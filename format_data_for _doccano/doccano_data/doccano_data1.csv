As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



From _New York Times_ , January 5, 1978 



Interesting quote at the end of the NYT article above:



The observations come at a time when a warming trend could have been expected from the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to the extensive fuel burning. […] the cause of the apparent cooling remained unknown and that **no scientific attempt to predict whether the the trend could continue was possible.**



What actually happened was that it got slightly warmer after 1978, the cooling trend did not continue as predicted.



Current score: Experts 0 – Reality 12.

" RESPONDING TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENCE – ALBERTA’S CARBON TAXRED INK + SORROWEnvironmental Defence issued a report at the end of December 2018 entitled “Carbon Pricing in Alberta – A Review of its Successes and Impacts”.They paint a rosy picture, claiming:“The aim of the levy is to reduce carbon pollution which causes climate change, while minimising any negative impacts to the province’s economy or to lower-income Albertans.”Friends of Science Society has issued a rebuttal report entitled “Carbon Pricing Consequences for Alberta.”LINK: Carbon Pricing Consequences for Alberta Final feb 4 2019This report will demonstrate that Environmental Defence is misinformed and is misleading the public.We will evaluate the billions wasted on coal phase-out, the continued downward-slide in investment, the faulty premises underlying carbon taxes and climate change claims.However, no one can put a price on the human wreckage – the lives ruined, small business dreams on the rocks, farmers up against a financial wall, citizens sliding into heat-or-eat-poverty – all thanks to an imposed carbon tax burden and climate change plan driven by foreign-funded ENGOs, acting as proxies for green crony capitalists. Cover image licensed from Shutterstock.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"The city’s Education Department plans to close or merge nine schools next year that are part of its   turnaround initiative, among a group of 22 schools to be closed or merged, according to a document obtained by The New York Times. Mayor Bill de Blasio came into office saying that unlike his predecessor Michael R. Bloomberg, he would support struggling schools rather than close them, and he initiated the Renewal program in 2014 to offer extra money and services for 94 of the city’s   schools. “We reject the notion of giving up on any of our schools,” Mr. de Blasio said at the time. Instead, he said, the city would infuse the schools in the program with resources, including coaches to help teachers improve their practices, new staff members to tackle problems like attendance, and social services like dental clinics or counseling. He said his administration might still end up closing schools, but he suggested that most schools would be given three years to improve. The program is now halfway through its third year. The department assigned each school a set of benchmarks in areas like attendance, graduation rate and, for elementary and middle schools, performance on state reading and math exams. But the schools have shown uneven progress. Eight schools in the program met all of their targets last year, while four schools met none, and 17 others met only one or two out of six or seven targets. Many schools in the program have also seen their enrollment decline as families shun schools labeled failing. The city previously decided to close or merge eight Renewal schools, so the latest round of closings will bring to 17 the number of schools in the program that will no longer be operating, at least as before. Six of the schools will be closed entirely: Junior High School 162 Lola Rodriguez de Tio, which had been singled out by the state as persistently failing, and whose closing was previously announced Leadership Institute, a high school Junior High School 145 Arturo Toscanini and Monroe Academy for Visual Arts and Design, all in the Bronx and Middle School 584 and the Essence School, also a middle school, in Brooklyn. The schools to be closed are all   to be sure. In the   school year, only 8 percent of the students at J. H. S. 145 passed the state reading tests, and only 3 percent passed the state’s math tests. Even so, it is not clear that they are necessarily the worst among the schools in the program. All of the six schools met at least one of the goals assigned by the city last year. Some are being closed for low enrollment as well.  The three schools in the program to be merged are the Young Scholars Academy of the Bronx, a middle school Frederick Douglass Academy IV, a high school in Brooklyn and Automotive High School in Brooklyn. All three schools already share their buildings with the schools they are being merged into, which are not in the Renewal program. The city is also proposing to merge five other pairs of schools, none of which are in the Renewal program, but many of which have struggled with academic achievement and enrollment. The Education Department declined to comment on the decision to close or merge the schools. The Bloomberg administration closed many large schools to start new, small ones. Studies have found that many small schools had positive effects on graduation rates and college enrollment. But not all the small schools were successful. The current city schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, has shown a preference for large schools and has said that some schools were too small to be sustainable. All of the closings and mergers will have to be approved by the Panel for Educational Policy, a citywide body. Aaron Pallas, a professor of sociology and education at Columbia University’s Teachers College, said, “The fact that the city thinks that it needs to do this for six out of the roughly 80 or so left suggests that things are not going as well as they’d like. ” At the same time, he said, “If these mergers and closures result in new schools that have a new kind of energy, perhaps different staff, perhaps a different culture, that may be better than trying to continue turning around schools that have been struggling for a very long time. ”"

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\----------   
  
In a recent _Global Science Report_ , we posted some good news coming out of California’s Sierra Nevada, where climate change (from whatever cause), has been partially responsible for a greening of the organo state. Technically, the biomass in the montane forests has been on the increase over the past several decades.   
  
Turns out climate change is for the birds, too. Yes, little Eastern Bluebirds (which almost went extinct because of habitat damage)—raising their young in cute houses, awakening us with their melodious songs, providing free cat food, and selectively messing only on _my_ car. What’s not to like? And who wouldn’t like _more_ birds? And if you live in the Eastern United States, there is a climate-related increase in cat purring because global (actually, local/regional) warming is increasing the range of songbirds.   
  
A new study appearing in the journal _Global Change Biology_ , authored by Karine Princé and Benjamin Zuckerberg from the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, finds that:   




[A] shifting winter climate has provided an opportunity for smaller, southerly distributed species to colonize new regions and promote the formation of unique winter bird assemblages throughout eastern North America.



The operative word here is “colonize.” In other words, they are spreading out from their home range, not moving north in lockstep.   




Linking observations from the amateur bird surveys with temperature data from nearby locations, the authors track how the birds are responding to changing winter conditions. During the period 1990–2011, Princé and Zuckerberg find that the average environmental temperature characteristic of the observed bird assemblages indicate a “northward shift in the community composition of wintering birds” of about 93 miles during the period 1990-2011. Most of that shift is the result of warm-weather adapted species with short migratory paths, such as the Chipping Sparrow and the Carolina Wren, which are both expanding their ranges northward as well as increasing their populations within already established ranges. The authors tell us:   




We found that the stronger positive … trends in southerly latitudes were driven by warm adapted birds increasing in their local abundance and regional occurrence... Despite diminished trends … in the more northerly latitudes, these trends were also driven by southerly species expanding their range (e.g., Carolina Wren and Eastern Bluebird) as opposed to cold adapted birds becoming locally extirpated and shifting northward.



This is pretty good news. Biodiversity—which everyone seems to like—is on the rise.   
  
The authors sagely point out that “[c]limate change should not be viewed as the sole driver of changes in winter bird communities in eastern North America,” and note that changing landscapes, changing backyard bird feeding habits, changes in the observing network, etc., may play some role in the results. They also note that the changing community structure of the bird species may act to alter the “biotic interactions” within the winter bird communities, implying that there may ultimately be winner and losers. (A “W” goes to the cats.)   
  
The data show that bird species are pretty much doing what rational climate optimists (h/t to Matt Ridley) expected all along, that is, adapting to changing climate conditions—and not only adapting, but thriving. And cats are purring with approval.

" William Walter Kay BA LL B © 2019Painting a word-portrait of the Venezuelan War lobby elicits empathy with Heracles. This war party resembles the three-hound of Hades, Cerberus, the capture of which comprised Heracles’s twelfth and final labor.The hellish hound’s most horrifying head is Trump’s foreign affairs camarilla. Deep state mavens John Bolton and Elliot Abrams habitually monger unilateral pre-emptive aggression. Cerberus’s much discussed, but toothless, second head is a US oil industry craving Venezuelan oil. The beast’s never discussed, but decisive, third head consists of a Democratic Party/EU coalition wedded to the petroleum phase-out initiative (a.k.a. Climate Change). They too covet Venezuelan oilfields; however, they do not want to develop them. They want to keep that oil below the soil.ContentsKeep it in the GroundThe Steam Injection Oil Extraction RevolutionSteaming the OrinocoWhy the Orinoco remains undevelopedThe EU’s petroleum phase-out passes the point of no returnA Democrat-EU alliance mongers the Venezuela WarConquering Venezuela isn’t feasible; creating a ‘Somalia on the Caribbean’ is.Keep it in the GroundThe Climate Change campaign is a smoke-screen for a fossil fuel phase-out initiative that arose in response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo. This perturbance prompted Western governments to commit to replacing petroleum as an energy source. Original propagandists sang “Energy Crisis” and “Peak Oil” refrains. Adherents, fortified by consensus science, claimed oil reserves were exhausted hence fuel taxes had to be imposed and oil substitutes incentivised.By the early-1980s it became obvious oil reserves remained abundant as oil extraction technologies expanded the volume of recoverable oil. Peak Oil sat upon a dusty shelf of cracked pots. In the mid-1980s petroleum phase-out planners pivoted toward claiming CO2 emissions from oil burning catastrophically overheated the atmosphere.While not as successful as the coal phase-out, the petroleum phase-out manifests in: carbon taxes; fuel emissions standards; mandatory bio-fuel blending; and vehicle electrification subsidies.For their part, front-line petroleum phase-out activists protest and litigate against oil extraction and pipeline construction. Prime targets are modern extraction methods like fracking.Obstruction of oil extraction dates to 1970s efforts to thwart drilling in Alaska’s National Wildlife Refuge, and conterminous hindrances of oil leasing in the US West. The pretext was protecting wildlife. Circa 2005 anti-petroleum campaigns ramped up; concentrating on unconventional oil. Blockading the Dakota Access Pipeline to throttle the Bakken Field shale oil bonanza, is one example.Another example is the Alberta oilsands siege. Through de-marketing, blockades, litigation and lobbying, campaigners stopped three pipelines and delayed two. Campaigners lobbied into place anti-oilsands: carbon levies, conservation requirements, and production caps. While campaigners deploy multiple pretexts, “global warming” is their main line. The Keystone XL oilsands pipeline was temporarily stymied by Obama who deemed its carbon footprint too large.A 2016 Keep it in the Ground web-proclamation declares that carbon embedded in fossil fuel reserves exceeds the climate’s carrying capacity:“Therefore, we, as over 400 civil society organisations… call on world leaders to put an immediate halt to new fossil fuel development.”Signatories included Global Catholic Climate Movement, Lutheran World Federation, Food and Water Watch, Rainforest Action Network, Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth; and focussed anti-oil extraction NGOs like: 350.org, Greenpeace, Oil Change International, and Fossil Free Europe.350.org was founded in 2007 by career climate alarmist Bill McKibben. (350 ppm is the atmospheric concentration of CO2 deemed safe by alarmist supremo James Hansen.) 350.org’s debut mobilization, the anti-Keystone XL campaign, drew support from National Resource Defense Council and Sierra Club. 350.org later obstructed the Energy East and Trans Mountain oilsands pipelines.350.org has 300 partner groups, 200 chapters, and 100 staff missioned to “stop all new coal, oil and gas projects.” On October 24, 2009, 350.org orchestrated 5,000 simultaneous demonstrations. Half 350.org’s $15 million annual budget comes from foundations.350.org’s Do the Math video claims humanities “carbon budget” (565 GT) is dwarfed by the carbon in fossil fuels reserves (2795 GT). Our only option is: “keep it in the ground.”In 2015 Nature magazine did the math; concluding that the 2 Celsius goal requires limiting mid-century CO2 emissions to 1,100 GT. As fossil fuel reserves possess thrice this:“…development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 C.”The New York Times, International Energy Agency and Obama endorsed Nature’s math.Greenpeace International’s mantra is “keep oil in the ground.” Greenpeace USA’s Keep it in the Ground webpage sermonises:“To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to keep the world’s remaining fossil fuels in the ground.”Fossil Free Europe consists of several dozen European student activist clubs. Their social media flutters with tales of student climate strikes. They oppose oil extraction.Oil Change International (OCI, est. 2005) boasts 200,000 supporters and 16 staff. Tides, Rockefeller Brothers and Hewlett provide funding. Sierra Club Executive Director, Michael Brune graces OCI’s board. OCI disseminates anti-oil propaganda while coordinating pipeline resistance. They express particular animosity toward “extreme fossil fuels” i.e. Venezuelan heavy oil.Innumerable lesser outfits round-out the field. Nigeria-based Oil Watch links to 50 anti-extraction groups from the Global South. Their motto is “keep oil in the soil.” Oil is the “devil’s excrement.”Leave it in the Ground Organization (LINGO) was launched at COP17 (2011, Durban). LINGO is a hub for scores of “extraction resistance initiatives” many of which engage in direct action.Better-heeled, but none-the-less committed to arresting oil extraction, are the financial specialists and tweedy profs drawn to Fossil Fuel Climate Conferences (FFCC); the second of which enlivened Oxford in 2018. KR Foundation, Stockholm Environment Institute, and International Institute on Sustainable Development are FFCC partners. Their goal is re-focussing climate policy onto restricting fossil fuel supply.Hostility to oil extraction is a prime impulse behind the divestment crusade. 1,029 institutional investors (churches, pensions, philanthropies and universities) worth $8.1 trillion, have committed to divesting from oil, coal and/or gas. Most are divesting from all three industries while dozens are divesting only from “tar sands” – betraying specific animosity to heavy oil.350.org boasts ongoing divestment agitations inside 308 universities and 105 city and state governments across the USA.In 2015 Guardian editor-in-chief, Alan Rusberger, launched a divestment agitation aimed at Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust. This Keep it in the Ground online community’s 210,000 members organise petitions, public appeals and tweet-storms. Their message to Bill Gates is:“Climate change poses a real threat to all of us, and it is morally and financially misguided to invest in companies dedicated to finding and burning oil, gas and coal.Guardian virtuoso George Monbiot kicked-off this initiative with an article bemoaning how climate campaigners address the problem from the wrong end. Restraining fuel consumption must yield to suppressing fuel extraction. Lowering demand without curbing supply merely lowers prices to the benefit of carbon intensive activity.The Steam Injection Oil Extraction RevolutionWhile much is heard of fracking; steam injection is the petroleum industry game-changer. Steam aids in harvesting of oils too viscous to be worked by conventional pumps.Initially, heavy oil was extracted via open-pit mining with giant shovels heaving mounds of oil-saturated sand onto dump-trucks for transit to separating vats of hot water. This has largely given way to steam injection. Alberta’s oilsands oil is now 80% extracted via steam injection.The simplest steam injection process uses a single well. A hole is drilled down to a heavy oil deposit; then steam is pumped down the hole, sometimes for months. Eventually oil concentrates near the well’s bottom of sufficient viscosity to enable pumping to the surface.SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) emerged 1978. Here, two lengthy perforated pipes are drilled horizontally through the deposit; one a few metres above the other. Both pipes emit steam until a teardrop shaped oil bubble envelopes the lower pipe. Then the top pipe continues to emit steam while the lower pipe draws oil to the surface. In 2017 Alberta’s oilsands yielded 2.7 million barrels a day; mostly via SAGD.Three innovations are coming.Solvent-Assisted SAGD adds chemicals to the steam injection process to further loosen-up the oil.Downhole Steam Generation lowers cylindrical furnaces down the well to improve heat conservation and fuel economy.Toshiba offers a miniature nuclear reactor specifically for heavy oil extraction. This 5 MW electricity generator simultaneously serves as the furnace for a 900 Celsius boiler. Reactors will render obsolete the expensive natural gas systems now used in steam injection.Steaming the OrinocoThe world’s fourth largest river, the Orinoco, rises in the Parima Mountains along the Venezuelan-Brazilian border then engraves a 2,000 kilometre north-easterly arc through Colombia before discharging into the Atlantic off Venezuela’s coast. The Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt stretches 600 kilometres along the north bank of the Orinoco’s easterly dash to the sea. The Belt is 70 kilometers wide.US Geological Service’s Estimate of Recoverable Oil Reserves of the Orinoco Oil Belt (2009) estimates “oil-in-place” to be up to 1.4 trillion barrels. Maximum “technically recoverable” oil is estimated at 652 billion barrels. Elsewhere the report speculates that fully exploiting SAGD might extract 70% of oil-in-place. The report relies on dated studies hence does not contemplate: Solvent-Assisted SAGD; Downhole Steam Generation; let alone nuclear power. Tackling Orinoco with these technologies should yield a trillion barrels.The report does not explore production costs. Canadian oilsands companies kept producing in 2018 after transportation bottlenecks tanked prices to $20 barrel. The business press guesstimates the breakeven price for Alberta oilsands to be around $30 a barrel.The Orinoco Belt has advantages over Alberta’s oilsands: a) its oil is lighter; b) its climate is hotter; and c) its closer to a coast. The Orinoco Belt sits at 9 degrees latitude. Its entire span is a few hundred kilometres from Atlantic shores. Orinoco production costs will be lower than Alberta’s oilsands.Global oil consumption is 35 billion barrels a year. The Orinoco alone could satisfy 100% of global demand for 30 years!Known global heavy oil reserves exceed 8 trillion barrels. The Orinoco will be another heavy oil recovery laboratory. As with Alberta, breakthroughs in the Orinoco will travel the world.Why the Orinoco remains undevelopedThe Orinoco remains undeveloped because Venezuela, the quintessential OPEC nation, possesses sufficient conventional (non-Orinoco) oil to meet its OPEC quota.OPEC (est. 1960) is Venezuela’s baby. Venezuela was one of five founding members. Venezuelans drafted OPEC’s charter. Venezuela drifted from the cartel in the 1980s but OPEC hawk President Chavez (r. 1999-2013) slashed production and adhered to quota. Between 2004 and 2015 production flat-lined at 2.4 million barrels a day (mbd) while Chavez circled Earth imploring OPEC comrades to maintain solidarity.Orinoco drilling began in the late-1990s. Circa 2010 Venezuelans contradicted their OPEC stance by luring investors with talk of raising Orinoco output to 4 mbd. Two dozen companies cumulatively pledged $200 billion. China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) committed $16 billion to three Orinoco ventures. Sinopec inked a $14 billion contract. A Russian consortium made huge commitments. Chevron, Matsui, Eni, Equinor, Petronas plus firms from Brazil, Argentina and South Africa signed Orinoco deals; …almost entirely for naught.Venezuelan’s state-owned oil monopoly (a partner in all ventures) systematically missed production targets. Pipelines and upgraders, needed to precede drilling, went unbuilt. Venezuela rarely provided its share of investment. Many firms pulled out complaining of: delays; inscrutable decision-making; and arbitrary ownership changes.Venezuela’s Plan A was: preserve OPEC. If OPEC failed Plan B sought to maintain revenues from the Orinoco. For Plan B to work shovel-ready projects had to be in place. Companies had to be strung along pending resolution of Plan A; even at risk of souring relations.Despite the current crisis (caused by low prices and economic warfare) the Orinoco is developing. CNPC’s Orinoco operation produces 130,000 b/d. A Chevron-led operation pumps 150,000 b/d of Orinoco crude. When this crisis passes an Orinoco volcano erupts.The EU’s petroleum phase-out passes the point of no return“Climate Change” means “European energy independence.” Europe imports $500 billion in fossil fuels annually.Electric vehicles (EVs, fully electric and hybrid) are Europe’s salvation. EVs are a pillar of the Climate Industrial Complex. The global EV industry earns $100 billion annually. This white elephant becomes farcically un-economical in the face of the coming tsunami of cheap oil.To aid the EV industry European governments are phasing out gasoline and diesel power vehicles. Germany will begin banning internal combustion engines in 2030. Scotland will ban new gasoline and diesel vehicle sales starting 2032. French and British bans begin in 2040. Austria, Denmark, Portugal and Spain have similar plans.An estimated 50 million EVs will cruise the world’s roads by 2030; many of those in Europe. Half of Norway’s new car sales are EVs. Volvo’s 2019 line-up is all EV. BMW is following suit.EVs are impractical without elaborate re-charging networks. Across Europe tens of thousands of charging points are constructed annually at enormous public expense. This transformative infrastructure mega-project requires separate grids and massive increases in electricity supply. The decision to go down the EV path will not be easily reversed.To accentuate his petroleum phase-out resolve Macron decreed an end to oil extraction across France and French overseas territories. This symbolic decree (France imports 99% of its oil) treats oil extraction like a scourge. Macron anticipates such declarations spreading EU-wide.A Democrat-EU alliance mongers the Venezuela WarIn 2014 a Democrat-led Senate passed the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act. This legislation, sponsored by Robert Menendez (Democrat-NJ), sanctioned Venezuela government officials and supported Venezuelan oppositionists. The Act sought to meet “the information needs of the Venezuelan people” through publications and broadcasts and through the “distribution of circumvention technology.” Obama signed immediately.In 2015 Obama declared: “a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States presented by the situation in Venezuela.”Days before Trump’s inauguration Obama renewed this declaration.At this time the US deep state played conductor to an orchestra of American and European agencies and foundations then disbursing $50 million yearly to Venezuelan politicians, activists and journalists. Key agencies were: USAID, National Endowment for Democracy, and (Democratic Party-affiliated) National Democratic Institute. Key foundations were: (Jimmy) Carter Centre, Soros’s Open Society and several government-linked German and Spanish concerns.The Democrat’s war drive survived Obama’s departure.On January 4, 2019 a Democrat-led House of Representatives swore in. On January 10 House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair, Eliot Engel (D-NY) said he would waste no time holding “Mr. Maduro” accountable. Simultaneously, former DNC Chair and Hillary Clinton “fixer”, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL) unveiled her Venezuelan-Russian Threat Mitigation Act. Debbie was flanked by former Clinton cabinet member and Clinton Foundation President, Donna Shalala (D-FL) who announced her Venezuelan Arms Restriction Act to prevent weapons sales, including non-lethal police gear, to Venezuela. Next up was Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL), sponsor of the Venezuelan Humanitarian Assistance Act aimed at allowing US operatives to bypass Venezuelan authorities and distribute “aid” directly to Venezuelans.EU powers ratcheted up sanctions against Venezuela in 2017. They pooh-poohed Venezuela’s 2018 elections and warned Maduro against inauguration. They unanimously boycotted his inauguration and quickly endorsed his auto-proclaimed rival Juan Guaido. As with Liberal Party-led Canada, EU countries were not being dragged into this by Trump. They moved swiftly and autonomously; sometimes ahead of Trump’s administration.Conquering Venezuela isn’t feasible; creating a ‘Somalia on the Caribbean’ is.Venezuela’s ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) regularly garners several million votes in national elections. A million PSUVers participate in candidate selection and platform drafting. PSUV’s 50,000 neighborhood councils hold meetings, elect representatives and lobby governments. PSUV auxiliaries, the “collectivos,” boasts thousands of paramilitaries. Relatively, PSUV is a larger more consolidated socio-political bloc than either the US Republicans or UK Conservatives.The PSUV’s Great Housing Mission constructed 2.5 million apartments therewith endowing a quarter of Venezuelans with dignified, affordable housing. Rural land reform and related programs earned PSUV support from small farmers and agricultural labourers.Venezuela’s armed forces have 350,000 personnel including 150,000 ground troops; but they are not who American war planners fear.To deter coups and invasions, PSUV launched the Milicia Nacional Bolivariana (MNB) in 2009. 400,000 civilians routinely engage in MNB training. President Maduro recently announced plans to increase MNB to 1.6 million; “armed to the teeth.”Anticipating US invasion Bolivarian doctrine emphasises asymmetrical warfare centered on heavy infantry. MNB will bring to battle thousands of mortars and recoilless rifles – each towable behind cars. Maduro loyalists possess a myriad of infantry portable anti-armour weapons; and 5,000 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles of a design that downed a score of US helicopters in Iraq. These weapons compliment 300,000 assault rifles; mostly AK103s. (Venezuela’s AK103 factory should be operational soon.) Venezuelan arsenals contain 45,000 sniper rifles.If bombed out of the cities the Bolivarians will retreat into a galaxy of rural cooperatives populated by compatriots skilled in that crucial guerrilla warfare technique: farming.US forces may make short work of Venezuela’s air force, navy and armour; but they will not quickly vanquish its infantry. They may make inroads on the ground but the likelihood of them creating conditions needed for exploiting the Orinoco seems remote.Conversely, through naval blockades, and close air support of mercenary brigades, Western powers may do unto Venezuela what they did to Syria, Afghanistan and Libya i.e. demolish vital infrastructure leaving a no-man’s land in their wake. A ‘Somalia on the Caribbean’ jibes with the petroleum phase-out agenda. Orinoco’s treasure will stay buried.ConclusionTwo tethered masses move in opposing directions. At one end several of the world’s most powerful political parties seek to banish petroleum with EVs, biofuels and electric rail. At the other end a petroleum extraction industry hones fracking, steam injection and off-shore drilling technology to conjure a cornucopia of cheap oil. While Venezuelans and their allies rejoice in the Orinoco’s bounty; petroleum phase-out policymakers, and their climate alarmist cheerleaders, gaze with dread upon maps of the Orinoco muttering: “keep it in the ground.”Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Review: Alex Epstein, The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, Penguin Publishing, November 2014; 248 pages; ISBN-10: 1591847443, ISBN-13: 978-1591847441, $20.89 on Amazon.
In his new book, The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, Alex Epstein makes one of the most compelling arguments for the moral value of fossil fuels and the need to increase their use I have ever read.
Epstein is an ethical humanist; for him, the well-being of human life is the standard of value public policy should maximize. This ethical theory goes back to the ancient Greeks and went virtually unchallenged as a basis for judging right and wrong throughout human history, at least until recently.
Unfortunately, many prominent environmental writers have rejected humanism, instead embracing a biocentric philosophy that views human changes to the environment as morally wrong and unnatural. For those biocentrists, minimizing human impacts on the environment is the primary moral goal. As such, biocentrism is a prescription for human poverty, disease, starvation, and premature death – in other words, an endorsement of the world as experienced by all but the wealthiest individuals for the vast majority of human history.

Epstein points out the development and use of fossil fuels have benefitted the poor far more than the rich, making available to the person of average means, food, goods, and services which even the rulers of old could hardly dream of.
Chapter by chapter, through clear and concise analysis, Epstein demonstrates why fossil fuels are the greatest energy technology of all time; why renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are in no position to replace them; why concerns about global warming are overstated and largely misplaced; how fossil fuel use actually improves environmental quality; and why, with more than 1.3 billion people in the world today without access to electricity and the labor and life-saving bounty it makes available, it would be immoral to artificially restrict growth in the use of fossil fuels to prevent climate change.
Assuming human welfare is one’s primary moral standard, a number of important takeaways from this book arise. I’ll list three:

One should look at the big picture when determining the value of using fossil fuels – not just the costs or potential harms to humans. If one has an open mind, it is apparent fossil fuels provide important benefits to humankind, unmatched by any other fuel source at current prices with current technology. The benefits of fossil fuels far outweigh the harmful by-products resulting from their use, even if one believes they contribute to global warming.


“Climate is no longer a major cause of deaths, thanks in large part to fossil fuels. … Not only are we ignoring the big picture by making the fight against climate danger the fixation of our culture, we are ‘fighting’ climate change by opposing the weapon that has made it dozens of times less dangerous. The popular climate discussion has the issue backwards. It looks at man as a destructive force for climate livability, one who makes the climate dangerous because we use fossil fuels. In fact, the truth is the exact opposite; we don’t take a safe climate and make it dangerous; we take a dangerous climate and make it safe. High-energy civilization, not climate, is the driver of climate livability.”


Even if human-caused CO2 emissions do pose a significant threat of dangerous climate change, the way to deal with climate danger is to develop technologies that allow humans to adapt to, mitigate, or prevent climate harms.

Restricting or ending fossil fuel use is a recipe for disaster. It would set human civilization back centuries – a true death knell for present and future generations. The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels makes this point as well or better than any other book I recall reading. The book is easily readable by anyone who has passed high school freshman English, and I encourage all those interested in learning about the threats of global warming and the relative benefits and harms of fossil fuel use to read it with an open mind. It will give you much to think about.

 **New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union**



 **‘Climate emergency’ trend sweeping the nation**



Are you feeling alarmed? According to virtue-signalling local politicians, you should be, because councils across the country are rushing to declare ‘climate emergencies’. Following intense media attention on last week’s ‘climate change strike’, nearly every council in the country looks set to debate whether to make “emergency” declarations.



 **Nelson: Porky the Waste-hater comes to town**



Since you last heard from us, Taxpayers’ Union friendly mascot Porky the Waste-hater and I travelled to Nelson to present our petition against Mayor Rachel Reese’s proposed climate emergency.



We made a short video of the meeting. We argued councils should stick to their knitting (roads, rubbish, rates) instead of throwing money and attention at fashionable global issues.



[You can also share the video on Facebook here.](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=27Ax0UmWOX2J8J_QwK9Z6islnFnJ22rFC_MQBiwQGEMHv63IYQBSY-YqGBnG69ZDxd_rIb6YlIsbrEzkq7M0Cg&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=190528_tu_nwsltr&n=5)



Despite the opposition of ratepayers in the public gallery behind us, the councillors approved the declaration, complete with a $100,000 funding commitment.



To underline the move’s hypocrisy, the Mayor refused to sign our pledge against ratepayer-funded (and emissions-spewing) international travel. So much for an ’emergency’.



 **Canterbury: Regional council’s hypocrisy on emissions**



Environment Canterbury (aka Ecan) actually pipped Mayor Reese at the post, declaring the country’s first climate emergency just a few hours earlier.



So, does Ecan walk the walk? Jordan asked our interns to check some of the data we’ve been collecting on travel expenses at regional councils.



[It turns out that](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/ecan_travel?utm_campaign=190528_tu_nwsltr&utm_medium=email&utm_source=taxpayers), aside from Auckland, Ecan spends more than any other regional council on flights. In the last financial year, Ecan spent $262,000 on over 1,400 flights, with destinations including Vancouver, San Francisco, and Copenhagen (that last trip was, in fact, the same climate junket Nelson’s Mayor enjoyed last year).



[The Press has reported on our figures here.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/112860157/environment-canterbury-rejects-taxpayers-union-hypocrisy-claim-over-flight-bill)



 **Green Party tries (and fails) to get in on the action**  
  
The Green Party yesterday asked Parliament to declare a national climate emergency. Thankfully, National’s Todd Muller vetoed the motion. However, we won’t be surprised if the idea becomes a bill, meaning it will be subject to a vote from all MPs. 



Successive New Zealand Governments have already dedicated an inordinate amount of taxpayer funding and red tape to the climate change issue. We say that declaring an ’emergency’ on top of this is pure virtue-signalling.



 **Your council is likely to follow**



Not to let Ecan steal the limelight, Christchurch City Council has also [rushed out a declaration.](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=5xNnogsdD9yGIfGEM2rlXfGI2AO2e0MawNa4w-8qpiz-qNVSSxspuFTSVWRqPYjoRhm8eIi-nuNGQTFia9yp2EMgkyqfFGAbzPMbLmfXWF2tuJnwH9QZPoQlazJJOfOYYTSqSzknflS8erziEp23MGn4uKrXTez9xN2jwuJEXbaiXGGyOJLneY5AjswFr2Gq&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=190528_tu_nwsltr&n=10) Meanwhile, Auckland Council has scheduled a vote for next month, and Kapiti Coast, Wellington City, and Greater Wellington have all indicated they’ll be voting on declarations soon.



These movements tend to gather momentum, as local politicians across the country will want their names connected to the fuzzy headlines. In short, your council could be next.



This week we are writing to all local councillors asking them to vote down any proposed ‘climate emergency’, and focus on value for ratepayers through core services.



 **Learning from the world’s most effective taxpayer advocate**  
  
This week we hosted Grover Norquist, the founder of American for Tax Reform. (That’s him with some of our team in the photo above).



Grover started his career in the Reagan administration, but is now known as America’s most influential campaigner for lower tax. His group’s “Taxpayer Pledge” is now signed by 90 percent of Republicans, meaning it is basically impossible for the party to raise taxes.



(Grover featured in an interview with Q&A, which [you can watch here.](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=5YJMdUwSRqRR5OtSoDZ3PUpYq6XzyNGp7wOWE4TwljWlka7jtRy4bTkJLOGU7WOcVN5HKv6F3DDUpWzlYBBB-o6w9AZJqNc-lWMMZWBeo7v6qYljzAzbyxgy03HurVxqgRmcqPZuWyQKqCt5Z7bGZ7S6Ly7HJil2kB4Z1WALiZA&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=190528_tu_nwsltr&n=13))



We’re looking at how we can translate the “Taxpayer Pledge” to New Zealand – perhaps starting with this year’s local elections. Watch this space.



 **Tomorrow’s budget**  




Leaks aside, Budget 2019 is being unveiled tomorrow. Our economic team will be in the Beehive for the media and analysts’ lock-up so we can send you our analysis shortly after 2 pm.



Here’s hoping someone thinks of taxpayers’ wellbeing in Labour’s “wellbeing” budget.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother study finds CO2’s greenhouse effect contribution and climate sensitivity are much smaller than claimed by the IPCC and proponents of anthropogenic global warming.
Ollila (2019) reconfigures the “consensus”-derived greenhouse effect radiation values and finds (a) LW absorption only adds 45% to Earth’s present atmospheric greenhouse effect, (b) water vapor dominates (76.4%) the total greenhouse effect whereas CO2’s contribution is minimal (7.3%), and (c) CO2 climate sensitivity is just 0.6°C upon doubling.

Image Source: Ollila (2019)
The reconfiguration eliminates the “physical contradiction” of having a 155.6 W/m² create an energy flux of 345.6 W/m² by rejecting the claim that the entire longwave energy flux is from greenhouse gases.
Further, CO2’s total temperature contribution to the greenhouse effect is reduced from 7.2°C to 2.4°C, which better aligns with the climate sensitivity (doubled CO2) estimate of 0.6°C.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman t-online.de news portal here reports how yesterday large areas of central and southern Germany saw the power fail yesterday due to “snow and storms.”

 
Power outages, Germany, February 27, 2020. (Source: stromausfall.org)


In some locations the power was out for hours, t-online.de reports.
Of course snow itself has little to do with the power going out. Rather the power outages are signs of an increasingly unstable power grid due in large part to the wildly fluctuating feed-in of volatile wind and solar energy.

Yesterday late evening’s storm and its winds led to wild fluctuation in the European power grid at around 8 p.m. The grid frequency critically dropped well below the 50 Hz value, which meant more power was being consumed than generated.

Austrian power grid expert Herbert Saurugg tweeted:


Und schon wieder ein Rekordausschlag bei der Frequenz um 20 Uhr: 49,856 Hz. Damit wurden 2/3 der Reserve eingesetzt 😤. Bei 49,80 Hz treten die erste Lastabwürfe ein. pic.twitter.com/YkRWonjmMA

In English: “And again a record low peak frequency at 8 p.m.: 49.856 Hz. That’s two-thirds of the reserve power used. At 49.80 Hz the first load drops occur.”
That means had the frequency dropped just a bit more, possible emergency grid switchoffs would have been needed, and so a widespread blackout was narrowly avoided.
The blackouts that did occur led to “many disruptions” to rail and auto transportation, t-online writes.
As of the time of writing this article 12:55 CET, hours-long power outages continued to hamper much of southern Germany:

A boredom epidemic is sweeping through Britain’s dog population – **and global warming could be to blame.** Across the country, there are reports of down-in-the-mouth mutts, and under-the-weather canines. Quote.



Leading pet behaviourists told The Independent that the number of depressed and unsettled dogs they have seen in recent months **is unprecedented.**



And they suggested that the spate of wet winters could be at the root of the problem, as owners cut down on the daily walks that are crucial to keeping dogs’ spirits up.



“I’ve been working with dogs for more than 20 years and **I can’t remember a time when they’ve been this bored.** I tend to see boredom in bursts but I’m seeing it chronically this winter,” said Carolyn Menteith, a dog behaviourist who was named Britain’s Instructor of the Year in 2015.



“They are just really, really, bored. People are quite happy to get their dogs out in frosty, hard weather but not when it’s muddy and horrible.”



“But we have over 200 breeds of dog in this country and an awful lot of them – especially family dogs like Labradors, retrievers and spaniels – were bred to do a job. So they are hardwired to work and need a lot of exercise.”



The lack of physical exercise – and mental stimulation that comes with it – is having noticeable consequences on the nation’s nine million dogs, she added.



Ms Menteith spends much of her time outside walking dogs and has noticed a significant change in the weather in the past five years or so – as cold, crisp winters gradually give way to “constant wet dreariness”.



She – like many scientists and meteorologists – **puts this down to climate change** and expects to see more bored dogs in the future as global warming unleashes increasingly frequent and intense bouts of winter rainfall.



December 2015 was the wettest month on record in the UK. Climate scientists predict that we can expect more and more mud-creating “extreme winter rainfall” in the coming decades as global warming changes weather patterns.



Sarah Fisher, an animal behaviour counsellor with around two decades experience, has also noticed a level of canine unrest that is unprecedented in her career. Ms Fisher works with horses as well as dogs and has noticed that the boredom is not confined to household pets.



“I’ve never seen our dogs or horses this bored before in 20 years. Horses that have lived happily outside before are saying ‘I actually can’t cope with this mud and wet anymore’,” she said.



“We’re turning them out of their stables and they’re saying ‘Get me back in straight away’.



“They can’t settle, they look bored, but actually it’s to do with physical stress and mental boredom, they can’t go off quietly and graze because they keep sliding around the field,” Ms Fisher added. […] End quote



  
Climate change can be a real bitch, when it gets you down like this. Clearly global warming is not at fault as there has been a paws in the temperature rise. The way that they keep hounding the population about climate change is a bit sniffy, really. Still, must stop muttering about it and go bark at a passing climate scientist or howl at the moon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Energiewende (transition to green energies) is driving up prices
by Holger Douglas
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
For a long time, electricity prices have known only one direction: upwards! Ever faster, ever more clearly. Now the shock for many families: The Federal Government has presented official figures in an answer to an inquiry from the FDP Free Democrats parliamentary group in the Bundestag and announced the true extent of the electricity price increase.
320 euros extra annually per household
In the past ten years, the price of electricity for households and industry has risen by a third. According to the Augsburger Allgemeine, which quotes from the paper, the price of electricity rose by 35 percent between 2009 and 2019. For a typical household with 4,000 kWh per year, this means 320 euros in additional costs for electricity alone.
This is even more than the various comparison websites had previously calculated.
8% hike
BILD expresses how drastic it is: “The electricity price wave is sweeping over Germany! Now the energy giants Innogy, RheinEnergy and Vattenfall are also raising prices by eight percent”. Millions of households are affected.
Thus the electricity price is nowhere else as high as in Germany. One kilowatt hour of electricity now costs on average 30.03 euro cents. The experts at the Verivox comparison portal expect that prices will continue to rise this year, for a simple reason: Germany is paying for the transition to green energies.
With the so-called EEG feed-in levy, every electricity consumer pays for the feed-in of the unreliable and extremely expensive “renewable energies” and thus also for the destruction of the previously reliable and inexpensive power supply.
No way around subsidies

No sensible person would install wind turbines on a large scale in Germany. The yield of electricity is simply too low and too unreliable. If, yes, if it would not have to be propped up by money.
Money for nothing
According to the German government, wind turbine operators alone received a total of 635 million euros in compensation in 2018 because they were unable to feed their electricity into the grid because of the times it was not needed.
This “compensation” will be even more drastic in 2019, because in the first quarter alone there were strong winds; the wind turbines delivered so much electricity – but at inopportune moments, and so it could not be used, not even given away to neighboring countries.
“Anti-social”
FDP politician Sandra Weeser explained: “We have an extremely anti-social redistribution here. The weakest citizens would be burdened with the electricity price just as much as the strongest.”
Ms Weeser also sees the attractiveness of Germany as a business location at risk: “With our high wage cost level, we cannot keep increasing the production costs of electricity if we want to keep industry in the country.
“Gigantic redistribution machine”
The so-called EEG feed-in program continues to prove to be a gigantic redistribution machine. This is once again calling the profiteers onto the scene – as can be seen from the results of the solar tender of the Federal Network Agency. Tendered were 500 MW of capacity for solar plants, bids were submitted for a total of 1,344 MW. That is a 2.7-fold more than needed. In mid-January, the agency awarded the contract to “121 bids for a solar capacity of 501 MW to be erected”.
Unsteady supply means inefficient use of backup plants
This means: even more photovoltaic systems for ridiculously low hours of use and even higher EEG fees. And even more CO2 emissions from those conventional power plants that have to supply electricity when the sun does not shine because Germany still does not want to go without electricity. The very frequent, inefficient start-up and shut-down processes of these large power plants on standby also cause additional CO2 emissions. This increases operating costs.

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.

"COVINGTON, La.  —   “Sour grapes,” explained Bob Marino, 79, weighing in on the recent spycraft bombshell from the corner table of a local McDonald’s. “Sour grapes,” agreed Roger Noel, 65, sitting next to him. “Bunch of crybabies,” Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released by United States intelligence chiefs on Friday informing   Donald J. Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Mr. Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed “trolls” on social media and used their “  propaganda machine” to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the  ’s legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia’s boldest effort yet to meddle with American elections, to spread discontent and to “undermine the U. S.  democratic order. ” But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the   won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. “From the parts of the report I’ve seen,” said Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as Tea Party favorite, “it seems silly. ” There are genuine concerns about Russia’s cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, “90 percent of them are like, ‘What’s the big deal? ’” The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in American elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries’ elections. Even if the Russians did do it  —   which some were more willing to concede than others  —   what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump’s election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, “just being sore losers. ” “I don’t think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves,” said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops at a frigid outdoor farmers’ market in Covington. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Mr. Emenes said. He added that, as long as Mr. Trump was not involved himself, “it doesn’t change the way I view him. ” Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, La. front yard after the previous night’s frost, had a similar attitude. “Trump is Trump,” she said. “Do I think he’s going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don’t. I think  —   I hope  —   his focus will be on making America great again. ” Ms. Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Mr. Trump’s slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. “I don’t believe it,” Mr. Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his “Make America Great Again” flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. “Why would Putin even want Trump?” Mr. Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Mr. Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Mr. Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Mr. Putin get away with things, Mr. Yates continued. Mr. Trump would be much tougher. But Mr. Yates then added: “Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I’m not against Putin. ” This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was “a basket case,” and not the powerful foe it once was, said Mr. Marino, from his seat at McDonald’s. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Ind. Ms. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as “somewhere in the middle” between friend and enemy, but agreed with Mr. Trump that the United States could work with them to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “We may have to line up with people who may not be our ‘friend’ to make that happen,” she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the Central Intelligence Agency. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. “The idea of a fair election” had been placed in doubt, Ms. Willis said. “We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you’re talking about espionage. ” The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Senator John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. “Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?” Mr. Willis said. “Yes, I’m very concerned about that. ” In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56,   Eagle 20 cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Mr. Gubert came to a different conclusion. “If that’s what it took,” he said, “I’m glad they did it. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere won’t as much blogging from my side this weekend because I’ll be participating in the so-called “Berlin Megamarsch” (Mega-Walk).
At the Berlin 100/24 Megamarsch, participants take on the challenge of walking 100 kilometers within 24 hours.
The fun starts Saturday, August 31, at 4 p.m. when some 1500 participants will begin following a marked route and will have to complete it before 4 p.m. the next day, Sunday. Here’s the route:

100/24 Megamarsch starts in Berlin Saturday at 4 p.m., goes overnight to Potsdam, before finishing on Sunday at Teltow.
Some five months ago a friend told me about it, and initially I thought the whole idea was insane. But another part of me became intrigued by the challenge and so on July 6th I completed the Düsseldorf 50k/12hr in 10.5 hours. As the 50k in Düsseldorf went pretty well, I decided to give the big Berlin 100/24 a shot.

Even though I’ve trained quite a bit, I still estimate my chances of success this weekend at less than 30%. What follows is my training list of walks done in order to prepare:
No. 23 was the Düsseldorf Megamarsch on July 6. 
Since Düsseldorf I’ve walked 65+ km three times, but made the big mistake of not stretching enough after the 67.7 km walk on July 22. The result: plantar fasciitis. During my 66-km walk on August 1st I wound up coming home with my feet in agony.
For the last 3 weeks since, I’ve been stretching and trying to massage all the kinks out, yet I can’t say how my feet will hold up in Berlin. I can only hope for a good day.
I was also in agony at the end of the 70k walk on August 14. My left foot is still not in a condition I’d like it to be.
According to Megamarsch organizers, only 20-25% succeed in accomplishing the distance in under 24 hours. Most throw in the towel at 60 km.
In any case, que sera, sera. I’ll be posting progress reports at Twitter Saturday night and Sunday for those who might be curious as to how I’m holding up. I also need all the fans and support I can get!

Please, if you are on medication, consult your doctor before making any changes to your regime. Whatever your concerns about your current medication, the effects of uncontrolled withdrawal could be worse.
Having said that, there is substantial evidence of a link between anti-depressants, suicide, violence and homicide.

By **Beth Houlbrooke**  
ACT _Deputy Leader / Vice President_



A Bill before parliament, the Kainga Ora Homes and Communities Bill, made its way to my desk this week for local board comment. A cursory glance tells me that the government needs to change the planning rules to make it easier for them to build state houses more quickly. I know there will be consternation from the planning-loving members of my board that this will be “riding roughshod” over the Unitary Plan. But the fact it has to be done is surely an admission that current planning rules are an impediment to increasing the housing stock. If this has to be done for state housing, then it needs to be done for the private sector.



The henny-pennies will tell us this, like National’s SHAs, is all bad because councils can’t provide for infrastructure quickly enough. They could, however, if they were given a share of the GST on development to fund it. That share could be paid monthly as the council submits its invoices, incentivising them to process consent applications quickly. As well, councils should be able to enter into partnership with developers to fund infrastructure and have property buyers pay it back over 20 or 30 years, getting sections released to market in a much shorter timeframe.



Labour has finally admitted that the way to ease the cost of building a house in Auckland is to increase the amount of land available for housing. Simple supply and demand economics in action, ignored by National and philosophically abhorrent to Labour – until now. 



Ministers Twyford and Parker, the minister responsible for the Resource Management Act, met with Mayor Goff to divine a way to extend Auckland’s Urban Boundary, opening up new land for residential development. **Oddly, the meeting was held without officials** from government departments. In fact, **Twyford publicly denied the meeting ever took place.** It wasn’t in the copy of his ministerial diary released as part of the Coalition’s open and transparent government edict. However, it wasn’t ‘missing’ from Parker’s diary. Now Twyford says his office is to blame for omitting the meeting from his diary. Jacinda says it was just a clerical error. The diary entry is immaterial because the meeting took place. The question must be: **why the secrecy?**



Opening up the Urban Boundary to relieve Auckland’s shortage of subdividable land has been ACT policy forever. Now Labour ministers are beginning to see the light. **Opening up Auckland’s land supply will have a far greater positive impact on housing shortage in New Zealand’s biggest city than the failed KiwiBuild scheme would ever have.** And it would set a precedent that local government throughout New Zealand could follow. We’ll just have to see if the secret meeting will produce the legislative goods required to put this vital – secret – policy into action. And why waste such a valuable opportunity? **The Coalition Government and Auckland Council should also address the** _ **cost**_ **they each add to the construction of a house.**



Meantime, the crisis builds in cities like Tauranga, where a shortage of land being released for development will mean a shortfall of thousands of houses within the next decade.



Tauranga has just 18 months of greenfield subdivision capacity left. However, the council’s timeframes for delivering suitable and significant new development in new growth areas such as Te Tumu, Tauriko West and ?mokoroa were at least another five years to go, the report stated.



 **DRINK UP**



Spotted this story on the news about the carbon footprint of milk production.



Emissions from cow’s milk here are half the global average. Land use is 1/9th, and water use beats the global average using less than both almond and soy milk.



New Zealand milk is some of the most sustainable in the world.



“Our farmers are continuing to invest in sustainable outcomes, they’ve spent a billion dollars of their own money to improve the environmental outcomes and sustainability.”



I think we can all continue to have a slosh of milk in our tea or coffee or on our breakfast cereal, guilt-free, for a while yet.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Back in the Bush II Administration, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) nakedly tried to nudge the political process surrounding the passage of the environmentally-horrific ethanol fuel mandate. It hung a large banner from the side of its Washington headquarters, picturing a corn stalk morphing into a gas pump, all surrounded by a beautiful, pristine, blue ocean. They got their way, and we got the bill, along with a net _increase_ in greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
So it’s not surprising that AAAS is on the Washington Insider side of global warming, releasing a report today that is the perfect 1-2-3 step-by-step how-to guide to climate change alarm.   
  
This is how it is laid out in the counterfactually-titled AAAS report  “What We Know”:   
  
Step 1: State that virtually all scientists agree that humans are changing the climate,   
  
Step 2: Highlight that climate change has the potential to bring low risk but high impact outcomes, and   
  
Step 3: Proclaim that by acting now, we can do something to avert potential catastrophe.   
  
To make this most effective, appeal to authority, or in this case, make the case that you are the authority. From the AAAS:   




We're the largest general scientific society in the world, and therefore we believe we have an obligation to inform the public and policymakers about what science is showing about any issue in modern life, and climate is a particularly pressing one,"" said Dr. Alan Leshner, CEO of AAAS. ""As the voice of the scientific community, we need to share what we know and bring policymakers to the table to discuss how to deal with the issue.



But despite promising to inform us as to “what the science is showing,” the AAAS report largely sidesteps the best and latest science that points to a much lowered risk of extreme climate change, choosing instead to inflate and then highlight what meager evidence exists for potential catastrophic outcomes—evidence that in many cases has been scientifically challenged (for example here and here).   




The AAAS takes us through the standard litany of scare-scenarios and tipping points. If you can imagine it, the AAAS mentions it. Rapid sea level rise? Check. Heat waves, floods, droughts? Check. Check. Check. Deteriorating public health? Check. National security threat? Check. Ecological collapse? Check. And the list goes on.   
  
The AAAS’s justification for such alarm?   




Below are some of the high-side projections and tail risks we incur by following the current path for CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Most of these projections derive from computer simulations of Earth and its climate system. These models apply the best understanding science has to offer about how our climate works and how it will change in the future. There are many such models and all of them have been validated, to varying degrees, by their ability to replicate past climate changes.



Somehow in its haste to scare us, the AAAS seems to have missed (or ignored) the two hottest topics in climate change these days—1) that climate models have done remarkably _poorly_ in replicating the evolution of global temperature during the past several decades , and 2) that high end climate change scenarios from the models are largely unsupported by observations.   
  
Thus, “what the science is showing” completely undermines the AAAS contentions regarding alarming climate change.   
  
So here’s what we are left with.   
  
As to the AAAS’s first point that human actions are causing climate change, this is largely correct, although the degree and details—the most important features—are uncertain and still being intensity studied and debated (a fact left out by the AAAS).   
  
As to the second point, the current best science suggests that coming human-caused climate change is going to be less than expected with a much-diminished risk of abrupt changes with catastrophic outcomes (a fact left out by the AAAS).   
  
Which means that the AAAS’s third point, that immediate action is required to reduce the risk of extreme change, is hardly applicable—especially when recognizing that no matter what action we take in the U.S. (the primary audience of the AAAS report) it will have such a small impact on the course of future climate change as to do nothing to alleviate the overblown worries of the AAAS (a fact left out by the AAAS).   
  
Add this all up and you realize that the AAAS report is the epitome of climate alarmism—long in hype and short in fact and aimed squarely at influencing policymakers. We should expect better, but they drank the ethanol years ago.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is here.In preparation for yet another United Nations “Climate Summit” to be held soon in New York, the representatives of various developing countries have been signaling their concerns and demands relating to what developed countries like Canada should do. In recent statements by China and India, the leaders have sent a simple message. “Pay up!” They are referring to the commitment that several OECD countries made in 2012 and then again at the 21st Conference of the Parties on Climate Change in Paris in 2015 (COP21) that they would contribute at least $100 billion per year by 2020 to help the developing countries pay for greenhouse gas reductions and for adaptation to climate change. So far, the Green Climate Fund has barely $20 billion ($2.3 billion from Canada, in one of Justin Trudeau’s first actions after being elected), and has actually allocated only a portion of that to projects. In separate statements on September 17, China and India reminded the developed countries of their commitment. China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. According to the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 2019, in 2018 China (including Hong Kong) emitted 9.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2e) , or over 28 per cent of the world total. China has made a number of commitments to “peak” its emissions by 2030, but by then its emissions will be somewhere between 14.4 billion and 16.6 billion tonnes of CO2e per year, two to two-and-a-half times those of the United States (source: Climate Action Tracker). China has the second largest economy in the world and one of the fastest growing ones. Yet, it qualifies to receive funds out of the Green Climate Fund, and it wants our money. India is now the fourth largest emitter in terms of CO2e, with 2.5 billion tonnes in 2018. India’s emissions are growing even faster that those of China in percentage terms, and by 2030 are projected to be 4.5 billion tonnes CO2e, according to Climate Action Tracker. The Indian Ministry of Finance just issued a report stating that India aims to be a U.S. $5 trillion economy by 2014 but that it demands that the developed countries pay more to cover the costs of its emissions reduction. The report quoted 2016 UN data saying that total “climate specific” finance flows from developed countries was US $38 billion, less than 40% of the US $100 billion per year Green Climate Fund target. The COP21 agreement  did not include any provisions as to the apportionment of payment responsibilities among the developed countries or the apportionment of payments to the developing countries. The declaration by the Trump Administration in the United States that it will withdraw from the COP21 Agreement in 2020 leaves another question as to whether the remaining developed countries are still willing to pay US $100 billion per year. If anyone from China or India arrives at my door asking for my contribution, I will just say that I gave at the office.

Chilling mission almost complete press release from the United Nations.
UN CLIMATE PRESS RELEASE / 29 NOV, 2019 COP25 to Be the Launchpad for Significantly more Climate AmbitionBonn/ Madrid, 29 November 2019 – As the global climate emergency intensifies and greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, governments will gather in Madrid for the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 (2 to 13 December 2019) to take the next crucial steps in the UN climate change process.The conference will take place under the Presidency of the Government of Chile and will be held with logistical support from the Government of Spain.Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change said: “This year, we have seen accelerating climate change impacts, including increased droughts, storms and heat waves, with dire consequences for poverty eradication, human health, migration and inequality.“The world’s small window of opportunity to address climate change is closing rapidly. We must urgently deploy all the tools of multilateral cooperation to make COP25 the launchpad for more climate ambition to put the world on a transformational path towards low carbon and resilience,” she said.A key objective of COP25 is to raise overall ambition also by completing several key aspects with respect to the full operationalization of the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Last year at COP24 in Poland, the bulk of the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement were agreed, with the exception of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.Article 6 is to provide guidelines for how international climate markets will work, as a key component of the world’s economic toolbox for addressing climate change.Other focus areas at COP25 will include adaptation, loss and damage, transparency, finance, capacity-building, Indigenous issues, oceans, forestry, gender and more.Notably, the provision of finance and technology is crucial for developing countries to green their economies and build resilience.“While we have seen some progress with respect to climate-related financing for developing countries, we will continue to urge developed nations to fulfil their pledge of mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020,” Ms. Espinosa said. “We also must see overall global finance flows reflect the deep transformation throughout society that we need: away from carbon-heavy investment and towards more sustainable and resilient growth. Drops in the bucket are not enough: we need a sea change.”COP25 to  Set the Stage for Enhanced NDCsIn 2020, nations are to submit new or updated national climate action plans, referred to as Nationally-Determined Contributions, or “NDCs”.According to the UN Environment Programme’s 2019 Emission Gap Report published this week, unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.This means collective ambition would need to increase more than fivefold over current levels to deliver the cuts needed over the next decade for the 1.5°C goal.“Current NDCs remain inadequate,” said Executive Secretary Espinosa. “If we stay on our current trajectory, it’s estimated that  global temperatures could more than double by the end of this century. This will have enormous negative consequences for humanity and threaten our existence on this planet. We need an immediate and urgent change in trajectory.It’s achievable, but to stabilize global temperature rise by 1.5 Celsius by the end of this century, we need to reduce emissions 45 per cent by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. It’s an extremely difficult challenge, but meeting it is absolutely necessary to the health, safety and security of everyone on this planet—both in the short- and long-term.”With regard to raising ambition, COP25 will be informed by the outcomes of the Climate Summit in New York in September and Climate Weeks in Africa, Asia and Latin America co-organized by UN Climate Change this year.“At these key events, we saw an enormous groundswell of action, with many contributions from governments and  non-Party stakeholders, including regions, cities, businesses and investors. Their contributions are crucial to drive the transformation we need, said Executive Secretary Espinosa.At the New York Climate Summit, Chile launched a Climate Ambition Alliance that brings together nations upscaling action by 2020, as well as those working towards achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.About the UNFCCCWith 197 Parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep a global average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.For media enquiries, please contactAlexander SaierUNFCCC Communications and Outreach(mobile) +49 172 179 8835; E-mail: asaier(at)unfccc.intUNFCCC Press Office: press(at)unfccc.intSee also: http://unfccc.intOverview of UNFCCC and COP25 Presidency social media channels:  https://unfccc.int/virtual-participation-cop25Source: https://unfccc.int/news/cop25-to-be-the-launchpad-for-significantly-more-climate-ambition-0
In my opinion the United Nations is trying to turn itself into a governing body at least as powerful as the European Union, possibly even as powerful as the Soviet Union. Climate policy appears to be the instrument of their ascendancy.
British EU apologists frequently claim EU membership is vital for British climate policy, so why not replicate this “success” on a much larger scale?  Whoever sets the rules of a strong international carbon market controls the global economy.

"You have probably heard it yourself: the impression that millennials are financial freewheelers. The theory goes that today’s   or   spend with little regard for savings and even less regard for retiring. Retirement planning experts say that this assumption isn’t entirely accurate  —   though it is perennially true that most young adults don’t make retirement savings a financial priority. But, as the experts point out, millennials are in an ideal position to get started, because whatever they set aside will grow and accrue interest greatly over time. “The value of compounding means you’ll have to contribute less later,” said Maria Bruno, a senior investment strategist at Vanguard, the investment management company. She recommends that people open retirement accounts as early as they can  —   that way, the savings have more time to build and be reinvested. Eventually, the interest an account accrues will begin to earn interest of its own. The New York Times spoke to five people in the   to    age group, a small sample of millennial savers. Two experts from the retirement division of Prudential Financial offered advice and feedback on each person’s profile. Though advice differed based on the individual situation, advisers across the spectrum were consistent on two broader points: ■ Young investors should take advantage of Roth retirement fund options. Roth funds, which include individual retirement accounts and 401( k)’s, differ from traditional retirement accounts in that contributions are made after tax once money is invested, earnings and withdrawals are  . ■ Younger workers should contribute at least as much as an employer is willing to match in a 401( k) or similar program. With this advice in mind, read a snapshot of millennials at various stages of retirement planning. Mr. LaCasse doesn’t see himself jetting off to exotic destinations at the end of his career, but he does hope to have some financial security and independence. He makes about $52, 000 a year and contributes 4 percent of every paycheck to a 403( b) account  —   a retirement account primarily for teachers. His school does not match his contributions, but he did receive an initial,   contribution of $1, 200. He currently has about $6, 000 in a savings account he doesn’t touch, and he puts away a little from every paycheck. Though he would like to save more, Mr. LaCasse worries that he is not in a secure enough position to do so. “There’s kind of a feeling of short term versus long term, and unfortunately the short term comes first  —   I need to cover my    expenses,” he said. “The long term takes a major back seat. ” For one thing, student loan repayments (of nearly $500 a month) represent about a fifth of his monthly expenses and hinder his ability to squirrel away more.  THE ADVICE Stephanie Sherman, a certified financial planner at Prudential, said that Mr. LaCasse might be able to restructure his student loans to give himself more breathing room. “If he has a great credit score, he can refinance them and make the same payment and pay them off quicker, or free up more money for savings,” she said. Mr. LaCasse said he had already considered refinancing and was thinking about it more seriously after hearing Ms. Sherman’s advice. “The process seems so daunting, and it keeps getting pushed aside,” he said. “Now I feel more motivated to do it. ” If she is able to break into theater or film, Ms. Craven would like to keep working for a lifetime. “As an actor, I’m going to want to tell stories and do that as long as I can,” she said. Even so, she hopes by her late 60s or early 70s to prioritize family time and traveling. Though she has never had a job with retirement benefits, she would be comfortable putting aside 5 to 10 percent of her $45, 000 income on her own. She already has $7, 500 in savings, but not in a formal retirement account. Her main concern is seasonal fluctuations in her salary that could derail a   savings plan. “I’m in a very busy season for work right now, so I’m making more money, but once the tourists go away, it’ll be back to scraping by,” Ms. Craven said. THE ADVICE Ms. Craven said she felt she wasn’t doing enough to save for retirement, but the experts saw things differently. “Mollie sounds like she has it all together,” Ms. Sherman said, noting how much she already has in savings. She didn’t deny that seasonal income fluctuations were a challenge, but said that there were many ways to plan around them. She suggested that Ms. Craven find a financial adviser to develop a personalized strategy and perhaps open an independent retirement account. Ms. Sherman also explained that many people in the entertainment field built retirement benefit credits through organizations that they worked for, but that these benefits were not always well advertised to contractors. Ms. Craven said that she was fairly certain she had not accrued retirement credits through her performances, but was interested in finding an adviser and considering a formal retirement account. “It does seem disheartening that the savings account that I have just sits there and doesn’t grow hardly at all, maybe a cent every month or so,” she said. “I’d love to put some of that away and not touch it. ” Although he has worked at his current company, Redwood Logistics, for more than three years, Mr. Ruger has been hesitant to invest in its 401( k). “It’s such a millennial thing, but I don’t want to have to commit to a job,” he said. His career goal is to wind up on Broadway. And while he does some singing gigs on the side, the older he gets, the less likely he figures he is to start a   acting career. He doesn’t have a definite vision for his retirement, either. “If I’m being totally honest, I never saw myself as having that option,” Mr. Ruger said. He has a few thousand dollars in a checking account, but no specific savings. He also has a lot of college debt. “We’re paying off these crazy student loans with these crazy interest rates,” Mr. Ruger said. “Stuff that requires money  —   like houses and cars and retirement  —   are not in the cards. We can just pay off the interest on our student loans and our rent, and work until we die. ” Further on the topic of his company’s 401( k) Mr. Ruger said he was unsure how the plan worked and worried about losing his investment if he ever left the job. THE ADVICE Crystal Vacura, a retirement counselor at Prudential, said that Mr. Ruger’s feelings were not uncommon: Many people are hesitant to invest in a 401( k) for reasons like procrastination or confusion. She pointed out to Mr. Ruger that 401( k) contributions could usually stay invested in the original fund or could roll over into new accounts if he switched employers or went freelance. She also suggested that Mr. Ruger put aside all of the earnings from his singing gigs into a dedicated savings account: If he is really not comfortable with a   401( k) he should consider opening an I. R. A. she said. Mr. Ruger particularly liked Mrs. Vacura’s suggestion of investing the money he earned from singing, and said that if he had to choose between a 401( k) and an I. R. A. “I’d go with getting my act together and opening a retirement account through my job, because they offer one, and it’s ridiculous that I haven’t done that yet. ” As a state employee, Ms. King is eligible to invest in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, and she anticipates staying with her employer for the duration. “I hope to retire at some point  —   my expectation is, after 30 years of service,” she said. “Because I am working for a public institution, 30 years is pretty much the standard. ” She has been in her current role for only three years, but was able to start contributing to Opers (the acronym for the Ohio retirement system) as a student employee and already has $15, 000 in her account. Though she has no other formal savings, Ms. King owns a house and contributes 10 percent of her $   salary to the account, with the university contributing an additional 14 percent. Ms. King is paying off student loans but expects to be   by the end of the winter, at which point she will be able to diversify her savings plan and increase her contributions by as much as 25 or 50 percent. THE ADVICE “Cherita certainly seems   on paying off her student loans,” Ms. Sherman said. “She also seems very focused on redirecting that to increasing her retirement savings. ” Ms. Sherman and Ms. Vacura agreed that Ms. King was in a good position for retirement, though they recommended that she open a separate “rainy day” savings account. Ms. King said the rainy day fund was her next priority after paying off her student loans. And she was happy her efforts had won good reviews. “It’s validating to hear that people who know about finance are saying I’m on the right track,” she said. Ms. Hamilton has been planning for her retirement since she was 17. “I took a class in high school, and they showed me the building of compounding interest,” she said. That prompted her to get a weekend job and put her earnings into an I. R. A. which has grown to about $30, 000. She also has a separate 401( k) through her employer, with a similar amount invested. “I want to work really hard now and save really hard so I can travel the world and not have to worry about finances” in retirement, Ms. Hamilton said. Her husband is a strong partner in her savings plan. When they married last year, they agreed to live on a single income and put the rest into savings: They already have more than $100, 000. Ms. Hamilton is very reluctant to touch her primary income for anything beyond basic necessities. When the time came to buy new furniture, she got a weekend job at Restoration Hardware to cover the expense. THE ADVICE Ms. Sherman of Prudential said that while Ms. Hamilton would seem to be a model of thrift, she could be even more proactive, perhaps by buying life insurance or opening a   retirement savings plan. “Really start to address the things that could derail your retirement, as you’re a fabulous saver,” she suggested. Ms. Hamilton said that her personal financial adviser gave similar feedback and that she was encouraged to be receiving such consistent advice about reaching her goals. “I may not make a million dollars a year, but I feel like I can one day hopefully have a retirement that’s comparable,” she said."

A new study suggests China’s shift from heavy industry to a high tech service economy will cause CO2 emissions to peak well before the 2030 goal – though the study authors admit they haven’t considered smaller cities.
China is on track to meet its climate change goals nine years earlyENVIRONMENT 26 July 2019By Adam Vaughan…Now an analysis has found that China’s emissions could peak at 13 to 16 gigatonnes of CO2 between 2021 and 2025, making what the researchers call a “a great contribution” to meeting the Paris deal’s goal of limiting temperature rises to 2°C. The official target is a peak by “around 2030.”…However, Haikun and colleagues admit they didn’t analyse many small cities, which have the potential to develop more, so the real emissions may end up higher. The US-based thinktank World Resources Institute also says that while more countries are peaking emissions – 57 are due by 2030, up from 19 in 1990 – it will still not be enough to make global emissions peak in the next few years.…Read more: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2211366-china-is-on-track-to-meet-its-climate-change-goals-nine-years-early/
The abstract of the study;
China’s CO2 peak before 2030 implied from characteristics and growth of citiesHaikun Wang, Xi Lu, Yu Deng, Yaoguang Sun, Chris P. Nielsen, Yifan Liu, Ge Zhu, Maoliang Bu, Jun Bi & Michael B. McElroy China pledges to peak CO2 emissions by 2030 or sooner under the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 °C or less by the end of the century. By examining CO2 emissions from 50 Chinese cities over the period 2000–2016, we found a close relationship between per capita emissions and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) for individual cities, following the environmental Kuznets curve, despite diverse trajectories for CO2 emissions across the cities. Results show that carbon emissions peak for most cities at a per capita GDP (in 2011 purchasing power parity) of around US$21,000 (80% confidence interval: US$19,000 to 22,000). Applying a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the peak of per capita emissions using a Kuznets function based on China’s historical emissions, we project that emissions for China should peak at 13–16 GtCO2 yr−1 between 2021 and 2025, approximately 5–10 yr ahead of the current Paris target of 2030. We show that the challenges faced by individual types of Chinese cities in realizing low-carbon development differ significantly depending on economic structure, urban form and geographical location.Read more: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0339-6
I’m always a little dubious about analysis of China conducted by Chinese academics, particularly where a negative finding might cause embarrassment for the Chinese government. 
The South China Post recently revealed massive fraud in reported economic growth in the city of Guanghan. 
This isn’t the first time; fake reports of economic growth may even have been responsible for the myth of decoupling, a period several years ago when Chinese growth appeared to be surging despite a slump in the growth of reported Chinese CO2 emissions. 
Then Chinese CO2 emissions suddenly surged; I still don’t know whether this was because actual economic growth started to catch up with reported growth, or maybe China decided to confess CO2 emissions they had previously been concealing.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn recent decades, North American glaciers have advanced by many kilometers and buried forests in ice in the same regions where glaciers have receded and uncovered Medieval-era forests.

Image Source: Davi et al., 2019
Ancient forests buried beneath ice for the last ~1,000 years began “popping out from under southern Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier” and garnishing headlines a few years ago (LiveScience, 2013).
Much of the attention centered around the glacier’s retreat and an apparent link to climate change. However, the revelation that intact and upright trees could be exposed from beneath a glacier suggests the Medieval climate was warm enough to sustain forests prior to the Little Ice Age glaciation.
In close proximity to Juneau’s wasting-away Mendenhall Glacier, the Taku Glacier has advanced 7 km since 1890 (Vore et al., 2019), encasing modern cottonwood tree forests in ice throughout the process.
There are claims that Juneau residents are concerned about the ice melt contribution to sea level rise due to the recession of the Mendenhall Glacier (LiveScience, 2013). This is ironic considering local relative sea level has been falling at a rate of over -13 mm/yr since the 1930s.

In Arctic Canada, the Good Friday Glacier (GF) has been continuously advancing ever since it was first spotted in 1948. While the advance has slowed in recent years (upon reaching tidewater and calving in the late 2000s), the uninterrupted advance has amounted to 9.3 km in the last 70 years (Medrzycka et al., 2019).

Another North American glacier system on the slopes of Mount Rainer (Washington, USA) has undergone both retreat and advance since the 1970s (Moore et al., 2019), further emphasizing non-linear glacier responses to recent climate changes.

The legendary bank robber Willie Sutton apparently did not say that he robbed banks “because that’s where the money is,” even though everyone thinks he did. And, apparently, rich donors also don’t identify issues that are “where the voters are,” at least in Florida.



Billionaire Tom Steyer has spent $12 million trying to make Floridians scared of global warming — an issue Gallup recently found ranks dead last among voter priorities. Other research indicates that the more people are harangued about it, the more they turn off, making this money not well spent.



Blame the information age, where people can easily see for themselves that we are in our 18th year without a global‐​warming trend. They can also go the National Climatic Data Center’s website and plot out Florida’s yearly temperature; there is no overall significant warming trend in the entire record, which covers 118 years.





Voters are suffering from apocalypse fatigue, something well‐​heeled political donors would do well to recognize.



A little advance work could have saved a ton of money. The most popular climate change website in the world, Anthony Watts’s www​.wattsup​with​that​.com, now has well over 200 million views. It is decidedly nonapocalyptic. The most prominent scare site, Real​Cli​mate​.org, has a hundred times fewer views.



Watts’s site is run on a shoestring. While some of Steyer’s ads blame the Koch Brothers for skepticism about the end of the world, Watts has never seen a dollar of their support — or, for that matter, many dollars of anyone’s support, as it is mostly run with a tip jar.



Here’s the cool part: According to the model the Environmental Protection Agency uses to assess the climatic effects of various policies, if the emissions from the entire state of Florida dropped immediately to zero, the amount of global warming that would be saved by the year 2100 would be a grand total of seven thousandths of a degree Celsius (0.007°C). Such action would cost the Florida economy a fortune — even more money down the climate rat hole.



And thanks in no small part to the nearly two decades without any warming, it looks as though the amount the EPA assumes will occur this century was substantially exaggerated.



Some of Steyer’s ad footage clearly conflates warming and tidal inundations caused by hurricane winds. The fact is a lot of people in Florida don’t remember the last big (Category 3 or higher) one, Hurricane Wilma, which made landfall in Florida on Oct. 24, 2005. In fact, Wilma was the last such Category 3 to strike in the entire U.S., 3,292 days ago. This is the longest that the country has gone without such a storm since the Civil War era, and 23 days from now, we will be in the longest major hurricane drought in our recorded history.



The truth of the matter is, the planet is warmer than it was, and there’s some evidence that people have something to do with it. It just doesn’t have anything to do with hurricanes and their brethren around the entire planet, nor is it strong enough to even induce a significant warming trend in the overall Florida record.



Incidentally, the hallmark of warming from carbon dioxide (recent years notwithstanding) is that the coldest air masses of the winter are what warm the most. These are what freeze Florida’s orange crop. One notorious 1977 freeze, dubbed _The Siberian Express_ , actually put down snow in Miami, for the first and only time since good weather records have been kept.



As Casey Stengel would have said, “you could look it up,” which is precisely what people do when hectored about the upcoming climate apocalypse. People my age have lived through about nine such apocalypses. “Acid rain” seems so quaint now, doesn’t it?



The reason voters rank global warming dead last is because they are tired of these false apocalypses. They are suffering from apocalypse fatigue, something well‐​heeled political donors would do well to recognize. Throwing money at exaggerated disasters may cost more votes than it buys.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science, posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
Leaving the election results aside (noting that they were bad for the Obama administration’s ill-founded and executive-ordered climate policies), we highlight a couple (among the many) interesting climate change–related tidbits scattered among the intertubes.   
  
The first is an analysis of what was left out of the latest (final?) report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), conducted by Marcel Crok, a Dutch journalist who covers climate change with a somewhat skeptical eye.   
  
Crok recently partnered up with climate researcher Nic Lewis to produce a major analysis of climate sensitivity—one of the key parameters in helping to understand how much influence human activities will have on the future climate—for the United Kingdom’s Global Warming Policy Foundation  (another site that you’ll surely be hearing from in these pages from time to time). Lewis and Crok found that the IPCC greatly overestimated the climate sensitivity based on a critical review of the extant scientific literature on the topic.   
  
In a post this week on his blog (which is sometimes written in Dutch), Crok compares how the IPCC treatment of climate sensitivity changed from being-front-and-center in its 2007 _Fourth Assessment Report_ to being nearly buried in its 2014 _Fifth Assessment Report_.   
  
Why the change? Because the more people look at climate sensitivity, the less it looks like the IPCC produced a very good “assessment” of it. Virtually the entirety of their reports are premised on a climate sensitivity of around 3.5°C. A much more realistic value is around 2.0°C—a difference so large as to consign most of the IPCC reports to the dustbin of climate history.   




In his article “IPCC Bias In Action,” Crok writes:   




The IPCC was saddled with a dilemma. A lot of conclusions in the report are based on the output of models and admitting that the models’ climate sensitivity is about 40% too high was apparently too … inconvenient. So IPCC decided not to mention climate sensitivity anymore in the SPM of the Synthesis Report. It decided to give the world a prognosis which it knows is overly pessimistic. One may wonder why. Did it want to hide the good news?



We could hardly have said it better ourselves!   
  
Another site worth clicking on from time to time is a blog called _The Blackboard_, run by Lucia Liljegren, and independent climate researcher and all-around busybody. Previously, we have teamed up with Lucia to examine how the observed evolution of the global average temperature compares with expectations of the behavior as produced by climate models. Our results indicated that climate models were not faring too well. While everyone knows this now, 4–5 years ago this was cutting edge, and the establishment wanted nothing to do with it. Thus, our paper was never published (rejected by several journals). Nevertheless, it was a scientifically robust work that was a harbinger of things to come. It is available here.   
  
Lucia continues to keep a tab on climate model performance. Recently, she updated her analysis to check to see if reports of the death of the global warming “hiatus” were accurate. Like Mark Twain before her, she found them to be greatly exaggerated. Lucia reports:   




Anyway: I’m rather unconvinced ‘the hiatus’ is over. That said: it’s a bit difficult to say for sure because the definition of ‘hiatus’ is rather vague. It does seem to me we are going to need to see _quite_ a bit of warming to overcome the doubts of those who think models are not well suited to predicting warming over periods as long as 20 or 30 years.



The reason for this is simple. It will take several years of warming to establish a significant trend since 1997. For example, if warming began in 2014, at the same rate that was established between the late 1970s and the late 1990s, the “hiatus” would extend to 24 years (using annual data) before the post-1997 trend became significant.   
  
And finally, we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that level-headed science/science policy researcher Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado has a new book out that should be of interest to anyone who seeks the truth behind the (lack of) identifiable linkages between extreme weather and human greenhouse gas emissions. His book is called _The Rightful Place of Science: Disasters and Climate Change_ , and it is available from Amazon at the insanely cheap price of only $5. For more info and to see what folks have to say about it, you ought to have a look here.

"**A famous French chef who said he had been ""disgraced"" after one of his Michelin stars was removed has lost his lawsuit against the restaurant guide.**
The Michelin Guide is a restaurant guide book, and its three-starred restaurants are often considered to be among the finest in the world.
Marc Veyrat lost his top rating after only one year, and sued Michelin, demanding a full explanation.
But the French court dismissed his case, ordering him to pay costs.
It found that the 69-year-old chef had failed to show any proof that he had suffered material damage.
Mr Veyrat himself told the AFP news agency ahead of the ruling that business in the restaurant, La Maison des Bois, was up 7% in the past year, and he was fully booked even in the normally quiet period between Christmas and New Year.
His legal case was aimed at forcing the guide's editors to hand over its judges' notes and the explicit reasons for the decision to strip his restaurant of its third star. He asked for one euro in symbolic damages.
Michelin, however, labelled the chef a ""narcissistic diva"" and said the case was about freedom of opinion and criticism.
Mr Veyrat had previously said he had been plunged into months of depression, and criticised Michelin's food critics, known as ""inspectors"".
They ""dared to say we put cheddar in our soufflÃ©"", he told French Radio at the outset of his legal action, saying he would never use an English cheese in such a way.
""I put saffron in it, and the gentleman who came thought it was cheddar because it was yellow,"" he said.
Earlier in 2019, he asked the guidebook to remove his restaurant from its listings entirely, rather than be listed with just two stars - something its editors refused to do.
Three stars are awarded to roughly 100 restaurants in the world each year. The guide says it awards such a rating only to those restaurants which are worth a ""special journey"" merely to dine there. Two-star restaurants, meanwhile, are ""excellent"" and ""worth a detour"".
But the authors are well aware of the power the guide has, noting that ""getting a star (or three) could change the fate of a restaurant"".
The entry for La Maison des Bois, located in Mr Veyrat's home town of Manigod in the Haute-Savoie department, 20km (12 miles) west of Mont Blanc, notes that guests can be ""assured to be well-looked after"" and amid a stunning setting, ""the chef always surprises""."
"**Tesco has temporarily withdrawn pots of its own-brand honey amid concerns that it contains adulterated ingredients.**
It comes after tests conducted by Richmond council in London indicated that ""Tesco Set Honey 454g"" contains syrups made from sugar.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it was ""[looking] into these reports"" to see if further action was necessary.
The supermarket chain denied there were any problems with the product and insisted it was ""100% pure"".
Concerns were raised over the honey, which costs Â£1.35 per jar, by Richmond council in south-west London, which conducted tests after it was alerted by a member of the public.
""The findings of the analysis is that there is likely to be adulteration with non-natural products,"" a council spokeswoman told the Sunday Times.
The council contacted the FSA, which confirmed it was looking into the matter, but has denied it called for Tesco to withdraw the product.
""We are continuing to look into these reports to determine whether further action is required,"" the FSA said in a statement.
""Honey is a natural but complex product and there are a number of different tests which may be used to determine authenticity.""
Nevertheless, the retailer said it has temporarily taken the honey off the shelves for further examination, but insists the product is ""100% pure, natural and can be directly traced back to the beekeeper"".
""We carry out regular tests to ensure our honey meets this standard and is fully compliant with all legal requirements,"" Tesco said in a statement.
""However, as a precautionary measure, we have temporarily withdrawn the product to conduct further tests.""
Chris Elliott, professor of food safety at Queen's University Belfast, who led a review of food systems following the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said it was a ""bold"" statement from Tesco.
""They are claiming they are 100% sure it is pure honey. If they are correct then the testing method is wrong. If it proves to be adulterated then Tesco doesn't have the control over their supply chain they claim,"" he said.
The method used by Richmond council was nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which he said was a relatively new technique that can be used to determine the sources of sugars.
Tesco's decision to withdraw the product was a ""prudent"" step, Professor Elliott added.
""There's no food safety issue here but consumers must trust our retailers to take every precaution that they are not selling us adulterated food,"" he said."
"So, the sparkly dresses and heat tech have been worn the ball, and the other shoe, has dropped. The year 2016 is over, and 2017 has begun. It’s no longer time to look back, but to look forward. And what do we see? When it comes to fashion  —   or more important, fashion as it affects life  —   there will be interesting times ahead. Here are some opening thoughts on what to watch for in the coming months. A new look in Washington and Paris. Pantsuits  —   at least on women  —   are out. So are the     look and the   look of men in   shirt sleeves. In Washington, we are entering the era of the boxy, oversize suit, the big knot, the   tie, and, maybe, European brands. As the Trump administration prepares to move into the executive wing, fashion  —   and the American capital  —   are preparing for a whole new style statement. The inauguration this month will throw down the gauntlet. What the   will wear (Brioni is my best guess) may ultimately be less significant than what his wife and eldest daughter will wear. Judging by the designs that Melania and Ivanka Trump wore on the campaign trail and on New Year’s Eve, the age of American designers in the White House may be over. On Dec. 31, after all, Melania celebrated in a black Dolce  Gabbana sheath (Stefano Gabbana, Instagramming the news, proudly joined the “I will dress Melania” camp). And previously, when stumping for her father, if not in her own brand, Ivanka opted for Roland Mouret and Alexander McQueen. If that pattern continues, that’s as big an upending of the soft status quo as anything Mr. Trump has pledged. Come Jan. 20, we’ll get the first real sense of what to expect. In France, where voters go to the polls in April and May, a   candidate, François Fillon, is known for combining Savile Row tailoring and Italian style, as well as for his fondness of red socks from Gammarelli (official tailor to the pope). By contrast, his   opponent, Marine Le Pen, has been characterized as promoting an image that is “mumsy” and “frumpy”  —   and not remotely   in contrast with Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May  —   perhaps to try to make her party, the formerly fringe National Front, more accessible. Either way, the   Pen oppositional   should have a   effect on fashion. Also on the runways. More upheaval on the  runways.  This year, the name to watch is indubitably Raf Simons, who makes his debut at Calvin Klein at New York Fashion Week in February, with a promise of shaking up the whole system. He’ll introduce his vision for the brand with a dual men’s and women’s wear show, thus giving his seal of approval to the new      trend, which extends from New York to London and Milan, and which includes Gucci, Burberry and Bottega Veneta. Think of it as the bandwagon of the sexes. And more cultural action off the runways. It’s going to be a banner year for fashion exhibitions. In February, in the middle of fashion month, Kensington Palace in London will host “Diana: Her Fashion Story,” a collection of garments worn by the princess in the 1980s and ’90s. In July, just before the couture shows kick off, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris  will present “Christian Dior. ” And in between those two openings, three major retrospectives will be unveiled in May: “Balenciaga: Shaping Fashion,” at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London “The World of Anna Sui,” at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London (the first retrospective of an American designer to be held in Britain) and, of course, “Rei   des Garçons” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. The Met show should provide the best   moments of the year, as   gala attendees attempt to honor Ms. Kawakubo’s work, which focuses less on beauty than on the question of what clothing is. It should give new meaning to the concept of wearable art. Then there are the movies. On the subject of the Met and the Costume Institute gala: The   Party of the Year is set to play a pivotal role in the coming   remake of the film “Ocean’s 11,” called “Ocean’s 8. ” Then there’s a new crop of fashion biopics in the works, and they are doozies. Jack O’Connell has been signed to play Alexander McQueen in Andrew Haigh’s movie on the British designer, which is set to start filming in the spring Daniel   will channel Charles James for Paul Thomas Anderson’s    movie about the   couturier, who was the subject of a Met show in 2014 and on the small screen, Lady Gaga will be Donatella Versace in “ : American Crime Story,” the third season of the FX television drama. Will this help or hurt the increasingly intertwined relationship between Hollywood and high fashion? Reviews, and box offices, will tell. The wedding of the year. O. K. they haven’t set a date, but there’s little doubt that the marriage  of the tennis great Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian,   of Reddit, is going to be a style grand slam. Between Ms. Williams’s avowed interest in fashion  —   see the outfits she designs for Nike, as well as her own line  —   and her willingness to take risks with tradition, her B. F. F. status with the American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, and her status as a crown princess of the BeyHive (see her appearance in Lemonade, this could put a whole new spin on nuptial trends. Pun intended."
"**Food brand Mackie's of Scotland has reported record revenues following a sharp rise in sales of chocolate and ice cream.**
The Aberdeenshire-based firm said annual turnover rose by 20% to Â£16.7m in the year to May 2019.
Pre-tax profits were up by nearly 60%, at Â£2,176,000.
Sales of chocolate grew by 63% on the previous year, which the company attributed to a ""recipe refinement"", while ice cream sales also climbed.
Mackie's said the sales growth ""bucked a wider market decline"", and it was now targeting further market expansion in London and the south east.
Across the entire business, revenues from exports increased by 72%, with the US and Far East markets ""developing at pace"".
Managing director Mac Mackie said: ""While this set of results undoubtedly benefited from 2018's glorious summer weather, beyond that this was no fluke.
""We've worked over the years to grow, cut costs and diversify the business across products and markets.""
He added: ""This past year's success is enabling us to make a serious investment in improving our operations, which will in the longer term increase our sustainability and secure job opportunities for more staff in our native Aberdeenshire and beyond.""
The firm is investing Â£4.5m this year in a new refrigeration system which it says will reduce both energy use and CO2 emissions by 80%.
It is aiming to become 100% self-sufficient in renewable energy this year."

What, if anything, should the United States do about climate change?



One possibility, embodied in President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, is to double‐​down on current policies, which include fuel economy standards for motor vehicles, efficiency standards for household appliances, subsidies for “clean” energies like wind and solar, mandates for biofuels like ethanol and carbon pollution standards for power plants.



 **‘Ideal’ carbon tax**



By raising prices for gasoline, coal and oil, an ideal carbon tax causes substitution of greener alternatives, thus reducing carbon emissions, according to the Cato Institute’s Jeffrey Miron. Higher fossil fuel prices also incentivize research on alternatives.



These policies tend to reduce carbon emissions, but they are blunt instruments for achieving that goal. Enhanced fuel or energy efficiency standards impact new purchases of cars and appliances but not existing stocks. Subsidies for clean energy require government to be a venture capitalist, despite abundant evidence that government does this badly. Bio‐​fuel mandates do not appear to reduce carbon emissions because they deplete carbon dioxide‐​consuming forests. Carbon pollution standards for power plants are difficult to monitor and enforce.





What, if anything, should the United States do about climate change?



More broadly, “command and control” policies do not readily balance emissions reductions against the costs of achieving these reductions. Some reductions are easy to achieve, while others are difficult, so an ideal policy obtains the biggest reductions from sources that require the smallest costs. Complicated rules imposed by bureaucrats at multiple government agencies do not lend themselves to this balancing.



An alternative approach is to replace all these command‐​and‐​control policies with a revenue‐​neutral carbon tax. That is, eliminate the entire command‐​and‐​control apparatus; increase or impose new taxes on fossil fuels; and lower other tax rates so as to leave tax revenue unchanged.



A carbon tax is far simpler to enforce than command‐​and‐​control policies. It is straightforward to compute the extra carbon cost generated by the tax, so this can be balanced against the estimated benefits of reduced carbon emissions. In addition, a carbon tax raises revenue, which means the U.S. could lower other tax rates while holding total revenue constant.



The economics of how best to address climate change is therefore clear. Why, then, has the U.S. not adopted this approach?



One possibility is that the scientific case for costly global warming is not compelling, but I’ll leave that aside for now. A second possibility is recognition that even ideal carbon taxation makes the U.S. a less competitive location for businesses, since it is impossible to force other countries to adopt similar carbon taxes (or even to reduce their existing carbon subsidies). If the U.S. goes it alone in reducing emissions, the net impact on global warming will be minor.



Moreover, political constraints make the ideal carbon tax virtually dead‐​on‐​arrival.



Conservatives are skeptical because they doubt Congress will adopt the ideal approach and instead just add a carbon tax on top of current command‐​and‐​control policies, while failing to lower other tax rates to achieve revenue‐​neutrality.



Such a non‐​ideal carbon tax would have several negatives. It would fail to eliminate the bureaucratic waste, rent‐​seeking, inefficiencies and corruption that command‐​and‐​control policies generate. Plus, adding carbon taxes on top of these policies risks overkill in addressing climate change; the estimated risks, even if 100 percent accurate, suggest moderate increases in carbon prices, not unlimited attempts to punish carbon.



Failure to keep revenue neutral also foregoes a key benefit of the ideal carbon tax. And, extra revenue might generate additional expenditure, which some conservatives oppose on principle and others oppose unless they are confident it will be spent in their own districts.



Liberals, with some exceptions, oppose carbon taxation. They fear voters will not support climate policies whose costs are explicit; voters seem to prefer command‐​and‐​control policies that appear free or that claim to impose the costs only on businesses. And some liberals like the power they obtain from rewarding special interests or favored donors with loan guarantees, ethanol mandates and the like.



Independent of party affiliation, moreover, politicians from coal or oil‐​producing states oppose carbon taxation because it will adversely impact their constituents.



The prospects for an ideal carbon tax are therefore remote, which leaves three choices: more command‐​and‐​control; a non‐​ideal carbon tax; or just sticking with current policy, as imperfect as it is. The third alternative — do no (new) harm — is probably the best choice.

There is a dirty, big secret in the climate change debate: it’s mostly constructed on a foundation of bullshit. Very sophisticated, high-powered bullshit, to be sure. But even the excrement of a pedigree wagyu steer is still bullshit.



Every time you hear some pinch-faced Swedish teenager or placard-waving green activist claim that “the science says” that we are careening towards climate hellfire, just remind yourself: **they don’t know what they’re talking about. Nobody does.**



That’s because almost everything that’s shouted about climate change is based on two very shonky assumptions: climate models and reconstructed temperature records.



Japanese oceanographer and meteorologist, Dr Nakamura Mototaka, has published (in Japanese with limited English translation) a book on “the sorry state of climate science”. [It’s available as a Kindle book.](http://amzn.com/B07FKHF7T2) Dr Nakamura, who is eminently qualified to do so, roundly criticises the global climate models (GCMs) on which almost all climate science is based.



Today’s vast panoply of “global warming science” is like an upside down pyramid built on the work of a few score of serious climate modellers […] [but] the temperature forecasting models trying to deal with the intractable complexities of the climate are no better than “toys” or “Mickey Mouse mockeries” of the real world, [Dr. Nakamura] says.



The IPCC at least had the good grace to quietly admit as much up until its third report in 2001. Since then, though, the increasing stranglehold of green-left activists over the IPCC has ensured that all such admissions have been systematically expunged.



Nakamura […] accus[es] the orthodox scientists of “data falsification” by adjusting previous temperature data to increase apparent warming “The global surface mean temperature-change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public,” he writes.



“ […] the models just become useless pieces of junk or worse (worse in a sense that they can produce gravely misleading output) when they are used for climate forecasting.”



The basic fact of the “greenhouse effect” – how much heat from the Earth’s surface is trapped by atmospheric carbon dioxide is not in dispute. In a simple, linear relationship, doubling CO2 in the atmosphere would lead to a temperature rise of 1°C. But the climate is not linear or simple.



[Nakamura] projects warming from CO2, “according to the true experts”, doubling to be only 0.5degC. He says he doesn’t dispute the possibility of either catastrophic warming or severe glaciation […] [but] climate forecasting is simply impossible, if only because future changes in solar energy output are unknowable. As to the impacts of human-caused CO2, they can’t be judged “with the knowledge and technology we currently possess.”



In fact, among the absurd simplifications of GCMs (including clouds and oceans), the most bizarre would have to be their treatment of the Sun, which is modelled as a “never changing quantity”. This is empirical nonsense on stilts. We know perfectly well that the Sun’s output is constantly fluctuating, often dramatically. Some scientists are adamant that the Sun remains the single biggest driver of climate change.



But, their defenders claim, models accurately “hindcast”, that is, recreate what has been observed in the historical record. This is, quite simply, bollocks.



The models are ‘tuned’ by tinkering around with values of various parameters until the best compromise is obtained […][Nakamura] is contemptuous of claims about models being “validated”, saying the modellers are merely “trying to construct narratives that justify the use of these models for climate predictions.”



“Tuning” models is like a gambler betting on a seven, throwing two fours, turning one of the dice over to a three, and then triumphantly proclaiming their winning bet.



Even the historical temperature record is less reliable than climate campaigners would like to believe.



The supposed measuring of global average temperatures from 1890 has been based on thermometer readouts barely covering 5 per cent of the globe until the satellite era began 40-50 years ago. “We do not know how global climate has changed in the past century, all we know is some limited regional climate changes, such as in Europe, North America and parts of Asia.”



  
Worse, global temperature records, even the best efforts, are spliced together from completely different methods, all with their own intrinsic problems and error margins. Even the most reliable, satellite measurements, have had to be “corrected” because they disagreed with synchronous measurements from other sources. And satellite data reaches back less than 40 years, scarcely more than what is accepted as the minimum time scale of climate significance.



To pretend that this represents a continuous dataset is a complete fallacy. To pretend that GCMs should form the basis of staggeringly costly and far-reaching public policy is even worse.

"As the dust settles on Russian interference in the United States election, journalists are confronting an aspect that has received less scrutiny than the hacking itself but poses its own thorny questions: Moscow’s ability to steer Western media coverage by doling out hacked documents. Reporters have always relied on sources who provide critical information for   reasons. The duty, tricky but familiar, is to publicize information that serves the public interest without falling prey to the source’s agenda. But in this case, the source was Russia’s military intelligence agency, the G. R. U.  —   operating through shadowy fronts who worked to mask that fact  —   and its agenda was to undermine the American presidential election. By releasing documents that would tarnish Hillary Clinton and other American political figures, but whose news value compelled coverage, Moscow exploited the very openness that is the basis of a free press. Its tactics have evolved with each such operation, some of which are still unfolding. Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King’s College London who is tracking the Russian influence campaign, said it goes well beyond hacking: “It’s political engineering, social engineering on a strategic level. ” Great powers have long meddled in one another’s affairs. But Russia, throughout 2016, developed a previously unseen tactic: setting up fronts to seed into the press documents it had obtained by hacking. “Doing public relations work in order to get the hacked material out as an exclusive story with the Daily Caller or Gawker or the Smoking Gun, that is new,” Mr. Rid said. That public relations work was initially done by two web presences that appeared this summer, Guccifer 2. 0 and DCLeaks, each posing as   in the mold of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks chief. Though neither acknowledged it, and the links were not immediately known, online security experts later concluded that both were Russian fronts. Guccifer 2. 0 claimed to be a Romanian ”freedom fighter” who had hacked the Democratic National Committee. Using Twitter’s private message service, the account conducted weekslong exchanges with journalists, pointing them to certain documents that had been hacked from the D. N. C. and other targets. “Whoever is doing this understands media. They understand the way that media works and how to manipulate media,” said Sheera Frenkel, a BuzzFeed News reporter who interacted with the fronts throughout the summer. DCLeaks, established separately and with its own sets of hacked documents, claimed to be “launched by the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech. ” The fronts sold the act by peppering their messages with slang and emojis. When Ms. Frenkel asked Guccifer whether it would release more D. N. C. documents, the reply came, “Yeah baby :)” Journalists who interacted with the accounts say their tone and facility with English varied widely, suggesting each was run by multiple users. A reporter with Motherboard, a technology site, quizzed Guccifer on the technical aspects of the hacking and on rudimentary Romanian. Guccifer failed both, lending credence to theories that it was a front. Those suspicions were initially restricted to security experts, trickling out only after firms such as ThreatConnect were able to unmask the fronts in detailed reports. In July, for instance, DCLeaks published emails belonging to retired Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove. The Intercept, a   site, covered the emails in a story that portrayed Mr. Breedlove as trying to foment hostility against Russia. The story did not note Russian links to the hack. Its lead author, Lee Fang, said he had no interactions with DCLeaks and pointed out that the group’s suspected Russian ties were not widely publicized at that time. Some reporters were offered documents exclusively, a familiar tactic of government press offices and public relations firms that want to shape coverage. In September, DCLeaks contacted Peter Hasson, a reporter at the Daily Caller, a   site, with an offer:   access to hacked emails belonging to Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. The Daily Caller’s story also did not note the growing belief that the documents had been hacked by Russia and leaked as part of an influence operation. Mr. Hasson said he was unaware of the alleged Russian links at the time. After awareness grew, the front organizations dropped the pretense. The newest group called itself Fancy Bears Hack Team  —   a breathtakingly overt reference to “fancy bear,” the name that some Western security groups use for G. R. U. hackers. Tom Cheshire, a reporter with the British network Sky News who has dealt with Fancy Bears, said they behaved “almost more like a P. R. firm, really” and were “very businesslike,” doling out scoops and trying to shape coverage. “It’s the sort of horse trading you do with all sorts of sources, really,” Mr. Cheshire said, hitting on a key to the operation’s impact: the way that it played within the bounds of established journalistic norms. Any leak by any source  —   Russian agent or citizen    —   poses a similar set of quandaries for reporters. Do you emphasize the hacking itself in your coverage, knowing that this will undercut the source’s agenda but could also be a disservice to readers by putting less focus on newsworthy information in the release? Do you withhold newsworthy documents, even only temporarily, to check their veracity and provenance? What if they have already been reported by other outlets that were shown the documents first? If they did turn out to be hacked as part of a hostile foreign operation, does that really make their contents less newsworthy? These are old questions for journalists, but they have taken on new urgency with the scale of Russia’s hackings and aims. Though the calculus of reporting on   leaks may be familiar, one aspect of the Russian operation stands out: the lengths to which the fronts go to mask their identities and motives. Because the internet gives any outlet the potential to reach millions, all it takes is one   leak to send the document flying across the web. Last year,   hackers infiltrated the United States   Agency, most likely in retaliation for accusations of   doping among Russia’s Olympic athletes. But Fancy Bears struggled to place the stolen documents with American or British outlets. Reporters who saw the files said their news value did not outweigh the risk of serving Russian interests. When Fancy Bears offered the files to The Associated Press, the reporters instead published a story on the   group itself. Fancy Bears ultimately persuaded sportswriters with Spiegel, a prominent German outlet, to report on emails that appeared to show American athletes requesting medical exceptions to take restricted drugs. The article noted a possible Russian link only in the final lines, alongside a quote from an American official arguing that the leak was intended to distract from   doping. If mainstream outlets pass on a hacking,   fronts can always pass the documents to peripheral outfits who will lend them less weight but can still send them across social media. That has often included the website InfoWars, which was founded by the   radio host Alex Jones and often publishes conspiracy theories. Guccifer 2. 0 approached Mikael Thalen, a writer for InfoWars, with D. N. C. documents that showed Democrats’ plans for attacking Paul Manafort, a campaign manager to Donald J. Trump who had worked on behalf of the   Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally. Mr. Thalen had come to believe, after many interactions with the front groups, that they “would reach out based on who would best carry the story the way they wanted it carried. ” He feared that Moscow was hoping InfoWars, by publishing the files, would muddy the water around accusations against Mr. Manafort, indirectly aiding Mr. Trump’s   campaign. Breaking with InfoWars’ usual reliance on such files, he declined to publish the documents. Because everyone has secrets, even if it’s only a few embarrassing personal emails, and because no network is impenetrable, skilled hackers can dig up compromising material on virtually any target. Democracies, which give privilege to competitive politics and free media, are particularly susceptible. “An open society is by choice more vulnerable than a closed society to some form of influence operation,” said Mr. Rid. “That is why we’re strong, but it’s also why we’re weak. ” The more that journalists and readers understand the motivations of foreign government leakers, he argued, the better they will be able to place those leaks in context, undercutting the hackers’ agenda without hiding newsworthy information. He compared this to a healthy body developing antibodies against a disease  —   foreign influence operations  —   that cannot be wholly immunized against while maintaining democratic openness. Still, some media trends  —   polarization, fake news, the   nature of social media  —   cut against those hopes. “This polarized election presented itself as a target of opportunity of the first order,” Mr. Rid said. Reporters may at times be hindered by a lack of transparency between media organizations, which are often highly competitive and prize speed and scoops. This has left reporters vulnerable because they cannot easily pool lessons on spotting foreign operations or, say, warn one another that a certain front is exaggerating the newsworthiness of its latest leak. “The more light shone on this, the more information you have when dealing with a source, the better decisions you’re going to make,” Mr. Cheshire said. Mr. Thalen, the InfoWars reporter, said he was increasingly turning down leaks that he knows his audience would read avidly and reward with acclaim, but that he considered exaggerated to advance Russian interests. Still, he was unsure it had made much difference. “A lot of people have swayed their reporting with their biases, and I didn’t want to do that,” he said. “People are believing what they want to be true. ”"
"Strange Allies in the War on Carbon Fuels.

What great cause could unite Prince Charles, President Obama, the Pope, the Arab Oil sheiks, the United Nations, the European Union, the Russians, the Chinese, Pacific Island Nations, most undeveloped countries, the glitterati of Hollywood, left-wing politicians, unrepentant reds, government media, the climate research industry, Big Oil, Big Gas and the Green Blob. It must be something posing a clear and urgent danger to all humanity?
No, the crusade that unites them all is the War on Carbon Fuels, focussed mainly on that most vilified target, coal.
The biggest group, and the generals in this war on carbon, have no real interest in the facts or science of global climate change – they see climate alarmism as a great opportunity to achieve their goal of creating an unelected global government. They have even laid out their plans in a document called Agenda 21.
This group naturally includes the United Nations and all of its subsidiaries, the EU, and left wing politicians and media everywhere. At a news conference in Brussels recently, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, admitted that the goal of environmental activists is not to save the world from ecological calamity, but “to change the economic development model” i.e. destroy what is left of free enterprise and private property. See:
http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/021015-738779-climate-change-scare-tool-to-destroy-capitalism.htm
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/10/10/shell-oil-lego-greenpeace-and-the-environmental-movement-s-war-on-capitalism/

The next big group of carbon warriors is the anti-western failed states who see this as their big chance to enrich and entrench their ruling classes with “climate reparations”.
Then there are the enviro-entrepreneurs forever seeking new crusades to energise their supporters and get the donations rolling in – Greenpeace, WWF, Get Up etc…
In the dark corner are the anti-human Malthusians and the Deep Greens who want to get rid of most of us other people – personified by the rich and powerful such as Prince Charles and Maurice Strong. They know that carbon fuels support millions of people by cultivating, harvesting, transporting, processing and storing most of the food that supports the cities of the world. Killing the use of carbon fuels will certainly achieve their goal of reduced world population. See:
http://explosivereports.com/2013/01/12/prince-charles-openly-endorses-draconian-conclusions-of-new-population-study/
Naturally, government media usually supports a bigger role for government, and all media likes a scare story. Truth or logic does not matter greatly for most of them – just so long as they can coax a looming disaster story from someone. The daily diet of natural calamities soon heightens climate anxiety, which then motivates politicians to be seen to be “doing something”.
And then there are those who see that fighting carbon fuels also suits their pockets. As someone said “When placing a bet, the best horse to back is the one called ‘Self-interest’ – at least you know he is trying”.

"MIAMI  —   By the time Donald Robertson, a retired architect, arrived at Fort   International Airport’s Terminal 1 on Friday afternoon, the mass shooting in Terminal 2, which left five people dead, had been over for at least an hour. The accused gunman, Esteban Santiago, was in police custody and the airport had largely returned to its normal rhythm  —   passengers were noshing, charging their phones, watching television. Things were so sedate that Mr. Robertson did not even realize there had been a shooting. But as he made his way past the gate, Mr. Robertson looked up and saw a “stampede” of people, including what looked like law enforcement agents, racing toward him. “It was tremendous,” he said. “It was like a herd reacting. Everyone around me was diving under chairs. ” A rumor about a possible second gunman had spread across the airport, via social media, news sites and word of mouth. People panicked and the airport was shut down, a turn of events that upended what had seemed like an orderly finale to a tragic afternoon. What followed that single rumor was a rush of terror for travelers and airport workers as they fled to the tarmac, were separated from loved ones, injured themselves in the tumult, hid in kitchens and storage rooms and hunkered down behind luggage trucks. Chaos and uncertainty unfolded over the next 12 hours. Through it all, travelers said, they were frustrated every step of the way by the dearth of information about whether they were safe, where to go once the airport was shut down and how they could retrieve the thousands of items  —   23, 000 according to a tally by airport officials  —   that were scattered across terminals. For the thousands who fled the terminals, seeking refuge on the tarmac or hiding wherever they could, food and water quickly became scarce. Bathrooms were nonexistent. Passengers on some planes that were either preparing to take off or trying to reach a gate were stuck on board for up to seven hours. Travelers said that some level of pandemonium is to be expected after a shooting, and they praised law enforcement for the swift response. But it was the aftermath of the rumor, which was debunked relatively quickly, that left them bewildered and angry. “Nobody gave us information, and as time went on, we were treated more and more like suspects,” Mr. Robertson said, referring to the   by law enforcement and orders for people to raise their hands as they walked from the airport down side roads. “When they decided to clear the terminal  —   that created terror. And it was real terror. People were really, really, really terrified and crying. ” Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County, Fla. said he issued the order to close the entire airport as a safety precaution after he received information that “perhaps gunfire had happened and an active shooter was in another terminal. ” At that point, he said, the safety of the people at the airport was paramount. “I made a decision to clear the airport,” Sheriff Israel said in an interview. “I worked with our SWAT team and other SWAT teams to clear the entire airport and the parking garage to make sure we didn’t have any other active shooter. It was a voluminous undertaking and we did it, as horrific and horrible as this scene was. ” Until that point, he said, the plan was by the book. “Had the misinformation of the active shooter not surfaced,” he said, “we would have had buses to the airport within 30 minutes. ” Sheriff Israel said he could not remember how long it took to confirm there was no second gunman. The authorities debunked the rumor about 30 to 45 minutes after it had started to spread, raising questions about whether the airport could have been reopened right away. By then, law enforcement was already sweeping the airport and garages. It is still unclear how the rumor began. Several travelers said in interviews that they heard what they believed to be gunshots in Terminal 3, something that sounded like loud pops. Sheriff Israel said that he was told somebody saw a bloody person and assumed a second gunman was loose. Providing accurate information to passengers and airport and airline staff members also proved challenging. Law enforcement typically can access wireless emergency alerts  —   the system that sends Amber Alerts  —   but alerts were not used to inform people that the danger had passed or instruct them on what to do next. Some airports have internal communication systems for employees to send important messages. It is unknown whether this was in place at the Fort Lauderdale airport. Instead, news, accurate and otherwise, traveled through word of mouth or was gleaned from cellphones. “Airports can put out messages to employees, and that is important because passengers will tend to follow directions from uniformed employees in the know,” said Douglas Mansel, the aviation security manager at Oakland International Airport in Oakland, Calif. All airports have emergency plans approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, including for   scenarios. The Fort Lauderdale airport’s director, Mark E. Gale, was not available to comment on airport protocols or on how events unfolded on Friday. Sheriff Israel said that communication proved tricky. With so many people spread out across different areas, including on the tarmac and in garages, it was hard to get information out. “I tried to tell as many people verbally,” he said. “Communication is critical, but there is no way to communicate to thousands. ” Anne Buongiorno, 56, who was visiting from Canada, had to evacuate Terminal 2 twice. The first time, after the shooting, she and her    daughter jumped under a seat, their hands over their heads. Her husband was in the bathroom. Terrified, they followed a surge of people down a staircase, but people were shoving one another. She fell down and broke her rib. She and her daughter ended up on the tarmac and were told to lie on the ground near a luggage truck. A while later, they were told to go back inside. A similar scenario played out as the report spread of the possible second gunman. Ms. Buongiorno said she again wound up among thousands of people on the tarmac. Clusters of people ran back and forth, fleeing what they feared was a threat as the rumor took hold. Ms. Buongiorno hid behind a truck and waited nearly for five hours before being led to a hangar and later put on a bus for the cruise port. Nobody gave her information about where to go, so she used to iPad to find a hotel, got in a long line for a cab and went there. The next day, she was back at the airport waiting for word about how to get her belongings and fly back to Canada. “It was the first time in my life I was so afraid,” she said, her voice quavering at the memory. “I’m afraid still. When I heard somebody talk over there, I’m afraid. ” Others joined the long line of people who were told to walk out of the airport along a set of railroad tracks, which skirted a marshy area. A few who had tried to avoid the mayhem by jumping a fence were confronted by law enforcement officers with pointed guns. Those who had luggage dragged it along. Officers sometimes issued contradictory orders  —   people directed to one location were told by officers there to go back where they came from. Along the way, law enforcement personnel ordered people to raise their arms and sometimes frisked them as they filed by  —   a common precaution, security experts said, but one that alarmed some. “They were patting us down like there was another shooter,” said Melody Dorward, 22, of Ohio, who walked the railroad tracks. “I felt traumatized. Not safe. ”"

From the YouTube description:
Modern doomsayers have been predicting climate and environmental disaster since the 1960s. They continue to do so today. None of the apocalyptic predictions with due dates as of today have come true. What follows is a collection of notably wild predictions from notable people in government and science. 
More than merely spotlighting the failed predictions, this collection shows that the makers of failed apocalyptic predictions often are individuals holding respected positions in government and science. While such predictions have been and continue to be enthusiastically reported by a media eager for sensational headlines, the failures are typically not revisited.

"Wealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on. Now data  —   gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations  —   is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation. In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants. The European Commission and the British House of Lords both issued reports last year on digital “platform” companies that highlighted the essential role that data collection, analysis and distribution play in creating and shaping markets. And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development held a meeting in November to explore the subject, “Big Data: Bringing Competition Policy to the Digital Era. ” As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services. “You certainly don’t want to punish companies because of what they might do,” said Annabelle Gawer, a professor of the digital economy at the University of Surrey in England, who made a presentation at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meeting. “But you do need to be vigilant. It’s clear that enormous power is in the hands of a few companies. ” Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law, who also spoke at the gathering, said one danger was that consumers might be afforded less privacy than they would choose in a more competitive market. The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful “network effect” effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks. Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies. A prime example is Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn, the business social network, for $26. 2 billion last year. LinkedIn has about 467 million members, and it houses their profiles and maps their connections. Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will “power a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,” said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft. In an email to employees, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described the LinkedIn deal as a linchpin in the company’s   goal to “reinvent productivity and business processes” and to become the digital marketplace that defines “how people find jobs, build skills, sell, market and get work done. ” IBM has also bet heavily on data for its future. Its acquisitions have tended to be in specific industries, like its $2. 6 billion purchase last year of Truven Health, which has data on the cost and treatment of more than 200 million patients, or in specialized data sets useful across several industries, like its $2 billion acquisition of the digital assets of the Weather Company. IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world’s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM’s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors. “Our focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,” said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM’s Watson and cloud businesses. At Google, the company’s drive into   business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation. For example, a new Google business offering  —   still in the test, or alpha, stage  —   is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and résumés of more than 200 million people. Its   algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site. That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google’s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible  —   using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide   data services. “You can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,” Ms. Greene said.   Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google’s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to “democratize A. I.,” now that the software and data ingredients are ripe. “We wouldn’t have the current era of A. I. without the big data revolution,” Dr. Li said. “It’s the digital gold. ” In the A. I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research. Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. “Data is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,” Mr. Ng said."
"**From curries to roasts, cooks are using Facebook to sell hot dinners prepared in home kitchens. The BBC has found thousands of listings for ""homemade food"" but campaigners want this emerging market regulated and subject to council hygiene inspections.**
What are the benefits and downsides of competing with the takeaways from your own home?
For most parents with young children, the Sunday lie-in is a distant memory. Yet for Annise Middleton from Stoke-on-Trent, her alarm is set for 05:00 anyway.
She gets up to cook about 30 roast dinners, which she will then deliver in her car to customers who have placed their orders via social media, including Facebook Marketplace.
Ms Middleton used to work in community care but now runs her business - which is registered with her local council - from her kitchen at home.
She said: ""I'm a mum of four and I struggle with childcare, but hate being out of work, so I thought, what can I do from home?""
The 30-year-old said many of the people she visited in her previous job lived alone and were unable to cook because of age or disability.
""All we had time to do for them was a sandwich and they would have the same boring sandwich for lunch and dinner,"" she said.
""All they ever would say to me is how much they wanted some home-cooked food.""
Ms Middleton drives up to 12 miles from home to deliver Sunday roasts to her customers most weekends.
""I buy my food on a Saturday then I'm up at 05:00 prepping and cooking, then out for delivery between 12:00 and 15:00.""
She said it was ""pretty straightforward"" to register with her local council and believes her meals are ""a lot healthier"" than those from takeaways.
""At least, with my food, kids will be getting veggies they wouldn't get from a local kebab house,"" she said.
Ms Middleton is far from alone in taking food orders on social media.
BBC analysis found more than 3,000 listings across the UK on Facebook Marketplace for ""homemade food"" on one day.
Indian and Moroccan style food were the most common nationalities available to buy with words like ""fresh"", ""chicken"", ""samosas"", ""cake"" and ""curry"" appearing most.
Analysis by the BBC found 20 adverts on one day for either ""curry"" or ""biryani"" coming from Luton with another 14 from Blackburn and 13 from Birmingham.
There were also 25 adverts referring to meat, chicken, beef, lamb or fish under ""homemade food"" in London, 24 in Birmingham and 23 in Manchester.
Kebabs were most common in Lancashire, with 15 postings emanating from or near to Nelson and another three near Blackburn.
There were 10 adverts involving bread or cakes from Sheffield, along with five from Glasgow, while 10 from Slough referred to ""meat, beef or lamb"".
Nasrin Rehmanwala from Cheltenham said most of her food business began through ""word of mouth"" among her friends, before she branched out to social media.
She registered with her local council to sell homemade Indian food after saying she saw a lack of ""authentic"" restaurants in the country, and typically gets about six orders a week.
Focussing on a few dishes each week, she takes orders from Friday to Monday, with customers collecting the meals from her home.
""It isn't easy to sell on social media or any other platforms because [consumers] don't know the quality of food people will sell,"" she said.
""The only real bad experience I had online is one 'non-client' leaving a fake bad review. That was disappointing as my real customers have all left great reviews.""
Mrs Rehmanwala, 36, who also has a food hygiene certificate, said it was a very good idea for councils and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to regulate online food sales.
""It's really important that food is prepared properly, hygienically and in a clean environment and to enable customers to trust the business,"" she said.
Johelis Zambrano from Birmingham prefers to be hired by clients to cook homemade food in their kitchens, rather than her own.
The mother of two, originally from Venezuela, said: ""Then they can see what I'm doing and they can see what ingredients I'm using.""
Ms Zambrano, who has run restaurants in the past, said she liked this way of working because it was ""flexible"".
""I can do it any time I want, it's less pressure,"" she said.
She said because of the prevalence of allergies, it was important for homemade food sellers to be ""registered and insured"".
Campaign group Unchecked has called for home cooks who sell meals to be subject to the same inspections as takeaways and be given hygiene ratings.
It said unregistered food producers selling on social media posed a risk to health because of a lack of checks on hygiene standards.
""There is no requirement for sellers to register with their local authority, meaning that online food producers are operating completely under the radar,"" Emma Rose, from the group, said.
""Food containing undeclared allergens, unspecified meat, or dangerous food-related bugs could be being consumed by unwitting customers - and there is no way of tracking the extent to which this is happening.""
The FSA said running a food business does not require a qualification, but the person must demonstrate ""safe food handling and supply"".
""People operating food businesses must register those businesses with the local authority, ideally 28 days before the commencement of trade,"" a spokeswoman said.
However, small scale operations can take place without registration as long as supply is ""occasional"", the agency has said, and there is no ""clear cut"" definition of when a supplier should register.
The FSA said local authorities can take a range of actions against those who did not comply with food laws, from informal steps such as written warnings, to formal actions such as forcing sellers to close down and prosecution.
A Facebook spokesman said: ""Our commerce policies set out what can and cannot be sold on Facebook.
""These make clear that sellers are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations."""
" Contributed by Grégoire Canlorbe @2019Dr. Crockford’s blog: https://polarbearscience.com/about-2/ Susan Janet Crockford is a Canadian zoologist, author, and blogger specializing in Holocene mammals. From 2004 to 2019 she was an adjunct professor in Anthropology at the University of Victoria. She is best known for her blog posts on polar bear biology, which oppose the scientific consensus that polar bears are threatened by ongoing climate change. In October 2019 she was interviewed by Grégoire Canlorbe—on behalf of the Association des climato-réalistes, the only climate-realist organization in France.Susan J. Crockford: I live in Victoria, British Columbia, and I specialize in animals from the late Pleistocene, so probably the last fifteen to twenty thousand years. I have a contract company called Pacific Identifications Inc. We identify animal bones from archaeological projects and also from biological research: stomach contents, fecal samples, that kind of thing. That’s primarily how I get my income. And then, I am also a former adjunct professor at the university—I had held that position since 2004 but in 2019, it was not renewed. My primary interest—my overall interest—is evolution. That, for me, really informs everything. It’s the big picture. Evolution is the big idea that drives all my interest. For example, the interesting thing is that a deer bone from 8000 years ago looks like one living today, and so, there is continuity. But there are also distinctions—when you get species differences, those are apparent. I became interested in polar bears when I was working on the topic leading up to my PhD dissertation. I was looking at the speciation process that turns a wolf into a dog (what we also call domestication). While trying to unravel what biological process drives that transformation, the wild species that I looked at to compare it to was the brown bear to polar bear transformation. So, I’ve been looking at the literature on polar bears (their life history, their ecology, and the geological history of sea ice) since the 1990s. I’ve been investigating polar bears for quite a while.Grégoire Canlorbe: Your most decisive feat of arms in evolutionary biology may be your claim that thyroid rhythms alone are responsible for all significant differences in life history traits. Could you remind us of the outlines of your approach?Susan J. Crockford: I don’t actually claim that thyroid rhythms alone drive evolution, although I suspect it may be the dominant driver in many cases. What really drives evolution is individual variation. So, within a species, animals are all different in some critical ways. And the primary hypothesis that most biologists go by is that those individual differences are primarily genetic: that genes are what controls those critical differences, and, therefore, genes, or genetic change, is what drives speciation change in evolution. But my concept looks at the idea that because thyroid hormone is so important for so many different but inter-related biological processes—like fetal development, brain development, growth, behavior—those individual differences within a species also include thyroid hormone metabolism. All hormones are produced in a rhythmic fashion: they are released in pulses that differ in strength and frequency over the course of a day. It’s similar to a song for a particular bird species. They sing virtually the same song within a species, but if you look at that species’ song closely you find that each individual bird sings slightly differently. So, the hypothesis is that an individual within a species has an individual thyroid hormone rhythm that’s unique to that individual but overall typical for its species, and that this unique thyroid hormone rhythm strongly affects its behavior, particularly in growth and response to stress. A speciation event (one species transforming into another) often involves the colonization of a new habitat, a new ecological niche. When that happens, I propose that only animals with a particular stress response (governed by its unique thyroid hormone rhythm) choose to occupy that niche. So, if we’re talking about a polar bear transforming from a brown bear ancestor, I suggest that a few brown bears decided at some point during a major glacial period that life would be better for them if they moved out onto the sea ice where seals lived and gave birth to pups. They learned how to hunt seals, but only the individual animals who were extraordinarily curious and not fearful of the new habitat moved onto the sea ice. And when they started to interbreed amongst themselves on the ice, they quickly created a new subpopulation that was physiologically different from the others that stayed on land. Over time, within just a few generations, that would have created a new set of physiological differences within those ice-living bears that made them different from the original population. It’s a bit complicated to explain, but one of the things that thyroid hormone does is affect how genes function. So, what I’m proposing is that rather than only genetic changes and genes themselves driving evolution, that you can also have changes in these hormone rhythms that control how genes function. And that provides a mechanism for how evolution can proceed quickly, especially in response to changing climatic conditions. My book on this topic is called Rhythms of Life: Thyroid Hormone and the Origin of Species.Susan J. Crockford with Grégoire Canlorbe — Paris, October 2019Grégoire Canlorbe: As a well-known debunker of the spread of disinformation on polar bears, what are the main objective facts of which you would like to remind us? How do you explain this religious cult surrounding the theory of an anthropogenic global warming with catastrophic consequences for the planet?Susan J. Crockford: Around the year 2000, it seemed that the polar bear was elevated to a position as icon of global warming because the Arctic amplification effect proposed that the Arctic and the Antarctic would actually warm much faster than the rest of the world. And as a consequence, it was proposed that polar bears would be affected first and more strongly than any other animal. And it was proposed that polar bears would then be the canary in the coalmine for global warming, and that the inevitable catastrophe that would affect polar bears would eventually happen to us. And a few years after that, the biologists who were working on polar bears sort of took up that idea and formally proposed that it was very likely the polar bear populations would decline dramatically if the sea ice in summer declined dramatically. And when the summer ice dropped suddenly in 2007, it became more and more of a hysterical response. It is true that we’ve fallen into a trap, looking at some of these things in a very confined way to the extent that it begins to look like religious thinking, rather than scientific thinking. I think what was disturbing and unscientific was a desire to have a statement about consensus. And I saw this myself in evolutionary thinking because what happened at the time was that there were creationists who were fighting very hard, especially in the US, against evolutionary biologists. And so, to counter that difficulty, their strategy was to create a consensus statement: something like ‘this is what we believe about how evolution works’. And I felt at the time that was very wrong but shortly afterwards, the same thing happened with global warming: rather than deal with the legitimate questions and concerns that some scientists were raising, what they did to protect themselves was issue a consensus statement. And so, the consensus statement is what makes this look like religion. Science should thrive on challenges such as these, not hide from them.Grégoire Canlorbe: It has been hypothesized that the alleged decrease in the extent of pack ice, far from being detrimental to polar bears, is actually allowing for a warmer ocean—and therefore a more hospitable ecosystem for polar bears. Did your researches lead you to endorse that view?Susan J. Crockford: Yes, to a degree that’s true, especially for summer ice. What was proposed around 2005-2006 was that when summer sea ice declined, polar bear numbers would decline. That the bears required ice in summer in order for them to find food. And they then proposed that if it got to be so there was no ice in summer, the bears would be nearly extinct. However, I was immediately suspicious of that prediction because we know that the bears survived at least two or three warm interglacial periods that were warmer than today and that had little to no ice in the summer. We don’t know exactly how the bears responded to those conditions—whether the population may have declined by half or not—but enough survived to be an abundant species in the Arctic 200 years ago. But what has happened is that the ice declined in 2007 to a level that the sea ice experts said would not happen until 2050. So, the ice declined several decades before it was expected and has stayed down at that level ever since (with some wide swings year to year). Biologists have continued to collect data in the field, studying bears, and what they’ve discovered is that, in some areas, the bears are in better shape with less ice in summer than they were with more ice in summer. And they’re finding that the seals which the bears eat—ringed and bearded seals—actually do much better with less ice in summer because that’s when they do most of their feeding. Also when they’ve been doing surveys to count the bears in areas that either have had no counts before, or have only one that was done long ago, they’ve discovered that instead of declining in number, they have either remained stable or increased in abundance. So, the long and short of it is that the prediction that the bear numbers would decline by two thirds failed. Not only did the bears not decline, but the global population number rose by at least 16 percent, perhaps more. What I have done is look at the literature, and summarized the data to draw this conclusion. It means that polar bears have flexible strategies for dealing with less summer ice, which is what you would expect from a species that has survived previous warm periods.Polar bear — Zoo de la Flèche Grégoire Canlorbe: It seems that the colder winters encountered in Europe and Asia (with respect to those existing in Africa) have led natural selection to play in favor of high intelligence—and high K strategy—in Europeans and a fortiori East-Asians. Is such hypothesis plausible also in the case of polar bears and other artic species?Susan J. Crockford: This K selection theory is one of the hypotheses that has gotten polar bear biologists into trouble because it’s a notion that was proposed in the 50s and 60s that most modern biologists have dismissed as not being helpful. What it says is that the Arctic environment should be stable all the time. But what we actually know from geological and recent history is that it’s not stable: ice extent and thickness goes up and down in cyclical fashion. In fact, both the bears and the seals they depend on for food are actually adapted to a very dynamic, ever-changing system rather than a stable system. I think that this is really the critical driving force for their evolution: they need to be adaptable and flexible in the short term and the long term. Flexibility is what allows them to survive in the Arctic. I don’t think that really answers your question, but I really do think that what goes on in the Arctic is the opposite of K selection theory. The Arctic isn’t stable, it’s dynamic.Grégoire Canlorbe: You have studied at length the domestication and speciation processes. How do you sum up the evolutionary pressures which led the polar bear to emerge as a wild species, while dogs were designed as domestic animals? Do you think that those lovely companions have a soul like humans allegedly do?Susan J. Crockford: The domestication and speciation processes, I think, are essentially one and the same. We’re encouraged to think of domestication as something that humans did actively, that they actively participated in creating a new species that’s a dog, or a pig, or whatever. But my theory proposes that, in fact, what humans did was create a new habitat. The first human villages were habitats that hadn’t existed before, and that attracted some wolves to it that, then, ended up becoming dogs. But actually, humans probably couldn’t have stopped this from happening, even if they’d wanted to. In other words, the transformation of some wolves to dogs was a natural response from the animal community to the humans creating this new habitat. And so, then, when you look at brown bears to polar bears, it becomes the same system: some individuals from the brown bear species invading a new habitat for them, which was the sea ice habitat. And then, they emerged as a new species. There are other parallels. For example, brown bears and polar bears can breed together, the same as dogs and wolves can. Genetically, they’re very close. And also, in terms of behavior between the two, polar bears are less dominant than brown bears. So, if brown bears and polar bears come together in the wild—there are a few places where this can happen, such as the north slope of Alaska at one of the piles of whale bones that have been left behind by hunters—when this happens you see that small grizzly bear (aka brown bear) females chase away big male polar bears. Her behavior is much more ferocious, and the big male is afraid of her. The same with a wolf and a dog. A wolf’s behavior is much more aggressive than a dog’s so a small female wolf easily intimidates a big male dog. Now, you wanted to know about dogs having a soul comparable to humans. And I think that’s something people have imagined because they would like it to be true. Dogs have had to adapt their social structure in order to fit in with human life and some of what we see is part of that adaptation. And that, over the last 200 years, that’s become increasingly the case. For example, urban dogs are much more dependent on people than they ever were, say, 100 years ago. Modern urban dogs are much more dependent on people than modern dogs that live on farms. In short, I don’t think that dogs have a soul. I don’t even think people have a soul.French TV show Bonne nuit les petits [Good night children]Dr. Crockford was special guest speaker at Friends of Science Society’s “Polar Bears and Solar Flares” event in 2017.

"**Greggs the bakers is taking on Cornwall's world-famous pasty-makers with a new store in the heartland of the renowned local delicacy.**
The chain had a previous branch in Saltash, but it closed in September after failing to convince locals and crack the coveted Cornish pasty market.
Greggs, which has 2,050 stores, said it would open on an industrial estate in Launceston, and is recruiting staff.
Some locals say they will boycott it, although the council is supporting it.
It will be located on the Pennygillam Estate, on the outskirts of the town, close to the exit to and from the A30 - Cornwall's major road.
The company confirmed it was opening the store, but did not comment on the challenges of succeeding in Cornwall.
Julie Jasper, who manages the Rocks Locks shop, a Launceston locksmiths that also sells pasties, said: ""I think local people love their local pasties and support their local businesses.
""I haven't personally ever tasted a Greggs pasty - I wouldn't know what they are. I wouldn't go there. Absolutely not. I support local because I'm Cornish and I wouldn't eat anything like that.""
Source: Cornish Pasty Association
Head of Planning at Launceston Town Council, Councillor Rob Tremain, said: ""It will be good for those working on the estate and will hopefully bring a little employment. It is a first for Launceston and a first for Cornwall.""
He said he was not aware of anybody being concerned about the branch opening, and nobody had commented on Cornwall Council planning website.
The new store will be next door to an established local butchers' shop, Philip Warren's, that also sells pasties.
Ian Warren, from the father and son business, said he was in favour of competition but accepted it could affect his business at busy times.
He said: ""Us Cornish are very tribal and we tend to stick together, so I would never envisage them setting the world alight down here.""
Kim Conchie, of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said he welcomed fresh investment and job opportunities.
But he said: ""Our love for the pasty above all other snacks in Cornwall has meant that previous incoming businesses have not had the success here that their business model projects from other parts of UK."""
"Why Vote?
In a long life of observing and participating in many election campaigns, I have never before seen anything approaching the ferocity and stupidity of the “war on carbon”. Are we fighting –

“Carbon” which is the essential element at the centre of every molecule of life on earth?… OR
“Carbon Dioxide” which is the natural atmospheric gas-of-life that feeds all plants?… OR
“Carbon Fuels” such as oil, gas and coal which are natural hydrocarbons which store ancient solar and hydro-thermal energy and which provide most of the electrical and motive power that supports and feeds every society on Earth?
The Answer? Judging from their statements and sloppy language, the alarmists and green zealots are fighting all three. They aim to make “carbon” a dirty word and to deny all humanity the great benefits of hydro-carbon energy.

Like all futile wars, this one will eventually collapse. But it has already done tremendous damage to the global economy and financial stability.
Ominously, Malcolm Turnbull signed Australia onto the Paris Climate Agreement. This appalling document should be forever draped around his neck like a dead albatross. We need our own CLEXIT – climate exit from the climate Czars of Europe. Julie Bishop and Greg Hunt supported him and were collaborators in wasting or committing over one billion dollars on climate nonsense. Please put these three and their supporters last in their electorates.

Most governments and politicians have no idea what would be required of them under this agreement, so Greenpeace recently commissioned a study into what would be needed to achieve the Paris targets.
Read the whole sad story here: http://www.thegwpf.com/the-energy-absurdity-of-the-paris-climate-agreement/
“According to the calculations of study author Volker Quaschning of the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin (HTW), “the production of cars with gasoline and diesel engines has to end by 2025 and main roads will have to be fitted with overhead electrical lines for freight transportation.”
The study also finds that Germany’s Autobahn too will need to have overhead catenary akin to overhead railway lines because the entire bus and freight transport needs to be electrified within a short period of time.” –
Here is the future according to the Greens, the ALP and the Turnbull “Liberals”.

The Vested-Interest-Voting Bloc embraces Climate Alarmism
Democracies are at the point of no return.
There are too many “vested-interest-voters” who are totally or partially dependent on governments for controlling and/or funding their salaries, services, taxes, subsidies, allowances, medical care, research, education, news, retirement rules, pensions, urban transport, infrastructure and energy. There are many deserving recipients among these groups, but government has never been able to separate the needy from the greedy, and the system has become untenable.
This huge bloc (and near majority) of vested-interest-voters will always vote for “more free stuff”. Those supporting internationalism and socialism have been adroit at harvesting these votes.
The climate battle has been embraced by another powerful coalition of globalists and centralists who now see the chance to use natural climate and weather variability as evidence for the need for a suffocating world government. The hidden agenda is to deliver more power to unelected UN agencies. The tactics are to make developed countries destitute, dependent and obedient using carbon taxes; and to keep the failed states in perpetual green poverty – trading their liberty for “climate aid”.
The battle over the science of what controls Earth’s climate is being won. The alarmists produce no new evidence or theory to support their global warming doomsday story, but real evidence of Earth’s changeable past climate keeps getting unearthed.
It is now mainly a political battle. It is not about improving the science; it is about winning the battle for votes by scare campaigns and parroted slogans (every weather event is now “weird weather”, “wild weather” or yet another “super storm”).
The political climate battle is close to its climax so the alarmists are now desperately trying to establish a network of taxes, rules and regulations designed to bring quick bankruptcy to those in the hydro-carbon energy business and perpetual protection and subsidies to the green energy promoters.
But the rocks continue to release their records of past climate change and new flaws are discovered in the massive climate models and their failed predictions.
In short, the true climate science continues to show that change is normal and man has no control over it.
So please play a part in this great political battle at every opportunity.
Luckily, the political tide is on the turn and for once there are several candidates and parties offering sound climate policies. Please vote for them and deny your vote for their enemies.
How to Vote
The government has been frustrated because some small parties have managed to get a voice in the senate, so they changed the voting rules in an attempt to shut most small parties out, leaving the field to LNP, ALP and Greens.
But their rules may backfire if enough voters are clever enough to understand and use them or too stupid to understand how they work.
The main battle will be in the Senate, and it appears that minor parties will get significant support from people who can’t stand Greens, the ALP or the Turnbull Liberal faction.
The worst thing voters can do is put “1” in just one box for a micro-party. Unless that candidate or party is elected on the first count, that vote will “expire” leaving the field to the big boys. So number every box either above or below the line. Below the line go at least as far as the big party candidate you think is least worst – your vote will get there and probably be counted. 
Judged just on their climate policies, put all Greens last and all ALP second last, or if voting below the line in the senate, don’t vote for them at all.
Who are the Climate Smart Candidates?
All candidates and parties mentioned below are rated solely on their climate policies. Generally those with sense on climate are also sensible in other policies, but this is not guaranteed. It is a case of “Voter Beware”.
There are at least 8 individual candidates deserving full support, including (in alphabetical order):

David Archibald, ALA candidate for Curtin in WA
George Christensen, LNP Candidate for Dawson in Queensland
Bob Day, Family First Senator for SA
Mark Imisides, Senate Candidate WA,  Christian Democrats
Dr Dennis Jensen MP, Independent Candidate for Tangney
David Leyonhjelm, LDP Senator for NSW
John Madigan, Senator, Manufacturing and Farming Party
Malcolm Roberts, No 2 on Senate ticket for Pauline Hanson in Queensland

Of the parties whose written climate policies we have seen, the outstanding one is that of the Pauline Hanson’s One Nation. All of the other parties listed above also deserve support.
The following minor parties by word or deed have also shown better than average climate sense:

Citizens Electoral Council
Shooters Fishers and Farmers
Rise Up Australia
Australian Christians
DLP

And of course we must not forget Tony Abbott, who did axe the tax. Vote for him and his supporters.
Who should NOT get our Vote?
Put the Greens or their candidates last in every contest.
What about the ALP? This is what they say:  “The key to tackling climate change is to drastically increase our investment in renewable energies like solar. That is why we’ll commit to 50% renewable energy by 2030 because it will cut pollution, help create jobs of the future and lower energy prices.”
So put the ALP second last. The two “Independents” who allowed Julia Gillard to mis-rule should also go last in their electorates – Mr Tony Windsor and Mr Rob Oakeshott – put them last.
The following minor parties show no climate sense but are marginally better than the Greens. Do not give them help.

Nick Xenophon
Animal Justice Party

What about the LNP?
The Turnbull faction of the LNP should be denied all support.
The National Party faction is probably worth supporting after the sound parties and candidates listed above. Barnaby Joyce understands the climate issues, but is muzzled by coalition solidarity.

World Energy Consumption. By Con-struct – BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017, CC BY-SA 3.0, Link
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
According to Forbes, when renewable energy programmes like Germany’s Energiewende mature, demand for Russian fossil fuel will collapse.
Will Russia Survive The Coming Energy Transition?Jun 27, 2019, 10:35amAriel Cohen Contributor A new global energy reality is emerging. The era of the hydrocarbon – which propelled mankind through the second stage of the industrial revolution, beyond coal and into outer space – is drawing to a close. The stone age ended not because we ran out of stones. The same with oil and gas.We have now entered the era of the renewable energy resource, whereby zero-emission electricity is generated via near unlimited inputs (solar radiation, wind, tides, hydrogen, and eventually, deuterium). Cutting-edge, smart electric grids, utility-scale storage, and electric self-driving vehicles – powered by everything from lithium-ion batteries to hydrogen fuel cells – are critical elements of this historic energy transition.Each of these technological trends will displace demand for Russia’s primary source of budget revenues: fossil fuels.The transition will have major consequences for the status-quo leaders of the hydrocarbon age: from Moscow to Caracas, and from Teheran to Riyadh. The Russian Federation, which today is the world’s largest gas exporter and second most prolific oil producer, is one such player which must ‘adapt or die’ over the next 15-20 years. Indeed, Russia derives 40% of its revenue from oil and gas sales, making it a de-facto petro-state. It, and other hydrocarbon revenue dependent nations, must accept their new reality, and react decisively, if they hope to survive in the age of renewables.…Even Germany, which is on the receiving end of Russia’s controversial Nord Stream II gas mega-project, has already declared that the purchases of Russian gas will start declining after 10 year’s time per its national Energy Transformation agenda. The so-called Energiewende policy aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) some 40% by 2020, by 55% by 2030, and up to 95% in 2050, compared to 1990 levels. This does not jive with increased imports of Russian fossil fuels.…As we have already seen in Europe, hydrocarbon demand will be driven by declining renewable energy costs, government policies, new technologies, and companies’ shifts in strategies to prepare for the new energy age.  Structural changes in fossil fuel supply, demand, energy mix, and prices will follow accordingly.…Read more: https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2019/06/27/will-russia-survive-the-coming-energy-transition/
Back in the real world post nuclear Germany, home of Energiewende, is so desperate for real energy they are preparing to tear down ancient forests in Hambach to get at the coal beneath the trees, and are using hardline police tactics to clear protesters from domestic brown coal mine sites.
The German government can declare whatever it wants, greens can celebrate their fantasy 15 year transition plans, but in the real world people do not tolerate being cold in Winter. Fossil fuel demand is rising, and demand for coal is strong.

" Republished with permission of FCPP Original © Dec. 9, 2010LINK to original FCPP post: https://fcpp.org/2010/12/09/ezra-levant-lawyer-journalist-and-political-activist/As the Tar Sands Campaign has become newsworthy, a number of media commentators (Markham Hislop, Gary Mason, Rob Breckenridge) are suggesting that researcher Vivian Krause ( @FairQuestions ) is just a lone conspiracy theorist.  We just ran across this 2010 interview with Ezra Levant on the Tar Sands Campaign, originally published on the Frontier Centre for Public Policy blog. We appreciate their permission to reblog it here.Why do we care about these issues? Because the ‘climate change’ umbrella has been used to damage the Canadian economy, but the climate catastrophe claims are not supported by scientific evidence. However, ‘climate change’ is a convenient front for ‘any’ cause. Why not a Green Trade War against Canada?Ezra also talked with us about these Foreign Funded Lobbyists at our 2016 Annual Event – he says we should speak out against them. Listen – then read what he said in 2010.Ezra Levant: Speak out Against Paid LobbyistsInterview with Frontier Centre for Public PolicyFrontier Centre: What was the genesis of this book? [Ethical Oil] Was there an event or a point where suddenly it became clear that you had to write it?Ezra Levant: I was actually promoting my last book Shakedown which was about freedom of speech at the Ottawa Writers Festival last year and I was out there with some time to kill beforehand and they said there’s a fellow downstairs talking about the oil sands, you’re from Alberta that makes you as close to an expert as me go and make it a panel discussion. So I went downstairs and it was in this room that was adorned with all these big photos of the oil sands and open pit mines. I call it oil sands pornography. There were a hundred hostile people in the room and this anti-Alberta author and me. For the next 90 minutes I sort of got beat up about the oil sands and I didn’t really defend myself very well because frankly, I was arguing in a right-wing, conservative, property rights, climate skeptic way. After that experience I thought about it and those people in the room were not malicious or hostile they were actually the opposite. They were do-gooders. These were not Greenpeace fundraisers or lobbyists these were just concerned people.  (bold added)The problem was I wasn’t talking in a way that connected with them so I thought about and I decided I was going to write a liberal defense for the oil sands and that’s what I did.FC: What are the four liberal values you sought to appeal to in the book?EL: I think they’re genuine liberal values. They are not caricatures or straw men. They are environmental responsibility, peace, a fair wage for the working man and human rights. Those are four legitimate values that make up the liberal or progressive world view. Using those liberal yard sticks comparing the oil sands against every other oil exporter in the world I think you have to come to the conclusion that Canadian oil sands oil is the most ethical in the world.FC: Do you need to be a climate change skeptic to agree with this book?EL: Not at all. That’s what I mean about talking to Liberals on their own terms. I am a climate change skeptic, I’ve even written a whole book about it called Fight Kyoto, but you don’t need to be because oil sands oil has a lower carbon footprint per barrel than a lot of other oil that the U.S. imports from Venezuela and even American oil from California which is called California Heavy it’s so carbon intensive. The argument would be that we should replace higher carbon fuels in the states like Venezuela imports and California oil with lower carbon oil sands oil. So even a global warming worrier can agree with that.FC: Why do groups such as Greenpeace choose to target the oil sands in spite of the considerations you raise in your book?EL: I think there are three reasons that Greenpeace targets the oil sands. First of all, it’s safe. If you were to target the oil production in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, Sudan, Russia or Nigeria you would probably be killed. If you broke into a refinery there like they did in Canada you would be killed. That’s the first thing it’s safe and easy. The second is it makes a lot of money for them. Because the oil sands are open and transparent and you can look at them and people talk about them they are a great fundraising tool for Greenpeace. That leads to my third reason which is that they’re esthetically ugly. Those open pit mines, even though they’re only a fraction of the oil sands are developable using open pit mines, are ugly and so that is their chief political flaw is they’re not pretty to look at. I think the main reason is cowardice. Greenpeace won’t go after the badly behaved countries precisely because they’re badly behaved. They go after the world’s most gentle country precisely because we are gentle.FC: Can you see the taking of such an inconsistent position damaging Greenpeace in Canada or in the developing world?EL: Greenpeace doesn’t care about its reputation in the developing world. It’s really not active in the developing world. Measured by where they’re memberships and income comes from it is basically a European and North American company. I say company because it is a trans-national corporation based in Europe with annual revenues of about $250 million. If they don’t raise $1 million a day every weekday they are out of business. They are actively fundraising in China. That is the one third-world country where they are active in fundraising but in return they do not criticize the Chinese government. I don’t think Greenpeace cares about its reputation as much as it cares about its money.FC: What sort of reception have you had when taking the book on tour to universities over the past several months?EL: Professional activists will obviously never be persuaded no matter what the arguments are. I have debated no less than five different Greenpeace lobbyists and they refused to state obvious things such as the way we conduct our business in Canada is morally superior to Saudi Arabia. They won’t make that obvious concession even though they look ridiculous denying it because if they were to say Canadian oil is morally superior to Saudi oil certain things would flow from that like the fact that America should buy more oil sands oil and not Saudi oil and they don’t want to acknowledge that. With people who are not paid professionals I have had some luck. True Liberals if I appeal to their values honestly and hold them to their own standards a lot of them will come around. Even if they don’t become cheering champions of the oil sands they will at least moderate or modify their criticisms a bit.FC: How do you respond to the suggestion that you’re on the take from the oil industry?EL: I respond by telling them who actually is paying me for the book and it’s a literary publisher out of Toronto called McClelland and Stuart. They paid me a $40,000 advance for the book which was enough to keep me going as I wrote it and now I’m running royalties against that. I didn’t even talk to oil companies when I wrote the book. What would be the point? They haven’t been effective in making their own case. I did my own research for the book for example calculating the amount of blood per barrel in Sudanese oil. You’re not going to get that information out there you have to find it yourself. It’s funny because what I discovered along the way is that while I was working for my publisher and doing it as an independent journalist so many environmental journalists themselves are on the take. For example as I prove in the book Andrew Nikiforuk who is a journalist and an author himself actually took money from Greenpeace at the same time and didn’t disclose that when he presents himself as a journalist. I think I’m an anomaly in that I’m the only guy who wrote a book for its own sake. I’m not on the payroll of Greenpeace like Nikiforuk and others.FC: Why do you think the industry has been so ineffective at defending their own story?EL: I think for years they didn’t have to defend it because conventional oil and gas didn’t get a lot of protest. The oil sands are a fairly new phenomenon although they’ve been in experimental stages for decades it’s only been in the last five years that they’ve really been large and had large international attention. It’s a new thing being attacked and they are not used to it. I think that is hard for some oil companies to fight back hard because they have so many stakeholders and they have to moderate so they want to be the good cop but there is no bad cop in the industry. Buzz Hargrove was a champion for the auto sector and he’d take on anyone as tough as he could beat. There is no Buzz Hargrove in the oil industry you have a bunch of risk-averse CEOs with boards and risk management approach to things. Finally, the attacks on them are by extremely well-funded foreign lobbyists not just Greenpeace but groups like the U.S. Tides Foundation that have poured in $190 million in the last ten years of foreign money.FC: What’s their (The Tides Foundation) stake in this?EL: They are an ideologically driven group of people who are against capitalism, against energy development so they are driven by ideology. Groups like Greenpeace it’s one part ideology and one part fundraising.FC: Okay let’s switch over to another topic. What is the case for getting rid of Human Rights Commissions?EL: Human Rights Commissions serve no purpose. Real courts already handle wrongful dismissal matters, landlord and tenant matters. If you fire someone because they’re black, if you kick someone out of their apartment because they’re Aboriginal we already have real courts that will deal with that fairly and quickly so they’re redundant. What they do do is they go after fake crimes, hurt feelings, the counterfeit right not to be offended and they become this grievance industry that exists for its own sake. So not only do we not need them to do any good but they’re actually doing bad things that we should shut down.FC: Do you have any thoughts on the Saskatchewan government’s move to abolish the Human Rights Commission there?EL: I think it’s a good first step because it will get rid of that whole kangaroo court with all the bizarre processes. I’m still not happy that the laws exist even though they’re going to be implemented by real courts it’s an improvement but the Saskatchewan law contains a censorship provision. I don’t want even the finest judges in the land enforcing a censorship law. Yes it’s an improvement because some of the kangaroo court aspects are removed but I don’t want even the fairest court in the land empowered to be a censor. I don’t believe in censorship or the right not to be offended at all but it is a step forward and I congratulate Saskatchewan to be the first Canadian jurisdiction to take this stand.FC: Why is the Harper government going so slow on Human Rights Commission reform?EL: Because they’re afraid of being branded anti-human rights or anti-minority and that’s really the only strength the Human Rights Commissions has which is a lie they are not human rights commissions they’re actually human rights destroyers. They are destroying our freedom of speech which is a real human right. They’re destroying our freedom of religion and our property rights in the name of this counterfeit human right not to be offended. I think the conservative government with its minority position in Parliament is afraid that the opposition would brand them as anti-minority or anti-human rights. I think that’s a mistake. I think not only do the vast majority of minorities in Canada either don’t care about this law or oppose it but I think it would actually create a division in opposition benches. I think the Conservative party would be united for free speech and about half of Liberals would be united too, the true Liberals. It would create a problem for the opposition if anything. Where would Michael Ignatieff stand? Historically he’s been on the side of free speech so if anything I think it will be a great wedge issue for the Conservatives to use against the Liberals. It would also give the Conservatives bona fidance with groups that traditionally don’t support them like artistic groups, editorial boards, people who love free speech would congratulate the Conservatives which they don’t usually do.—-Related:Climate Catastrophe Leadership – Friends of Science Society 16th Annual Eventhttps://youtu.be/oOQ6s6uu3O4Please read our reports showing the incredible financial and political influence of ‘Big Green’ in Canada.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/07/environmental-charities-a-compilation-of-reports-on-their-finances-power-and-implications-for-canada/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
" By Michelle Stirling © 2019In an April 18, 2019, op-ed in the Globe and Mail, David Anderson invites us to enter his time machine and return to the 1970 and 80s.  Is he still driving a Mercury Cougar? Pontiac Firebird? Chevy Suburban? No?  Curiously his column suggests that tanker traffic is stuck in this era. Regarding the West Coast tanker ban legislation (Bill C-48), the only thing people keep coming up with as a reason to ban tankers is the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989.Things change.  Thirty years ago, the Exxon Valdez was a single-hulled tanker with an inexperienced, exhausted hand at the wheel, the captain below deck, and a broken collision avoidance radar system. The rest is a tragic and messy history.But it is history.Now thirty years later, we have double-hulled tankers, so that if the outside hull is punctured, the inside hull remains intact. Tug boats guide tankers in and out of harbor.  We have GPS and much better mapping of ocean floors and far more accurate weather prediction.And we have excellent spill response materials, teams, and more in-depth scientific knowledge of how to address ocean oil spills than we had 30 years ago. Globally, oil spills have been reduced to a minimum, as reported by the non-profit International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF). Sadly, the facts don’t get the same play as the anti-oil hype in Canada.Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior to that, has written several useful reports filled with facts.  And you know, Facts Matter!Here are some relevant excerpts from his work:Oil transported as cargo in Canadian waters annually totals 192 million tonnes (MT) to the Atlantic coast, 67 MT to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 24 MT to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway and 6MT to the Pacific coast. So, only 2% of the oil shipped as cargo in Canadian waters goes to the Pacific coast. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/29/two-coasts-two-solitudes/The largest oil spill off Canada’s coast was in 1970. The M/V Arrow spilled over 10,000 tonnes off the coast of Nova Scotia, before the era when tankers were required to be double-hulled. The west coast’s largest spill was 240 tonnes caused by the sinking of the M/V The Queen of the North in 2006; that was a fuel oil spill. The largest west coast spill was thus 2.4% of the largest east coast spill. Over the last decade, marine oil spills in Canada have been so small that they are measured not in tonnes or in barrels, but in litres.The standard for response capability related to a potential marine oil spill is 10,000 tonnes across Canada. Why 10,000 tonnes? Because that is equivalent to the largest oil spill in Canadian history, which occurred about 50 years ago. No spill in the last 40 years comes anywhere close to that total, and the Canadian and international requirement of double-hulled tankers makes it extremely unlikely that it will ever happen again. Yet, the environmentalists on the west coast whine constantly that the response standard is not high enough.In its submission to the Tanker Safety Expert Panel (TSEP) in 2013, the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation provided information on several topics, including the present capacity of its equipment to deal with west coast spills. It stated that, even though the standard is 10,000 tonnes, it has a present capacity (i.e. in 2013) of about 26,000 tonnes and is continuing to grow! This is an extremely important counterpoint to the claims of the B.C government, only discovered if one trolls the depths of technical detail. So, the present private sector capacity for dealing with an oil spill off the west coast is two and a half times higher than anywhere else in Canada, and that does not even count the resources of the Canadian Coast Guard, which is the main federal government response organization. No one ever raises this in response to the B.C. government’s claims because it is never publicized. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/18/spilling-best-kept-secrets-on-the-west-coast/With so much evidence publicly available as outlined in Lyman’s reports, why is Mr. Anderson still promoting a ban? It would seem technology and legislation has made tanker traffic very safe from spills, world-wide.Friends of Science Society’s report “Manufacturing a Climate Crisis” documents how environmental law charity, West Coast Environmental Law (WCEL), was funded by a foreign partner of the Tar Sands Campaign to push for the tanker ban legislation.Anderson’s commentary claims that the 2014 drop in investment was solely due to oil price decline. This is untrue. There was a concerted effort by major foreign-funded ENGOs, including Greenpeace, to drive investors out of the Canadian oil sands, as documented in our report.  In 2014, Greenpeace sent an intimidation letter to global  corporate executives of various oil, gas and coal companies, threatening CEOs and board directors with jail for alleged climate crimes. We wrote a rebuttal and sent it to those same corporations and individuals and issued this press release.  BankTrack, a group of some 40 ENGOs out of The Netherlands, has been harassing banks and investors for about a decade to drive them off investing or financing oil, natural gas or coal projects. They particularly hate the Alberta oil sands.Contrary to Anderson’s claim that only the oil price drop has driven the exodus of investors from Canadian oil, WCEL reportedly (from their own documents) went to Kinder Morgan’s AGM in Texas and scared the pants off them over Trans Mountain pipeline expansion with threats of law suits.  What exactly they said is not clear, but it certainly created reluctance.And as Houston energy investment banker noted in its April 2018 “Musings,” just weeks before Kinder Morgan shut down work on Trans Mountain, Canada became seen as a territory that is ‘hostile’ to investment. This is certainly reflected in recent Alberta government statistics.Source: https://economicdashboard.alberta.ca/InvestmentContrary to Anderson’s assertions, both Bill C-48 tanker ban, and the hopelessly subjective Bill C-69, are the products of endlessly lobbying by a hoard of ENGO lobbyists in Ottawa.Robert Lyman explains the problematic issues of NEB reform, the result of which is Bill C-69.Clearly this tanker ban, the on-going foreign-funded pipeline “Blockadia” and foreign-funded international smear campaign against the Alberta oil sands are not based on facts or logic at all.Facts matter and so does living in the present. Because it’s 2019.Canada’s economy and our attractiveness to investment is being destroyed by foreign-funded activists.  Canada is a competitor in the OILympics. We just need market access to win. Stop Bill C-48 and Bill C-69.Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society.

Guest essay by Larry Hamlin
California announced an agreement with a group of automakers which claims to reduce future tailpipe emissions by increasing the mileage performance more than provisions proposed by the Trump Administration as reported in a recent L. A. Times article:

“The agreement between the California Air Resources Board and the automakers — Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW — covers about 30% of new cars and SUVs sold in the United States. It presents a direct challenge to the Trump administration’s plans, expected to be formally announced later this summer, to roll back tougher tailpipe pollution standards put in place under President Obama.”
“The deal is a voluntary one, under which the companies are committing to produce a fleet of cars nationwide that would meet California’s higher standards, regardless of what the federal government does. The state would not have the legal authority to enforce that.
But the agreement marks a major strategic victory for California in its fight with the administration over tailpipe pollution and efforts to combat climate change because it splits the auto industry coalition that had begged for relief from fuel economy standards in the early days of the Trump administration.”
The U.S. EPA disputes the value of this announced agreement noting:
“But the Environmental Protection Agency, which has spent more than a year working on new, more lenient standards with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, dismissed the agreement.
“This voluntary framework is a PR stunt that does nothing to further the one national standard that will provide certainty and relief for American consumers,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement.”
The agreement relaxes mileage provisions established during the Obama Administration.
“Instead of producing cars that have to reach a minimum of about 50 mpg by 2025 — as the Obama-era standards called for — car manufacturers would have until 2026.”
The reaction from the environmental community was mixed:
“Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said that “in the face of a total abdication of duties by the Trump administration, today’s announcement is a positive step forward.”
But Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign and the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety, said the agreement would result in less than half of the greenhouse gas reductions automakers had agreed to under Obama.”
As the headline of the Times article suggests (spurning Trump) the article dealt more with the papers political battle with President Trump than it did addressing the complicated and highly circuitous requirements of the agreement.
The California automakers agreements regulatory provisions complexity and nuances were addressed more fully in an Orange County Register article as follows:

“California is holding up the whole world with a demand for an increase in gas mileage of 10 miles per gallon.”
“While some reports have made it sound as if four automakers have sided with human survival while the rest favor total extinction, the actual dispute is less dramatic. California is demanding a fleet average mileage standard of almost 50 miles per gallon and the Trump administration wants to keep the current standard of almost 40 miles per gallon.”
“That agreement called for fleet average mileage to increase to above 50 miles per gallon by 2025, but the Trump administration proposed freezing the mileage requirement at the 2020 level of 37 miles per gallon.
This is the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standard that has been part of U.S. law since 1975, when it was believed that there was a shortage of oil and only conservation would save humanity from extinction. Decades later, when it turned out that there actually was no oil shortage, the federal government switched to a new rationale for federal regulation of vehicle mileage. Now it’s climate change, and once again, only conservation will save humanity from extinction.”
But the provisions of the California agreement are far from straight forward regarding whether the 50 mile per gallon standard would actually be attained because of an array of “credits” and “advanced technology multipliers” that reduce the mileage target. The article notes:
“California’s deal with Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW includes an expansion of “off-cycle credits” for installing non-engine technologies to improve mileage, such as more efficient air conditioners. Some environmentalists think these credits are “a bunch of loopholes,” in the words of Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign. He said California’s agreement with automakers is “probably less than half of the emissions reduction that they committed to” during the Obama administration.”
“The Detroit Free Press reported that the California deal with Honda, Ford, Volkswagen and BMW requires a 3.7% annual increase in the “stringency” of greenhouse gas standards, but allows 1% to be achieved using “advanced technology multiplier credits.”
“Here’s how the newspaper described that part of the deal:
“Appropriate flexibilities to promote zero-emission technology: Continue current advanced technology multipliers that now expire after model year 2021, extending them through model year 2024 at the current 2.0x for Battery Electric and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (BEV/FCEV), and 1.6x for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), tapering off at the current model year 2020 and 2021 levels in model years 2025 and 2026, respectively.”
This crazy and arbitrary complexity is a form of government force, and not only against auto manufacturers. In an earnings call with investors on July 25, Edison International President and CEO Pedro Pizarro said the company is awaiting regulatory approval of its “Charge Ready 2 electric vehicle charging infrastructure program,” which is another way of saying ratepayers are about to get “charged” on their utility bills to support the state’s goal of more electric vehicles on the road.
The calculations and manipulations that go into the enforcement of greenhouse gas emission and mileage standards fill thousands of pages of regulations that are wildly distorting the business decisions of an important industry that employs a lot of people in the United States.
The Trump administration wants a 50-state mileage standard that stays the same after 2020. That’s not unreasonable and it shouldn’t be portrayed as the path to human extinction.”
The article concludes with the following caution regarding the climate alarmist propaganda hyped California automaker agreement:
“If California and the Trump administration can’t reach an agreement on standards, the matter will end up in court and it could be years before automakers have any kind of certainty about how to comply with regulations that affect critical and long-range business decisions.
All the more reason that Californians should look closely at state regulations instead of just assuming that the government knows what it’s doing.”
California government, political and regulatory leaders are falling all over themselves congratulating each other on having negotiated an agreement that has higher increased mileage levels than those proposed by the Trump Administration – with the difference being perhaps 10 miles per gallon by year 2026 for those automakers involved.
These leaders along with the usual climate alarmist propaganda media have hyped this automaker agreement as being required because of its importance in “fighting climate change.” This claim is of course totally wrong and complete rubbish because the world’s developing nations dominate both global energy and emissions outcomes.

By year 2026 EIA forecasts that the developing nations will have increased their CO2 emissions by over 2.2 billion metric tons from present 2018 levels. The CO2 emission reductions nationwide from California’s auto agreement will amount to only about 1% of the worlds developing nations CO2 increase during that period.
This outcome demonstrates that the proposed California automakers deal has no ability to arrest the unrelenting upward climb of global CO2 emissions by the developing nations.
California’s automakers agreement has no role in “fighting climate change.” Claims otherwise are just climate alarmist propaganda political drivel.
The huge global paradigm shift that has occurred with the emergence of the world’s developing nations dominating the planets energy and emissions outcomes establishes that developed nations proposals mandating costly and unnecessary energy and emission schemes because of hyped propaganda claims of “fighting climate change” are invalid and complete bunk.
California’s government media hyped automakers agreement clearly falls in that bunk category.

"CHICAGO  —   The police here were questioning four people on Wednesday as video circulated online showing a white teenager tied up and beaten as a group of young   shouted antiwhite messages and insulted   Donald J. Trump. “It’s sickening,” Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the Chicago Police Department said. “It makes you wonder, what would make individuals treat somebody like that?” The police said the victim was an    man from suburban Chicago who had “mental health challenges” and who had been reported missing. Officers spotted him on Tuesday in a violent neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side and recognized that he was in distress, the police said. They sought treatment for him at a hospital and connected the beating to four people who were taken into custody later that day near where the bloodied man had been found. A roughly   video clip shared widely online appeared to show a Facebook livestream of the assault. A group can be seen taunting and physically assaulting a man amid cursing and laughing. Much of the video focuses on one woman as she rambles, at times incoherently. The video begins with a shot of that woman before turning to the victim, who is seated in the corner of a room with his mouth covered. The woman laughs as two men cut the sleeve of the victim’s shirt. One of the men yells epithets about Mr. Trump and “white people. ” Later, a man cuts a patch of hair from the victim’s head, appearing to draw blood in the process. Mr. Johnson said criminal charges against the suspects, two men and two women, could be announced on Thursday. Investigators said they were not yet sure of a motive, but could pursue hate crime and kidnapping charges if the evidence warranted. The victim knew one of his attackers, the police said, and had been taken from the suburbs to the city and held for some time before the beating was streamed online. “Images in the video put on display the brazenness of the offenders who assaulted the victim and then broadcast it for the entire world to see,” Mr. Johnson said. The victim, whom the police did not name, was hospitalized for undisclosed injuries, but had been released by Wednesday evening and was speaking with investigators. The police said he was “traumatized” and initially had trouble communicating with detectives. The video’s spread online comes at a time of relentless violence in Chicago. In a Twitter post this week, Mr. Trump cited Chicago’s 762 murders last year and suggested that the city should seek federal help if local efforts to control the violence continued to be ineffective. Superintendent Johnson declined to speculate on whether the  ’s Twitter message and the videotaped beating were connected."

Guest Essay by Kip Hansen
 
Reading widely across the literature of many scientific fields broadens one’s view of the rate of scientific progress — both our increased knowledge and our “steps backwards”.  A recent piece in Nature Ecology & Evolution  represents both:  one of these advances and one of these “steps backwards”.
The article is a Brief Communication titled “Moth biomass increases and decreases over 50 years in Britain” by Callum J. Macgregor, Jonathan H. Williams, James R. Bell and Chris D. Thomas.   (a full .pdf is available via SciHub with doi: 10.1038/s41559-019-1028-6).  Here’s the abstract:
“Steep insect biomass declines (‘insectageddon’) have been widely reported, despite a lack of continuously collected biomass data from replicated long-term monitoring sites. Such severe declines are not supported by the world’s longest running insect population database: annual moth biomass estimates from British fixed monitoring sites revealed increasing biomass between 1967 and 1982, followed by gradual decline from 1982 to 2017, with a 2.2-fold net gain in mean biomass between the first (1967–1976) and last decades (2008–2017) of monitoring. High between-year variability and multi-year periodicity in biomass emphasize the need for long-term data to detect trends and identify their causes robustly.”
In surprisingly straightforward (and diplomatic) language, the authors start out with a clear explanation of the scientific problem:
Insufficient Comparable and Consistently Collected Long-term Data
  “Reports of declining insect biomass give credence to the notion that insects are at the forefront of a ‘sixth mass extinction’. However, some reports have received criticisms for poorly justified conclusions, potential biases and extrapolating beyond the data. Regional abundance and distribution declines have taken place in many individual species but populations of other species are stable or increasing, leaving uncertainty over the consequences for biomass change and associated ecosystem processes. Nearly all existing estimates of biomass change lack continuous, systematically controlled monitoring or sufficient survey sites. Hence, analyses of continuously collected data from multiple sites and environments are necessary to establish the robustness of the conclusion that insect biomass is declining.”  [footnote numbers removed — see original for these references — kh]
 
There is a Press Release related to the article here.
The authors point out:  “Contrary to previous reports of insect biomass change, moth biomass increased before it declined and remains higher than in the late 1960s (Fig. 1).”
[click image or here for larger version]
There are several interesting things to notice in the graphs presented in Figure 1  but first and foremost, in my mind, is that in panel “a” we see that Total Moth Biomass varies on an annual basis as much as three orders of magnitude — from a low of 1,000 mg up to 1,000,000 mgs.  The Supplemental Information shows the mean varying from 8,000 mgs to 80,000 mgs.  That’s a lot of variation.
[This should not be a surprise to anyone familiar with Population Dynamics.   Even in very simple populations, one sees oscillations and deterministic chaos.]
The author’s main points are obvious in this one four-panel figure:  1)  Total moth biomass rose from the mid-1960s to about 1980.  2)  from 1980 to 2017, there is a declining trend, but totals remain above 1960s levels.  3)  There are “winners and losers” — Panel “b” —  the moth family Erebidae has been steadily increasing across the entire time period whereas Geometridae and Noctuidae show the rise-then-decline pattern.   and 3)  The changes do not seem to be due to land use changes, as the pattern is similar across all four land use categories —  arable land, woodland, urban and grassland.
This data supports their conclusions that “analyses of continuously collected data from multiple sites and environments are necessary to establish the robustness of the conclusion that insect biomass is declining”  and that “Such severe declines [“insectageddon”] are not supported by the world’s longest running insect population database”.    This paper represents a step forward in its own field, and points to other papers that, through their failures, have represented a step backwards.
Even more impressive is the amount of detailed Supplemental Information that is attached at the end of the full .pdf file for this study [use the doi and SciHub to obtain a copy].  There are charts by land use, charts of periodicities in the data and many more.
Callum J. Macgregor, Jonathan H. Williams, James R. Bell and Chris D. Thomas, our authors, are to be congratulated for their extremely well-done paper which is complete, transparent and supplies all the data (or links thereto).
This is Real Science.
And “Insectageddon” ?  — probably not.
# # # # #
I encourage readers to obtain a full copy of the .pdf  of this paper, for an entirely different reason.
At the end of the paper, after all the author’s work and supplemental information, there is a two-page section headed Reporting Summary:

The very existence of this section represents the hope and future of Science and of Science Journals.  The topics covered in the Reporting Summary include:
Statistics:
In this case that the authors followed all the statistical guidelines that applied to their study.
Data:
“Data collection:  No software was used in the data collection process (data were obtained from Rothamsted Research and other sources as described in the Methods section). Identical datasets can be obtained from these sources on request.”
Software and code:
“Data analysis:  All analyses were conducted in open-source software, R version 3.6.1, as stated in the manuscript. All R scripts, from initial processing of datasets to final analyses, are archived online at Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3356841).”
Field-specific reporting:
The authors report their study to be in “Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences”
Ecological, Evolutionary & environmental sciences study design:
In this section, the authors report their study design in detail:

[click image or here for larger version]
While these NatureResearch steps may not be everything that John P.A. Ioannidis and  others who are striving to reform research standards towards replicability and full-disclosure science reporting would demand, it is a beautiful thing to see.  Imagine if every published Climate Science paper came with a required, field-appropriate section like the above.  Or for that matter, if all science used by the E.P.A., the C.D.C. or the F.D.A. was published to these standards for explicit declaration of study design and  full data and code availability.
I had not realized that the Nature group had advanced so quickly, and admirably, on this topic.  They have my congratulations and thanks.  
# # # # #
  Author’s Comment:
 On a personal note, I have been away sailing, serving  under my youngest son, now a Captain and Master in his own right — from the mid-Hudson Valley of New York (on the Hudson River) to Elizabeth City, N.C.   Wonderful trip with three young men, all ranked as Captains.   
Insects are a “subject of interest” for me — and I have hundreds of pictures of different “shield spider” species that live in the Dominican Republic — thus my first interest in the paper highlighted above.
In the end though, I found the NatureResearch’s Reporting Summary more significant.
Glad to read your comments on either topic.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\---   
  
In our post last week titled “Climate Alarmism: When is this Bozo Going Down?” we described how new research increasingly casts doubt on the validity of climate models and their projections of future climate change. It is increasing clear that climate models simply predict too much warming from human greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
But the scientific community, or at least that part of it which makes its living off climate alarm, is slow to accept this.   
  
Who can blame these folks? More money flows from the government into universities (or government labs) to study the effects of climate change if we all agree that human greenhouse gas emissions are leading to climate change of a dangerous magnitude.   
  
So it is left to the emeritus or retired profs to lay bare the truth.   
  
A fine example of this can be found in a recent article in the _New York Times’_ DotEarth blog run by ex- _Times_ science reporter Andy Revkin. In his story looking into the implications of new scientific findings concerning the potential impacts of ocean circulation variability on our understanding of the behavior the global average surface history (parts of which we described in our last post), Revkin interviewed four prominent climate researchers. The level of confidence that each showed in the mainstream (climate model-driven) global warming meme (despite this new research suggesting that something may be rotten in the state of Denmark) appears proportional to how much professional advancement still lies ahead.



Josh Willis’ (a young scientist from the government’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) views on climate change seemed unshaken by the new research:   




In regards to your question, if you mean how robust is the “slowdown” in global surface warming, the answer is it just probably just barely statistically significant. If you are wondering whether is it meaningful in terms of the public discourse about climate change, I would say the answer is no. The basic story of human caused global warming and its coming impacts is still the same: humans are causing it and the future will bring higher sea levels and warmer temperatures, the only questions are: how much and how fast?





Andrew Dessler, a mid-career professor at Texas A&M, appeared pretty much equally unmoved:   




Second, I think it’s important to put the hiatus in context. This is not an existential threat to the mainstream theory of climate. We are not going to find out that, lo and behold, carbon dioxide is not a greenhouse gas and is not causing warming. Rather, I expect that the hiatus will help us understand how ocean variability interacts with the long-term warming that humans are causing. In a few years, as we get to understand this more, skeptics will move on (just like they dropped arguments about the hockey stick and about the surface station record) to their next reason not to believe climate science.



John Michael Wallace, a late-career professor at the University of Washington who recently became emeritus, expressed much more interest in the idea that the new research could lower confidence in just how much human greenhouse gases were impacting climate change:   




…It seemed to me that the hiatus in the warming, which by then was approaching ten years in length, should not be dismissed as a statistical fluke. It was as legitimate a part of the record as the rapid rises in global-mean temperature in the 1980s and 1990s…   
  
The new paper by Tung and Chen goes much farther than we did in making the case that Atlantic multidecadal variability needs to be considered in the attribution of climate change. I’m glad to see that it is attracting attention in the scientific community, along with recent papers of Kosaka et al. and Meehl et al. emphasizing the role of ENSO-like variability. I hope this will lead to a broader discussion about the contribution of natural variability to local climate trends and to the statistics of extreme events.



And finally Carl Wunsch, late-career professor emeritus at M.I.T. was pretty frank about the new research and the state of climate science:   




The central problem of climate science is to ask what you do and say when your data are, by almost any standard, inadequate? If I spend three years analyzing my data, and the only defensible inference is that “the data are inadequate to answer the question,” how do you publish? How do you get your grant renewed? A common answer is to distort the calculation of the uncertainty, or ignore it all together, and proclaim an exciting story that _the New York Times_ will pick up.





We couldn’t have said that better ourselves!

His full biography is here. This commentary responds to the recent comments by Trudeau, Scheer and prominent journalists about how and whether we will attain the 2030 target, all of whom treat it as if it were cast in stone.  The Paris Agreement targets are not legally binding, not sacrosanct and not realistic.Elizabeth May – whose party claims to have a “Mission Possible” plan, demanded even more stringent targets: One of the topical political debates in Canada today is whether Canada will meet its “target” of reducing greenhouse gas emissions set prior to the December 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The target is to reduce emissions by 2030 to 30 per cent below national emissions in 2005; in other words, to reduce them from 716 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017 to 512 Mt in 2030. Confusion abounds about what this target means. First, it is not a legal requirement. The Paris Agreement placed no legal requirement on any country to actually reduce emissions, only to submit plans about how they would reduce emissions according to nationally-determined priorities. There is no penalty for non-compliance. The total emissions reductions that would result from the plans countries submitted in 2015 would not reduce global emissions enough to attain the United Nations aspirational goal of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In fact, if one accepts the UN’s analysis, the commitments in the existing plans from take the world about one one-thousandth of the way to that objective. The prospect of missing the target is not unusual. Canada previously set emissions reduction targets in 1992 and 1997 (the Kyoto Accord) and missed them by a wide margin. In 2012, Canada committed to reduce emissions by 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020; there is no way that target can now be met. We are in good company in this regard. Only a handful of European countries have ever met past emission reduction targets. Of the top ten largest emitters in the world today, none of them are on track to meet their 2030 emissions reduction targets. If truth be known, no one really ever expects the targets to be met. In management terms, a company may set targets as a way of providing a standard against which to measure progress towards its long-term business objectives. Business targets must be realistic and achievable. No one expects emission reduction targets to be achieved. They serve political, not operational, objectives. For the governments that set them, they serve as ways to rally their supporters to a cause and, more often, to cope with the incessant pressure they get from environmental activists to “set an example”. For the activists, they serve as the measuring sticks by which they can hold politicians’ feet to the fire, bitterly criticizing them when they (inevitably) fail to meet the objectives. It gives the environmentalists’ objectives the moral high ground in any internal country debates about the tradeoffs between economic and environmental objectives. So, let’s stop treating Canada’s 2030 target as though it were sacrosanct, and start talking realistically about whether it can and should be met. In fact, it won’t, for three reasons. First, as acknowledged by the Parliamentary Budget Office in its recent report on this subject, the Canadian economy and population are likely to grow between now and 2030. The PBO’s assumption, drawn from external analysis, is that Canada’s GDP will grow by 26 per cent and its population by 16 per cent between 2016 and 2030. Under normal conditions, GHG emissions would also grow significantly, as energy use and emissions historically have been closely tied to national income. There are two possible reasons why emissions might not grow in our case. One is that we might achieve a remarkable improvement in energy efficiency and emissions intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) as a result of technology, policies and programs. The other is through a deep and prolonged recession.See Robert Lyman’s latest on the PBO report:  “The Stakes Are Too High To Be Tricked By The Numbers” Second, because we would have to make great efforts just to avoid emissions increasing in a growing economy, we are unlikely to make the kinds of emissions reductions required to go from 715 Mt to 512 Mt in 13 years. Contrary to the perceptions of many, emissions reductions of this magnitude cannot be achieved by installing more efficient light bulbs, driving less with more fuel-efficient cars, or turning down the thermostat in winter. It would take severe cuts to our economy. Eliminating every single car, SUV and pickup truck would only reduce emissions by 85 Mt; it would not take us even half-way to the 2030 target. We would also have to cut a substantial portion of our heavy industry both in resources and manufacturing, spend hundreds of billions of dollars on public transit and new electricity generation and transmission (with corresponding increases in consumer costs), and accept restrictions on personal choices unparalleled except in wartime. Almost half of Canada’s emissions arise from activities in Alberta and Saskatchewan; large emissions reduction would significantly punish those provinces by curtailing their most important industries. Third, because the economic costs are so high, the political costs would be unacceptable. According to recent polls, more than half the people in Alberta and Saskatchewan already favour secession from Canada because of federal government-imposed policies. Even if the average Canadian consumer accepted without complaint thousands of dollars per year in higher fuel costs for vehicle use, home heating and electricity usage, there would be an inevitable backlash when severe restrictions are placed on a wide range of energy uses, especially when it becomes every year more obvious that global emissions are growing regardless of anything Canadians do. Canada’s political system and constitutional makeup, with the provinces owning and controlling resources within their boundaries, empowers the regions to strongly defend their interests, and they would certainly do so. The 2030 target was set without due regard for what attaining it would cost Canadians. It deserves to be missed. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"**It will be a Mother's Day like no other on Sunday, as scores of people self-isolate and are forced to rethink plans with loved ones. With the usual lunches and afternoon teas cancelled, what can people do instead to celebrate?**
â¨â¨Affi Parvizi-Wayne lives just three doors down from her 74-year-old mother, Afsar, in north London. Like millions of others, they won't be able to have the family lunch they planned for this weekend.
For them, Mother's Day is usually a triple celebration because it coincides with Afsar's birthday and Persian New Year.
""To suddenly be told the only interaction is through the window is tough for my mum,"" says Affi, a social entrepreneur with two children.
Instead, she says her family plan to congregate on the pavement outside Afsar's house and sing happy birthday. ""My nieces are going to release some balloons"".
Afsar has four children and six grandchildren, and is usually the person who brings everyone together.
This year, she is going to cook the family a traditional Persian dish of green herby rice and fish, and leave it on her doorstep to be collected. The two households will set up screens by their dining tables and have a virtual meal together.
An added bonus is it also means family members in Iran can be present too. ""This Sunday will be about keeping the spirits up,"" Affi says.
Elsewhere in London, it will be chicken legs from the freezer for Ros Ball and her family, who are self-isolating after one of them showed coronavirus symptoms. Ros's mum Penny, 73, is also staying indoors in Bedfordshire.
But they plan to sit down to eat together over FaceTime. Ros's children aged, 9 and 12, will then play some online games and quizzes with their granny.
Others are still planning to share a meal in a more conventional way.
Becky Greenwell and her sister have moved back in with their parents, in Woking, to be with them during the coronavirus outbreak. They've had to cancel plans to celebrate Mother's Day with a Sunday roast in a pub.
But it means they'll be able to sit round the dinner table together.
""We are planning on cooking my mum a three-course meal based on her favourite foods and printing out a special menu, like we used to when we were kids,"" she says.
Meanwhile, Savannah Dawsey-Hewitt, from Harpenden, in Hertfordshire, says she has baked her mum some ginger, turmeric and banana muffins, topped with brazil nuts.
All the ingredients were chosen for their immune-boosting properties.
According to current guidelines there is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 is passed through packages or food, if cooking is what you plan to do.
But the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends following good hygiene practices when handling and preparing food, such as washing hands, cooking meat thoroughly and avoiding potential cross-contamination between cooked and uncooked foods.
For other it will be about dealing with self-isolation.
Rob Bacon's mum Vicky, 75, will receive a bumper pack of her favourite magazines, sweet treats and crucially wine, for Mother's Day this year, to help see her through.
Members of the newly-established family Whatsapp group - called The Bacons - also plan to set-up chairs a safe distance from Vicky and her husband Roy's front door, bringing their own food and drink.
""We will all wrap up warm and talk,"" says Rob, who works in public health for local government.
Marie Phillips' mum, Janet, is a nurse. They can't be together either on Mother's Day so she has posted her a grow your own vegetable kit to her keen gardener mother.
""We've all got to find distractions and try to put our energy into something positive,"" says Marie.
Planting seeds and waiting for vegetables to grow or flowers to bloom can be a hopeful reminder of better seasons to come.
For some people, even delivering a card or present won't be an option.
Consuelo Martin, in Birmingham, is in self-isolation and plans to send her mum a virtual card, together with a subscription to an online streaming service and Spotify.
""My mum is on her own and I'm worried she is going to get bored in self-isolation. I wanted to make sure she has music and films and television at her fingertips.""
For others technology could be the solution.
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 this week, Dr Sarah Jarvis said cancelling celebratory lunches and big gatherings would be the most loving and responsible thing for people with elderly mothers to do.
Instead, she suggests investing in a mobile phone or tablet and setting up so elderly relatives with Skype or FaceTime.
Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK agrees. ""We need to think creatively about how to stay in contact with older friends and relatives to keep morale up.""
She suggests considering using video technology that is integrated on smartphones, tablets and laptops.
She says those are often be the most straightforward and easy to use, and to remember that older people may also prefer to use equipment like a mouse rather than a touch screen.
""It might turn out that some of these options remain a good way to maintain regular contact and nip loneliness in the bud in the long-term."""
"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Approximately 300 United States Marines will return this spring to help fight a resurgent Taliban in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, the site of a yearslong bloody campaign, American officials in Afghanistan said on Saturday. An American military spokesman in Kabul said the Marines would replace an Army unit stationed in Helmand, and would offer training and advice to members of the Afghan military and the national police. “The Marine rotation is to replace soldiers currently here conducting the train, advise and assist mission,” said Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, a spokesman for United States forces in Afghanistan. “We’re very pleased that the Marines will rotate in, as they have tremendous institutional history in the region. ” The Marines were last in Helmand, a hotbed of Taliban fighters and poppy cultivation, in October 2014. Since then, Afghan forces, suffering from leadership woes and plagued by corruption, have struggled to hold territory, with district after district falling to the Taliban. For months now, the insurgents have been at the gates of the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. The Afghan military welcomed the news of the Marines’ return. “We have been asking our foreign counterparts in security meetings to increase the level of their troops in Helmand Province to help us on the battlefields,” said Shakil Ahmad, an Afghan Army spokesman. Mr. Ahmad said the security situation in region was rapidly deteriorating. The Taliban appeared unfazed by the news of the Marines’ return. “Our mujahedeen continued their progress in the presence of tens of thousands of Americans and other invading forces,” said Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman. “A few hundred other soldiers won’t become an obstacle on the way of our progress. ” Fewer than 8, 400 American troops are currently in Afghanistan, deployed either through NATO to train Afghan forces or as part of a smaller American counterterrorism mission. President Obama declared the United States combat mission in Afghanistan over in December 2014. But in the past year, as violence has spread across the country, the line for the American military between consulting and fighting has increasingly blurred. At the peak of a troop surge in 2011, there were about 20, 000 Marines fighting across Helmand alongside thousands of British soldiers. Western troops fought the Taliban village to village, and tried to win civilians’ hearts and minds by doling out cash for bridges and roads. The Taliban recently told Lashkar Gah residents to store food items, warning that they would once again cut off Helmand’s main highway to the regional economic hub, Kandahar Province. Unlike in the past, fighting between government troops and the Taliban has not diminished with the coming of this year’s winter. Many fear that when fighting intensifies in the spring, the Taliban will be starting from a position of strength around several provincial capitals. Ensuring that Afghan leaders take advantage of the winter to improve leadership and root out corruption will be critical to how they tackle Taliban pressure in the spring, American officials said."
"**French police violently dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in the heart of Paris overnight, clashing with migrants and activists.**
Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin tweeted that some of the scenes were ""shocking"", and ordered the police to provide a full report on their actions.
Dozens of small tents were removed from Place de la RÃ©publique, with occupants sometimes being tipped out by police.
The homeless migrants say they are forced to live on the streets.
Volunteers had joined the migrants and, linking arms, the crowd - several hundred strong - chanted ""papers for all, accommodation for all!"" when police moved in.
Police later used tear gas and chased people through the streets, using batons to hit some of them.
The violence came ahead of a vote in the French parliament on Tuesday on a controversial security bill, which opponents say could undermine the media's ability to scrutinise police behaviour.
France has seen large demonstrations this year against police brutality and alleged racism.
Article 24 of the bill makes it a criminal offence to post images of police or soldiers on social media which are deemed to target them as individuals.
The new makeshift camp in the centre of the capital appeared a week after police had dismantled a bigger, illegal migrant campsite near the French national sports stadium in northern Paris.
""They are too violent,"" lamented Shahbuddin, a 34-year-old Afghan, quoted by AFP news agency. ""We just want a roof.""
Ian Brossart, a Paris city hall official overseeing housing, condemned the ""law and order response to a social situation"".
President Emmanuel Macron has adopted a tough policy towards irregular migrants, many of whom see their final destination as the UK, via Calais.
The far-right National Rally led by Marine Le Pen still poses a big threat to him politically.
The huge surge in migration to Europe via the Mediterranean in 2015, fuelled by the Syrian civil war and other conflicts, has declined, but many asylum seekers still live in precarious conditions in the continent, homeless and unemployed.
The French government argues that the new security bill does not jeopardise the rights of the media and ordinary citizens to report police abuses.
But in the face of criticism the government added an amendment, specifying that Article 24 ""will only target the dissemination of images clearly aimed at harming a police officer's or soldier's physical or psychological integrity"".
People found guilty could be punished by a year in prison or a fine of up to â¬45,000 (Â£40,000).
French human rights ombudsman Claire HÃ©don is among the bill's critics: she called Article 24 ""disproportionate"" and warned that police use of drones for surveillance of demonstrators, granted by another clause, would be ""especially intrusive"".
Anne-Sophie SimpÃ¨re of Amnesty International called it ""a freedom-killing law that would threaten freedom of expression, the right to demonstrate and the right to privacy"", France 24 news website reported."

Buy offsets!COP 25 A MADRID, PROCHAINE ETAPE DU TOURISME CLIMATIQUEAfter its cancellation in Chile following the current turmoil in this country, COP 25, the annual high mass on climate, will be held in Madrid from 2 December. As every year, it will bring together tens of thousands of participants, most of whom are transported, housed and fed at taxpayers’ expense.The 25 th “United Nations Conference on Climate Change” is a further step towards the objective longstanding but increasingly affirmed UN: impose a world government term.A key instrument in this agenda, the climate debate has for a considerablenumber of years, left the scientific field for the ideological, political andfinancial fields. He has become the object of all excesses and amalgam,imposing a single point of view on the question, and muzzling all contestationor draft debate. It justifies a profound change in the industrial andeconomic policy of the so-called developed countries, in practice only Europeancountries, pending the return of the US from the outset of Trump. Some ofthe leaders of countries receiving compensation for so-called climatedisruptions – including China and India – are likely to be confirmed by agenerous distribution of funds supplied by taxpayers from so-called“rich” countries.All circles interested in climate issues will be present,First of all, part of the scientific world. Today it is necessaryto involve anthropogenic global warming, even anecdotally, in any study to seethe financial windfall of subsidies. In just a few years, the annualglobal budget for climate science has grown from $ 170 million to severalbillion dollars.The political world has found in the subject a good way to collectvotes, and today everyone wants to look greener than green. Theimplementation of such a policy also allows the creation of a growing multitudeof so-called “ecological” taxes and constraints, affirmed ordisguised, benefiting in addition to the unexpected approval of a part of thepopulation that we have persuaded that by this means, we will save the planet.The industrial world is engulfed in the juicy new market, by thepremature marketing of so-called “renewable” energies such as wind orphotovoltaic. This placing on the market was facilitated by incentives,bonuses, green certificates, network improvements and various tax refundssupported by all taxpayers, financial incentives also essential to impose theemergence of electric vehicles. This is the triumph of what is called“connivance capitalism”. The financial world also benefits greatly from the system put in place,through investments in companies, banks or so-called “ecological andresponsible” funds.Let us not forget also a constellation of NGOs engaged ineco-responsible citizen actions; and, of course, the powerful ideologicaland political lobbies who are obsessed with the unconditional support of allfor their own purposes.“Emerging” countries, meanwhile, are impatientto see the annual sum of $ 100 billion promised to them at the Copenhagenconference. A commitment that they intend to remind us imperiously on thisoccasion.This convergence of interests has taken on such a global dimension that anybacktracking has become extremely difficult, because it would put into play thevery credibility of the main pillars of our societies: the political, thehumanitarian and the industrialist.And recently, the religious world joined the movement bythe voice of the Pope. (3)As every year, I come out this ticket barely cleanedaccording to the new COP 25 …The aim each time affirmed is to impose imperative restrictive norms on(mainly European) states which would still doubt the existence of a climaticthermostat, with the help of which the man would regulate at will the globaltemperature. All this is supported by more and more apocalyptic mediainterventions as the opening date approaches. In fact, almost every day,we are bathed in catastrophic climatic or environmental events, immediatelycataloged as consequences of global warming. Currently, we have Californiafires, and any new disaster within days of the opening of the conference wouldbe welcome.Because it will be, no doubt, our new last chance to “save theplanet”. (1)All this beautiful world prefers to hide a fact now established: globalwarming has slowed considerably, if not capped for a long time since 1998,while human emissions of CO2 would cease, it is said, to increase, denying allclimate models who did not foresee this embarrassing phenomenon, among otherrealities just as disconcerting and just as unnoticed elsewhere.In the note below, Viv Forbes is concerned that Australia alone has sent ateam of 114 people – including his Prime Minister – to the CopenhagenConference. What about the Belgians, whose delegation in Copenhagen had120 people, in Cancun, 108 participants, the other conferences to match.A sumptuous “Magical Climatic Tour” !The Rio +20 conference in 2012 alone brought together 50,000 participants,including more than 100 heads of state. In Marrakech for COP 22 in 2016,30,000 participants were expected. At COP 23 in Bonn, there were plethoricAfrican delegations; Côte d’Ivoire alone had 492 participants. In Madrid,25,000 participants are expected, but we bet they will be more numerous …In recent years in the world, millions of people have died in armedconflicts, others in famines or lack of clean water, and even in our countriescitizens are dying of cold because they can not afford to heat or even shelter,while millions of people are parceled in refugee camps, or have taken thedangerous path of a Europe which counts the tenths of degrees which, it seems,threaten the existence even of its populations.Nobody died because of global warming. An overall warming of 0.4 to0.7 ° C depending on the sources -sept tenths of a degree- throughout thetwentieth century, remember.So, where are the priorities, and is it wise that taxpayers continue todirectly or indirectly fund the annual stays of our (ir) leaders in moretourist than scientific stays, so that they show their presence in cyclicalconclaves which also lead to so many failures? It would also be fun tocalculate the “ecological footprint” of these gigantic conventionsdesigned to reboost climate catastrophism.For what were the consequences on the climate of theprevious 24 climate conferences?But the vast majority of my readers are aware of what has just beensaid. And that’s the problem: we go around in circles in a smallcircle of convinced . And yet, each of us can extend the debateby intervening in the comments of the media, in social networks, within hisprivate or professional circle etc …Challenging the conclusions of climate conferences, combating“one-size-fits-all thinking” and restoring an exchange of ideas onthese issues that engage the future of our society is paramount and concernsall of us.Here are the significant parts of the ticket published by Viv Forbes in2014 in the WUWT site of Anthony Watts (2) (home translation)Jo Moreau.Twenty-two years ago, a group of green activists calling themselves“The Earth Summit” gathered in Rio and invented a way to visit theworld at the expense of taxpayers: to initiate endless conferences on alarmsthreatening the environment.(…) But they discovered the juiciest of the veins with their creationcalled “Global Warming”, and its sub-branches “ClimateChange” and “Extreme Weather Phenomena”.These “noble causes” have generated a profusion of steeringcommittees, reference committees, policy committees, scientific subgroups,working committees, evaluators and leading agencies, and have generatedmeetings with 20,000 participants. countries in places such as Rio, Berlin,Geneva, Kyoto, Buenos Aires, Bonn, The Hague, Marrakech, New Delhi, Milan,Montreal, Nairobi, Bali, Poznan, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Qatar, Doha,Warsaw, Stockholm , Lima, Abu Dhabi and New York.The Climate

The BBC reports:
Chile has pulled out of hosting two major international summits, including a UN climate change conference, as anti-government protests continue.
President Sebastián Piñera said the decision had caused him “pain” but his government needed “to prioritise re-establishing public order”.
The COP25 climate summit was scheduled for 2 to 13 December, while the Apec trade forum was next month.
The UN said it was now looking at alternative venues.
World leaders were to gather at this year’s Conference of the Parties (COP) to discuss the implementation of the Paris Accord – a landmark international climate agreement, first signed at COP21 in December 2015.
The COP25 is turning in to a geopolitical game of hot potato:
COP25 was originally supposed to be hosted by Brazil.
But in November last year, just two months after being announced as the summit’s host nation, then President-elect Jair Bolsonaro pulled out.
The far-right leader said this was due to the change of government and budget restrictions, according to local media. However, he had recently chosen a foreign minister who claimed “climate alarmism” was just a plot by “cultural Marxists”.
A month later, Chile was selected to host the climate conference instead. Costa Rica, the other frontrunner, withdrew because of the costs involved in hosting.
Of course their “Science editor” weighs in:
This is a huge blow to hopes of progress on what many see as the crisis of climate change.
Just as the science becomes more robust about rising carbon levels driving up temperatures and triggering a range of dangerous impacts, diplomats and experts have been looking to the COP25 talks in December as a vital staging-post on the way to global action.
And of course this article foreshadows an upcoming article (here) about how people cannot adapt to an incremental change in circumstance over an 80 period, whether or not that change is exagerrated.
And as the news was announced, a US-based organisation also separately revealed that millions more people than previously thought were at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea-level rise within the next century.

Other data shows the USA wasn’t even close to a record.
By Anthony Watts
In a report generating substantial media attention this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) claimed January 2020 was the hottest January on record. In reality, the claim relies on substantial speculation, dubious reporting methods, and a large, very suspicious, extremely warm reported heat patch covering most of Russia.
The January 2020 Climate Assessment Report, released by NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), was accompanied by a map showing a giant red menace of extraordinary asserted warmth extending from the Russian border with Poland well into Siberia. Yet, the asserted hot spot appears nowhere else.

Figure 1: Map of temperature departure provided by NOAA/NCEII. Note the huge red spot over Russia.
Meanwhile, in the United States, Alaska was abnormally cold, and the contiguous United States wasn’t even close to a record.
While the media attempt to spin the NOAA announcement as more “proof” of a climate crisis, there are a few things to consider. First and foremost, January is the coldest month of the year for much of the Northern Hemisphere. You likely won’t find many people complaining that a particular January was warmer than usual. This is especially the case in Russia and Siberia.
January in Moscow is typically the coldest month of the year. Daytime high temperatures average 20°F, with average lows of 9°F. In Siberia, it is even worse. The Siberian city of Oymyakon, Russia, reached 88°F below zero (-66.67°C) in January 2018. The big red Russian “hot spot” in NOAA’s January temperature map simply shows Russia remained very, very cold, but not as excruciatingly cold as usual.
Yet, the Russian temperature data was the primary driver behind the asserted global January temperature record. This begs the question, why would Russia – and Russia alone – have such an unusual, giant red spot of unusual warmth compared to the rest of the world? Is Russia trying to influence and interfere with global climate data along with American elections?
Hardly, and the answer may be very simple and have little to do with climate change. In 2008, I identified a possible source for similarly odd reported warmth during the preceding Russian winter: Russian central-heating steam pipes.
Now before you say, “How could that possibly affect global temperature?” let’s take a closer look.

Figure 2: Steam generation plant and steam distribution pipes for central heating in the Russian village of Oymyakon Image credit: Amos Chapple via Radio Free Europe
In most of Russia, and especially in Siberia, a central power plant pipes steam via overhead pipes within towns and villages. The steam goes to radiators in homes to provide warmth during the brutally cold winters. The waste heat from these heating systems is dispersed throughout the town. Official temperatures are also measured in these same towns, meaning that waste heat raises the reported temperature above what it would normally be.
When you have much of the Russian nation using this inefficient central heating scheme, dumping huge amount of waste heat into the local atmosphere, you end up with a nationwide temperature anomaly – which might well explain the great temperature “red spot” over Russia and Siberia that appears almost every winter.
A similar effect happens in Barrow, Alaska, a town that is dependent on heating to survive the winter, just like towns in northern Russia. Science has found that Barrow has become its own Urban Heat Island (UHI) during winter. In a peer-reviewed study published in the International Journal of Climatology, “The Urban Heat Island in Winter at Barrow, Alaska,” researchers found Barrow’s urban heat island to create local temperatures an average of 3.96°F warmer that would otherwise be the case. Notably, this artificial heat signal was largest during the winter, when the indoor heating requirements for the town were greatest to compensate the cold, outside air. 
It appears that the “warmest ever” January might simply have been influenced by Russian temperature data warmed up by waste heat. Maybe the U.S. House of Representatives will start an inquiry into Russian collusion to interfere with global temperature data and climate change legislation – but don’t hold your breath.

"WASHINGTON  —   In a vivid illustration of the tensions between the United States and Iran, an American Navy warship fired warning shots at Iranian boats that were racing toward it near the Strait of Hormuz, Defense Department officials said on Monday. The episode occurred Sunday when four Iranian fast boats came within 900 yards of the U. S. S. Mahan, a guided missile destroyer that was escorting an amphibious warship with 1, 000 Marines on board and a Navy oiler. When the Iranian boats did not respond to a radio call and flares signaling them to stop, the American destroyer fired three warning shots with a .  machine gun. A Navy helicopter also dropped smoke grenades. There was no damage to the Iranian vessels, and they did not return fire. It was the first time the Navy had fired warning shots at an Iranian boat since Aug. 24. Though the boats’ approaches are essentially a form of harassment, they point to the risk of military confrontation in a region that is bristling with Western, Arab and Iranian forces.   Donald J. Trump vowed during the presidential campaign to take military action against Iranian ships that approached American vessels in a threatening manner. “With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in September. There were 35 close encounters between American and Iranian vessels in 2016, most of which occurred during the first half of the year, and 23 encounters in 2015. “We had a significant number of these before,” Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters. “They had largely stopped. ” The most serious episode took place in January 2016, when Iran detained and ultimately freed 10 sailors who had unintentionally entered its territorial waters while cruising from Kuwait to Bahrain. On Sunday, Iranian boats approached the American ships six times before they got so close that the Mahan fired warning shots. “This was an unsafe and unprofessional interaction, and that is due to the fact that they were approaching at a high level of speed, with weapons manned, and disregarding repeated warnings,” Captain Davis said. There was no immediate comment from the Iranian authorities. But the Iranian military has signaled its intention to be active in the area and is planning a war game in the region this month. “The navy will practice    tactics during the drill, including modern warfare tactics, for the first time,” Habibollah Sayyari, the Iranian Navy commander, said, according to Iranian news organizations."

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   




Case and point. Last week, we had an article published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal _Nature Climate Change_ that showed how the impacts of extreme heat are often overplayed while the impacts of adaptation to the heat are underplayed. And a new paper has just been published in the journal _Environmental Health Perspectives_ that finds that the risk of dying from heat waves in the U.S. has been on the decline for the past several decades.   
  
By now, this should be rather unsurprising as it has been demonstrated over and over again. Not only in the U.S. but in Europe (and yes, Stockholm) and other major global cities as well.   
  
The idea that human-caused global warming is going to increase heat-related mortality is simply outdated and _wrong_. In fact, the opposite is more likely the case—that is, a warming climate will _decrease_ the population’s sensitivity to heat events as it induces adaptation. We described it this way in our _Nature Climate Change_ piece:   




Some portion of this response [the decline in the risk of dying from heat waves] probably reflects the temporal increase in the frequency of extreme-heat events, an increase that elevates public consciousness and spurs adaptive response. In this manner, climate change itself leads to adaptation.   
  
…Our analysis highlights one of the many often overlooked intricacies of the human response to climate change.



But this information often falls on deaf ears—especially those ears responsible for developing the NCA.   
  
Here is what the Executive Summary of the draft version had to say about heat-related mortality:   




Climate change will influence human health in many ways; some existing health threats will intensify, and new health threats will emerge. Some of the key drivers of health impacts include: increasingly frequent and intense extreme heat, which causes heat-related illnesses and deaths and over time, worsens drought and wildfire risks, and intensifies air pollution.



The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency takes the same outlook (of course since it is based heavily on the National Climate Assessment). The EPA leaned heavily on heat-related mortality as one the “threats” to public health and welfare in its justification for pursuing greenhouse gas emissions restrictions. From the EPA’s Technical Support Document for its greenhouse gas “Endangerment Finding”:   




**Severe heat waves are projected to intensify in magnitude and duration over the portions of the United States where these events already occur** , with potential increases in mortality and morbidity, especially among the elderly, young, and frail. [emphasis in original]



Now compare the Administration’s take with the latest findings on the trend in heat-related mortality across the United States as published by a research team led by Harvard School of Public Health’s Jennifer Bobb. Bobb and colleagues found that the risk of dying from excessive heat events was declining across the U.S. And further, that most of the overall decline was coming from declines in the sensitivity to extreme heat shown by the elderly population (75 and older). In fact, the Bobb team found that the risk in the older population has dropped so far that it is now indistinguishable from the risk to the younger populations. Adaptation is a beautiful thing!   
  
From Bobb et al.:   




While heat-related mortality risk for the ≥75 age group was greater than for the <65 group at the beginning of the study period, by 2005 they had converged to similar levels.



In other words, all the EPA’s talk about an increasing threat from heat waves and a growing elderly population combining to negatively impact the public health and welfare has been wrong up to now and almost assuredly will be so into the future as we continually look for ways to avoid dying avoidable deaths (e.g., those from heat waves).   
  
Bobb and colleagues summarize this way:   




This study provides strong evidence that acute (e.g., same-day) heat-related mortality risk has declined over time in the US, even in more recent years. This evidence complements findings from US studies using earlier data from the 1960s through mid-1990s on community-specific mortality rates (Davis et al. 2003a; Davis et al. 2003b), as well as European studies that found temporal declines in heat-related mortality risk (Carson et al. 2006; Donaldson et al. 2003; Kysely and Plavcova 2011; Schifano et al. 2012), and supports the hypothesis that the population is continually adapting to heat.



As a note, we (Knappenberger and Michaels) were co-authors on the two Davis et al. studies cited in the above paragraph. Our work, first published more than a decade ago, was some of the first research into the declining trends in heat-related mortality across the U.S.   
  
Clearly we have been saying all this stuff for a long time and even more clearly, the federal government hasn’t been listening for a long time. It is _not_ what they want to hear.

" by Robert Lyman and Michelle Stirling ©2019On March 18, 2019, in Yahoo Finance, Ryan Vanzo filed a report claiming Exxon’s production target costs meant Canadian oil sands stock were ‘dead’.  However, his article was filled with flaws about global oil markets, supply and demand, according to Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior. Lyman notes that Vanzo reported one significant fact, which is that Exxon Mobil has set a goal (not yet attained) of reducing crude oil production costs in the Permian Basin to U.S. $15 per barrel. The Permian Basin is the area that has most benefited from the application of fracking technology, and has caused total U.S. oil production to double from 8 million barrels per day in 2010 to 16 million barrels per day in 2018. The International Energy Agency projects U.S. crude oil production to continue growing by 3.7 million barrels per day to 2023. This is undoubtedly a major addition to world oil supply, and has made it possible to satisfy the continuing steady growth in global oil demand which reached al all-time high of 100 million barrels per day in 2018. Lyman goes on to explain that Vanzo then leaps to a completely unjustified conclusion about the economic viability of Canadian oil sands production. The best way to view the world’s oil production is as coming from hundreds of different sources that vary in quality and cost, which the most important differences being between heavy and light crudes and conventional and non-conventional (i.e. tight oil, oil sands, and offshore production) crudes. These can be portrayed by a rising cost curve, or more accurately a series of cost curves for crudes of different quality. There have always been crudes that have a low cost of production and those with a high cost of production, with the marketability of the higher cost sources depending on demand trends. The Permian Basin oil is light crude, which competes with light crudes from all other places, but notably the Middle East. Oil sands crude is mostly heavy crude that competes with heavy crudes from many other sources, notably Venezuela. In other words, most Canadian oil sands crude does not compete with U.S. light crude oil produced from the Permian Basin. It competes with all the other sources of crude oil production in the world in meeting a seemingly voracious demand still growing at the rate of over 1.2 million barrels per day. Various parties are publishing stories in the media which appear to be throwing up a lot of diversionary reports these days the objective of which seem to be to suggest that it is not the present federal and Alberta government policies on carbon taxes, pipeline regulation, and climate that are impeding oil sands development. This, it seems, is both self-justification and an attempt to influence the the forthcoming Alberta provincial election, and perhaps the Canadian federal election. Neither investors nor Albertan nor Canadian voters should be fooled. Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society points out that, furthermore, investors and members of the public should be aware of the concerted anti-fossil fuel and Tar Sands Campaign waged by foreign green billionaires, with the objective of pushing global cap and trade, a price on carbon and their vested interest in renewables.  The vast scope of this campaign was reported on by Matthew Nisbet in 2018 in a peer-reviewed study, a summary of which is here.  This multi-million dollar, decade-long green trade war waged particularly against the Alberta oil sands in Canada, has shaken investor, insurer and bank confidence, primarily due to unrelenting attacks on the oil sands waged by green-billionaire-bankrolled environmental groups (aka “Tar Sands Campaign”). Part of this campaign appears to include that of the CDP and their damning Nov. 2016 report “In the Pipeline” which scared off some of the climate and carbon-risk obsessed institutional investors who are signatory to the UNPRI. So if you are an oil sands stock owner, says Stirling, if you are going to think twice, perhaps you should be thinking twice about who is behind the dramatic drop in share value and pipeline Blockadia and what is their end game.  World oil demand continues to rise.  Why is Canada the only market in the world facing this green trade war?  Maybe we should do something about it.– 30 –Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior to that.  Michelle Stirling is Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society and a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists and the AAAS. RELATED:Money Matters: The ENGO Political Advantage Money Matters: The ENGO Political AdvantageBig Green Money vs Conventional Energy Advocateshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-1.pdf Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"**About half of primary school children in the UK have a packed lunch.**
But unlike school dinners, there are no official rules about what should be in them to make them nutritious.
And a new study from Leeds University found 98 in every 100 packed lunches eaten by children at primary school failed to meet nutritional standards.
Some schools set their own standards and even inspect lunchboxes and remove ""contraband"" unhealthy foods such as sausage rolls.
And one academy, in Norwich, recently suggested scrapping packed lunches for infants entirely to get more pupils eating their healthy school meals.
So what does a healthy packed lunch look like?
Experts say the ""main event"" should be something filling, such as bread, rice, pasta or potatoes. Choose wholegrain where you can.
When it comes to the filling of a sandwich, wrap or bagel, always add salad if you can because it will count towards your child's recommended five a day of fresh fruit and veg.
The study, published in BMJ Open, which looked at how healthy children's packed lunches were, in 2006 and again in 2016, found the most popular filling was ham, followed by cheese, chicken, tuna and then a chocolate nut spread or jam.
Veg, such as sweetcorn and carrots, rarely featured although experts say these would be good, healthy fillings to give children, along with hummus or coleslaw, especially as an alternative to sugary jam or chocolate spread.
Try to avoid using lots of mayonnaise, butter and spread - a little bit can go a long way.
Reduced-fat alternatives are available for many spreads and cheese.
The study found while the amount of sugar in packed lunches was declining overall, many still contained foods too high in sugar, salt or fat.
Most lunchboxes in the surveys of nearly 1,500 children contained crisps or other savoury snacks, while about one in three included a chocolate biscuit.
To make lunches healthier, choose:
Try chopped apple, peeled satsuma segments or melon slices to make it easier for young children to eat and enjoy. A squeeze of lemon juice can stop the fruit going brown.
Cherry tomatoes, peppers and celery also count.
Water is the obvious choice but milk or unsweetened (no added sugar) fruit juice is also good.
Study author Dr Charlotte Evans said getting children involved in shopping for and preparing packed lunches could help with educating them about making healthy choices.
""Changing behaviour is very difficult,"" she said. ""We know that. And we do need the food industry to help by making the choices that are available healthier.
""But involving children and getting them engaged with food choices from a young age is important.
""Encouraging a child to go to the shops with you and buy a pepper, then go home and slice some off and put it into their lunchbox would be great.
""It's about making it feel normal to have vegetables.""
Loughborough University's Dr Emma Haycraft has studied the psychology of getting kids to eat more veg.
She said: ""Research has shown that children need to be exposed to foods a number of times before they learn to like them. So it's important that foods are offered in lunchboxes on multiple times.
""These can be small portions initially, to minimise waste, but this will allow children time to become familiar with foods that they might not be used to eating."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs it emerges the “Russia Affair” was based on a dossier of fabricated, phony data designed to wrongfully criminalize a President, it also has become clear that trace gas CO2 has been similarly set up using a phony climate dossier.
It too was made up – in great part by NASA.
Let’s hope the Department of Justice also pursues the cast of shady figures behind the “climate dossier” and that their “Day of Reckoning” is coming too.
Video explains NASA data forgery
When it comes to data manipulations, no one has worked as tirelessly as Tony Heller in gathering the evidence of all the wrongdoing going on within the US weather Agencies as they collude to rewrite the US temperature history in a manner that reminds us of George Orwell’s 1984.
In his latest video, “John Dillinger – An Early Victim Of Climate Change“, Tony Heller illustrates how global weather extremes were far worse in the 1930s than they are today, but are being deleted by NASA.

In his video, Heller, an expert software engineer, explains how we should think that scientists would want to try to understand why the weather back in 1934 went so off the rails as unprecedented drought ravaged the globe. However, today’s scientists are instead rewriting the data in order to cover up the extreme events of 1930s.

“Straight out of Orwell’s Ministry of Truth”
For example, 1934 used to be the hottest year recorded in the US, hotter than 1998. But NASA scientists tampered with the data and made 1934 much cooler while fudging the 1998 data to be warmer (8:19 mark).
“They turned cooling into warming,” Heller says. “This is straight out of Orwell’s Ministry of Truth, rewriting the past.”
Why is this being done? Heller firmly believes that at NASA, it has everything to do with propaganda, and nothing to do with science.
“These people are not scientists; they’re propagandists pretending to be scientists, Heller says. “Actual scientists want to understand the past, not rewrite it.”
Running a racket
So blatant and rampant are the data alterations and history rewritings that Heller is compelled to compare the involved NASA scientists to 1930s Chicago gangsters. “We just have a different type of gangsters now. They dress in white lab coats, but basically they’re running the same racket,” says Heller.
Critics have been pointing out and documenting the known data alterations for years, so now is as good a time as any for the Department of Justice to investigate the data racket currently going on at NASA. Scientists are not above the law.

By Christopher Monckton of Brenchley, William M. Briggs, David R. Legates, Anthony Lupo, Istvan Marko, Dennis Mitchell, & Willie Soon
25 Sep 2016
Some 375 political activists attached to the National Academy of Sciences, supporting the totalitarian view on the climate question, have recently issued an open letter saying we “caused most of the historical increase in atmospheric levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.”
In fact, the extent of our influence on climate is not “settled science.” Only 0.3% of twelve thousand papers published in learned journals claimed that recent warming was mostly manmade. The 375 activists are entitled to their opinion, but the scientific community’s peer-reviewed results overwhelmingly fail to endorse their narrow view that recent warming was predominately manmade.
True, we influence climate, by returning to the air some of the carbon dioxide that was there before. But so do termites, by emitting more methane than all the world’s farm animals combined. So do plants, by taking carbon dioxide; storing the carbon in leaves, stems, and trunks; and returning the oxygen to the air. So does the Sun, by supplying nearly all the Earth’s radiant energy. So do volcanoes, by emitting hot rocks that warm the air and ejecta that shade the Earth from the Sun and cause cooling. So do the oceans, by helping to keep the Earth’s temperature within a few degrees either side of the period mean for more than 800,000 years.

The activists say we are warming the oceans. But in the first 11 full years of the least ill-resolved dataset we have, the 3500+ Argo bathythermograph buoys, the upper mile and a quarter of the world’s oceans warmed at a rate equivalent to just 1 Celsius degree every 430 years, and the warming rate, negligible at the surface, rises faster the deeper the measurements are taken. The oceans are warming not from above, which they would if we were warming the air and the air was warming the oceans, but from below.
The activists say we are warming the lower atmosphere. Yet on all datasets, the atmosphere is warming at less than half the rate originally predicted by their fellow-activists at the error-prone Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — who have a vested interest in overstating the supposed extent of our influence on climate. For, otherwise, the Panel would be – as it should now be – abolished. The Panel is political, but science is not science unless it is scientific, and unless it is free, in particular, from the political totalitarianism that sullenly insists that only one opinion – the Party Line – may be uttered.
The activists say the oceans are “acidifying.” The truth is that, aside from a few transects and a few local studies, science has no idea whether or at what rate the oceans are “acidifying.” What is known, however, is that the oceans are not acid (as rainwater is): they are pronouncedly alkaline. It is also known that, under anything like modern conditions, they are so powerfully buffered that alkaline they must remain.
The activists say our influence on climate is evident in “altered rainfall patterns,” but in this they are at odds with their fellow-activists at the ill-fated Intergovernmental Panel, whose special report on extreme weather (2012) and whose fifth and most recent (2013) Assessment Report on the climate question find little or no evidence of a link between our industries and enterprises on the one hand and global rainfall patterns on the other.
The activists say we are to blame for retreating Arctic sea ice. But Arctic sea ice variations, if objectively quantified with proper error estimates, are fully within the large natural range of changes that have no need of any unique explanation by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. In addition, Antarctic sea ice, which they somehow do not mention, has largely offset the loss of Arctic ice.
True scientists, like any other citizens, are entitled and even encouraged to take part in the political process, and to state their opinions. This applies to non-USA-citizens, which many of the 375 are. What true scientists must not do, however, is pretend, as the activists did, that their totalitarian point of view is unchallengeable. In all material respects, unfolding events have proven their extremist viewpoint prodigiously exaggerated at best, plain wrong at worst.
Specifically, the activists complain that, during the presidential primary campaign, “claims were made that the Earth is not warming.” Yet early in the primary campaign it was correct to say the Earth had not been warming for almost 19 years. More recently there has been a naturally-occurring El Niño event, which has raised the trend a little, but it remains true that the early predictions of medium-term warming were badly exaggerated.
The activists declare their faith in the doctrine “that the problem of human-caused climate change is real, serious and immediate, and that this problem poses significant risks” to everything from national security via health and agriculture to biodiversity. But this statement is based wholly on faith and is unsupported by reality. We know this because of the serially failed predictions made by alarmists.
The activists say, “We know that the climate system has tipping points.” Yet, revealingly, “Tipping point” is not a scientific but a political term. The activists say that “rapid warming of the planet increases the risk of crossing climatic points of no return,” but there is no evidence for rapid warming of the planet today. At the end of the Maunder Minimum, the Earth’s atmosphere warmed more rapidly in response to the naturally-occurring recovery of solar activity from 1695-1735 than it has warmed in any subsequent 40-year period. There is nothing unprecedented either about today’s global temperatures or about the rate at which those temperatures have been changing.
The activists say warmer weather will “possibly” set in motion “large-scale ocean circulation changes.” The scientific truth is that, while the wind blows, the Earth rotates and its land-masses are approximately where they are, the ocean circulation must remain much as it is now. To suggest otherwise is mere rodomontade.
The activists say warmer weather will cause “the loss of major ice sheets.” But if the great ice sheet that covered most of North America to a depth of two miles had not melted owing to naturally-occurring global warming 10,000 years ago, where would the United States be today? Antarctic snowfall accumulation has not exhibited a massive meltdown over the past 40 to 60 years, and there has been no change to speak of in northern-hemisphere snow cover. There is little evidence that the tiny global warming that has occurred is at all likely to have major effects, whether on the cryosphere or on anything else, and still less evidence that those effects would be deleterious, and still less that, even if they were deleterious, the proposed measures to prevent them would make any detectable difference, and still less that, even if proposed measures might work, the imagined benefits would exceed the extravagant cost of their implementation.
The activists are also wrong in their assertion that any appreciable human influence on the climate will be detectable for many thousands of years. Their fellow activists on the Panel say that very nearly all of the feedbacks from the small warming that may be caused by our enriching the atmosphere with plant food act over timescales of hours to – at most – decades.
The activists are wrong to state that “it is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord.” On the scientific evidence to date, it is abundantly clear that the original predictions made by the totalitarians were extreme exaggerations; that, though the world may warm a little, it will not warm a lot; that adding CO2 to the air will be of benefit to plants in reducing their need for water, which is why the world’s desert regions are beginning to green; and that the cost of futilely playing Canute with the climate is 10-100 times greater than the cost of any realistically foreseeable net disbenefit from warmer weather.
Rooting basically means to gain root access to the device. There are various rooting apps available, but KingRoot Apk is one with a high success rate.
It would, therefore, be entirely proper for a presidential candidate to argue that the United States should withdraw from the Paris climate treaty, except for one inconvenient truth. The United States has not ratified the treaty. Any such ratification requires a two-thirds majority of the Senate, and the collapse of the totalitarians’ scientific case for “climate action” now renders any such two-thirds majority impossible to achieve.
Though the activists have attempted – falsely and improperly – to convey the impression that it is somehow illegal, immoral or damaging to the planet to vote for the Republican party’s candidate in the forthcoming presidential election because he disagrees with the totalitarian position on the climate question that they espouse with such religious fervor and such disregard for science, in truth it is not the business of scientists to abuse the authority of their white lab-coats by collectively suggesting that “Science” demands the voters should or should not cast their vote in any particular direction.
Therefore, the signatories hereto repudiate the letter issued by the 375 activists as reflecting not scientific truth but quasi-religious dogma and totalitarian error; we urge the voters to disregard that regrettable and anti-scientific letter; and we invite every citizen to make up his or her own mind whom to elect to the nation’s highest office without fear of the multifarious bugaboos conjured into terrifying but scientifically unjustifiable existence by the totalitarian activists who have for decades so disrespected, disgraced and disfigured climate science.

Those promoting climate change would have us believe it is out of control when it is becoming increasingly obvious it is they who are out of control. The use of a sixteen year old girl at the U.N. to parrot off a speech on a subject she has been brainwashed on for years is at the very least objectionable. The fact that the child has a type of autism makes it even worse. I fear for the child’s future and feel very sorry for her. But not for the sick people who are using her as nothing more than a promotional tool.



I also have an abject dislike of the media who are promoting this school girl as if she is some sort of a saint and climate change hero. It makes you wonder at the level of journalism these days. We are told she stared down President Trump. Well, she was probably told to do that but all she got to stare at was the back of his head. That is not staring him down. If the journalists had a conscience they would paint the true sorry picture of how this poor girl is being used, rather than putting her on a pedestal. Disgraceful.



It is most unfortunate that our foolish Prime Minister is donkey deep in this nonsense. Tucker Carlson on Fox News interviewed a climate skeptic by the name of Bjorn Lomberg from Denmark. He said “New Zealand, they’ve just promised to be carbon neutral in 2050. They actually had the audacity to ask their official economic institute, how much is this going to cost us and the answer was sixteen per cent of their GDP. (GDP, at this point Jacinda will be lost) That is more than the entire Government of New Zealand is spending right now on everything they do. Of course they’re never going to actually do that because they’ll have a revolt before that.”



He’s just made a mockery of Ardern’s keynote address to the UN. and the Government’s climate change policy. The quicker she and her nutty friends in the Green Party realise this the better. They need to front up to the public now that they’ve been caught out lying again. **It can’t be done**. 



With Trump being a climate change denier and scrapping US targets and China and India still using huge amounts of coal, it’s high time the likes of Jacinda and James Shaw came to the realisation that yes, we can play our part, but not at the expense of sending our farmers, and therefore the country, to rack and ruin. If they want us to become part of the third world they sure as hell are going the right way about it.



The whole stupidity of climate change is being driven by the lunatics on the political left who are beneath contempt.

"When F. B. I. agents learned that a prime suspect in the Volkswagen emissions scandal was traveling to the United States, investigators knew they were on the cusp of a rare feat: the arrest of an overseas corporate executive accused of wrongdoing. On Saturday night, agents swooped in to arrest the Volkswagen executive, Oliver Schmidt, as he prepared to depart Miami International Airport for Germany, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the case, one of whom described the circumstances of the arrest. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case. Mr. Schmidt, formerly Volkswagen’s top emissions compliance executive in the United States, has been charged with defrauding the government and violating the Clean Air Act. He made an initial appearance on Monday in federal court in Miami. He will be moved to Detroit, where he was originally charged and where court documents suggest that he might be valuable in the government’s investigation into other Volkswagen officials. Mr. Schmidt, 48, played a central role in Volkswagen’s   of its diesel emissions cheating, according to an affidavit from an F. B. I. agent that was unsealed on Monday. Even as the company obfuscated details of its cheating program from regulators, Mr. Schmidt warned executives in Germany that the company could face criminal charges for its actions, the affidavit says. The case against Mr. Schmidt sheds new doubt on Volkswagen’s assertions that top executives did not understand the full scale of the wrongdoing until early in September 2015, more than a year after questions were first raised about emissions from its vehicles. Mr. Schmidt briefed executives in detail months earlier, in July, according to the criminal complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan. The timeline of the briefing has not been laid out before by prosecutors. The complaint also says that other employees were involved in a   suggesting that more charges could be coming. It is unclear which employees  —   above or below Mr. Schmidt  —   the government believes were involved. Mr. Schmidt reported to   officials at Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg. Volkswagen is nearing a deal with the Justice Department to pay more than $2 billion to resolve the criminal investigation into the emissions cheating, according to three people briefed on the negotiations. The company or one of its corporate entities is expected to plead guilty as part of the deal, according to one of the people. That deal, though, would not prevent charges against individual employees. Volkswagen’s emissions scandal has cost the company $16 billion in civil settlements in the United States alone. The fallout from the scandal has already reached Volkswagen’s executive ranks. The automaker’s chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, resigned in September, several days after American regulators publicly accused the company of manipulating testing results. German prosecutors are now investigating Mr. Winterkorn and another executive, Hans Dieter Pötsch, about whether they violated securities laws. For United States investigators, the arrest of Mr. Schmidt is a stroke of luck. Their attempts to prosecute people suspected of being responsible for the scandal have been hampered because many of the people are in Germany, which does not normally extradite its citizens. Mr. Schmidt’s lawyer, David Massey, said in court that his client had learned of the investigation and contacted the F. B. I. to cooperate. He met with federal investigators in London in 2015, Mr. Massey said. Reached by phone, Mr. Massey declined to comment further, leaving unclear what came of the outreach to the government. Volkswagen declined to comment. Why Mr. Schmidt risked arrest by traveling in the United States remains a mystery. He is fluent in English and has extensive ties in the United States from his years working in the country for Volkswagen. A Volkswagen employee since 1997, Mr. Schmidt was named general manager of Volkswagen’s Engineering and Environmental Office in Auburn Hills, Mich. in 2013. In that job, he was responsible for managing relations with the Environmental Protection Agency and the powerful California Air Resources Board, the regulatory agencies that initially pursued the emissions cheating case. Mr. Schmidt was among the first to react in early 2014 when a study by West Virginia University found evidence that Volkswagen diesel cars polluted far more under normal driving conditions than they did in official testing labs. In an email to a colleague in April 2014, he wrote, “It should first be decided whether we are honest,” according to an affidavit signed by Ian Dinsmore, an F. B. I. special agent. The affidavit was the basis for a criminal complaint against Mr. Schmidt. Volkswagen decided to mask its emissions cheating from regulators, according to the complaint and lawsuits filed by the New York attorney general’s office. To buy time, the company recalled Volkswagens in the United States for an update of the engine software in early 2015, even though Mr. Schmidt and others knew that change would not bring the cars into compliance, according to the complaint. In March, Mr. Schmidt was promoted to a new position in Wolfsburg. As he moved up, he continued to play a crucial role in Volkswagen’s relations with regulators. In July, he briefed   executives on the risks that Volkswagen faced. According to the complaint, Mr. Schmidt and other Volkswagen employees briefed top managers in Wolfsburg ahead of a meeting with officials at the California regulatory agency, also known as CARB, which took the lead in the investigation. Mr. Schmidt explained that the cars contained software that recognized when a vehicle was undergoing tests. The   defeat device increased pollution controls so the cars would pass muster. Mr. Schmidt also told the executives that if the meeting with regulators did not go well, the company could face criminal charges, according to the complaint. The   executives decided not to disclose the defeat device, according to the complaint. The complaint did not say which executives Mr. Schmidt briefed. The account runs counter to the timeline Volkswagen has detailed. The company has maintained in court documents that top managers did not learn of the wrongdoing until early September 2015. The   continued into August, according to the complaint. While attending an industry conference, Mr. Schmidt presented a thick binder of technical information to a   California regulator. But when agency experts scrutinized the data, they found that it made no sense, Alberto Ayala, the board’s deputy executive officer, said in an interview last year. Having run out of excuses for the emissions discrepancies, Mr. Schmidt and other Volkswagen managers met with CARB and E. P. A. officials in September and admitted the presence of a defeat device. By then, Mr. Schmidt and his colleagues had squandered the credit that companies usually get for cooperating with investigators. Nevertheless, Mr. Schmidt continued to represent Volkswagen publicly through early 2016, continuing to play down what the company had done. In January, he testified before the British Parliament as part of an inquiry into the emissions testing. Mr. Schmidt told the members of Parliament that Volkswagen had removed software that recognized when an emissions test was underway. But the software was nothing nefarious, he said. “This software is not defined as a defeat device in Europe,” he said."

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



From _The Guardian_ , January 29, 1974. 



Way back then the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia was donkey deep in the deception. They went from global cooling to global warming without batting an eyelid.

The Current Wisdom _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. “Chip” Knappenberger, from Cato’s Center for the Study of Science, review interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press._   




In 25 years of global warming hype, why hasn’t one article noted that it will increase the number of beach days? Where’s the beef?[/caption]   
  
  
In a recent _USA Today_ article “Diseases on the move because of climate change,” The Campaign Continues.   
  
  
It’s biblical. Brain‐​eating amoebas. Killer ticks. A fungus kills many among us. About the only thing missing from this one is all the deaths that will result from hail the size of canned hams.   
  
  
It’s mind‐​boggling. 0.8°C ago, around 1900, life expectancy was one half what it is now. Malaria was endemic. Food and water‐​borne illnesses were real killers. All have been pretty much vanquished, despite dreaded warming. Not a mention of this.   
  
  
Such droning is probably why people tune this stuff out. There’s an epidemic of the real global warming‐​related malady, apocalypse fatigue, [1] and still the Society of Environmental[ist] Journalists hasn’t gotten the email.   
  
  
There’s no need to bring out climate change to explain recent patterns of the diseases that can be thoroughly accounted for by any of a large collection of confounding factors. We meant _human_ -caused climate change as that’s the pernicious kind (it’s too bad we can’t ask our ancestors how much they liked the very natural ice age).   




First, the brain‐​eating amoebas. They prefer warm bodies of fresh water. They are nasty critters that are virtually always fatal when they set up shop inside their victims—which are usually young children. The latter attributes make them attention getters, although the former is why they find themselves a focus of the _USA Today_ article, which states that they are “showing up in northern lakes that were once too cold to harbor [them].”   
  
  
The evidence? There have been two, count ‘em, _two_ cases (the first in 2010, another in 2012) from a single lake in Minnesota—where, according to the _USA Today_ , “[t]he water in Minnesota had been too cold for [the brain‐​eating amoebas] to thrive.” “But August 2010 was the third‐​warmest in Minneapolis since 1891.”   
  
  
Okay then. So is this a part of a trend towards warmer Augusts in the Black Fly state?   
  
  
Just because of our experience with the facts never getting in the way of a good global warming scare story, we went to the website of the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and used their tool to plot the history of August temperatures in Minnesota from 1895 through 2013 ( _USA Today_ could have done this as well). Figure 1 shows the result. 2010 is warm, but it isn’t the third warmest. According to NCDC, which also ranks the data in tabular form, 2010 was seventh‐​warmest. Further, there are ten additional years within a degree of 2010. It is therefore reasonable to estimate that there have been 17 years in the climate record that could support the brain munchers.   
  
  
And, as is obvious from NCDC’s figure, it’s impossible to see a global warming signal in the Minnesota August data—unless you think that the noisy up‐​trend from roughly 1910–1930 was because of dreaded greenhouse gas emissions—something no one would want to contend in a live debate format, for fear of professional death—and not from brain eating amoebas, but from brain‐​beating data.   






_Figure 1. August statewide average temperature history for Minnesota, 1895–2013, as compiled by the National Climatic Data Center (_ source: NCDC)   
  
  
But in case you’re still scared of your brain being eaten because of global warming, the Centers for Disease Control can only find _128 cases_ _of infection by the brain‐​eating amoeba in the entire USA since 1962_. And, according to the CDC, “It does not appear that the number of infections has increased since CDC established its Free‐​living Ameba (FLA) Laboratory and PAM registry in 1978.” Figure 2 (from the CDC) shows the number of reported cases in each year.   






_Figure 2. Annual occurrence of infection by brain‐​eating amoeba, 1962–2012 (from theCDC_).   
  
  
Since 1962, there have been roughly 100,000,000 deaths in the U.S. Of those, 128 have been from brain‐​eating amoeba—a percentage so low my old‐​fashioned handheld calculator can’t figure it.   
  
  
Perhaps _USA Today_ could do better with its coverage of tick‐​borne illnesses such as Lyme disease?   
  
  
Hardly.   
  
  
_USA Today_ tells us (who told them, we wonder) a generally warming climate along with changes in extreme weather are demonstrably responsible for more tick‐​to‐​human disease transmission, despite a whole list of other confounding factors—many which are included in the article itself, such as humans moving closer to forests, and forest regrowth, and still others such as greater recognition of the disease, improved medical detection technologies, not to mention questions concerning the accuracy of surveillance data.   
  
  
A recent review of Lyme disease in the journal _Environmental Health Perspectives_ described the history of the disease in this way [references removed]:   




The infection’s sudden rise in the United States in the 1970s gave the impression that Lyme disease was caused by a newly invading pathogen, but the diaries of early American settlers reported abundant ticks, and the evidence now shows that [ _Borrelia burgdorferi_ , Bb] is an ancient infection in North America. Distinctive Bb genes have been identified in museum collections of ticks from the 1940s and of white‐​footed mice from the turn of the twentieth century, and studies of genetic variation in separate populations of Bb suggest the pathogen existed across much of the present‐​day United States many thousands of years before European settlement. Nevertheless, genetic analyses indicate that this genus of bacteria originated in Europe.   
  
  
Bb is a microbe of forest habitats, and its history is tied to human land use. As European settlers moved west across the United States, they cleared great swaths of forest. Deer, one of the major hosts for black‐​legged ticks, were overhunted and dwindled to a few small, scattered populations. Populations of white‐​footed mice, an important reservoir host for Bb, also declined. But in some undisturbed spots in the Northeast and the Midwest, deer, white‐​footed mice, their tick parasites, and Bb all survived. With the abandonment of most northeastern farm fields in the mid‐​nineteenth century, forests regenerated, and the microbe traveled with its tick and vertebrate hosts into newly re‐​expanding habitats.   
  
  
Lyme disease now appears to be expanding outward from long‐​time refuges.



In other words, the ticks are reclaiming their once‐​held territory that included most of the U.S., and in doing so, they are spreading Lyme disease—an ancient pathogen.   
  
  
You get pretty twisted up trying to invoke anthropogenic global warming to explain a general (including southern, i.e., into already warmer climates) expansion of the ticks and their pathogen hitchhikers.   
  
  
Is it possible that warming climate is facilitating the expansion northward? To some small extent, perhaps. But even under a scenario in which its influence is proven (which is not the current situation), climate change is just one contribution to a highly complex interplay of a large number of factors.   
  
  
Identifying whatever climate change signal may exist in such a system and attributing that the a human casue, is darn near impossible.   
  
  
Lastly, _USA Today_ takes on Valley Fever—an infection caused by the inhalation of the spores of a fungus ( _Coccidioides_ spp _.)_ which is found largely in the desert Southwest. The fungus prefers hot, arid environments, interspersed with periodic wet periods, and the spores are spread by soil disturbance mechanisms, including wind (and construction equipment, and tractors, and shovels, etc.). _USA Today_ reports that there has been a large rise in the numbers of reported cases of Valley Fever during the past few years and that “Valley Fever is one of multiple diseases experts say are spreading in part because of climate change.”   
  
  
But, the CDC explains that there are numerous factors that may lie behind the recent reported increase [references removed]:   




This report describes statistically significant increases in the incidence rate of reported coccidioidomycosis in endemic states during 1998–2011 after adjusting for changes in population size and in age and sex distribution. Although the number of cases decreased in Arizona during 2007–2008 and in California during 2007–2009, incidence dramatically increased in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, coccidioidomycosis was the second most commonly reported nationally notifiable condition in Arizona and the fourth most commonly reported in California.   
  
  
The reasons for the increases described in this report are unclear. _Coccidioides_ exists in the soil and is sensitive to environmental changes; factors such as drought, rainfall, and temperature might have resulted in increased spore dispersal, and disruption of soil by human activity, such as construction, also might be a contributing factor.   
  
  
Changes in surveillance methodology might have resulted in artifactual increases. California transitioned to a laboratory‐​based reporting system during 2010, which facilitated reporting and might account for the increase in reported cases in 2011. However, some highly endemic counties, such as Kern County, already had been using laboratory‐​based systems, so this cannot fully explain the recent increase. The observed increase in Arizona might be partially attributable to a 2009 change by a major commercial laboratory to conform its reporting practices to the 2008 CSTE case definition, whereby positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) results were reported as cases without confirmation by immunodiffusion. One commercially available EIA test (Meridian Bioscience) commonly used to diagnose coccidioidomycosis has been described to have false‐​positive results in some instances, but the contribution of this phenomenon, if any, to the overall increase in cases is unknown.   
  
  
Improved awareness of coccidioidomycosis might have resulted in increased diagnostic testing (and thus reporting) in endemic and nonendemic states. _Coccidioides_ has been found to be the etiologic agent in an estimated 15%–29% of community‐​acquired pneumonias in highly endemic areas. However, a 2006 study demonstrated that only a small proportion (2%–13%) of patients with compatible illness in an endemic area were tested for coccidioidomycosis, suggesting that the disease is greatly underreported. Further study is needed to understand if testing practices have changed. Despite the increase in reported cases, overall U.S. coccidioidomycosis mortality rates have remained fairly stable at approximately 0.6 per 1 million person‐​years during 1990–2008.



Like we said, it’s complicated.   
  
  
As it is for climate _change_ (as opposed to variability), Figure 3, shows the annual number of Valley Fever cases from 1995–2011 along with the temperature and precipitation history from Arizona (the state with the large majority of Valley Fever cases). Our figure clearly shows that the temperature and precipitation vary on annual to decadal (and even longer) timescales, but that there is nothing particularly unusual during the past couple of years associated with the large rise in Valley Fever cases.   






_Figure 3. (top) Reported cases of Valley Fever in the U.S., 1995–2011 (source_ _CDC_ _). (bottom) Annual statewide temperature (left) and precipitation (right) history from Arizona, 1895–2011 (source:_ _NCDC_ _)._   
  
  
While annual statewide averages probably don’t reveal the nuances of the complexity of the climate relationship with Valley Fever outbreaks, if you have to look _this_ hard, and only at a couple of years, there is no way to conclusively implicate human‐​caused climate change. It is impossible.   
  
  
If you want even more facts, have a look at Figure 4, from the CDC, showing several measures of mortality across the U.S. Even though the raw number of people dying each year is on the increase, this increase is a result of an increasing and aging population. Correct for these attributes (dark blue line) and you see that a large and on‐​going decline is taking place. If you want to go looking for an anthropogenic climate change signal, you need to go looking in (and shouldn’t lose sight of) this overall trend.   






_Figure 4. Number of deaths, crude and age‐​adjusted death rates: United States, 1935–2010 (source:_ _CDC_ _)._   
  
  
As is often the case in assessments of the impacts of climate change, including those from the federal government (see our critique here), authors quickly lose sight of the big, rosy, landscape, instead manufacturing a nanoscene of doom and gloom constructed with much whole cloth.

"**Farmers in Scotland who feel under ""attack"" as interest in the Veganuary trend grows have said both sides can exist side-by-side.**
Veganuary - the campaign highlighting avoiding animal products in the first month of the year - has risen in popularity since it began in 2014.
Campaigners claim thousands of people are swapping meat and dairy for plant-based diets.
However, Scottish farming groups are trying to change the conversation.
Gwen Chalmers has farmed near New Deer in Aberdeenshire for 20 years.
She has a small herd of pedigree short-horn cattle.
Like many farmers, she feels she increasingly has to defend her way of life - particularly during campaigns such as Veganuary.
Google Trends suggests there has been increased interest in veganism this year, with Google searches for ""veganism"" reaching an all-time high this January.
Mrs Chalmers said: ''We do feel under attack. It's a small minority of the population, but they've got a loud voice.
""So we have to get out there and put our message across and show people what we're doing.""
She explained: ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I am not against vegetarians, but I believe in a balanced diet, we need meat in our diet, we need vegetables, we need cereals, and it all works in a cycle together.
""Soil, I say, is the poor man's tropical rain forest. If we look after the soil, the soil looks after us.""
The farmer argued the industry was doing its best to reduce its carbon footprint, but that other industries had to do likewise.
""We are doing our best to help climate change,"" she said. ""We recycle everything that we can.
""Farmers are needed to produce food and we want to do that in a sustainable manner.
""We can co-exist side by side.""
Last year, a major UN report examined the impact of diet on the planet. It said reducing meat consumption could have a major impact in cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Rebecca Knowles, from Vegan Outreach Scotland, said environmental concern was believed to be the biggest reason that people were choosing to go vegan.
""Coming from a farming background, having worked on farms, I feel a connection there,"" she said.
""Farmers are always going to be the people who produce our food, We're always going to need farmers.
""People have said things to me like 'you vegans, you're trying to put farmers out of business'. Nothing could be further from the truth.
""What we're looking at is shifting from what we produce and producing things that have a better outcome for the environment, and a better outcome for ourselves as well as the animals.""
Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) said 94% of UK households still buy meat, fish and poultry on a weekly basis.
It wants to change the Veganuary conversation by promoting what it believes are the benefits of beef.
Jennifer Robertson from QMS said: ""Our farmers are working very very hard at producing sustainable product and they're working hard at increasing biodiversity throughout the farmland as well.
""I think a lot of people are looking at how much meat they're eating and that's absolutely fine but if they want to try and choose meat maybe two or three times a week that's still perfectly acceptable.
""We're encouraged that we can eat up to 70g (2.47oz) of red meat per day, so if we're going to choose to eat it maybe a little less often we would encourage eat the best."""

Thank you for inviting my testimony. I am a Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies at the Cato Institute and Distinguished Senior Fellow in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University. This testimony represents no official point of view from either of these institutions and is tendered with the traditional protections of academic freedom.



My testimony has four objectives:



1) Demonstration that the rate greenhouse‐​related warming is clearly below the mean of climate forecasts from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that are based upon changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that are closest to what is actually being observed,



2) demonstration that the Finding of Endangerment from greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency is based upon a very dubious and critical assumption,



3) demonstration that the definition of science as a public good induces certain biases that substantially devalue efforts to synthesize science, such as those undertaken by the IPCC and the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), and



4) demonstration that there is substantial discontent with governmental and intergovernmental syntheses of climate change and with policies passed by this House of Representatives.



“Climate change” is nothing new, even climate change induced by human activity. What matters is not whether or not something so obvious exists, but to what magnitude it exists and how people adapt to such change.



For decades, scientists have attempted to model the behavior of our atmosphere as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are added above the base levels established before human prehistory. The results are interesting but are highly dependent upon the amount of carbon dioxide that resides in the atmosphere, something that is very difficult to predict long into the future with any confidence. It is safe to say that no one — no matter whether he or she works for the government, for industry, or in education — can tell what our technology will be 100 years from now. We can only say that if history is to be any guide, it will be radically different from what we use today and that therefore projecting greenhouse gas emissions so far into the future is, to choose a word carefully, _useless_.



One thing we are certain of, though, is that the development of future technologies depends upon capital investment, and that it would be foolish to continue to spend such resources in expensive programs that will in fact do nothing significant to global temperature. 



Fortunately, despite the doomsaying of several, we indeed have the opportunity to not waste resources now, but instead to invest them much further in the future. That is because the atmosphere is clearly declaring that the response to changes in carbon dioxide is much more modest that what appears to be the consensus of scientific models. 



**Testimony Objective #1: Greenhouse‐​related warming is clearly below the mean of relevant climate forecasts from the IPCC**



Figure 1 shows the community of computer model projections from the IPCC’s “midrange” scenario. Observed changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations correspond closer to this one than to others. You will note one common characteristic of these models: they predict warmings of a relatively constant rate. This is because, in large part, the response of temperature to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide is logarithmic (meaning that equal incremental increases produce proportionally less warming as concentration increases), while the increase in carbon dioxide itself is a low‐​order exponent rather than a straight line. This combination tends to produce constant rates of warming.





The various models just produce different quasi‐​constant rates. Divining future warming then becomes rather easy. Do we have a constant rate of warming? And if so, then we know the future rate, _unless the functional form of all of these models is wrong_. And if this is wrong, scientists are so ignorant of this problem, that you are wasting your time in soliciting our expertise.



How does the observed rate of global temperature increase compare to what is being projected? For that, we can examine the behavior of literally hundreds of iterations of these models. For time periods of various lengths, some of these models will actually produce no significant warming trend (as has been observed since 1996), or even a short‐​term interval of cooling.



Figure 2 gives us the mean and 95% confidence limits of the midrange family of IPCC models as well as temperatures observed by the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. (More will be said on this history below). It is quite apparent that the observed rates of change are below the mean value forecast by the IPCC. 





An additional and important discrepancy between the models and reality extends into the lower atmosphere as well. In the lower atmosphere, climate models expectations are that the degree of warming with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations should be greater than that experienced at the surface, with the lower atmosphere warming about 1.4 times faster than the average surface temperature. Despite claims that observations and models are in agreement (Santer et al., 2008), new analyses incorporating a large number of both observational datasets as well as climate model projections, clearly and strongly demonstrate that the surface warming (which itself is below the model mean) is significantly outpacing the warming in the lower atmosphere — contrary to climate model expectations. Instead of exhibiting 40% more warming than the surface, the lower atmosphere is warming 25% less — a statistically significant difference (Christy et al., 2010).



And further, the climate models are faring little better with oceanic temperature changes. There again, they project far more warming than has been observed. In a much‐​publicized paper published in _Nature_ magazine in 2006 (by authors Gleckler, Wigley, Santer, Gregory, AchutaRao, Taylor, 2006), it was claimed that by including the cooling influence of a string of large volcanic eruptions starting in 1880, that climate models produced a much closer match to observed trends in ocean warming than when the models did not include the volcanic impacts. Further, it was claimed that volcanic eruptions as far back as Krakatoa in 1883 were still significantly offsetting warming from human greenhouse gas emissions. However, a soon‐​to‐​be‐​published paper by one of the _Nature_ paper’s original authors, Jonathan Gregory, shows that the influence of volcanoes was greatly exaggerated as the original climate models assumed that no major volcanic eruptions had occurred prior to Krakatoa. In fact, episodic major eruptions are an integral part of the earth’s natural climate. Gregory shows that had climate models been equilibrated with more realistic natural conditions, that the long‐​term impact of volcanoes since the late 19th century would be greatly minimized. In that case, the apparent match between model simulations and observations of oceanic heat content that was noted by Gleckler et al. would deteriorate, leaving climate models once again over‐​responsive to rising levels of greenhouse gases.



I caution you that analyses of climate models can be highly dependent upon the time period chosen. There was a major El Nino event in 1998, which is the warmest year in the instrumental histories. Thus any analysis beginning in this year will show little warming. On the other hand, if one studies the last twenty years, there is a major volcano at the beginning of the record (Pinatubo in 1991), so any analysis beginning then will show anomalously large warming trends. 



An example of the time dependency of model validation can be seen in one of the most famous papers ever published on this subject, by Santer et al. (1996). It was clearly rushed to print by _Nature_ magazine in order to provide a scientific justification for the Second Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Geneva a mere few days after its publication. The findings were reported in virtually every major newspaper on the planet in this politically sensitive timeframe.



The analysis shows a remarkable fit between the observed three‐​dimensional changes in the atmosphere and what was projected by models between 1963 and 1987. But, indeed, this three‐​dimensional history actually begins in 1957, and, for the purposes of this paper, clearly ends in 1995, not 1987.



The major match for this record results from the substantial warming of the southern hemisphere compared to the northern (Figure 3). Indeed the time evolution of southern hot spot is striking from 1963 through 1987. But, when all of the data are used, the warming trend completely disappears.1





Nonetheless, the Geneva conference marked the turning point in international climate change policy. It was agreed there that at the next conference, in Kyoto, that the nations of the world would adopt a binding protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The resultant Kyoto protocol demonstrably did nothing about climate change and was an historic, expensive failure that led to the ultimate failure in subsequent policy that took place in Copenhagen last December.



 **Testimony Objective #2: The Finding of Endangerment from greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency is based upon a very dubious and critical assumption**



The reluctance of the Senate to mandate significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions has resulted in EPA taking the lead in this activity. Consequently it issued an “endangerment finding” on December 7, 2009. The key statement in this Finding is adapted from the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC and from the CCSP:



Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures _since the mid‐​20 th century_ is _very likely_ due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG [greenhouse gas] concentrations. [italics added]



Here the EPA gives us a very testable hypothesis. “Most” means more than 50%. “Very likely”, according to the IPCC and CCSP, means with a subjective probability of between 90 and 95 %. “Since the mid‐​20th century” means after 1950. So, is more than half of the warming since 1950 a result of “the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations?”



Figure 4 is a plot of observed global surface temperature since 1950 from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia. Note that its linear behavior is quite striking, with a warming trend of 0.70°C.





Thompson et al., writing in _Nature_ in 2008, noted that sea‐​surface temperatures were measured too cold between the mid‐​1940s and mid‐​1960s. Accounting for this lowers the surface warming trend from 0.70 to 0.55°C; see Figure 5. 





Late in 2007, Ross McKitrick and I published an analysis of “non climatic” trends in surface temperature data. While the global effect was not as large as some erroneous reports have stated, we found that approximately .08°C of the warming trend was a result of these factors. We were looking at effects that could only occur over land, and Thompson et al. was concerned with the ocean, so these two adjustments are obviously independent, additive, and not from GHG changes. The remaining warming is now 0.47°C (Figure 6).





In January, 2010, in an attempt to explain the lack of significant warming that has been observed since 1996, Susan Solomon published a new simulation in _Science_ that took into effect the radiative consequences of changing water vapor in the stratosphere. No one really knows why this is happening, but it is not an obvious consequence of changing GHG concentrations. This additional factor drops the warming to 0.41°C; see Figure 7. 





In 2009, Ramanathan and Carmichael reviewed the effects of black carbon — which is not a GHG — on temperature and concluded it was responsible for approximately 25% of observed warming. This now drops the residual warming to a ceiling of 0.31°C, or 44% of the original 0.70° (Figure 8). Note that this catena of results does not invoke solar variability, as estimates of its impact on recent climate vary widely (Scafetta, 2009). 





Consequently EPA’s core statement (as well as that of the IPCC and the CCSP), “Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid‐​20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG [greenhouse gas] concentrations”, is not supported. 



**Testimony Objective #3: The definition of science as a public good induces certain biases that substantially devalue efforts to synthesize science, such as those undertaken by the IPCC and the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP).**



Visitors to the website of _Scientific American_ have been invited to participate in an ongoing survey on global warming. This survey finds — despite the general environmentalist bent of its readership — that only a tiny minority (16%) agree that the IPCC is “an effective group of government representatives, scientists, and other experts”. 84% agree, however, that it is “a corrupt organization, prone to groupthink, with a political agenda” (Figure 9). The concordance between the IPCC and the bizarre one‐​sidedness of the CCSP Synthesis would compel the respondents to say the same about it, if asked.





This stems from the very nature of modern science, which is treated largely as a public good, to be funded by taxpayer dollars. But, like other tax‐​supported entities, science also competes within itself for attention to its disciplines and problems. In the environment of Washington, the most emergent or apparently urgent subjects receive proportional public largesse. With regard to incentives, no scientific community ever came into this House of Representatives and claimed that its area of interest was overemphasized and that funding should be directed elsewhere. This is normal behavior.



However, an implication of this behavior is that the peer‐​review process is also populated by a community of incentivized individuals. The test of this hypothesis would be in fact if that literature were demonstrably biased.



Rather than use the inflammatory subject of climate change as an example, I draw your attention to the everyday weather forecast. In the US, we recast our global forecasting models twice a day, based upon three dimensional measurements of atmospheric state variables that simultaneously updated.



If the initial forecast model is unbiased, each new pieced of information has an equal probability of either raising or lowering the high temperature forecast three days from now. And, indeed, that turns out to be the case.



The same should apply to climate science if there is no incentivized bias. In fact, the “mainstream” community of climate scientists claims this is true. In their _Amicus_ brief in _Massachusetts v. EPA_ , the supreme court case that required the EPA to determine whether or not carbon dioxide caused “endangerment”, Battisti et al., writing as “The Climate Scientists” state:



Outcomes may turn out better than our best current prediction, but it is just as possible that environmental and health damages will be more than severe than the best predictions.



As with the EPA’s use of “most” and “mid‐​20th century”, “just as possible” is a quantitatively testable hypothesis. In this case, “The Climate Scientists” are stating that there is an equal probability that a new scientific finding in global warming, in amount or consequence makes future prospects either worse than previously thought or not as bad.



I examined 13 consecutive months of _Nature_ and _Science_ to test the hypothesis of unbias. Over a hundred articles were examined. Of those that demonstrably had a “worse than” or “not as bad as” component, over 80 were in the “worse” category and 11 were “not as bad”.



The possibility that this did not reflect bias can be determined with a binomial probability. It is similar to the likelihood that a coin could be tossed 93 times with only 11 “heads” or “tails”. That probability is less than 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000.



In fact, climate science holds itself apart from other quantitative fields. Both economics and biomedical science acknowledge this problem, known as “publication bias” when doing meta‐​analyses. It a concept is completely foreign to the dominant mainstream in my profession, in the IPCC and in the CCSP.



 **Testimony Objective #4: There is substantial discontent with governmental and intergovernmental syntheses of climate change and with policies passed by this House of Representatives.**



In response to a perceived political need for mandated reductions to demonstrate our national resolve at Copenhagen, this House passed a cap‐​and‐​trade bill on June 26, 2009. The Senate never considered such legislation and it will rest when this Congress adjourns.



The survey by _Scientific American_ shows the unpopularity of this approach. Figure 10 shows that only 7.5% of nearly 7,000 respondents say cap and trade was the course that should have been taken.





 _Conclusion_



I hope to have demonstrated in this testimony that observed warming rates are certainly below the mean of the most likely suite of climate models, and that the finding of endangerment by the EPA is based upon an important assumption that may not be true.



Further, science and scientists are demonstrably incentivized, as publicly funded goods, in ways that make any synthesis of the scientific literature highly susceptible to bias. Finally, an ongoing survey by _Scientific American_ reveals profound distrust of scientific institutions such as the IPCC, and by extension, the CCSP, probably caused by the incentives noted above.

"**As NHS doctors and nurses in intensive care units across the UK battle to save as many lives as they can, outside their hospitals, networks of volunteers are ensuring these key workers get fed and know they are appreciated.**
""You can't save an entire nation on an empty stomach,"" says Alick Varma, a tech entrepreneur and one of the co-founders of Meals for the NHS.
It is one of the grassroots organisations popping up in an attempt to ensure that no NHS worker goes without food during the coronavirus crisis.
In just a few days, he and his other co-founders have raised more than Â£200,000 and set up a network to deliver to 17 hospitals in London, providing free hot meals to NHS staff.
The food hasn't gone just to doctors and nurses but to others playing a vital role in keeping the hospitals running - from security guards to cleaning staff.
Mr Varma adds: ""On Sunday I was talking to a doctor friend and when I heard how staff were doing 18-hour shifts - and it's not that they don't have canteens, it's just the canteens weren't really open or there wasn't anything on offer other than something they could grab from a vending machine - it really hit home the need to get meals to doctors and nurses.""
The team has already provided hungry NHS workers with several thousand free meals. Its members are in the process of applying to become a charity but at the moment have set up as a company to help them organise logistics.
Andrew Muir Wood, one of the other co-founders, says they have made sure to team up with businesses close to the hospitals, as they wanted to help the communities and local economies to continue to thrive during the lockdown.
They are not the only ones, though.
In Wembley mother-of-three Daksha Varsani has galvanised an entire community to help make Indian meals and sandwiches to send to hospitals in London and beyond. She's set up the Covid-19 Response Kitchen.
Mrs Varsani, who is from Newham, said she was moved to take action after watching a video posted by Yorkshire nurse Dawn Bilbrough, who was left in tears after being unable to find or buy any essential supplies after a gruelling shift.
""I saw the video and then decided something had to be done,"" she said. ""Lots of family and friends offered to help after I put a post up on my social media and it's snowballed from there.""
After tracking down two chefs with the correct food certifications, a batch of 50 meals was sent to staff at London's Northwick Park Hospital, where her niece is working in its Covid unit.
Then she teamed up with Desi Dhaba, a restaurant in Wembley, and Katie-Louise Barber, a mother-of-three from Barnet who was also fundraising. They spread the word so that more and more people and businesses got involved and more deliveries were sent to hospitals across the capital.
So far, they have delivered at least 5,000 free meals and are looking to expand further.
Mrs Varsani said: ""People want to help. There is a demand and we want to meet it. We've seen nurses crying and telling us this is something they need.""
But she stressed that it was imperative that those making the food they were delivering to the hospitals had the right certification, such as local-authority registration and food-hygiene certificates, plus the correct insurance.
""Only the chefs cook... All volunteers wear masks, hair nets, aprons while handling food."" She said they followed a ""strict"" regime washing hands, sanitising and wearing gloves.
Meanwhile in Peterborough, Aleksandra Zarnowiec and her husband, Pawelco, are now planning to deliver free bubble teas to hospital staff weekly. The couple, who own the Double Bubble Tea House, say it is an opportunity to give back.
Ms Zarnowiec said: ""We were pretty much forced to close because of the government lockdown so all we can do is deliveries.
""We were trying to think about what we could do to help and thought, well the only thing we know how to do is to make good bubble tea, so let's give that to the hospital workers.""
In Inverclyde, baker Ros Paterson's ovens are rarely off. She thought her business was at risk after the Scottish government told cafes and gyms to close.
But when a friend asked to buy a box of brownies to send to staff at Inverclyde Royal Hospital, it set up a chain of human kindness.
""I put a post up on social media and said if people want to buy a box of brownies at a 40% discount, I'll deliver them for free to the hospital. In the first day about 40 boxes were ordered. I thought a few orders would come in but not so many. People were sharing [the post] left, right and centre.
""It's helping me to retain my sanity, even if I'm not making much money from it. It's giving people a way to give back.""
The sole trader added: ""We have to take care of the people who take care of us.""
Of course, they are not the only ones. Fundraising pages are being set up nationwide for local and regional initiatives.
In Cardiff, traders calling themselves Holy Yolks have set up a Help the Heroes campaign and far exceeded their Â£200 target for a weekly shop for NHS staff.
Al Maidah is providing 1,000 meals a week for NHS staff at North Manchester General Hospital; Nandos staff have dropped off food parcels at hospitals around the country, while volunteers from Khalsa Aid have taken hot meals to exhausted NHS staffers, too. Fast-food chain Leon has launched a not-for-profit campaign called FeedNHS.
Hospitals around the country have gratefully accepted the food parcels and staff have taken to social media to say thanks personally. However, some hospitals have been so inundated they've had to ask people to stop the deliveries for now.
All the organisations that have emerged say they need help to sustain the demand, especially during these uncertain times.
Andrew Muir Wood, of Meals for the NHS, said: ""We've estimated that we need to raise Â£1m of funding just to feed the hospitals we already have on board for the next 90 days.""

Global climate strike for the future.Teachers’ magazine with a debate article, which states that students should be allowed to strike from school for the climate.A church congregation that encourages climate change.Everyone calls for the politicians to do something.What is less clear and probably they have neither deeper knowledge in climate science nor how the society they wish to see will be in reality.Like the entire establishment in politics and the media, they assume that they are largely unanimous, that there is broadly consensus  in the research community about threatening catastrophic climate change. The weaker the arguments, the higher the tone will be. And emotions get to control. You want to belong to the good side.The phenomenon of Greta has the greatest impact and inspires several of the aforementioned. It would be strange to me to bully  a child. Unlike many in Greta Thunberg’s surroundings, she is completely and totally honest in her intent. However, a legitimate question is how the circus around her is possible.Who believes that Arnold Schwarzenegger, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker or alarmist Al Gore is so greatly impressed by her knowledge when she teaches them to the TV cameras? Greta has become a phenomenon and it benefits their agenda to be seen together with her. It is not possible to claim anything other than that a child is totally exploited. No matter how voluntary she may be and with the support of her family. Hope she doesn’t hurt.It is difficult to reach out with a more sensible message in the media. A bunch of middle-aged white men with placards, who urge the public to wake up , does not raise any emotional storms. And probably no support from any entrepreneur like Ingmar Rentzhog either.Nevertheless, we should think about how we managed this long. The UN man Maurice Strong already said in 1972 that we have ten years to prevent the climate catastrophe. Now 2019, forty six years and a number of alarm reports later, we are told we have twelve years.Group pressure and group thinking are psychological concepts. In their extreme expressions, they can get usually wise and educated people to act idiotically. (Compare the Macchiarini scandal). Acting against peer pressure requires courage and integrity. It is difficult and costly to break. Both for researchers, politicians and media people.The UN is hardly known to succeed in its core missions. Every report from the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) has a politically negotiated Summary for Policy  Makers. It also includes an information strategy that covers everything from elementary school to universities, the media, the public and politics. This is precisely a task they have succeeded to the extent that there is now a concept such as climate anxiety. It affects children and youth most. The basis of the phenomenon of Greta’s enormous impact.Read the article in Teachers’ newspaper and be horrified. There are three teachers behind the debate article.

The Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index is an analysis based on one of the most reliable data sets available on the impacts of extreme weather events and associated socio-economic data. The Germanwatch Climate Risk Index 2019 is the 14th edition of the annual analysis. Its aim is to contextualize ongoing climate policy debates – especially the international climate negotiations – with real-world impacts during the last year and the last 20 years.



 **However, the index must not be mistaken for a comprehensive climate vulnerability scoring. It represents one important piece in the overall puzzle of climate-related impacts and associated vulnerabilities but, for example, does not take into account important aspects such as rising sea-levels, glacier melting or more acidic and warmer seas.**



It is based on past data and should not be used for a linear projection of future climate impacts. Specifically, not too far-reaching conclusions should be drawn for political discussions regarding which country or region is the most vulnerable to climate change. Also, it is important to note that the occurrence of a single extreme event cannot be easily attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Nevertheless, climate change is an increasingly important factor for changing the likelihood of occurrence and the intensity of these events. There is a growing body of research that is looking into the attribution of the risk of extreme events to the influences of climate change.  
  
The Climate Risk Index (CRI) indicates a level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events, which countries should understand as warnings in order to be prepared for more frequent and/or more severe events in the future. Not being mentioned in the CRI does not mean there are no impacts occurring in these countries. Due to the limitations of the available data, particularly long-term comparative data, including socio-economic data, some very small countries, such as certain small island states, are not included in this analysis. Moreover, **the data only reflects the direct impacts (direct losses and fatalities) of extreme weather events** , whereas, for example, heat waves – which are a frequent occurrence in African countries – often lead to much stronger indirect impacts (e.g. as a result of droughts and food scarcity). Finally, the index does not include the total number of affected people (in addition to the fatalities) since the comparability of such data is very limited.

Perhaps, those who believe with almost religious fervor that humans are causing catastrophic global warming are just feeling the confidence that comes with having billion-dollar foundations as well as plenty of government money behind them. Whatever the reasons, every day we see another statement of a simple, short and incorrect logic. It is expressed as, “Climate change is real, so we must impose carbon dioxide taxes” or “I believe in global warming, so the government should impose legally binding targets so people who produce or use fossil fuels will be punished.”Some things don’t die… Pinterest https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/502362533413735452/?autologin=trueSuch leaps of logic, it seems to me, obscure the many implicit theses that underlie the alleged linkage between climate science and public policy. I count at least ten, and I am sure there are more. So, let us count the ten deadly theses that climate catastrophists believe:that despite millions of years of climate changes affected by solar, oceanic, and other natural cycles, the main influence on the global climate today is the four in every ten thousand parts in the atmosphere that represent human-caused carbon dioxide emissions;that by adjusting human-caused carbon dioxide emissions), people can “manage” the global climate as though human emissions were a thermostat;that the analysis of future climate trends carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and specifically its modelling of future temperature changes, can be relied upon as a basis for understanding climate a century hence (despite the failure of those models even to replicate actual global temperature changes over the past thirty years);that the various agreements of the United Nations to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets will actually result in those targets being met, notwithstanding that none of the targets set since 1990 have ever been met;that the growth in GHG emissions globally can be reduced by actions that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (i.e. the wealthier) countries take to reduce emissions – even though the non-OECD countries now constitute 63% of the emissions; all the emissions growth is occurring in the non-OECD countries; and the emissions growth is driven by the poorer countries’ justifiable and irresistible desire for higher living standards for their citizens;that a transition of all countries from one set of energy sources (i.e. fossil fuels) to another (i.e. wind and solar energy) can be achieved in 10 to 20 years even when, historically, such transitions have all taken 50 to 70 years;that sharply reducing GHG emissions in Canada will not cost very much or impair Canadian living standards very much, when the few steps that have been take so far have cost Ontario and Alberta alone tens of billions of dollars;that, even though federal and provincial governments already have over 600 programs, subsidies and regulations in place, adding a carbon dioxide tax is the additional ingredient that will sharply reduce emissions;that, even if one eliminated 100% of Canada’s emissions, or 1.6% of the global total, it would affect the future level of global emissions now growing every year due to developments in other countries (nine of the ten largest country emitters are not on track to meet their political commitments to reduce emissions by 2030); andthat making GHG emission reduction the pre-eminent goal of Canadian public policy and thereby sacrificing Canada’s economic, social and national unity goals will be feasible without dire effects for the country as a whole.Each of these theses stretches credibility. The whole package is so flawed as to be far beyond belief. Yet, so powerful and entrenched is the ideology behind them that doubters are portrayed as the “denier” of facts.Every one of these false claims seems to have a life of its own, but they are like Dracula – almost impossible to kill without a stake through the heart.

The above photo was taken at 5.16 pm on Friday 24 May 2019 from the western hills of Lower Hutt, looking towards Wellington Harbour. It was a calm late autumn evening and you will notice that the trees and fronds are surprisingly upright for a Wellington day. It has been less windy recently than usual in the capital, but then again, it often is less windy at this time of year. Don’t worry, the howling southerlies will make their presence felt when winter takes hold, which will be very soon.



No, this is not ‘View from your Window’. This photo was taken on the day that students and politicians were screaming about climate emergencies and how ‘we are not doing enough’. Yet, look at that photo again. What is there in that photo that we need to declare an emergency about?



Nelson and Canterbury have declared climate emergencies and it is rumoured, although not yet confirmed, that both Auckland and Wellington are about to do the same.



At the same time, _Stuff_ has appointed 17 year old Mia Sutherland as its guest editor on climate change. Honestly, it seems the world is being run by children these days.



Here are a few of the things that Mia has to say. quote.



You should change your lifestyle to reduce your negative impact on the environment because I want a future I can look forward to. And at the rate we’re going, I know my hope is unrealistic, to say the least. 



Try to reuse, repurpose, pass on, or fix the things you’re going to throw away. Make stock out of vegetable ends and bones. Create some cat toys out of toilet rolls (my sister did this and gave them to the SPCA). Cut your energy consumption by air-drying clothes. If you’re going to consume, try to do it responsibly. end quote.



I already do this… well, not the cat toys, but I hang out my washing and have a large store of plastic bags to reuse. Most older people are much more conscious about waste and conservation than younger generations. To be honest, my observation is that it is the young people who are least responsible about this. Think of all those placards that were a waste of cardboard and ink on Friday. quote.



It breaks my heart that across the globe those in power are showing me that they don’t care about my future. Their inaction tells me that they do not care about thousands of lives that are already threatened, and the many, many more that are to follow. **Why do they deny me a safe future? Why do they inflict this pain upon me? end quote.**



I can’t help but feel that this is nothing more than a self-centred rant. Climate change, if it is happening at all, is happening to everybody, but Mia seems to be taking it personally. Hint: it is not personal. If you die, as a result, you will not be alone. quote.



Please reconsider your actions. We are in danger and I am scared. It is a common sentiment shared by many at my age, as over 1 million students around the world prepare to walk out of school on May 24 to protest the inaction they see globally to combat climate change. 



[Stuff. ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/112939231/why-you-should-take-action-on-climate-change) end quote.



  
As you have put out a challenge, Mia, let me put one out to you. From now on, walk or cycle to school and everywhere else. Do not use a car. Ditch the cellphone, the iPad and cut your internet time in half. Take responsibility in your household for recycling. This is not about making cat toys. This is about reducing your consumption as much as anyone else’s.



Until you do these things, you have no right to expect anyone to take you seriously, and my prediction is that you will not do any of these things, because it is hard. If you don’t then all you are doing is producing a lot more hot air… and according to you, we already have enough of that.



In the meantime, as I look out of the window, I really wonder what there is to panic about. Why are we declaring states of emergency for things that cannot be seen, or heard, or felt or for the most part, experienced in any way? Or is Mia, like Greta Thunberg, another one who claims she can see CO2? The real world still looks perfectly fine to me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German government recently decided to exit from coal generated power by 2038, and now one expert says that the exit is going to cost handsomely, and bring zero result. Still, that 2038 target is too slow for some.
That’s how German politicians make decisions on things that concern the economy and environment. The German government’s aim of a coal phaseout is to contribute to protecting the climate. In reality, it will have no impact at all.
German online FOCUS magazine reports here: “80 billion euros are to be given to the affected regions and companies in the coming years as aid and compensation.”
But for some experts, the 2018 target date for completing the coal exit is too late, and thus risks seeing Germany emitting another 140 million tonnes of extra CO2 between 2020 and 2040 by exiting so slowly, so claims the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW).
To keep that 140 million ton figure in a global perspective, it is barely a drop in the bucket when compared to the 33 billion tonnes emitted globally and annually. The climate is not even going to notice it.
And over the next 20 years, global Co2 emissions could total 700 billion tonnes, which is a figure that is roughly 5000 times greater than the 140 million tons the DIW is bellyaching about and wishes to eliminate by speeding up the coal phaseout.
“The coal exit changes the CO2 emissions of the European Union by 0,” FOCUS quotes economics professor Christian Bayer of the University of Bonn at Twitter. “A German coal phase-out in itself only shifts emissions abroad.”
In summary, the 2038 coal exit will cost the German government (taxpayers) 80 billion euros, will have no effect on CO2 reductions, have no impact on climate, will ultimately lead to higher electricity costs, result in a more unstable grid, make Germany more dependent on foreign energy, and encourage companies to leave for places with more stable and cheaper electricity.

"Short Biography – Dr. Patrick Moore
Dr. Patrick Moore has been a leader in the international environmental field for over 40 years. He is a co-founder of Greenpeace and served for nine years as President of Greenpeace Canada and seven years as a Director of Greenpeace International. The leader of many Greenpeace campaigns (e.g. “Save the Whales”, seal hunting), he was a member of the Rainbow Warrior crew when the anti-nuclear testing ship was bombed in Auckland Harbour.  Dr. Moore was a driving force shaping policy and direction while Greenpeace became the world’s largest environmental activist organization.
He left Greenpeace in 1986 because of his concern at the anti-science and extreme political policies it was adopting; nevertheless, he remains passionately concerned about the environment and describes himself as a “sensible environmentalist”. This, of course makes him a most controversial figure as the current Greenpeace policies are not aligned with his “sensible” view.  He is visiting Australia to explain why his view of catastrophic global warming differs from that of the extreme green movement.

" Contributed by Professor Wyss Yim DSc PhD DIC FGSGeothermal heat: an episodic heat source in oceansPlate climatology (www.plateclimatology.com) is a theory introduced in 2014 by James Kamis.Unlike the Sun which is the first order driver of earth’s climate, it is an underestimated second order driver which can contribute significantly to regional natural variations. The overall theory contends that periods of active earth tectonics and volcanism can be correlated to periods of active climate change and/or climate related events.READ full paper here:ImpEng2017S geothermal ocean episodicGeothermal Heat and Arctic Sea Ice VariabilityContinuing his series of intriguing articles on the effects of volcanic eruptions on regional weather,Wyss Yim (Geology, 1971-74) has been examining the effect on the extent of Arctic sea ice.In previous issues of Imperial ENGINEER (Autumn 2013, Spring 2016, Autumn 2016, and Spring 2017), selected volcanic eruptions studied were found to have an important role in regional weather. Out of these, two eruptions releasing geothermal heat into oceans were particularly notable. The first eruption was entirely submarine, and the second eruption was initially submarine followed by bothsubmarine and sub-aerial activities. Both these eruptions were also responsible for causing the Arctic sea ice to undergo major retreat. In this article, satellite observation records in support of the two retreats are presented, provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Boulder.READ full paper here:ImpEng2018S geothermal ocean heat Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

You may wish to consider sending it to your family as well!Dear Family:On May 5, 2015, I wrote a heartfelt email to all of you …… [His thoughts today follow]Personal WealthOver the last 4 years Alberta’s net financial assets have decreased by $47 Billion. During that period the equity in Alberta housing has decreased by an estimated $27 Billion. Based on a population of 4.3 million, that means that every man woman and child is on average $15,000 poorer today than in 2015 – $60,000 for a family of four.JobsIn 2014, 431,000 individuals were employed in the resource sector while 467,000 were employed in education, healthcare and public administration. (all numbers from Statistics Canada). In late 2018, 401,000 individuals were employed in the resource sector while 551,000 were employed in education, healthcare and public administration. During that period the public sector added 84,000 jobs (18%) while that portion of the private sector shrank by 7%. The government’s share of total employment is now 23.2% – the highest in decades.TaxesCorporate and personal income taxes (provincial & federal) have increased dramatically and we now also have a carbon tax which was not mentioned in the NDP’s 2015 campaign.Cost of GovernmentEven after 4 very tough years, the cost per capita ($12,717 ) of delivering Alberta’s government services, continues to be 14% higher than the average cost for the 4 largest provinces. No attempt has been made to reduce those costs or otherwise balance them with the vastly reduced revenues experienced during the downturn.DebtWhen the NDP took over in 2015, Alberta had no provincial debt. The debt is forecast to be $71 Billion next year and is projected to grow to over $100 Billion in the next 4 years, IF the NDP are re-elected.What About all of the Other Social and Non-Financial Issues?Healthcare wait times? Average class sizes? New schools & hospitals? Environmental stewardship? Human rights? Personal freedoms? Commitment to the arts? The rights & freedoms of the LGBTQ and other defined groups? Other social issues?If the economy is not strong, the budget not balanced and the debt not brought under control, the province will not be able to afford to adequately deal with those issues. Our standard of living, which has already materially eroded under the NDP, will continue to deteriorate. Societies that put their financial house in order first have the flexibility to address the other needs and wants of the citizens. The extreme example of a country that followed the spend/borrow/tax/repeat path can be seen in the disaster that is Venezuela today.Who will have to pay back the debt?My generation will not be around to service the interest and repay the massive debt that your government has incurred. That burden will fall to my children and their cohort and to the children of that group. Interest on the debt, together with repayment of principal, will become an increasingly more painful annual cost which government can only fund with increased taxes – a vicious downward spiral.Living Within One’s MeansI am very proud of the fact that each and every one of you understands how to budget responsibly and that you are committed to living within your personal means. The Alberta government forecast says they will run another $6.9 Billion deficit this year, which means they will have to borrow those funds at ever-increasing rates because the province’s credit rating has been materially impaired. The City of Calgary continues to substantially live beyond its means with misplaced priorities and many programs introduced in better times and are now much too expensive to maintain and in some cases of questionable utility.The federal government’s aggregate deficit under the Liberals since 2015 is $60 Billion and the recent budget confirms they are planning to run further deficits totaling an additional $66 Billion over the next 4 years, IF re-elected.QuestionI only have one very important question for each of you:Do you think it is time for the Alberta government to exercise the same level of financial discipline and prudence that each of you is required to demonstrate in your personal lives?I am hopeful that your answer to that question will guide your decision at the ballot box on April 16th.Love,DadP.S.

There was a time, before the baby-boom generation took over, when we took pride in the achievements of our builders, producers and innovators. There was always great celebration when settler families got a phone, a tractor, a bitumen road or electric power. An oil strike or a gold discovery made headlines, and people welcomed new businesses, new railways and new inventions. Science and engineering were revered and the wealth delivered by these human achievements enabled the builders and their children to live more rewarding lives, with more leisure, more time for culture and crusades, and greater interest in taking more care of their environment.
Then a green snake entered the Garden of Eden.

"Every living thing needs access to energy – food, light and warmth.
But the UN is plotting to limit our access to energy.

A study of human history shows what a grave threat this poses to all of us.
Our distant ancestors were hunter-gatherers. They killed and ate wild animals, which provided much of their energy needs. Solar energy warmed their days, and gave life to the herbs, roots and fruits they gathered and to the grasses and shrubs that sustained their prey. Sunlight reflected from the moon allowed them to hunt and fish during moon-lit nights. The sun and moon dominated their world, so naturally many of them worshipped these heavenly bodies.
The invention of stone and wooden weapons and tools increased their access to energy – hunting and gathering was more efficient with tools.
The discovery of how to control fire multiplied man’s access to energy. Fire provided heat and light and could be used to clear vegetation, fight enemies and trap wild animals.
Hunter-gatherers need access to land, preferably free from competitors. This led to the development of territory with defined and defended property boundaries. Property rights are thus an essential ingredient to provide guaranteed access to food and energy.

Some hunters discovered they could harvest more food by maintaining their own tended plots of crops and vegetables and protecting domesticated goats, pigs, cattle and sheep from wild animals and poachers. Farms with fences allowed humans greatly increased access to the solar energy collected by plants and processed into human food by domesticated animals.
The long experiment with collective and tribal farming showed that individual farmers with secure property rights produce more food and are better at protecting the long term value of their land. Tribalism and open range grazing are key factors in the recurring famines in Africa.
Farmers soon realised that land with good soils, reliable water supplies and warm moist climate produces more food. A warrior class emerged to acquire and defend the tribe’s exclusive long-term access to these fertile fields.
Some tribes discovered they could trade their surplus food, tools or weapons for other goods in scarce supply. This free trade increased their access to food and energy.
Trade requires transport, and the use of oxen, horses, donkeys, mules and camels for transport was a great boost to trade. With a bridle and saddle, the horse allowed humans to hunt, patrol and defend a far larger territory.
The discovery of how to smelt metals from ores using charcoal provided another great leap in human access to energy. Metals made better ploughs, spears, swords, shields and digging forks.
But the giant leap for mankind was the progressive discovery of how to use that black shiny rock called “coal”; first in camp fires, then to smelt ores and, in a great energy leap, to power steam engines. Soon thousands of water pumps, factories, locomotives, traction engines, ships and electric generators were being driven by coal. Mankind gained access to an almost unlimited supply of energy via heat, light and motive power wherever it was needed.
The discovery of that other marvellous hydrocarbon, petroleum, gave humans access to a powerful source of portable energy. Tractors, trucks and buses replaced wagons, coaches, horses and bullocks, releasing more energy for humans.
This access to cheap reliable energy created widespread prosperity, families became smaller and people took more interest in conserving their heritage and environment.
Try to picture our world before we gained access to hydrocarbon energy – there was limited energy from wood, sun, wind and water but there were no trains, electricity, motor vehicles, appliances, hi-rise buildings, hi-tech hospitals or the millions of products produced by reliable electric-powered mining machinery, smelters, refineries, fabricators and factories. Famine and poverty were common occurrences and there was little concern for welfare, culture or the environment.
Cities which were choking in smog from open fires and boilers were also rescued by electricity – “the clean-coal-by-wire”. And in another bit of environmental serendipity, burning of these buried hydrocarbons is returning carbon dioxide to Earth’s carbon-deficient atmosphere to support more plant growth all over the globe.
We and the entire biosphere should celebrate having more CO2 in the atmosphere:
http://www.thegwpf.com/28155/
The harnessing of nuclear power then gave mankind the key to almost unlimited power for as long as people have enough sense to use it safely.
Earth’s growing human and animal population depend, more than ever, on maintaining this hard-won heritage of resources, rights, inventions and infrastructure. It is what ensures future access to reliable affordable food and energy.
Today the biggest threat to human well-being is the global war on carbon being run by climate-scare/sustainability zealots. They are trying to undermine and reverse centuries of discoveries and legal heritage.
But they know there is no practical possibility that we can reliably energise our world with the green energy of our ancestors, even if we smothered the surface with windmills and solar shades. Their secret dream is to destroy urbanised and industrialised humanity, ban private property and free trade, close the mines, factories, farms and fisheries, tear down the fences and dams and return the decimated human race to rationed, taxed and globally-controlled dormitories and urban play-grounds.
This is what these enemies of humanity really think:
“Giving society cheap, abundant energy would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun.”
-Prof Paul Ehrlich, Stanford University
“Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?”
-Maurice Strong, founder of the UN Environment Programme
“We must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and their projects. We must reclaim the roads and ploughed land, halt dam construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land. My three main goals would be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial infrastructure and see wilderness, with its full complement of species, returning throughout the world.”
-Dave Foreman, co-founder of Earth First!
“My vision is for a country, a society, a world where we don’t use any coal, oil, or natural gas because we have zero-emissions electricity in huge abundance,”
-Dr Alan Finkel, Australia’s new green government-appointed “Chief Scientist”.
And see here to learn what they think is “Unsustainable”: http://www.freedomadvocates.org/what-is-unsustainable/
These foes of freedom and their clandestine controllers are planning to forge the green chains of a global government for humanity in Paris next month.
They must not succeed.
We must defend our right to develop and use our own land, resources and property to produce abundant, reliable and affordable energy and food.
Tell our politicians: “Sign NOTHING that we can’t get out of, in Paris in December.”

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019   Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant and diplomat. Robert’s full bio can be read here. Financial markets constitute an increasingly prominent front in the war waged by those who believe that humans are causing catastrophic global warming against fossil fuel companies. One of their strategies has been to harness the power of institutional investors – such as mutual funds, pension funds and insurers – to lower the share prices of companies that do not “do enough” to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The mechanisms used include socially responsible investment funds (SRI or “green funds”) and initiatives such as the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) with its Investors Network on Climate Risk (INCR) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). These organizations have almost unlimited funds at their disposal to wage attacks on the energy industry and on large energy consumers; they can far outspend not only the few organizations skeptical about the climate catastrophe thesis but also many governments. They can influence investors with trillions of dollars at their disposal. Further, every year, their activities grow. Only a few academic studies have been done on the results of their efforts and even fewer empirical assessments of how much change they have achieved. However, I was recently made aware of a paper by Adam Harmes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that offered a thoughtful discussion of the theory behind the effort.[1] This article provides a simplified summary of the 20-page Harmes paper. Those who wish to learn more should refer to the longer paper. The Essence of the Theory Behind “Green Investment” Promotion The advocates of green investing with respect to climate change base their actions on a number of premises: That human-induced GHG emissions will cause higher global temperatures and other climate effects that will have adverse, potentially catastrophic, consequences;That the present and future damages associated with GHG emissions can be calculated in present value terms;That the global costs from climate change can cause genuine financial risks for firms and investors today;That once these risks are identified, institutional investors can promote emissions reduction through a two-stage process: first, using their power as shareholders to pressure firms to disclose their exposure to climate risks; and second, after disclosure, by pressuring companies into incorporating the climate risks into their investment decision-making. Specifically, the advocates of this approach want to promote “investment switching” (i.e. reduction of investment in high-emissions firms and activities and an increase of investment in so-called “green” or “clean” firms and activities often related to wind and solar energy and other favoured businesses). The mechanism by which this allegedly could work is by changing the price of the firm’s shares and thus bringing shareholder and Board of Governors pressure to bear on corporate management. Rarely do studies of this assess the actual incentives created by climate “risk” or the likely effects of the pressures applied to different types of institutional investors. The article aims to assess the two main assumptions that underpin investor environmentalism through carbon disclosure: the power of institutional investors and the “business case” for companies to invest in climate change mitigation. The Power of Institutional Investors There are different types of institutional investors; the incentives that drive investment decisions vary considerably among them. Mutual fund companies sell mutual funds to the public and/or manage institutional funds on behalf of pensions, insurers and foundations. A growing number of them (over 60%) delegate the management of their portfolios to external investment companies. Pension funds are composed of trustees who oversee the fund, as well as fund managers who conduct the actual asset selection. They have a legally-mandated “fiduciary duty” to minimize risk, maximize returns and preserve capital. They also tend to use both in-house and external fund managers. Insurers are publicly-listed companies that also have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize revenues for both shareholders and policy holders. The fourth category includes large hedge funds and private equity funds, as well as various foundations. Hedge funds and private equity funds operate in a more competitive environment than other investment companies. A significant finding is that, like corporate managers, fund managers operate in a “structural context” that severely limits their ability to take into account any non-market investment criteria when assessing investments. If the fund manager did so and the fund underperformed compared to others, even for only a year, the fund manager would be out of a job. Active fund managers simply are not able to take climate change into account for non-market or “ethical” reasons. After examining the institutional environments in which these different institutional investors operate and what specifically motives the people who make the investment decisions, Harmes observes: “Overall, the specific incentives and constraints faced by different institutional investors lead to two initial conclusions about the potential effectiveness of investor environmentalism. The first is that, with the exception of certain public defined benefit pension funds, SRI funds and foundations, most ‘mainstream’ institutional investors will not be able to promote climate change mitigation for non-market or ethical reasons, although some may do so in a ‘soft” manner for their own reputational reasons. While most proponents of investor environmentalism emphasize the business rather than the ethical case, this conclusion is relevant in terms of empirically assessing the actual practices of investor environmentalism. Specifically, if the investors who are most strongly promoting climate change mitigation are primarily the public defined-benefit pension funds, SRI funds and foundations, it provides an indication of the weakness of the business case, as they are likely doing so for ethical rather than business reasons, even though they may discursively frame their activities in business terms.” Even worse for the theory of environmental investing, if a number of ‘ethically-motivated” investors sold off the shares of a company that they considered to have poor environmental performance, causing the stock price to drop, other investors, through a process known as ‘arbitrage”, would view that company as under-valued in market terms and would quickly purchase its shares, causing the stock price to soon return to its original value. “Even if all institutional investors, with the exception of hedge funds, could be convinced to allocate their capital on an ethical or reputational basis, their investment-switching activities would still be rendered ineffective by hedge funds.” The Business Case for Companies to Invest in Climate Change Mitigation The business case for investor environmentalism argues that climate change already creates real financial costs for firms, in the form of six varieties of climate risk: regulatory risk, exposure to the physical effects of climate change, product risk, risk to reputation, energy costs and exposure to climate change litigation. (Those who take a skeptical view might note that most of these risks are the direct result, not of climate change, but of the political activities of the advocates of climate alarm.) The case further argues that disclosure of these costs will create market incentives for institutional shareholders. Harmes considers that the business case fails at the theoretical level. Exposure to Costs and Regulatory Risks The largest emitters do not bear the costs of the emissions they produce; they are borne by the world.Measuring a firm’s carbon dioxide emissions or broader “environmental footprint” is not the same as putting a price on them; someone has to calculate this value, but even if they do, externality costs are not real in accounting terms, because firms do not pay them unless governments try to impose the costs in other ways. If companies face the risk of being regulated or taxed by governments due to their emissions, why would these risks and costs not create an incentive for the firms to act even without investor environmentalism? In countries where governments already impose carbon taxes and stringent environmental regulations, why is investor environmentalism also needed? Exposure to the Physical effects of Climate Change Exposure to extreme weather events (assuming present emissions even cause extreme weather events) will only affect a firm’s costs in certain circumstances; even if the costs were generally felt, this would create an incentive to pay for adaptation that would specifically benefit the firm, not mitigation. Product Risk The product risk is the risk that a company will experience declining sales of its “climate-unfriendly” products (e.g. “I am going to stop riding in oil-powered vehicles to protest Shell’s production of gasoline!”). More likely, product risk is simply an extension of regulatory risk and therefore is dependent on government action. Again, If the government is already acting, why is investor activism needed? Risk to Reputation Most risks to reputation that lead to investment-switching result from specific environmental events – such as oil spills, chemical leaks or illegal dumping – rather than from a general lack of action on broadly-caused environmental issues like climate change. It is almost impossible for investors to assess an individual firm’s climate-related reputational risk. “Ethical consumerism” is limited to a small number of participating consumers; where it has been successful, it is generally the result of NGO campaigns. Energy Costs The risk of “energy cost” increase is generally related to the potential for new and higher energy taxes. Where it concerns increased energy market prices, the fossil fuel producers stand to gain, not lose. Litigation Risk The risk of litigation is primarily in the United States (although it is coming to Canada). Here the claims of liability are at best uncertain and often outside “the frontiers of existing legal doctrines”. Some Real-Life Evidence When the Carbon Disclosure Project sought to survey its signatory investors on the extent to which they made use of CDP data, only 80 of 385 even responded to the survey. In other words, simple participation in an investor environmentalism initiative should not be viewed as evidence that investors are incorporating climate change into their investment decision-making. A 2008 study on investor environmentalism among UK fund managers found that “virtually without exception, the interviewees cited the EU ETS (European Union Emission Trading System) as the critical – and, in many cases, the only – driver for them explicitly to consider climate change in their investment analysis.” In other words, fund managers are far more likely to respond to present financial costs than to prospective and poorly-defined future risks. Conclusion Harmes concludes that the potential of using institutional investors to create real financial incentives for climate change mitigation, through share price performance, has been considerably overestimated. There is not even a strong theoretical case for why “carbon disclosure” should work in this regard. “This suggests that, even if all firms disclosed carbon risks in a complete and usable way, mainstream investors are unlikely to incorporate them due to the inherent weakness of the business case, while the actions of ethically-motivated investors will be counteracted by arbitrage.” Harmes’ article, of course, has not persuaded the large number of well-funded SRIs, politically-motivated investment funds, and certain international finance organizations from continuing to “name and shame”, intimidate, harass, and lobby against investors in fossil fuel industries and other firms that fail to adhere to the catastrophe thesis. Even if such bullying tactics have only limited chances of success in altering investor behaviour, they seem intended to serve a broader political objective.~~~~[1] Adam Harmes. “The Limits of Carbon Disclosure: Theorizing the Business Case for Investor Environmentalism”.

"LOS ANGELES  —   It was a surprise photo finish at the weekend box office, with the   drama “Hidden Figures” and “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” each selling an estimated $22 million in tickets at North American theaters. Most analysts had expected “Rogue One” (Disney) to easily repeat as the No. 1 multiplex attraction. The “Star Wars” spinoff has now collected about $477. 3 million over four weeks. Overseas, it has taken in another $437 million. But in its first weekend in wide release “Hidden Figures” (20th Century Fox) about unsung black heroines in the NASA space race of the 1960s, was lifted by strong reviews, an aggressive   marketing campaign that included a   appeal to faith audiences, and attention on Hollywood’s annual awards circuit. Fox said “Hidden Figures,” directed by Theodore Melfi and starring Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monáe, did particularly well in San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and Cleveland. Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, “Hidden Figures” received an   grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. The movie was most popular with women (64 percent of the audience) and people over the age of 35 (about 56 percent of attendees). The animated musical “Sing” (Universal) was next in line, taking in about $20 million, for a   domestic total of $213. 4 million. The weekend’s other new   movie, “Underworld: Blood Wars” (Sony) only managed $13 million in ticket sales, or nearly 50 percent less than the initial results for its 2012 franchise predecessor. Sony noted that “Blood Wars” also cost half as much to make  —   about $35 million  —   and has already taken in $45 million overseas. Sony also blamed winter storms in the Eastern United States for decreasing turnout. Among specialty releases: “Manchester by the Sea” (Roadside Attractions) sold about $2. 5 million in tickets in 1, 054 theaters, lifting its total to $34 million “Patriots Day” (CBS Films and Lionsgate) about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, had $105, 000 in seven locations, ahead of its nationwide release on Friday."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCO2 concentrations rose from 345 ppm to 398 ppm in the 29 years from 1985 to 2014. Mainstream scientists sympathetic to the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) paradigm have nonetheless reported the overall greenhouse effect forcing has been flat to declining throughout this period.
1. Cess and Udelhofen, 2003  Due to the downward trend in cloud cover, absorbed shortwave radiation increased and the overall greenhouse effect’s forcing influence declined from 1985-1999. The authors consider these trends to be driven by natural variability.

Image Source: Cess and Udelhofen, 2003
2. Song et al., 2016  The overall greenhouse effect went on “hiatus” from 1992-2014, with the combined forcing effects of water vapor, cloud, and CO2 declining by -0.04 W/m² per year (-0.4 W/m² per decade) during this interval. Again, the main reason for the declining greenhouse effect trend was the downward trend in cloud cover.

Image Source: Song et al., 2016
3. Kato et al., 2018   Downward longwave radiation (DLR), or the overall greenhouse effect, responds to variability in water vapor and cloud. CO2 isn’t mentioned in the paper as a factor influencing DLR. Total DLR was negative (-0.2 W/m²) during this decade, insinuating rising CO2 had no net warming climate impact. In contrast, downward shortwave forcing increased by +2.2 W/m² per decade from 1986-2000 and by +1.3 W/m² from 2005-2014. These positive shortwave absorption trends explain the warming during this period.

" © 2019Friends of Science Society has received a number of inquiries about a recent terrifying article in the Washington Post. To help calm people down, we are publishing a response to one of our readers.The statement “if Greenland’s Ice mass would melt ..” is as meaningless as “if the Moon crashed into the Earth …” or “if pigs could fly …”.The total volume of the Greenland ice sheet is approximately 2,900,000 km3. Its mass is 2,900,000 Giga tonnes (Gt). The IPCC estimates the ice sheet lost 215 Gt per year over the period 2002 – 2011, corresponding to 0.6 mm annual sea level rise.  At that rate it would take 2,900,000/215 = 13,488 years to melt.However, there are several ways to estimate the rate of ice melt and the IPCC only uses the method that gives the highest melt rate. This paper says “Luthcke and others (2006) also reported a mass gain of 54 Gt a–1 at elevations >2000 m and a loss of 155 Gt a–1 at elevations <2000 m, with an overall net mass loss of the GIS from 2003 to 2005 of 101 ± 16 Gt a–1.  Using this lower rate of ice loss, it would take 2,900,000/101 = 28,713 years to melt.This paper says “The net balance changed from a small loss of 7 ± 3 Gt a–1 in the 1990s to 171 ± 4 Gt a–1 for 2003–07, contributing 0.5 mm a–1 to recent global sea-level rise. This rate implies 16,959 years to melt.The FUND integrated assessment model calculates the social cost of sea level rise for the global total and 16 regions including Canada. The sea level impact for Canada of sea level rise according to FUND is US$-22 million. The impact of storms, agriculture, health and energy combined is US$8,735 million. [I applied a correction to the energy impact due to new research.] The positive impact of these sectors is 395 times greater than the negative impact of sea level rise.On a global basis, the positive impact of storms, agriculture, health and energy combined is 109 times greater than the negative impact of sea level rise.  As a fraction of GDP, the cost of sea level rise from 2018 to 2100 is 0.004% of global GDP in 2100.Therefore, there is no reason to fear sea level rise.Ken Gregory, P.Eng.Friends of ScienceSeventeen years of providing independent        climate science information ———-Related post by Ron Clutz of Science Matters:https://rclutz.wordpress.com/2019/08/25/greenland-glaciers-history-vs-hysteria/ Related post by Maria Assunção Araújo  – Porto 2018 Basic Climate Science ConferenceGreenland Maria_Assunção_Araújo Porto Conf 2018 If you like our work, we would love to have you join us as a member and donate to the cause of common sense on science and energy policies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterData from the University of Rutgers show that northern hemisphere snow cover in the fall and winter have trended upwards since data recording began in 1967.
The following chart shows northern hemisphere snow cover for fall, where we see a formidable upward trend:

Next we see the chart for wintertime northern hemisphere snow cover. Though the trend is not as pronounced as it is in the fall, the trend has been modestly upward.

Finally we look at the latest Arctic ice volume data from PIOMASS:

As we can observe, Arctic ice mass has in fact stabilized over the recent decade after having shrunk during the previous 2001-2010 decade.
It should be noted that data going back to 1900 show that Arctic sea ice AREA had been low as well during the 1930 to 1960 period before reaching a peak in the 1970s and 1980s.

In summary, nothing to worry about up in the Arctic.

According to both the general public and to our readers the government should **NOT** declare a Climate Emergency.



The MSM poll when we last checked had a **77% majority against** declaring an emergency.



Our blog poll had an even stronger no vote with **98% against** an emergency declaration.



Our Blog poll was taken by **1596** individuals at last count.

"Dear Sir,
Here in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, I am truly dismayed by the unbridled hysterical approach to counter “Climate Change” (newspeak for ‘Global Warming’) taken by both of our Provincial and Federal Governments. Coal burning electricity generating stations have been shutdown to reduce CO2 emissions. Our new Liberal Party federal government has ratified The Paris Framework on Climate Change. Kingroot Apk Online
My biggest concern and fear comes from the declaration that carbon dioxide is a pollutant to be reduced as much as possible. Given that human beings exhale CO2, it does not take much imagination to conceive that the vast majority of human kind and our myriad activities will be put under some kind of Orwellian control.
Please send me your newsletter.192.168.0.1 I would like to be better informed about what is happening in our world from your groups perspective about ‘Climate Change caused by human life and activities’ nonsense. This is a subtle, tricky, superficially plausible but totally fallacious idea that somehow is being touted as truth.
Very Sincerely,
Daniel.

Most educated people say climate change threatens disaster. The few sceptics are denounced as climate deniers. All governments are firm believers. This consensus was underlined last week when Cyclone Nilam hit India and Hurricane Sandy hit the US. Greens, journalists and politicians declared this was proof of climate change.



However, words are cheap, actions speak for themselves. Since global warming will raise sea levels and increase hurricane damage, the future of beachfront property and coastal cities should be bleak. People should be withdrawing to safety inland. But, people are rushing into coastal areas.



New York was swamped by Hurricane Sandy. Columnists wondered how New York and other US coastal cities would cope with rising seas caused by global warming, especially in the hurricane‐​prone east coast and Caribbean coast. Yet, property prices keep rising unabated in these regions.



The Gulf of Kutch and Gulf of Cambay have the highest tides in India. Hurricanes cause the most damage when combined with high tides, since storm‐​water cannot drain away. But are people and businesses fleeing these areas? No, industries, ports and cities are proliferating, including new port cities like Mundra, Pipavav, Dholera and Simar. Krishnapatnam and Kakinada are coming up in Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra is getting new port cities at Jaigarh, Dighi and Dabhol. The list is endless.



And population is booming and property prices skyrocketing in all old coastal cities including Mumbai and Chennai. Beachfront properties are affordable only by millionaires.



So, people’s words suggest fear of global warming, but their wallets suggest no fear at all. What explains this duality? Greens complain that people are not sufficiently aware of climate change. But people who buy urban and beachfront property are not illiterates who haven’t heard of global warming. They are among the richest and savviest, the sort most likely to worry about climate change, not just as a global problem but as one threatening their investments in coastal industries, flats and beach resorts.



Can humans be so myopic that they ignore long‐​term warming threats? No, if this were true, you would not have such a wide consensus on warming. Bloggers across the world say Hurricane Sandy shows a warming disaster is already upon us. The alarm of a thousand green blogs is hardly contested by sceptics. Yet, words of warning are not matched by withdrawal from the coast. Not even Al Gore, green Nobel laureate, is withdrawing from his coastal residence in Delaware. New Orleans was wrecked by Hurricane Katrina.



Residents know it can happen again, yet the city is being rebuilt. Neighbouring cities in the hurricane belt are booming. US population is shifting massively from north‐​central states to coastal states, especially in the hurricane‐​prone south. China too has seen a massive movement of people and investment to coastal cities in its hurricane belt.



Greens might argue that people expect the world to lick global warming by cracking down on carbon emissions and, hence, view coastal investments as safe. That’s implausible. The US refuses to accept the Kyoto Convention. China now emits more carbon than the US, and India is on the same path. All three are taking limited steps to check emissions, but none accepts a binding target, and none is even close to the truly drastic reductions that the IPCC deems essential for safety.



Intelligent investors know there is no political will for the necessary carbon cuts. Then why do they keep piling into coastal locations?



An important part of the answer must be that their belief in global warming is quite shallow, more political correctness than deep conviction. Yes, they see some danger. But they do not see it as dangerous enough to change their lifestyle and investment style.



In effect, they expect some adaptation to solve the problem, avoiding any drastic sacrifices. The world has always faced a hundred problems, and has often mitigated these through new technology and other forms of adaptation without necessarily solving them. Eco‐​fundamentalists are opposed to adaptation to global warming: they want prevention. But prevention is costly, and lacks political will in key emitting countries. People are rushing into coastal cities: their wallets suggest they think adaptation will be enough even without drastic carbon cuts.



They have reason to be sanguine. Much of Holland is below sea level but it has adapted to cope. Pat Michaels of the Cato Institute shows that the sea level at Atlantic City has risen 16 inches in the last 100 years, more than the predicted rise in the next century by IPCC. Yet, Atlantic City has adapted so well that residents are scarcely aware of it. Surely Mumbai, Chennai and other coastal cities will adapt too.



Damage caused by hurricanes has risen stridently in the last 50 years. But that’s mainly because more buildings keep coming up in hurricane belts, covered by hurricane insurance. Weak construction collapses in hurricanes. But Bermuda experienced zero housing collapses even in a Category 5 hurricane because its building codes ensured hurricane‐​proof construction. Such adaptation is expensive, but is cheaper than giving up coal. With luck, new technology will provide cheap solar energy, ending the emission problem. If not, adaptation will be a viable alternative.

" Contributed by Drieu Godefridi © 2019I see three motives that make it necessary to classify environmentalism among totalitarian ideologies in the strict sense.The first is that environmentalism does not make any secret of its will to control the entirety of human action. Indeed, the environmentalism claims to control each of the human activities emitting CO2. However, there is no human gesture, as tiny as it is – the simple act of breathing – which is not emitting CO2. Therefore, environmentalism claims to control the entirety of human action.The academic literature leaves no more doubt on this subject than the innumerable media variations. So man must give up the plane because it emits CO2. The car is one of the misdeeds of the past, because the automobile emits CO2, directly in the case of “ICE -Internal Combustion Engine” vehicles, indirectly when it comes to electric vehicles. Man must give up tourism, pleasure travel, traveling without rhyme or motive – or even with just cause. We must of course give up meat consumption because cattle farming emits CO2. “Veganism”, formerly the privilege of a tiny minority, is now a “scientific” obligation. Even the fact of having children should be hindered: because a child is the worst source of CO2 that can be conceived.Not only do environmentalists claim total control of human action, but they are proud of this claim.By way of comparison, it is interesting to note that while the great totalitarian ideologies of the past – National Socialism, Communism – claimed to be involved in all aspects of individual life, none have ever claimed or even conceptualized control as complete as the one environmentalists claim. Traveling in the USSR was narrowly limited by the poor availability of transport, but it never occurred to any communist ideologue to make problematical the very fact of moving. Holidays were limited in the communist countries, because the material means were limited, but never were the leave, the beach, the meat, even less the fact of having children, considered as an anti-social act, crime or problem in itself .From this point of view, the totalitarian purity of environmentalism is unprecedented.Two, a totalitarian ideology is defined by the objectification of an enemy; an element within the social body that must be confined, or even eradicated, to allow the advent of the final stage of human society, when the class barriers that had stratified nations for thousands of years would dissolve, or the racially pure socialist society. As early as 1920 in his speech Warum sind wir Antisemiten, pronounced in Munich, Adolf Hitler theorized socialism as being able to triumph only within a nation, Germany, by the purification of its race – thus the expulsion of the element that he presents as his negation: the Jew. Marx, who was exonerated of the crimes of communism by generation of intellectuals, is their direct author in the realm of ideas, with for example the concept of Volksrache, ie the recommendation by Marx of the legal lynching of enemies of the regime – the bourgeois and other “revisionists” – after the revolution has prevailed.Neither Jew nor bourgeois in ecological theology, and yet a properly “agonistic” logic, as it was said in ancient Athens. All contemporary ecological theory is defined by its rejection, its detestation, its execration of the human CO2, thus in the last analysis of man. The enemy of environmentalism is in all of us; it resides in this substance which transcends any consideration of class, race or culture: our very humanity. The enemy of the environmentalist is the man and the imagined “Garden of Eden-Earth” of the environmentalist would have been peeled of the human crust.Having worked for a long time on the subject of socialism, in its German and communist nationalist slopes, I was struck by the great sincerity, the candor of their authors, who never made a mystery of the atrocities they intended to commit. In this almost naive contemplation of to the abomination, thrown to the cantonnade, trumpeted, announced with rage and eagerness to act, resides, in my opinion, the third characteristic of totalitarianism. All the debate on the theme “we did not know” the genocide of the Jews by the National Socialists takes a surrealist turn when we measure that it is the whole of the national-socialist theoretical corpus which, since the first writings, the first harangues, point jauntily towards the massacre of the Jew perceived as possessing, animated of a spirit of lucre which would be the antithesis of German socialism. Marx, as we have seen, theorised about violence and civil war as a means of gaining access to power, but especially as a technique of government. National Socialists and Marxists did what they had announced, and massacred millions as soon as they had the opportunity.It would obviously be foolish to blame the environmentalists for the slightest crime; they have reached power nowhere. Green parties are around 10 per cent in the countries where they do best, and in the European Parliament.But their project and objectives are undoubtedly clear: it is about reducing humanity to a tiny fraction of what it is. Such was the recommendation of Hans Jonas, probably the most influential ecologist theorist of the twentieth century, such is today the recommendation of most intellectuals and environmental activists, consistent with their theoretical axioms. Get rid of nine-tenths of humanity ... How? This is an aspect of the program on which the ideologues remain the most discreet. Not all. Paul Ehrlich, probably the most read American ecologist since the sixties, author of “The Population Bomb ”  – the environmentalists did not talk about CO2 then, only overpopulation – advocated the sterilisation of the people who reproduce “like rabbits” (sic), a racist and contemptuous expression that targeted Indians and Pakistanis. If massive vasectomy is not enough, Dr. Ehrlich continued, then sterilizing substances must be poured into the drinking water. That would be the “final solution” – the expression is Hans Jonas, in an interview with “Der Spiegel” in 1992 – to the “ecological problem”.Environmentalism is a totalitarian ideology in the strict sense, more radical in its homicidal claims than any of its predecessors.—–Drieu’s new book is available on Amazonhttps://www.amazon.fr/L%C3%A9cologisme-nouveau-totalitarisme-Drieu-Godefridi/dp/2930650222 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"By Geoff Derrick.
Our Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull lives on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour, and is in a favoured position to observe the climate moods and weather of the Sydney area in the 21st Century.
However, he should be aware that a considerable database exists that scientifically documents the climate history of Sydney Harbour and adjacent beaches, mainly temperature and sea levels, at least from the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788.  When Captain Philip arrived in 1788 and landed at Sydney Cove, he quickly established a weather recording framework to help him better understand what the climate trends might be in this new colony.  
Over a three year period from 1788 to 1791, two officers Bradley and Dawes recorded temperatures in the fledgling colony 6 times a day.  A log of this data was found in 1977 in a remote corner of the Library of the Royal Society of London, and the data were analysed and plotted by Gergis, Karoly and Allan in 2009. They compared the First Fleet data with BOM data from the Sydney Observatory for the period 1859 to 2014, using monthly averages for Tmaximum and Tminimum.  A graph comparing the First Fleet data set 1788-1791 with the BOM data set 1859 to 2014 is shown below, for Tmax.

Remarkably, the First Fleet data (red circles), are almost totally coincident with the later BOM record 1859 to 2014 (green dots); the same result is seen also for average minimum temperatures, and so Malcolm could justifiably claim that in the Sydney area there has been no change in trend of maximum and minimum temperatures over 256 years.
Data from the Fort Denison tide gauge in the harbour also shows an almost stable sea level trend for 129 years from 1886 to present day.  In addition, a fisherman’s hut built in 1875 along the high water mark at Long Reef, Collaroy has been photographed in 1907, 1936, 1950 and 2014; remarkably, it exists in precisely the same position now as in 1875, and Malcolm could also justifiably claim that in the Sydney northern beaches there has been no documented sea level rise for about 140 years.

Fungi play an important role in the ecosystem by decomposing plant and animal debris into nutrients and simpler compounds. Credit Susan V. Fisk
When we think of climate change, we tend to think about greenhouse gases, fossil fuels and pollution. Most of us don’t think about fungi.
But Kathleen Treseder does. Treseder, an ecologist at the University of California, Irvine, studies how fungi can affect climate and vice-versa.
“Fungi are important to consider,” she says. “They can influence nearly every aspect of ecosystems, especially processes that occur in soils.”
New research from her lab shows that fungi can have different lifestyles in response to climate change. These findings can be incorporated into computational models that simulate ecosystems.
“We may be able to better predict shifts in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and climate change,” says Treseder. “That can help us estimate how much, when and where climate change will affect human societies.”
It’s important to be able to forecast which places will be hit by climate change and how quickly. These early warnings can help preparations, such as building sea walls or flood channels, or direct the development of new crop varieties.
Fungi are terrific decomposers. They break down organic material to get nutrients and energy. In doing so, they turn complex chemicals into simpler elements, such as carbon. In fact, “fungi are an integral part of the global carbon cycle,” says Treseder. “They can move carbon from decomposing material into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.”
But fungi don’t just release carbon. They can also store it. For example, environmental stress can cause fungi to strengthen their cell walls. They do so by using organic compounds that contain carbon. These carbon compounds can stay in soils for years to decades or even longer.
Treseder’s research explores how fungi decide whether to use limited energy and resources to decompose material or for other processes. “No one can do everything well, and the same goes for fungi,” says Treseder. “If fungi invest resources into one activity like decomposition, then those resources won’t be available to support another activity like tolerating environmental stress.”
These resource allocation decisions become even more important in a world with changing climate. “For example, will more extreme climates select for fungi that tolerate stress well, but cannot decompose dead material as efficiently?” says Treseder. “If so, then their production of carbon dioxide might decrease, slowing climate change.”
To answer these questions, Treseder traveled to Alaska and Costa Rica. Experiments were set up in Alaskan Boreal forests and the cloud forests of Costa Rica. ”
“We chose these locations because they are both endangered by climate change,” says Treseder. “Northern ecosystems are warming particularly fast. Clouds are disappearing from the mountaintops of Costa Rica.”
Treseder and colleagues exposed areas of the forests to drought-like conditions or more mellow environments. They collected soil samples from the different experimental areas.
Then they analyzed products made by fungal genes. These gene products served as indicators for whether the fungi were investing more resources toward decomposition or strengthening cell walls.
“We found that where drought stress increased, the amount of fungi that invested more in strengthening cell walls and less in decomposition tended to increase,” says Treseder. In contrast, in more moderate conditions, the reverse occurred. Fungi that decomposed more efficiently became more common.
These findings suggest that fungi might store more carbon as global climate becomes more extreme. On the other hand, they might release more carbon dioxide in moderate climates. “These opposing feedbacks would not have been apparent without examining trade-offs among fungal traits,” says Treseder.
Treseder is working to incorporate these findings into new and existing models of climate change. One particular area of focus are Earth system models that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses for its official predictions. “We hope our research improves predictions of future trajectories of climate change,” says Treseder.
###
Treseder presented her research at the 2019 International Annual Meeting of the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America and Soil Science Society of America. This research was funded by the US Department of Energy and National Science Foundation.

Black Hole Nurtures Baby Stars a Million Light-Years Away

Back to Gallery
Black holes are famous for ripping objects apart, including stars. But now, astronomers have uncovered a black hole that may have sparked the births of stars over a mind-boggling distance, and across multiple galaxies.
If confirmed, this discovery, made with NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes, would represent the widest reach ever seen for a black hole acting as a stellar kick-starter. The black hole seems to have enhanced star formation more than one million light-years away. (One light year is equal to 6 trillion miles.)
“This is the first time we’ve seen a single black hole boost star birth in more than one galaxy at a time,” said Roberto Gilli of the National Institute of Astrophysics (INAF) in Bologna, Italy, lead author of the study describing the discovery. “It’s amazing to think one galaxy’s black hole can have a say in what happens in other galaxies millions of trillions of miles away.”
A black hole is an extremely dense object from which no light can escape. The black hole’s immense gravity pulls in surrounding gas and dust, but particles from a small amount of that material can also get catapulted away instead at nearly the speed of light. These fast-moving particles form two narrow beams or “jets” near the poles of the black hole.
The supermassive black hole scientists observed in the new study is located in the center of a galaxy about 9.9 billion light-years from Earth. This galaxy has at least seven neighboring galaxies, according to observations with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).
Using the National Science Foundation’s Karl Jansky Very Large Array, scientists had previously detected radio-wave emission from a jet of high-energy particles that is about a million light-years long. The jet can be traced back to the supermassive black hole, which Chandra detected as a powerful source of X-rays produced by hot gas swirling around the black hole. Gilli and colleagues also detected a diffuse cloud of X-ray emission surrounding one end of the radio jet. This X-ray emission is most likely from a gigantic bubble of hot gas heated by the interaction of the energetic particles in the radio jet with surrounding matter.
As the hot bubble expanded and swept through four neighboring galaxies, it could have created a shock wave that compressed cool gas in the galaxies, causing stars to form.  All four galaxies are approximately the same distance, about 400,000 light years, from the center of the bubble. The authors estimate that the star formation rate is between about two to five times higher than typical galaxies with similar masses and distance from Earth.
“The story of King Midas talks of his magic touch that can turn metal into gold,” said co-author Marco Mignoli, also of INAF in Bologna, Italy. “Here we have a case of a black hole that helped turn gas into stars, and its reach is intergalactic.”
Astronomers have seen many cases where a black hole affects its surroundings through “negative feedback” – in other words, curtailing the formation of new stars. This can occur when the black hole’s jets inject so much energy into the hot gas of a galaxy, or galaxy cluster, that the gas can’t cool down enough to make large numbers of stars.
In this newly discovered collection of galaxies, astronomers have found a less common example of “positive feedback,” where the black hole’s effects increase star formation. Moreover, when astronomers previously encountered positive feedback, it either involved increases in the star formation rate of 30% or less, or it occurred over scales of only about 20,000 to 50,000 light years on a nearby companion galaxy. Whether the feedback is positive or negative depends on a delicate balance between the heating rate and cooling rate of a cloud. That is because clouds that are initially cooler when hit by a shock wave are more prone to experience positive feedback, and form more stars.
“Black holes have a well-earned reputation for being powerful and deadly, but not always,” said co-author Alessandro Peca, formerly at INAF in Bologna and now a Ph.D. student at the University of Miami. “This is a prime example that they sometimes defy that stereotype and can be nurturing instead.”
The researchers used a total of six days of Chandra observing time spread out over five months.
“It’s only because of this very deep observation that we saw the hot gas bubble produced by the black hole,” said co-author Colin Norman of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “By targeting objects similar to this one, we may discover that positive feedback is very common in the formation of groups and clusters of galaxies.”
A paper describing these results has been published in the most recent issue of the journal “Astronomy and Astrophysics” and is available online.

"Key IPCC quotes
The fifth and latest IPCC assessment report, published in 2013, showed that climate models failed to predict the absence of warming from 1998 and 2012, and that climate scientists have no clear idea of why they failed. (NB. I have added the bolding in the following extracts.)

“… the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05 [–0.05 to 0.15] °C per decade) … is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] °C per decade).” [WG I SPM, page 5, section B.1, bullet point 3, and in full Synthesis Report on page SYR-6]
“… an analysis of the full suite of CMIP5 historical simulations (…) reveals that 111 out of 114 realisations show a GMST trend over 1998–2012 that is higher than the entire HadCRUT4 trend ensemble ….” [WGI contribution, chapter 9, text box 9.2, page 769, and in full Synthesis Report on page SYR-8]
“There may also be a contribution from forcing inadequacies and, in some models, an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing (dominated by the effects of aerosols).” [WG I SPM, section D.1, page 15, bullet point 2, and full Synthesis Report on page SYR-8]
“This difference between simulated [i.e. model output] and observed trends could be caused by some combination of (a) internal climate variability, (b) missing or incorrect radiative forcing and (c) model response error“. [WGI contribution, chapter 9, text box 9.2, page 769]

IN MY SIMPLER WORDS …
1 – According to statistical practices the trend in temperature from 1998 to 2012 (the 15 years prior to the report being drafted) falls somewhere between slight warming and slight cooling. In other words there is no certainty that any warming occurred.
2 – Despite claims of the accuracy of climate models most of the model runs (97%) wrongly predicted warming from 1998 to 2012.
3 – The IPCC is admitting that “some models” – we are not told how many, so maybe it’s almost all – exaggerate the influence of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
4 – The models could be wrong for a number of very basic and general reasons; the IPCC really doesn’t know why the models failed.

Friday, the world was treated to the latest, greatest report on global warming from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the form of its _Fifth Assessment Report_. It is an embarrassment of internal inconsistency, entirely self‐​serving, and is beyond misleading.



That’s because the IPCC is more intent on maintaining the crumbling “consensus” on global warming than on following climate science to its logical conclusion; a conclusion that increasingly suggests that human greenhouse gas emissions are less important in driving climate change than commonly held.



That’s right, the latest climate science (some 10 studies published in just the past 3 years) indicates that the earth’s climate sensitivity—that is, how much the global average surface temperature will rise as a result of greenhouse gases emitted from human activities—is some 33 percent _less_ than scientists thought at the time of the last IPCC Assessment, published in 2007.





The IPCC misleads policymakers around the world.



A little climate 101: climate sensitivity is one of the key parameters for understanding the future impacts from climate change.



Virtually all elements of climate are related in some way to changes in the earth’s average temperature.



The less the earth warms up, the fewer the resulting impacts, and the lower the urgency to try to do something to alleviate them.



Meaning, initiatives like President Obama’s Climate Action Plan—the motivation for such things as the EPA’s just‐​announced effective moratorium on future coal‐​fired power plants—would be even more unnecessary and ineffective than they are already.



The IPCC is not altogether blind to the new scientific findings indicating a lower climate sensitivity, but it barely pays them lip‐​service in its new report.



It can’t.



Why?



The meat of the new IPCC report — and the part that politicians predominantly look to for new legislation — is its projections of future climate change.



The problem is that the climate models the IPCC relies upon to produce these projections have a climate sensitivity that averages some _50 percent higher_ than what the latest science suggests.



This means that the IPCC’s projections of future climate change and the resulting impacts are nearly twice as large as they likely should be. In other words, the models don’t work.



The IPCC can’t very well admit to the fact that observations say one thing, but the climate models say another. If they did, they would have to throw out virtually the whole report.



But just because the IPCC doesn’t admit to it, doesn’t mean that the rest of the world doesn’t know it to be true.



It is increasingly obvious that the earth’s average temperature over the past several decades has refused to warm up at the rate foretold by these climate models.



In fact, there has been no clear large‐​scale surface warming for more than 16 years now, and a new paper published earlier this month in the prestigious journal Nature Climate Change affirms the climate models inability to correctly simulate these observations.



So we have a situation in which the latest science on two key issues: how much the earth will warm as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions, and how well climate models perform in projecting the warming, is largely not incorporated into the new IPCC report.



In this manner, the IPCC misleads policymakers around the world.



The IPCC’s exaggerated projections are the root of fears of coming climate disaster (sinking cities, storm‐​ravaged coastlines, widespread famine, etc.)—fears that result in calls to limit our use of fossil fuels used to produce the energy that supports human society and feeds innovation.



If mankind is to contemplate such a major undertaking with the attached risk that it drives the human condition backward, shouldn’t the basis be something other than an IPCC report that is obsolete and counterfactual on the day of its release?



Instead of laboring to try to uphold a consensus that was tenuous from the outset, and which is now outdated, the IPCC should be striving to produce a summary of the contemporary bank of scientific knowledge. Only with that type of information can responsible decisions pertaining to the development of world’s energy sources be made.

"Promoting Parasitic Power Producers
Wind and solar are parasitic power producers, unable to survive in a modern electricity grid without the back-up of stand-alone electricity generators such as hydro, coal, gas or nuclear. And like all parasites, they weaken their hosts, causing increased operating and transmission costs and reduced profits for all participants in the grid.
Without subsidies, few large wind/solar plants would be built; and without mandated targets, few would get connected to the grid.
Green zealots posing as energy engineers should be free to play with their green energy toys at their own expense, on their own properties, but the rest of us should not be saddled with their costs and unreliability.
We should stop promoting parasitic power producers. As a first step, all green energy subsidies and targets should be abolished.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman 2019.  Lyman’s bio can be read here. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe government of Canada’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions includes efforts to reduce emissions from 1,600 emissions-intensive facilities across Canada. Many are in small cities and towns in rural Canada. The purpose of this paper is to describe how current federal policies may affect those plants, with special focus on three eastern Canadian rural communities.Climate policy relentless ravages rural Canada, west to east.CLIMATE-POLICY-AND-RURAL-CANADA-Final-Dec-15-2019DownloadThis Canadian carbon dioxide pricing system operates differently across the country. Under the Canadian government’s “backstop” regime, which applies in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, there are two key elements:• A carbon dioxide tax, or levy, applied to emissions resulting from consumption of fossil fuels; and• An output-based pricing system for industrial facilities that emit above a certain threshold, with an opt-in capability for smaller facilities with emissions below the threshold. The output-based pricing regime imposes emissions restrictions on industrial facilities that emit 50 kilotonnes (kt) or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Large emitters only pay the levy on their emissions above a threshold. The government claims that this complex system will provide an important incentive to reduce emissions. In fact, the effect of the system will vary significantly among industries and among the facilities in a given sector. The marginal cost of the carbon charge imposed on a firm will be determined by the emissions-intensity of its facilities, by their performance compared to other firms in the same industry, and of course by the rate of the carbon tax. The firms with the highest marginal emissions will face the highest competitiveness risks. It is not possible to know in advance which firms will face the highest charges, as the emissions-intensity standards have not been set and data is not publicly available about the marginal emissions production or costs of the many covered firms. The Quebec emissions trading system will have similar effects.I selected three facilities that play a large role in the economies of the communities in which they operate and are in industries highly vulnerable to international competition. The three are the Iron Ore Company of Canada Carol Project in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador; the Graymont New Brunswick Inc. plant in Havelock, New Brunswick; and the Alouminerie Alouette aluminum plant at Sept-Iles, Quebec.Labrador City has a population of just under 10,000 people and neighbouring Wabush has another 2,000. The city is located in a fairly remote area on the Labrador/Quebec border. The iron ore plant is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the province, with annual emissions of 992,666 tonnes in 2017. It is by far the largest employer in the region. If the plant were to close, it would probably make the associated railway system uneconomic and thus force it to close as well. There are no other significant resource development or employment opportunities in the immediate region, so closing the plant would largely turn Labrador City and Wabush into ghost towns. Graymont Ltd. is the third largest lime-producing company in North America. It is the leading supplier of lime and limestone products throughout the Maritime provinces and the State of Maine. Havelock is a rural village in central New Brunswick, 45 km west of Moncton, with a population less than 50. The Graymont plant produced 76,403 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017. The closing of the Graymont plant would not have major direct employment effects, but it would have a large impact on the other firms in Atlantic Canada that rely upon the plant for limestone supplies, requiring them to seek alternative supplies at higher costs from more distance sources.Alouminerie Alouette is an aluminum manufacturing company based in Sept-Iles. It is the largest primary aluminum smelter in the Americas. The company generates about $440 million per year into the provincial economy. Sept-Iles is a city with a population of about 26,000.In 2017. Alouminerie Alouette was the third largest emitter of GHGs in Quebec, with total emissions of 1,156,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017. If this plant closed, it would deal a sharp blow to the income and employment of eastern Quebec, a region with few other large investment prospects. The three plants all sell their products in domestic and export markets in competition with others, mainly in the United States. The competing plants in the U.S. and other countries, for the most part, will not incur similar carbon dioxide taxation expenses, as the governments do not plan to impose regimes similar to the Canadian one. Consequently, for competitive reasons, the Canadian plants will not be able to raise their prices to recover the higher taxation costs In October 2019, the Conference Board of Canada published a report entitled Tipping the Scales, an analysis of the effects of Canada’s current carbon dioxide taxation regime on the competitiveness of Canadian industries and of the potential for “carbon leakage” affecting emissions-intensive industries. The Conference Board found that, even at the tax rates that will apply in the period to 2022, the incremental costs have the potential to displace about $10 billion of Canada’s GDP and reduce employment by 48,400 jobs among the emissions-intensive industries and their suppliers. This will have disproportionate impacts in the Prairies and Atlantic Canada.There is a bitter irony here. Much of the opposition to the globalization of trade in Canada and other western countries has been due to the adverse effects of increased imports on our industries and the people they employ. Yet, many of the same groups that most criticize the effects of economic globalization strongly support the consequences of Canada pursuing global climate objectives through policies that will place our remaining industries at risk. Economic destruction awaits.

Extinction  Rebellion “Miner”. Source Twitter
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Miners are furious Extinction Rebellion successfully fooled a BBC reporter into believing XR protesters dressed in cardboard safety helmets were actually miners demanding the closure of their own pits.

BBC Claimed Extinction Rebellion Activists in Cardboard Helmets Were Real Miners
JAMES DELINGPOLE 28 Feb 2020921:28
Extinction Rebellion, the eco-fascist protest group, has successfully duped the BBC into believing that miners in the north of England support its campaigns to close down their pits. It did so by dressing up its activists in cardboard miners helmets.
…

But the BBC now accepts that it has no evidence of current or former miners attending the protests.

Read more of the article to see what a real miner thinks of this stunt.
I guess we can’t blame BBC reporter Jo Coburn for being fooled, she probably doesn’t know what a real worker looks like.
As for Extinction Rebellion, has anyone else noticed they seem to have this desperate need to be accepted as normal people? But they aren’t normal, or at least they seem to come from a very narrow demographic; they mostly seem to be a bunch of idle climate obsessed rich kids.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome fresh new scientific papers are confirming that renewable energies, particularly wind and solar power, are not delivering what was promised – not by a long shot.
They likely will become far more of a burden than a benefit.
“Virtually doubled the price of electricity”
For example, Pereira et al., 2019  writes that “growth in the installed capacity of renewable energy has increased electricity prices, which raises the question of how households have withstood the cost of energy transition.”
The authors conclude that their paper “proves that both income and risk of household poverty are directly linked with renewable energies, in both the short- and long-run” and that the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources “has virtually doubled the price of electricity.”

Inefficiently located, “stranded assets”
Another paper by Greenstone and Nath, 2019 writes that “renewable power plants require ample physical space, are often geographically dispersed, and are frequently located away from population centers, all of which raises transmission costs above those of fossil fuel plants.”


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Moreover the study found that adding new renewable installations to a mature grid infrastructure “may create a glut of installed capacity that renders some existing baseload generation unnecessary” and “the costs of these ‘stranded assets’ do not disappear and are borne by some combination of distribution companies, generators, and ratepayers.”
In other words, the location of renewable power systems are often just inefficient and a bad idea that doesn’t make economic sense. The paper also adds that batteries of the size and scope needed are unproven and not cost effective.
“Inhibits CO2 emissions insignificantly in Africa”
Nathaniel and Iheonu, 2019 look at renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions in Africa. They conclude: “Renewable energy inhibits CO2 emissions insignificantly in Africa.”
Or in plain language: No benefit for a high cost on a continent that can ill afford it.
Toxic…could soon cause harmful effects to human health 
Finally a study by Padoan et al., 2019 warns of a huge heap of waste coming from solar panels as they begin to be scrapped in earnest in 2036.
They write: “The improper disposal of these waste fluxes could cause harmful effects to human health and to economy of the manufacture sector by the dispersion of toxic elements and loss of valuable material resources including rare metals, respectively.”

"PITTSBURGH  —   The Miami Dolphins won the coin toss Sunday and kicked off to the Pittsburgh Steelers, a decision that in retrospect seemed a tad misguided. But then it was not as if electing to receive would have been a wiser choice. A more prudent, if somewhat unorthodox, strategy would have been doing something else entirely with the football. Hiding it, for example. Maybe beneath the Dolphins’ parkas. Because without the ball, the Steelers’ offense could not score. And if the Steelers’ offense could not score, then the Dolphins might actually have stood a chance of winning Sunday’s playoff game at Heinz Field instead of absorbing a comprehensive demolition. The   defeat, which reaffirmed Pittsburgh as a formidable A. F. C. contender, held less suspense than a romantic comedy. All of 2 minutes 45 seconds elapsed before Pittsburgh scored on an exquisite    (50 yards) by Antonio Brown. That preceded another exquisite    by Brown (62 yards) which preceded a scoring rush by Le’Veon Bell, who accounted for all 78 yards on that drive (excluding a   penalty) all on runs, 10 in a row. It was as if the Steelers kept giving him the ball because they had grown bored of demoralizing Miami through the air. Finishing with 167 yards, Bell set the team   postseason record in his playoff debut. He missed the playoffs two seasons ago with a hyperextended knee. Last year, a torn knee ligament sidelined him. The Steelers have been eagerly waiting for their redoubtable trio of Bell, Brown and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who completed his first 11 passes for 188 yards, to play in the postseason together. They combined for all four touchdowns, scored across the first seven series (one was a   before halftime) in a performance that showcased Pittsburgh at the apex of its intimidating might. “We can attack in different ways,” Bell said. All of them are devastating. Especially those that involve Brown, who turned two short passes into long touchdowns, and Bell. Not since Barry Sanders, perhaps, has the N. F. L. seen a running back as destructively patient as Bell. He takes the handoff. Then he waits. “I’m standing back there and I’m watching, and I’m like, ‘Uh, are you going to go any time here? ’” Roethlisberger said of Bell. The length of Bell’s pause varies from play to play, but it allows him to survey the field, set up his blockers and find creases. Accelerating through, he leaves defenders in his wake, then drags them through it. “He’s a man for all situations or circumstances,” Coach Mike Tomlin said. When Miami’s defensive coordinator, Vance Joseph, was asked last week how he prioritized containing Brown, Bell and Roethlisberger, he chose Bell first. “If you can’t contain Bell, you can’t contain A. B. ,” Joseph said, using Brown’s nickname. The Dolphins, overwhelmed by the challenge, did neither. The burden of preparing for the Steelers now belongs to the Kansas City Chiefs, who will host Pittsburgh on Sunday afternoon in a rematch of a Week 4 game. The Steelers won by 29 points that night, but there is folly in perceiving past as prologue. The Dolphins’ resurfacing in the postseason after an   absence elicited much joy not only in South Florida, but also in western Pennsylvania, where the Steelers seethed all week, eager to avenge an October rout. That win ignited Miami’s recovery from a   start and foretold the steamrollering that running back Jay Ajayi, who rushed for 204 yards that day, would administer to defensive game plans. Even thinking about that defeat angered the Steelers’ defensive coordinator, Keith Butler, who said it “really challenges your manhood. ” The Steelers pride themselves on playing a physical style. Shoved around that day, they vowed to inflict pain Sunday. “We just wanted to get out there and be as physical and as violent as we could be,” safety Mike Mitchell said. “Like I said, our   was to tee off on them. It wasn’t to wrap up and make tackles. ” Ajayi exceeded 200 yards twice more during the regular season. He never came close Sunday, smothered by Pittsburgh’s front. He finished with 33 yards on 16 carries. “We always can get better, but we was cooking today,” defensive end Stephon Tuitt said. “It was fun to cook. ” The essence of Mitchell’s proclamation  —   “The goal was to tee off on them I can’t say that enough”  —   permeated the rest of the defense, which nearly turned Miami’s suboptimal quarterback situation even more dire midway through the second quarter. Starting a fourth consecutive week in place of the injured Ryan Tannehill (knee) Matt Moore left the pocket and, after releasing a pass, encountered linebacker Bud Dupree. He did not hit Moore so much as nearly dislodge Moore’s head from his body. “You just see a sack,” said Dupree, who had not yet seen a replay. Moore crumpled to the field and lay there as a skirmish that began near the Miami sideline expanded closer to midfield. It seemed to take less time for Moore to be examined for a concussion, and other injuries, than he spent on the ground. He missed one play. “I got checked out, I felt fine,” Moore said. “It was more of my jaw than anything else. I felt good. I came back in, and I was fine. ” On that drive, the Dolphins kicked a field goal to draw to within  . But on their next two series, on either side of halftime, Moore was   losing the ball  —   and, soon enough, the game for the Dolphins. Pittsburgh, which has won eight straight, has not lost since Nov. 13, when Dallas pilfered a late victory that earned the wrath of Roethlisberger, who demanded afterward that the Steelers play with more discipline and accountability. Those elements returned, and so did the A. F. C. North crown, borrowed for a year by Cincinnati. The Steelers reached this stage of the playoffs last season before losing at Denver. They did not have Bell, or even Brown, who sat with a concussion. Now they have both. And Roethlisberger, who said he would play next week despite an injured ankle encased afterward in a walking boot. And a healthy offensive line. And a snarling defense. But still. “I’m not excited about this,” guard Ramon Foster said after the win. Why? “It’s bigger than this week,” he added, referring to the coming game against the Chiefs."
"He was not her type. He was too old for her. She would never give him her number. And then she did. And he called her. And they fell in love. He called three times a day for a week before she finally answered. Alena Kastsiuk picked up the phone that May morning in 2011 only to yell at him for waking her. “How about sushi?” he responded. Ms. Kastsiuk, a waitress who had worked other   jobs, had little money for such luxuries. Her refrigerator was empty, so she agreed. The sushi date lasted five and a half hours. Although he was almost twice her age, Ms. Kastsiuk, a film directing major from Belarus struggling to find her way into New York’s film industry, discovered much in common with the Russian pianist across from her. The pianist, Vladimir Spitsberg, had arrived in New York State more than 20 years earlier, worked as a digital media arts instructor at Touro College in Manhattan and played with his band, Gypsy Fun Trio, at a Russian restaurant and piano bar in Midtown Manhattan. “I fell in love that day,” said Ms. Kastsiuk, now 29. “And I didn’t even understand love yet. ” They married three weeks later. “Maybe three and a half weeks,” she said. It was not a marriage of convenience. Neither was a United States citizen. They married for love, but the ceremony was a nightmare. On what was supposed to be her wedding day, Ms. Kastsiuk discovered that the security tag was still attached to her dress. Mr. Spitsberg pulled at it, and yellow paint exploded on her gown. She changed into a sundress, and they hurtled to the Brooklyn clerk’s office with 30 minutes to spare before it closed. But they forgot their rings and had to turn back to retrieve them. They made it back to the clerk’s office just after it closed. Friends were waiting at Uncle Vanya Cafe in Midtown and the party could not be called off, so they put together an impromptu ceremony with a friend splashing them with Cognac and sliding the rings over their fingers. He declared them married. The next morning, they returned to the clerk’s office to marry for real. By 2014, they had created Karma World Productions, a film company, where she handled the editing and videography and he produced the music. Ms. Kastsiuk had noticed signs of her husband’s health problems  —   his ashen face and frequent sweats  —   before their marriage. Sometimes he would collapse on her couch, unable to make it home. But he did not tell her about his longtime heart and blood pressure problems. Mr. Spitsberg lost his teaching job in 2014. His band started to play at a different restaurant later that year, leading to further stress. He was asked to advise a film project about Russian immigrants in the United States, but the job fell through. He agreed to compose the film’s score, instead. Depressed, Mr. Spitsberg drank, skipped his heart medication and refused to go to a hospital. Helpless, Ms. Kastsiuk watched as his late hours with the band and heavy drinking took a toll. “I was fighting for him all the time,” she said. “But his style of life was taking him away from me. ” On May 13, Ms. Kastsiuk heard her husband calling from the bedroom. “He was sitting on the bed, white and sweating,” she said. “Everything was wet. ” She called 911 and waited for help. “Sit close to me,” he said. When emergency responders arrived, the numbness in his chest had spread to his legs. As Mr. Spitsberg was taken to a hospital, Ms. Kastsiuk followed on a bicycle, calling his cellphone repeatedly on the way. But Mr. Spitsberg, 51, was pronounced dead before she arrived. In the emergency room, she held his hand, not letting go until his fingers turned blue. On a cold December morning, sitting inside a Midtown office, seven months after his death, Ms. Kastsiuk still spoke of him in the present tense. She reflected on a life beginning with their romance. She had come to New York in 2008 at 21, initially on a student visa. With $100 in her pocket, she supported herself as a maid, a waitress and a flower seller. Meeting college students in film school in fall 2010, she produced several small video projects. But Mr. Spitsberg had introduced her to an entirely different New York, with evenings at Samovar, the Midtown restaurant where his band played, drinking vodka and singing Russian songs. She networked with producers, became a business partner with her husband and made films. Without children, the couple got a West Highland white terrier. Returning to their Coney Island apartment on the day he died, she felt trapped, as if still in the moments before his death. Valeriy Zhmud, the friend who led the couple’s unofficial marriage ceremony, joined her with a bottle of Mr. Spitsberg’s favorite pinot noir, and she opened the fridge to find the pork that he had cooked the day before. Overcome, she threw it out. But life outside the apartment continued. The band hired another pianist. The couple’s film company halted operation. Financial trouble, which had been a problem for years, increased after his death. Though she is in the country legally, Ms. Kastsiuk does not have a green card, something she is pursuing now. She received a   payment of $255 from Social Security after her husband’s death. Without his income, she is looking for a roommate to split the cost of her $1, 350 rent. Over the summer, the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provided Ms. Kastsiuk with $1, 481 of Neediest funds to cover one month’s rent and electricity. “I didn’t know what to do,” Ms. Kastsiuk recalled. “And I didn’t think they’d help me. I’m not Jewish, but that didn’t matter to them. ” The organization has helped with another month’s rent and provided bereavement counseling to help her start over in a city filled with memories of her husband. She takes comfort in walks with their dog. “He’s the only family I have right now,” she said. “He looks at me and understands my heart. ”"

A Michael Moore-backed documentary _Planet of the Humans_ that investigates Alternative Energy makes the startling point that the green energy movement has proven to be **counter-productive.**



Director Jeff Gibbs [explains](https://www.nonfictionfilm.com/news/planet-of-the-humans-possibly-most-bracing-environmental-documentary-ever-made-premieres-at-traverse-city-film-festival) that the green energy movement is “a giant profit center” for environmental groups and for corporations, including those that are involved in mining. 



“The people that produce our fossil fuels love [the green movement] because it still uses fossil fuels and it’s not a threat to fossil fuels. All the car companies love the electric car.”



The low-budget documentary looks at the **false promises** of the environmental movement and why we’re still “addicted” to fossil fuels. 



Director Jeff Gibbs takes on electric cars, solar panels, windmills, biomass, biofuel, leading environmentalist groups like the Sierra Club, and even figures from Al Gore and Van Jones, who served as Barack Obama’s special adviser for green jobs, to 350.org leader Bill McKibben, a leading environmentalist and advocate for grassroots climate change movements.



Gibbs […] and Moore said they were shocked to find how **inextricably entangled alternative energy is with coal and natural gas** , since they say everything from wind turbines to electric car charging stations are tethered to the grid […]



[…] “It’s up to people who actually share the same values to sometimes call each other out and **bring out the uncomfortable truths,”** Gibbs said. “This is not a film by climate change deniers, this is a film by people who really care about the environment.”



Gibbs argues that green energy is not only not going to save us but it is actually going to kill us faster. 



“The parts of the Green New Deal that have to do with social justice and equality are fantastic […] [But] the Green New Deal, to the extent it’s proposing that green energy is going to save us – it’s not going to save us, it’s actually going to kill us faster.“



He reveals all the problems with so-called green energy one by one.



Gibbs believes that there is going to be a human apocalypse if something isn’t done to fix climate change.



The wake-up call revealed in his documentary is that what he thought was going to save the planet won’t. He admits that his documentary has no answers but he hopes that it will lead to people asking better questions.



The one question he should be asking is why on earth does he believe that we are heading for a human apocalypse? As I pointed out yesterday in the post _[18 Breathtakingly Wrong Environmental Predictions](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/18-breathtakingly-wrong-environmental-predictions/)_ , on Earth Day back in 1970 many apocalyptic predictions were made for our planet and 18 of them were spectacularly 100% wrong.

"**Facebook should ""take responsibility"" for people using its website to sell food from their own homes, the Food Standards Agency has said.**
The watchdog is warning that sellers who have not registered with or been inspected by their local councils could be putting the public at risk.
FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock wants Facebook to bring in stricter seller checks on its Marketplace platform.
Facebook says its sellers must follow all applicable laws and regulations.
Facebook Marketplace allows users to post advertisements for free, to sell a range of goods and services.
But rules in force across the UK require people selling food from their homes on a regular basis to register with their local authority. Once registered, they may be inspected and given a food hygiene rating.
BBC News found a wide variety of food for sale by unregistered sellers on Facebook Marketplace.
This included cooked meals and baked goods - and in one case, a whole deer.
Food safety expert Tony Lewis looked at a number of the adverts.
""There is no information about what they contain, we don't have a list of ingredients,"" he said.
""How's it been stored, how's it been prepped, have we got a whole load of allergens in there?""
He also warns about the potential risk to health.
""Listeria is a real threat, in the worst case it could kill you.""
The BBC conducted a series of test purchases across the Midlands, buying goat curry, cake, roast chicken and chocolate party cones for children from sellers advertising on Facebook Marketplace.
None of the sellers indicated they were registered, had been inspected or had a food hygiene rating.
One said they thought those regulations did not apply to people cooking in their own homes.
Another, when asked about the possible presence of allergens admitted: ""I haven't actually checked.""
Ms Hancock of the FSA, which is responsible for food safety in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, says Facebook has ""an unavoidable moral obligation to help keep people safe"".
She said ""if something goes wrong with this food"", the sellers would be in a ""terrible mess personally, about the consequences for them and the risk that they're posing to other people"".
She added: ""We'd like that responsibility to extend to asking anybody who is supplying or selling food through the platform - are they registered?""
She also wants sellers to be forced to display any food hygiene rating they obtain.
Facebook said: ""The safety of our community is our foremost priority and if we determine that a listing violates any of our community standards or commerce policies we will immediately remove the listing.""
It added: ""We're in contact with the FSA to discuss the concerns raised and what we can do together on this issue.""
Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, whose daughter Natasha died in 2016 from a severe allergic reaction after eating a sandwich from High Street chain Pret a Manger, says Facebook must do more, especially when it comes to allergens.
Natasha did not know her sandwich contained sesame seeds and after she died her parents successfully campaigned for changes in the law. Food businesses will have to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged products by summer 2021.
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse says she does not want to stop people selling homemade food, but is demanding they label ingredients clearly.
Informing buyers on the doorstep is not enough, she said, adding: ""People can get confused, they might forget... Someone might misunderstand what they're saying.""
Paula Wilkinson runs a business called Mums Bake Cakes, which connects home bakers to customers via a dedicated website.
She makes sure all her sellers are registered and insured.
There is ""absolutely"" no reason why properly-registered people should not sell food they have prepared at home, she says.
""It can be done safely,"" Ms Wilkinson added."

It is not surprising that most glaciers and ice sheets show melting and calving while snow is being added at their source. If this did not occur, much of Earth’s water would eventually become tied up in the ever-growing ice sheets, as happened in the Ice Ages. And when land-based ice caps melt during periodic warm eras, the sea level inevitably rises and all life-forms must adapt to the new shoreline.

The Obama administration is working to forge a sweeping international climate change agreement to compel nations to cut their plant‐​warming fossil fuel emissions, but without ratification from Congress. — _New York Times_ , Aug. 26



President Obama clearly believes that the Supreme Court, in its 2007 decision, _Mass. v. EPA_ , empowered the president, via the Environmental Protection Agency, to unlimited regulations of greenhouse gases without the advice or the consent of Congress. He has already shown that he means it. Barring an unlikely electoral earthquake off the Richter Scale, no new coal‐​fired generation facility is ever going to be built.



On Aug. 26, though, Mr. Obama crossed a bridge too far, proposing a “Climate Accord” (really, a treaty) that will, in the well‐​chosen words of _The New York Times_ , “compel nations to cut their planet‐​warming fossil fuel emissions.” Never mind that we are now in the 18th consecutive year of not warming the planet, according to two separate and independent measures of surface and near‐​surface temperatures.



Do, however, mind that word “compel.” Dic​tio​nary​.com gives four definitions: To force or drive, especially to a course of action; to secure or bring about by force; to force to submit, subdue; and to overpower.



How on God’s getting‐​greener earth can the president think the nation can be “compelled,” absent the two‐​thirds vote of the Senate explicitly required by the Constitution? After all, his proposal, which will be unveiled by Mr. Obama himself at the United Nations’ Climate Summit on Sept. 23 will “legally require” participants “to enact domestic climate change policies,” according to the Times. Isn’t that up to the standard of a binding international treaty?





The Constitution is of no consequence when there’s a planet to save.



Well, harking back to his predecessor in the halcyon 1990s, Mr. Obama is playing fast and loose with the Constitution. In his mind, it might “depend on what the meaning of is is.” Mr. Obama wants to write this “accord,” not as a new treaty, but as an addition to the already‐​ratified 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change.



That’s not going to cut it. It’s already been done. That’s what the failed Kyoto Protocol and the purpose of Mr. Obama’s new codicil “is” to replace it. The Kyoto Protocol never did get the required two‐​thirds vote to be ratified by the Senate. The same will apply here.



A king in any area rules by absolute power. The fact of the matter is that Mr. Obama is obsessed with climate change, even as the voters of this country, who speak through their legislatures, most assuredly are not. That’s not his worry, though. He can’t be re‐​elected, and he doesn’t really care if, as retribution, the Democrats lose control of the Senate in this year’s election.



Convincing analyses of who lost and why show that a wildly unpopular cap‐​and‐​trade bill cost his party control of the House in 2010. When confronted on Nov. 3, 2010 about this and the future of greenhouse gas regulations, he replied that “there is more than one way to skin a cat,” meaning that he would simply ignore the legislative branch. His latest proposal skins everyone else’s kitty, too.



Emboldened by the Supreme Court, Mr. Obama can argue: Who needs the silly legislators when we’re saving the world from dreaded greenhouse gases? Besides, the earliest the U.N. is going to adopt this invasion of sovereignty worldwide will be late in 2015. That will put it back to at least 2016 before the newly spawned regulations — which we can only imagine at this point — harm someone enough to grant standing in the courts. He’ll be out of office before any possible legal blowback.



The Constitution is plain as day that any international treaty that compels certain actions by the United States requires a two‐​thirds ratification by the Senate. Only a king could think he would not be subject to that.

"At first blush, there’s a baffling,   quality to Julian Assange’s latest star turn in our shambolic national story. He belongs in jail for “waging his war” against the United States by exposing its secrets, the conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity has said of him. An “  operative with blood on his hands,” Sarah Palin once called him. Yet last week brought the sight of Mr. Hannity speaking with Mr. Assange in glowing terms about “what drives him to expose government and media corruption” through Clinton campaign hacks that American intelligence has attributed to Russia. And Ms. Palin hailed him as a great truth teller, even apologizing for previous unpleasantries. (Cue sound of needle sliding across record album.) O. K. the fact that WikiLeaks’   splash was bad for the Democrats and good for   Donald J. Trump may have a   bit to do with their change of heart. But what’s up with Mr. Assange, who seems equally comfortable being a hero of the American left as he is being one of the American right, or even of Russian Putinists? What does he want, anyway? The answer has been in front of us all along. And the current imbroglio over Russia, WikiLeaks and their role in Mr. Trump’s victory  —   or, more to the point, Hillary Clinton’s loss  —   might be viewed as the realization of the vision Mr. Assange had when he started WikiLeaks over a decade ago. Mr. Assange spelled it out in prescient terms in an essay he posted online in November of 2006, the year of WikiLeaks’ founding. He wrote it long before becoming the polarizing figure he is today, a “cypherpunk” folk hero with an outsize reputation for being messianic, impetuous and all too cavalier with the personal data that come his way. (He’s currently living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he was granted asylum from Swedish authorities who are investigating a rape accusation against him that he says is false and politically motivated.) Yet even his toughest critics acknowledge how clearly he saw the politically disruptive potential of technology, back when some of us were getting our first BlackBerries. It’s what prompted him to start WikiLeaks, which “pioneered something extremely important and very dangerous to large organizations that keep lots of secrets digitally,” as the journalist Glenn Greenwald told me in an interview last week. From the start, Mr. Assange said WikiLeaks’ prime directive was to expose hidden data sets that “reveal illegal or immoral behavior” in government and big business. But in the essay he also wrote in more ambitious terms about forcing regime change through data and technology rather than through the old, barbaric means of assassination. As Mr. Assange saw it, power was held by vast networks of conspirators who shared vital information in secret, giving them a superior understanding of reality that enabled them to hold on to power. The technology revolution, he wrote, was providing the conspirators with the means to achieve what he called an even “higher total conspiratorial power. ” But it was also making them more vulnerable to sabotage, so that a governing conspiracy could be “slowed until it falls, stupefied unable to comprehend and control the forces in its environment. ” As an example, he pointed to “two closely balanced and broadly conspiratorial power groupings,” the Democratic and the Republican Parties in the United States. “Consider what would happen if one of these parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence  —   let alone the computer systems,” he wrote. “They would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other. ” The essay got new attention when WikiLeaks, working in tandem with The Guardian, The New York Times and other outlets, released extensive diplomatic cables in 2010, making WikiLeaks more of a household name. No one seemed to grasp what Mr. Assange was hinting at more clearly than the conservative writer John Sexton, who foresaw the events of 2016 in a post that was published on Breitbart News and his own blogin 2010. “You can take his example further by imagining what would happen to, say, the D. N. C. if it suffered a massive Wikileak of secret data,” Mr. Sexton wrote, referring to Mr. Assange’s essay. “It seems entirely possible that a leak of the contents of their email for one month would be exceedingly damaging to them. ” And here we are, over six years later. Mr. Assange’s essay has resurfaced yet again, after major data breaches of the email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton adviser John Podesta, committed, allegedly, by   hackers and fed to the world via WikiLeaks. Clinton aides have said the breach impeded their ability to communicate electronically afterward, causing them to resort to holding more   meetings. But far more damaging were the spilled secrets. They forced the resignations of the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie   and of the interim chair, Donna Brazile, from her analyst job at CNN. And they provided Mr. Trump with a steady stream of fresh,   data points, which WikiLeaks fed out incrementally, creating a running story that the American news media voraciously seized upon. Political scientists will debate for years to come how decisive the leaks were in the election outcome. But the emails were undeniably in the mix of an election decided by fewer than 100, 000 votes in three key swing states. So, in the end, one political party was technologically compromised in a way the other wasn’t, and that party did indeed “lose to the other. ” It’s a straight line from Mr. Assange’s initial essay. But if WikiLeaks’ disclosures abetted Mr. Trump, how does that square with Mr. Assange’s goals to undercut “authoritarian conspirators” and create incentives for “more humane forms of governance”? Mr. Trump was less transparent than Mrs. Clinton was during the campaign (we’re still waiting for those tax returns) and he made a number of   statements (“lock her up! ”) that were unique to modern American politics. A WikiLeaks journalist, Sarah Harrison, recently wrote in The Times that WikiLeaks was a news organization committed to disclosing vital information, not picking political sides. Mr. Assange addressed the question differently in an interview last month with the Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi of La Repubblica. “Hillary Clinton’s election would have been a consolidation of power in the existing ruling class of the United States,” he said. Mr. Trump and his allies, he said, “do not by themselves form an existing structure, so it is a weak structure which is displacing and destabilizing the   central power network within D. C. ” That, he said, could herald change, both good and bad. A weak power network in Washington, of course, is just what President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wanted to see, too. Given Russia’s own authoritarianism and opacity  —   try independent journalism there, if you dare  —   it’s a wonder and, for some, cause for suspicion that it’s not a bigger WikiLeaks target. Mr. Assange told Repubblica that while he had released plenty of   documents, WikiLeaks has no staff members who speak Russian. And he told my Times colleagues Jo Becker, Steven Erlanger and Eric Schmitt last summer that Russia was “a bit player” on the world stage compared with the United States and China. (Their article showed how WikiLeaks’ releases often benefited Russia at the expense of the West despite American assessments that it is likely not directly tied to Russian intelligence services). Though Mr. Assange does not as a rule reveal sources, he has repeatedly said he is confident that the Clinton campaign and D. N. C. email caches that WikiLeaks received did not come from a “state party. ” He maintains that the United States has failed to offer conclusive proof of the Russian government’s direct role, and he is not alone. On Friday, The Intercept, a news outlet   by Mr. Greenwald  —   who led the Guardian team that shared a Pulitzer Prize in 2014 with The Washington Post for coverage of Edward Snowden’s revelations on mass surveillance  —   declared the intelligence report “underwhelming. ” Mr. Greenwald has been highly critical of mainstream news reports that, in his view, have been too quick to accept intelligence reports pointing to Russia’s role. That has added to the fun house mirror aspect of the latest Assange turn, given that Mr. Greenwald’s past work was celebrated by people who are so solidly opposed to Mr. Trump now. But Mr. Greenwald has long criticized mainstream American journalists as being too credulous with government intelligence claims (see “weapons of mass destruction”). Unlike, perhaps, Mr. Hannity and Ms. Palin, he is being consistent. “What’s changed is the political earth around me,” he said. “And the same thing has happened to Julian. ” That earth is still shifting. Where Mr. Assange turns up on it next is anyone’s guess."
" ©2019 Friends of Science Society On June 24, 2019, a group of 28 law professors issued an Open Letter on Climate Accountability Legislation, claiming that the production and use of global fossil fuels are causing climate change, that these corporations knew this would happen, that cities and municipalities are being stuck with the costs of extreme weather events caused by climate change, and that fossil fuels are a ‘nuisance’ under tort law and thus can these corporations be prosecuted.  They advocate for the institution of such laws in Canada. LINK TO FULL REBUTTAL: Case Dismissed Open Letter to Law Professors A1FINAL In this document – “Case Dismissed…”  we rebut these claims with evidence showing that:Climate, temperature and weather evidence does not support the law professors’ claimsOfficial scientific documents by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) do not support the climate claims as presented by these law professorsThe degree of human influence on climate change is uncertain and undeterminedThe global warming ‘hiatus’ of ~20 years began before the Kyoto Accord on greenhouse gas reductions was ever ratified.Consumers voluntarily use fossil fuels and related products to benefit their lives while governments reap huge financial benefitsThe proposed legislation might create risk of serious unintended consequences for cities and taxpaying citizensThere is no evidence that extreme weather events are related to human causation on climateFossil fuel companies pay exorbitant taxes and engage in substantial charitable donations to universitiesThe law professors engage in faulty logic on the law, the Paris Agreement and global emissionsThe case should be dismissed on grounds of nonsense, not pushed forward based on nuisanceThe alleged harm of Canada vs the world is not well understood by these law professorsDramatic findings about oil companies’ apparent foreknowledge of fossil fuel causation and climate change are divorced from historic contextSuing a reliable provider of essential services would benefit citizens and cities in what way?Human influence on climate is only evident in computer climate models (simulations) so there is no evidenceThe law professors claim their legislative proposal would stimulate ‘sensible climate policies’ but fail to tell us what those might be.In conclusion, Canadians must reject the 28 law professors’ proposal for climate accountability legislation as the proposal is not founded on evidence and may also result in distressing unintended consequences. Without reliable supply of fossil fuels, modern society would collapse into chaos and anarchy within days.As the saying goes, “Be careful what you wish for, you might get it.”—–Red Flags All Over the Climate MovementShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

"SEOUL, South Korea  —   Less than a week after Donald J. Trump taunted North Korea over its ballistic missile capabilities, North Korea has said that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental missile “anytime and anywhere” in a rebuke to the incoming president. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly over the Pacific. In a New Year’s Day speech, Kim   North Korea’s leader, said his country had reached a “final stage” in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. That drew a Twitter post the next day from Mr. Trump that said, “It won’t happen!” On Sunday, an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, “The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by our supreme leadership. ” The spokesman’s remarks, made public on the KCNA website Monday, were in response to comments last Thursday by Antony J. Blinken, the United States deputy secretary of state, that North Korea had made “a qualitative improvement” in its missile capabilities over the past year. And he said Washington and its allies would continue “comprehensive, sustained pressure and sanctions” against the North. On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Ashton B. Carter, the departing secretary of defense, said the United States would shoot down a North Korean missile “if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies. ” It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable ICBM. Although it has displayed the     believed to be its first ICBM, during military parades in recent years, it has never   that system. In the past year, however, North Korea has boasted of successfully testing key technologies, such as   missile engines and heat shields for an ICBM. Last Tuesday, John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department, said Washington did not believe that North Korea had achieved its goal of tipping   missiles with nuclear warheads, though it continued to “march in that direction. ” North Korea has sought to develop by early 2018 miniaturized nuclear weapons that can fit atop a missile capable of reaching the United States, Thae   a former North Korean diplomat who defected, told the Yonhap news agency of South Korea on Sunday."

Guest essay by Larry Hamlin
The recently released EIA IEO 2019 report forecasts global energy use and emissions growth from year 2018 through year 2050.
The report shows the world’s developing nations CO2 emissions climbing upward by an enormous 8.4 billion metric tons by year 2050 from year 2018 levels.

This huge increase in emissions is driven by increased global energy use with the developing nations accounting for over 87% of world future energy growth as estimated by this forecast.

In sharp contrast the report forecasts the world’s developed nations will decrease CO2 emissions by 651 million metric tons by year 2050.
Thus the huge world increase in global CO2 emissions based on the IEO forecast are accounted for solely by the world’s developing nations.
The developing nations are forecast to significantly increase energy use from both fossil fuels and renewables with fossil fuel growth exceeding the increase in renewables growth.
Conversely the developed nations energy growth as forecast in the report shows decreased use of fossil fuels with significantly increasing renewables.
This developed nation energy use outcome is driven by the assumption of continued government mandated preferred renewable energy policy actions.
Fossil fuels continue to dominate global energy use in year 2050 accounting for over 68% (down from 80% in 2018) of total global energy consumption despite the assumption of mandated government dictated policy actions to support increased renewables during the 32 year long forecast interval.

Globally fossil fuel use in 2050 is forecast to grow by about 25% from year 2018 levels with all of that growth accounted for by the world’s developing nations.
Renewable energy is forecast to provide about 28% of total global energy use in year 2050.
Renewable energy in 2050 is forecast to grow by about 266% from year 2018 levels based upon continued government mandated renewable energy use policy actions.
Wind and solar resources are forecast to account for only about 17% of global energy use in year 2050 clearly establishing that climate alarmist demands pushing 100% zero emission global energy use outcomes are absurdly unrealistic pipe dreams.
Government renewable energy policy actions include continued use of production tax credits, investment tax credits, numerous rebate schemes and government mandated use requirements with none of these policy actions reflected in energy market pricing provisions for renewables.
Given global experience showing that the removal of renewable subsidy provisions dramatically reduces the use of renewables the IEO reports assumptions that such provisions will continue unabated for the next three decades is questionable given the growing recognition by governments of how costly and unaffordable these subsidy provisions have become.



Additionally the significant and negative environmental impacts of renewable wind energy projects on species conservation especially the threat to endangered bird and bats has resulted in legal challenges that have reduced wind projects in Germany this year by 82% from the already weak period of the prior year.

The EIA IEO 2019 report confirms the global reality of unrelenting use and growth of fossil fuels as the dominate energy resource for providing for the world’s existing and future energy consumption needs. The world’s developing nations overwhelming dominance in increased global energy use and resulting emissions dictate this outcome.
Despite decades of government policy dictated mandates requiring renewable energy use along with extensive and costly subsidy actions these resources have been shown to be incapable of meeting the majority of global energy needs in a cost effective and reliable fashion
The EIA IEO 2019 report results clearly demonstrate these global energy use and emissions realities.
Fortunately continued global energy use growth with increasing emissions does not create “a climate emergency” as falsely claimed by climate alarmist propagandists as proven by actual climate data outcomes versus alarmists erroneous claims based on their use and reliance upon unvalidated flawed and failed computer projections.

"Without warning, Tyrell Williams’s mood shifts from gleeful to morose. Consumed by his action figures one moment, Tyrell, 4, will abruptly set them down, start sobbing and complain to his mother how much he needs his father. “Obviously I want to cry with him, but I don’t,” his mother, Myasia Williams, 23, said. “I stay strong and I just speak to him. I say, ‘Daddy’s away and he loves you. He misses you very much. ’” She will not explain to him that his father, who is also named Tyrell Williams, is in prison. That conversation must be between father and son, reserved for a future date. Mr. Williams is serving time for attempted murder and is set to be released in 2041. Mrs. Williams said his crime has not changed her love for him, though it has caused her to lose relationships with other people in her life who question why she is loyal to a man behind bars. They don’t understand the depth of the love she has for him, she said. They met while attending Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan. She noticed his kindness toward her friends. Once they began dating, she felt a sense of belonging she had never experienced. “At the time we met, I was at a rough place when it came to my family, and his family came to me with open arms,” she said. “They really took care of me. ” Mr. Williams was arrested in 2011. He spent the next few years out on bail and the couple spent even more time together, and she gave birth to Tyrell Jr. Mr. Williams was convicted in July 2015. That October, the couple married at the Rikers Island jail complex. The ceremony was held in a small room, under the supervision of two corrections officers. Another inmate and his wife served as the witnesses. “After we said, ‘I do,’ we only got five minutes to sit there and talk to each other,” Mrs. Williams said. “I was not happy at all. But I was happy I got married. ” Mrs. Williams, alone raising their son, had limited career options. When she became pregnant, she dropped out of high school and thought that Mr. Williams would provide for the family. “When he got taken away from us, I could have been more prepared,” she said. “Instead, I have to start all over in my life. ” To improve her job prospects, Mrs. Williams enrolled in test preparation classes at the Next Generation Center for the high school equivalency diploma exam. The center is operated by the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. A year ago, the organization used $400 from the Neediest Cases Fund to help Mrs. Williams buy winter clothing for herself and Tyrell. Mrs. Williams and Tyrell live in the Bronx in an overcrowded apartment shared with six other relatives. Finding work has not been as easy as Mrs. Williams had hoped. She has a temporary job at a postal office in Flushing, Queens. She said she needed a college degree to have more career options, so she is working toward a practical nursing certificate at Mildred Elley, a   career and technical college. She feels guilty whenever she has to leave Tyrell in the care of her sisters or godparents when heading off to school or work, especially at times where he pleads with her not to leave him like Daddy did. “I always talk to him and try to explain to him ‘This is what I’m doing,’” she said. “‘I’m doing this so you can have your own room, you can have this, you can have that.’ I don’t know if he’s too young to understand, but I know he’ll eventually understand. ” Mrs. Williams said she lived by her phone, and talked to her husband almost every day. The thought of not being able to answer is its own source of stress. “If I miss a call, I miss a chance to speak to him,” she said. “And if I’m at work or at school, Tyrell can’t talk to him. ” Once every few months, Mrs. Williams and Tyrell Jr. travel by bus, to the Clinton Correctional Facility to visit Mr. Williams. The journey takes six hours one way to nearby Plattsburgh, and then they must take a cab. Their son recognizes police officers, Mrs. Williams said, but doesn’t grasp that they are visiting a prison. She hopes that her husband will be able to appeal and one day be granted an early release. Then they can make a life for themselves in Central New York. The family spent some time in Syracuse while Mr. Williams was awaiting trial. He has relatives there. “I loved it,” Mrs. Williams said. “It’s different. You come outside and everyone wants to say hi and give you a smile. When you come here, and have a smile on your face, it’s ‘What are you looking at? ’” She has another dream as well, and this one might never be realized. “I want more kids, but I don’t want to have them while he’s in there,” Mrs. Williams said. “That’s not going to work. I’m not having a child in that situation. I feel guilty for even having my son, knowing that eventually something was going to happen. ” Motherhood, in addition to her long hours of work and school, is already a lot to juggle, and she admits, despite her best efforts, she doesn’t always do so with aplomb. But she says she won’t stop trying. ”I’m trying to get it together,” Mrs. Williams said. “It’s not together at all. ”"

From The GWPF
Date: 31/12/19 Matt Ridley, Reaction
What readers of newspapers and listeners to the radio do not see is the sustained and deliberate pressure put on editors to toe the alarmist line on climate change.

I was asked to appear on the Today programme on Saturday 28 December by the guest editor, Charles Moore, and made the case that the BBC’s coverage of climate change is unbalanced. Despite a lot of interruption by Nick Robinson I just about got across the point that the BBC uncritically relays any old rubbish about the environment so long as it is alarmist, even if it comes from an uninformed source like the leader of Extinction Rebellion or falls well outside the range of the scientific consensus that we are on course for a warming of 1-4 degrees this century. But the Corporation has strict rules about letting guests on who might say that the climate change threat is being exaggerated, even if their view and their facts fall within that consensus range.
The BBC now has a rule that if by some oversight a lukewarmer or sceptic does get on the air, he or she must be followed by a corrective interview from a scientist, setting the record straight. Sure enough I was followed by Sir David King, former government chief science advisor. (He’s a qualified chemist, while I am a qualified biologist.)
I sat there open-mouthed as he beautifully demonstrated my point with one exaggeration after another. He said that Europe’s dash for diesel had nothing to do with greens, when green pressure groups pushed actively for it. He said that we will see 1-2 metres of sea level rise this century, when the current rate of rise is 3.4 millimetres a year with no acceleration (or 0.3 metres per century). He said that all of Greenland’s ice cap might melt and could cause 5-6 metres of sea level rise, though at current rates of melting, Greenland’s ice cap will be 99% intact in 2100. He said that wild fires were being caused by trees dying out because of rising temperatures, rather than a failure to manage increasingly luxuriant vegetation in fire-risk areas leading to a build up of tinder. He said scientists are agreed that Calcutta will have to be moved, when the Ganges delta is actually expanding in area, not shrinking.
What readers of newspapers and listeners to the radio do not see is the sustained and deliberate pressure put on editors to toe the alarmist line on climate change. Take Bob Ward, who works at the London School of Economics, where his salary is paid by a billionaire, Jeremy Grantham. Ward is not employed to do research, but to “communicate” climate science. He chooses to interpret this as a duty to put pressure on the media to censor people like me. He complains to the Times almost every time I mention climate change, often getting his facts wrong, and kicked up a huge fuss when the Times, after publishing half a dozen of his letters declined to publish another one.
Recently he has taken to complaining to the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Whenever Charles Moore, James Delingpole, David Rose, the late Christopher Booker, I or any other journalist writes an article arguing against exaggerated climate alarmism in one of the newspapers self-regulated by IPSO, he sends in a detailed and lengthy complaint. He never complains about the myriad alarmist mistakes that appear all the time like articles saying that “the science” tells us six billion people are going to die soon because of climate change.
IPSO was invented, remember, to give redress for people whose private lives were invaded by journalists, yet Ward is never complaining on his own behalf (though he probably will after this piece). To give one example, I wrote an article in the Times in 2017 about a scientist whistleblower in the United States who said his colleagues had deliberately distorted a data set to make climate change look more alarming.
Although all of this took place in America and had nothing to do with British scientists, let alone Ward himself, and although the scientist in question was happy with my article, Ward sent IPSO 11 separate lengthy complaints about supposed inaccuracies in my article. I responded with a very lengthy reply, which took two weeks to compile. IPSO asked him to respond to my response, which he did at great length. He raised several new issues that had not been in the original article. IPSO asked me to respond. I did so, at great length and effort. Ward responded a third time. (Remember: this is his day job.) This time, six months into the argument, I and the Times refused to reply and instead asked IPSO to rule on the matter. They did so and quickly found in my favour, dismissing all 11 of Mr Ward’s complaints. Every single one.
In 2019 he tried it again over an article of mine in the Telegraph about how giving up meat would make little difference to emissions, but this time IPSO rejected all of his complaints without even asking me for a response.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman site Alles Schall und Rauch (Everything is smoke and mirrors) here reminds us how back in 2004, “leading experts” warned the planet would likely be going down in flames by 2020!
Forecast 2004 – Global doomsday by 2020

By Freeman
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Only three more days and the first decade of the 21st century will be over. And there are also only three days left until the climate catastrophes predicted in 2004 will have to occur. Back then a report by “climate experts” was released and was widely reported in the media. It stated that the consequences of man-made climate change would cause sea-level rise, food and water shortages by 2020, leading to “environmentally driven conflict constellations” and “which can lead to violence or even war”.
Der Spiegel reported on the study, which George W. Bush presented, on February 22, 2004:
The scenario is as threatening as it is realistic: the Gulf Stream, which like a gigantic hot water heating system that pumps billions of liters of tropical water to the north, loses power, changes direction and suddenly collapses completely. Icy winds roar across northern Europe, devastating storms and floods devastate the coasts. The forests die off, the plains around the North and Baltic Seas freeze into tundra. The dramatic climate changes are putting people and governments in dire straits. Oil is running out, peacekeeping alliances erode. Bloody conflicts break out, wars for raw materials and food devastate the continents. Within a few years, the world is brought to the brink of total anarchy.”
On the same day as Der Spiegel, February 22, 2004, the British Guardian added:
Climate change could lead to a global catastrophe in the next 20 years, costing millions of lives in wars and natural disasters.”
A secret report suppressed by US defense chiefs and obtained by The Observer warns that major European cities will sink below rising sea levels if Britain is plunged into a ‘Siberian’ climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread violence will erupt worldwide.”
Dead wrong
But in three days’ time, the year 2020 will be nothing like the catastrophic predictions of doomsday made by the so-called climate experts and disseminated by the serious media. After 16 years of NOTHING!
Right at the forefront of the panic-mongering back in 2004 was and still is the German upper climatic liar, Professor Dr. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, founded in 1992, who for many years was Merkel’s advisor on the climate crisis and who calls himself the “father of the 2-degree target”.
In 2004, he was part of a group of climate scientists invited to visit the White House to inform the Bush administration about the current results of climate research.

Horror scenarios meant to sway Bush politically
With their horror scenarios about the future, the climatologists wanted their “expert opinion” to force Bush to accept man-made climate change as a real phenomenon. They also hoped  their panic-mongering about environmental degradation and the resulting climate refugees would convince the United States to sign global treaties to reduce CO2 emissions.
In a speech at the Federal Delegates’ Conference of the Greens in Berlin at the end of November 2017, Schellnhuber presented his idea of a climate pass, which had been strongly applauded by the party conference delegates, for the first time in public:
Anyone who has to leave their home country because of climate change should be allowed to emigrate to the countries that are mainly responsible for climate change is his position.”
This is the ideological background to the debate in the Bundestag, which on Friday 13 December discussed the consequences of “climate-induced migration, flight and expulsion” at the request of the Greens. The motion stated:
Whole archipelagoes and wide coastal areas threaten to disappear from the world map in the future. Already today, more people are being displaced domestically by climate- and environmental disasters such as floods and storms than by violence and conflict.
The Bundestag should therefore call on the Merkel regime to press ahead with the introduction of a climate passport, which, according to estimates of a flood of 140 million refugees, would make a German, or EU and US passport possible.”
The Greens have gone completely nuts and are the real cause of a catastrophe and destruction, namely through the mass migration and deindustrialization they are demanding.
Dire  predictions turn out to be phony
They justify their destructive policies with claims that are not true and disasters that do not happen. Nothing of what was announced to us decades ago has come true.
All the predictions of an end of the world go back much further than 2004, because I remember the beginning of the apocalyptic predictions of the 1970s.

May 19, 2014
A New York Times headline reads “Scientists Warn of Rising Oceans From Polar Melt” and goes on to say:
“A large section of the mighty West Antarctica ice sheet has begun falling apart and its continued melting now appears to be unstoppable, two groups of scientists reported on Monday. If the findings hold up, they suggest that the melting could destabilize neighbouring parts of the ice sheet and a rise in sea level of 10 feet or more may be unavoidable in coming centuries.”
The story, based on studies of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica, went ballistic in the news media with dire predictions of the ‘unstoppable’ catastrophe about to unfold.  
The authors of the Pine Island paper, Justin Gillis and Kenneth Chang say in their paper:  “…we find no major bed obstacle that would prevent the glaciers from further retreat and draw down the entire  basin.”
In  a  second  paper, “Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Underway for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica,” the authors (Joughin, Smith, and Medley) also infer that the entire West Antarctic ice sheet will soon disappear, resulting in a sea level rise of up to 10  feet.  The  governor of California is now suggesting moving  LAX and San Francisco airports!
WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW	
Since last week’s press releases, thousands of Antarctic photos and text items on the internet have	 been relabeled, and you can scarcely find any mention of Antarctica now without reference to ‘the	 unstoppable, collapsing Antarctic ice sheet.’ From all of the media hype, you would think that the West	 Antarctic ice sheet is presently in the process of collapsing and drastic sea level rise is imminent. THE	 WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET IS NOT COLLAPSING! The retreat of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers is	 NOT caused by global warming, and sea level is NOT going to rise 10 feet.

"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   The federal trial to determine whether Dylann S. Roof will receive the death penalty for his murderous rampage at an   church has become a delicate balancing act, pitting the desire of prosecutors to convey the fullness of grief for the nine devout victims against the due process rights of an unrepentant white supremacist who largely declines to defend himself. In three days of   testimony last week, prosecutors questioned 20 spouses, children, grandchildren and friends of the victims to draw painfully poignant portraits of men and women who were pillars of their church, families and community. Jurors heard not only the tributes of the bereaved but in some cases the voices of the dead  —   recordings of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney lecturing proudly about the   history of Emanuel A. M. E. Church, the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor booming a soulful a cappella solo, the Rev. Sharonda   praying in a crescendo at the funeral of a friend. The government’s lawyers called two or three witnesses to render a portrait of each victim testimony about one of the deceased  —   the youngest,    Tywanza Sanders  —   remains for Monday. The prosecution plans to rest its case that day, and Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, has said he will not call any witnesses. Closing arguments are expected on Tuesday. Mr. Roof, 22, stared straight ahead or down at the defense table, avoiding eye contact with witnesses who lost composure on the stand and jurors who sometimes dabbed away tears. When a prosecutor would conclude his gentle questioning, which could draw on for more than an hour, Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court would call for  . Mr. Roof, dressed in a   sweater and slacks, would rise slightly from his seat and announce: “No questions. ” That dynamic has prompted a series of challenges by Mr. Roof, and pointed exchanges between Judge Gergel and David I. Bruck, the veteran,   capital defender whom Mr. Roof has sidelined, about how much is too much. “It is not fair to allow that much testimony to be heard by the jury when I am not presenting any evidence  —   from my family or anyone else  —   in mitigation,” Mr. Roof argued on Wednesday in a motion that Judge Gergel denied. “If I don’t present any mitigation evidence, the   evidence will take over the whole sentencing trial and guarantee that I get the death penalty. ” Found guilty in December on 33 counts, including 18 that carry a potential death sentence, Mr. Roof has rejected Mr. Bruck’s strategy of presenting evidence about his background and mental health that might mitigate against his execution. The lawyer has been relegated to the role of standby counsel, allowed to sit beside Mr. Roof and offer guidance but not to question witnesses or to object to the government’s evidence. The usually   Mr. Bruck has not been able to contain his frustration. At several points last week, with the jury out of the courtroom, he pleaded with Judge Gergel to rein in the prosecution and to empower him to object to testimony. “This is sentencing it is not a memorial service,” said Mr. Bruck, who has often expressed his admiration for the victims and his sorrow for their families. “It has become a runaway freight train. ” Mr. Bruck told Judge Gergel that Mr. Roof did not have the capacity or courage to offer objections and consistently ignored the suggestions he passed along in notes. He said he had advised Mr. Roof to move for a mistrial. Judge Gergel has had none of it. He lectured Mr. Bruck that he had twice held competency hearings and determined that Mr. Roof met the legal thresholds to stand trial and represent himself, a constitutional right. “I have not noticed the bashfulness to make an objection any time he feels it appropriate,” the judge told Mr. Bruck on Friday. He asked Mr. Roof if he felt uncomfortable doing so. “No,” Mr. Roof replied, saying no more. The judge has, however, cautioned Julius N. Richardson, an assistant United States attorney, to restrict the number of victim impact witnesses and the length of their testimony. “At some point it’s too much,” Judge Gergel said. “I’m worried about the cumulative effect. ” Yet, he also acknowledged the emotion of the memories offered from the stand. “There is no antiseptic way to do this,” he said. Although they gradually acceded to Judge Gergel’s suggestion to “streamline” their case, prosecutors have argued that the scale of the massacre justified a large number of witnesses. “He is the one who chose to kill nine people,” Mr. Richardson said of Mr. Roof, who, according to testimony, wore shoes to a closed hearing last week bearing a   symbol of white supremacy. “He is the one who chose to go into a church to do it, and he’s the one who chose to do it to particularly good people. ” Impact statements at capital trials  —   and the legal questions surrounding them  —   rose to prominence in the 1980s as victims’ rights advocates won public support, including the passage of a law that altered the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. But in 1987, the United States Supreme Court ruled that such evidence in capital cases was a “constitutionally unacceptable risk. ” Four years later, it reversed that position when it ruled in Payne v. Tennessee. “Victim impact evidence is simply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the specific harm caused by the crime in question,” Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the    majority. Such evidence has become a staple of capital proceedings. Before Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people, prosecutors called 38 victim impact witnesses, Mr. Roof noted in a motion. More than a dozen testified at the 2015 trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who received the death penalty for the Boston Marathon attack that left three people dead and more than 250 wounded. Researchers have repeatedly found that such evidence has substantial effects on jurors who are weighing capital punishment. Mr. Roof’s choice to not call witnesses means that jurors will “not hear that evidence which tends to dampen the emotional effect” of grieving relatives, said Scott E. Sundby, a law professor at the University of Miami who has studied juror behavior in capital cases. Victim impact witnesses cannot, by law, opine about the penalty they prefer. But the jurors in Charleston have heard stories of intense suffering and loss, one after another. Prosecutors began by eliciting heartfelt reminiscences of family gatherings and final conversations, then pivoted to the excruciating moments of discovery after the killings of June 17, 2015. “I dropped the phone and just started jumping and fell on the floor and stayed there for two hours,” recalled Bethane Middleton Brown, Ms. Doctor’s sister. “I couldn’t move. ” Jurors saw an affecting video of Chris Singleton, the son of Ms.   rapping a tribute to his charismatic mother: “Took your life in the middle of the church, and I just pray, Mama, that you weren’t hurt. ” They heard Malcolm R. Graham, a former North Carolina state senator, describe the deep void left by the death of his sister, Cynthia Hurd, a longtime county librarian who served as his mentor and political guide. “I’m alive, I’m fit, but something is missing,” he said. “I can’t go to the store and replace it. I can’t reinvent it. ” Walter Jackson Jr. seemed to find cruel irony in his grandmother Susie Jackson’s being taken in a hate crime. “She was 87 when she passed, and that’s someone who’s gone through racism, discrimination, segregation,” he said. “Yet she was still that kind of person who still had that unconditional love for everyone. ” Daniel L. Simmons Jr. told of his initial bewilderment that his father, the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr. a    Vietnam veteran with a license to carry a concealed weapon, had not done more to protect the churchgoers as he always had his family. He got his answer after receiving the keys to his father’s car from the coroner and finding the gun inside. “When I opened the car, it was sitting on the front seat,” Mr. Simmons said. “He took it off before he went to church. ” Death penalty critics complain that the testimony here has traded on the inherent nobility of the victims to advance what they consider the most ignoble of punishments, one that many members of the families say they oppose. They note the paradox that a death sentence for Mr. Roof may bolster support for maintaining a penalty that has been inflicted disproportionately on  . Some said the impact evidence may produce grounds for an appeal. Henderson Hill, a lawyer who founded the Center for Death Penalty Litigation and who attended the proceedings last week, said the tenor amounted to “a whistle for a life for a life. ” “This is so far past the pale of what is acceptable practice that I find it just unrecognizable as a capital sentencing proceeding,” he said. “I’ve never seen this kind of celebration of life, even in black churches where the traditions are that services go on forever. ”"

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
President Trump has criticised other countries for pursuing technology which doesn’t work.
Trump rejects need for climate action at G-20: US has ‘cleanest’ water and air ‘we’ve ever had’BY ARIS FOLLEY – 06/29/19 04:08 PM EDTPresident Trump broke with the Group of 20 (G-20) nations on the need for climate change action on Saturday, saying the United States has the “cleanest water we have ever had.”…Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Trump said, “I’m not sure that I agree with certain countries with what they are doing. They are losing a lot of power. I am talking about the powering of a plant.”“It doesn’t always work with a windmill. When the wind goes off, the plant isn’t working. It doesn’t always work with solar because solar [is] just not strong enough, and a lot of them want to go to wind, which has caused a lot of problems,” he continued, according to The Washington Post.“Wind doesn’t work for the most part without subsidy. The United States is paying tremendous amounts of subsidies for wind. I don’t like it. I don’t like it,” he added.…Read more: https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451021-trump-rejects-need-for-climate-action-at-g-20-us-has-the-cleanest

"By Ian McClintock.
There is an old scientific tenet that says “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof”.
I commenced an independent, comprehensive investigation of CAGW (Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming) some 25 years ago because of the direct potential impact this would have on my farming enterprise.
Farmers work directly with nature and climate as they pursue their farming and grazing activities and if the world was going to warm, possibly catastrophically, it would at the very least mean a substantial change in my enterprise mix and management approach, and at worst, might mean I could no longer continue to farm.
I therefore had a strong vested interest in attempting to understand the science (and politics) behind the claims that were being made so that I could take appropriate action as future climatic events developed and demanded.
It goes without saying that I needed to seek out the actual truth with an open mind as it would be clearly counter- productive to delude myself with preconceived or incorrect ideas and assumptions.
It is a long story but what I found, quite early on in my investigation, is that the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), despite having spent many billions of dollars on attempting to find compelling evidence to substantiate their hypothesis, have been totally unable to do so.
At first I could not believe this, I must be wrong, so I carefully and critically re-read the IPCC Reports and much other relevant information. The result was the same, NO valid empirical evidence 1 has ever been cited. I was and am astounded.
A very careful study has shown that ‘Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming’ has proven to be no more than a politically generated fairy tale, yet the media, most Governments, many scientific organisations, Universities and others continue to ignore any and all evidence that challenges the IPCC claims and blindly accept what they say.
Why?

"A Progress Report
History
The Carbon Sense Coalition was founded seven years ago. Its 7 th birthday was on 12 th July, 2014. To see the historical formation documents go to: http://carbon-sense.com/carbon-sense/
No one asked or paid us to start this crusade, and we have never changed our policies as the result of external pressure or inducements. My personal motivation was hearing stupid or scheming politicians calling carbon dioxide a “pollutant”. I was also concerned by the increasingly anti-human, anti-industry ethos of the extreme Greens.
Since then we have fought quietly and persistently to explain and popularise the fallacies underlying the Mania of our Times. We have not been diverted to other causes, believing this is the biggest and most destructive political folly we have seen in a life-time of watching politicians. And the more we look, the more convinced we are of the cost and stupidity of the whole man-made global warming scam.
Our Main Focus
Our main problem is politics, not science. Politicians persevere in their climate/energy stupidities even though the science and the evidence no longer support them. They will only change when voters demand a change. Therefore our main focus is putting all aspects of the climate stupidity into short simple articles and spreading them into all media outlets and web sites available to us via letters, opinion pieces, media statements and newsletters. We also make submissions to public enquiries, and appear in person when invited.
We do not confine our activities to Australia – this is a world-wide problem requiring world-wide response.
Our Activities
We aim to get our message spread widely among ordinary voters and opinion makers. We welcome any website, newspaper, radio or TV station that will spread our message and we have had successes in all fields (except the Melbourne Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times, which, I believe have never published a thing we have said.) I believe the ABC also falls into this category of one-eyed media. But even among the green media, someone in there reads our things before shredding them, and some points may take root, lying there in their brain like unexploded bombs.

"**Lidl has said it will remove cartoon characters from its own-brand cereals to help parents buy healthy products.**
It hopes that the rebranded packaging, to be introduced in the spring, will alleviate the pressure of children's ""pester power"".
Health experts welcomed the move but called for government regulations on ""junk food marketing"".
A group of MPs has previously recommended a ban on cartoons on unhealthy foods.
Lidl said it will rebrand eight of its own-brand Crownfield products in total, including Choco Shells, which features two cartoon penguins on the box, and Rice Snaps, which is advertised with a grinning cartoon crocodile.
The new packaging will be free from cartoons.
Georgina Hall, the retailer's head of corporate social responsibility said it wants to help parents ""make healthy and informed choices"" about the food they buy for their children.
""We know pester power can cause difficult battles on the shop floor and we're hoping that removing cartoon characters from cereal packaging will alleviate some of the pressure parents are under,"" she said.
She stressed that the company seeks to make ""good food accessible for everyone"" and ""[help] customers lead healthier lives.""
According to Lidl's website, a serving of its Honey and Peanuts Corn Flakes - which features a cartoon bee on the box - contains 14g of sugar, compared to 0.4g in its regular Corn Flakes.
Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance - a coalition of organisations such as the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the British Medical Association - welcomed what it called a ""responsible approach"".
""We know that the use of cartoon characters on sugary products is a marketing technique used by the food industry to put their unhealthy products firmly centre stage in children's minds,"" she said.
However, she noted that more needs to be done than one retailer changing a category of products.
""We need the government to introduce regulations to create a level playing field and protect children from all types of junk food marketing,"" she added.
The move comes more than a year and a half after the health select committee recommended a ban on cartoons on sugary foods, such as Tony the Tiger and the Milky Bar Kid.
In October, England's outgoing chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, called for extra taxes placed on unhealthy foods to tackle child obesity.
In her final report, she also called for tighter rules on advertising.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""It's encouraging to see companies taking action to tackle childhood obesity.""
It added that it has reduced the amount of sugar in soft drinks and encouraged physical activity in schools. It said it will ""continue to assess"" the impact of marketing on children."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGood news: Germany’s “climate rescue” plan is light years away from FFF demands, thus postponing economic suicide leap, Bad news: plan means considerable hardship for German consumers and economy.

Haunted by visions of a climate collapse, German government yet decides to postpone its economic death leap, instead proposes highly watered down climate-rescue plan. 
FFF’s draconian demands
The Fridays for Future (FFF) movement is sweeping across Germany. Media reports claim more than a million people attended rallies and blocked streets in dozens of cities throughout the country yesterday. The demonstrators’ demands are clear: Away with cars, industry, meat and plastic, etc. In short: Economic suicide.
Merkel announces “climate rescue” plan
And spooked by the gains made by the Greens in recent EU elections, the German mainstream Socialist SPD and Conservative CDU parties have been scrambling to take climate rescue really seriously. “No more playing around,” they declared. Angela Merkel’s CDU-CSU/SPD coalition government announced “an immense act of strength” would be taken to combat climate change.
From that point on Germany has been on economic suicide watch with the country watching in suspense.
No economic death leap
After having met some 19 hours in a “Climate Cabinet” meeting, the suspense ended yesterday as Chancellor Merkel’s government compromised and announced its long-awaited bold plan. The promised “act of immense strength” plan, however, turned out to be every thing but, and is light years away from what the FFF movement and climate cultists had been demanding.
Though the package promises more economic hardship and environmental destruction, the country at least as put off its economic death leap – for the time being.
The German plan forsees higher fuel prices for consumers, 10 million electric cars by 2030, a network of one million charging stations, an air traffic tax, cheaper train tickets, and more solar panels and wind turbines. Read here.
German industry already reeling from the Green onslaught

But already the now high energy prices and massive attack on fossil fuels and the automotive industry have been causing Germany’s precarious economy to enter a nose dive.
Germany’s once powerful automobile industry – the backbone of the country’s economy – is already reeling. The entire industry is under “massive pressure”, says Axel Dransfeld, head of restructuring at Brandl, and automotive supplier.  German online NTV reports how workers at a number of automotive suppliers have not been getting their wages: “Just how dramatic the situation is is shown by the appeal made by IG Metall [trade union] spokesman Thorsten Dellmann at an information event for employees: ‘Let’s all pray that money will come.'”
Greens, FFF activists outraged by government’s plan
The Greens and FFF movement in Germany reacted to Merkel’s timid plan with outrage. For example, green lobbyist Volker Quaschning tweeted he couldn’t eat as much as he’d “like to vomit” and that it’s “a black day for the climate”.
FFF German activist Luisa “Longhaul” Neuerbauer retweeted Quaschning’s comment. Many activists are stunned and speechless by the timidity of Merkel’s 100-billion euro climate plan. However, the student protesters are absent from the streets today (Saturday).
“Collective psychosis…”wild fears and demnds”
Interestingly, some German climate alarmists are becoming alarmed by the hysteria the demonstrators have been showing on the streets and by the sheer uncompromising vehemence of their demands.
One RTL West reporter, Jörg Zajonc, commented “not only is our Earth doing poorly, but so is our understanding of freedom and responsibility. […] What I’ve also massively experienced today borders on a collective psychosis, paired with wild fear and demands. Ever shriller, ever louder, ever faster”.
Like the 1930s?
Zajonc also added that feasibility is being replaced by ideology, and anything that disagrees is getting labelled “criminal and so must be outlawed”.
He comments that the nation is becoming irreversibly divided by the extremism. Anyone expressing common sense is getting labeled “an enemy of the environment, a denier, someone who needs to be morally punished”.
The demonstration shell-shocked RTL West reporter Zajonc says: “I can barely believe any of it.”
Zajonc summarizes: “Freedom, democracy, liberal thought – all of it being sacrificed .. […] and everyone is enthusiastically cheering it on. What a development.”

"**Aberdeen Royal Infirmary's hospital kitchen has become the first in Scotland to be certified gluten free - by preparing food separately at night.**
The hospital was previously buying in gluten-free meals.
Now the dishes are being made on site, but at night to avoid risk of contamination from certain ingredients being used during the day.
ARI is the first hospital kitchen in Scotland to achieve the Coeliac UK accreditation.
Coeliac disease is a common digestive condition where the small intestine becomes inflamed and unable to absorb nutrients.
One in 100 people in the UK have the disease.
It is caused by an adverse reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.
Gluten is found in food containing those cereals, such as pasta and many types of bread and beer.
NHS Grampian believes the new processes could be rolled out to other hospitals across the country.
Hundreds of meals have to be prepared every day at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
Catering manager Stuart Donald said: ""Now we are making all of our gluten-free meals fresh on site, using local suppliers where possible with fresh ingredients.
""They are all made at a separate time of the day from the other meals being prepared, to ensure there's a total segregation of processes.
""Everything is being made at night. We have a separate chef who cooks these meals. The meals previously were bought in.""
Asked what difference patients will see, Mr Donald said: ""The first difference is rather than getting a frozen ready meal effectively for their lunch or their supper they're getting a fresh home-cooked meal like everyone else that takes the standard menu.
""The other big difference they can come in to hospital and be assured it's a safe meal for them to have. It can be quite worrying if you are coming into an unknown environment like a hospital, is your meal going to be safe?""
He said the in-house production also offered a cost-saving.
There was an unannounced audit of the hospital just before Christmas, confirming the accreditation.
Coeliac UK chief executive officer Hilary Croft explained: ""Being in hospital can make patients with coeliac disease feel vulnerable as they have to entrust their gluten free diet, which is the only treatment for their condition, to someone else.
""Coeliac UK only awards GF accreditation to hospitals that meet stringent and independently verified audit and training standards.
""We applaud Aberdeen Royal Infirmary's kitchen practices and processes regarding storage, labelling, preparation to avoid cross contamination and ensure the safe delivery of gluten free food by trained staff.""
One patient in Aberdeen, Vera Lyall, said she had been eating gluten-free food for about 40 years.
""You learn quite quickly what you can and cannot eat,"" she explained.
She rated the gluten-free food made on site at the hospital as ""pretty good"", and added: ""It certainly looks better, it's attractive, it's got a lot going for it I think.
""I have confidence, you've got to trust people."""

I was recently reminded of one of the most common misconceptions about our changing climate that is often accepted as fact by climate skeptics and true believers alike. Last week a commentary written by a fellow geologist and colleague lamented the less snow and cold in recent winters compared to the winters of his youth in Kentucky in the 1950s and 60s. He also related a talk he had with an octogenarian in Europe over the holidays who told him that he also recalled common snow during Christmas in Germany but alas, no longer.
This nearly universally held belief that even the most skeptical of us tend to believe is “warming by recollection.” Virtually every person from snowy climes claims that winters today are nothing like they were when they were a child. This recollection reinforces the thought that we are experiencing global warming within our own lifetime. Never mind that the slight warming of ~0.6 oF (0.3 oC) that a typical 45-year-old may have experienced since that big snowfall when he was five years old is much too slight to be recognizable by anyone.
Before I looked at the actual data on the subject, I also believed that the snow of my youth in Pennsylvania exceeded any of recent decades. My research into snowfall records for my hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, showed that my memory of snowfalls past was quite flawed. Snowfall here had been on the rise, rather than in decline.

Further examination from around the country revealed that this was not the exception, but the rule, as snow has generally been on the increase dating back many decades. My colleague’s recollection was equally flawed and records indicate that five of the top ten snowiest Februarys in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky, had occurred since 1975!
This notion is not a new one.  In 1801, Thomas Jefferson expressed similar opinions about the moderating temperature and lack of snowfall.
Both heats and cold are becoming much more moderate within the memory even of the middle-aged. Snows are less frequent and less deep…. The rivers which then seldom failed to freeze over in the course of the winter, scearcely (sic) ever do now.
— Thomas Jefferson 1801
Just like Thomas Jefferson in 1801, we remember those times that are remarkable, while forgetting the unremarkable. Our memories are filled with the times of extreme weather conditions as opposed to the moderate.
Big snowfalls periodically happen. Just like the picture below of me and my siblings in the snow in 1961, a six or eight-inch snowfall may come well past your knees when you are only five years old and three feet tall. It is a memory indelibly etched in your brain because it was so awesomely fun. (The odd-looking fellow in the bowler hat is my younger brother).
Increasing snow is not isolated to random sites in the United States but confirmed using data from the Rutgers Global Snow Lab (GSL) that reveal snow cover both in North America and across the northern hemisphere have been increasing.

The mistaken notion of decreasing snowfall in our lifetimes reinforces the idea that many people have that supposed man-made warming is more significant and impactful than it really is. Despite the evidence to the contrary we are warned regularly of the “end of snow” from warming driven by our use of fossil fuels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned us in 2001 that “milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms.”
Dr. Kathryn Hayhoe, no stranger to failed alarmist predictions, stated in 2008 that the California region would experience 70% to 90% reduction in snowfall due to warming. This was just three years before California’s snowiest winter on record of 2010/2011.
As with so many other climate fantasies the “end of snow” prediction doesn’t stand up to review of the actual data. Go ahead and buy those skis, you will be using them often in the decades to come.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019. Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years. On January 2, 2019 the Maryland Board of Public Works rejected a proposed right of way for a subsidiary of Trans Canada Pipelines that would carry natural gas produced in Pennsylvania to West Virginia. The Board concluded that the pipeline would “bring Maryland environmental problems without economic benefits”. The rejection came after 60 elected state representatives sent a letter urging the board members to reject the proposal. In doing so, they referred to the fact that Maryland had passed a law in 2017 to ban hydraulic fracturing to produce natural gas in Maryland. The letter included these statements:“Given that Maryland has banned fracking, it defies our state’s existing energy policy to bring the same public health risks to our residents by way of a pipeline… Moreover, enabling fossil fuel production runs counter to the state’s goals of increasing renewable energy production.”The letter also noted that the pipeline would cross at least 10 wetlands and 19 streams, in addition to the Potomac River. When reading stories like this, one is tempted to think that indeed alien invaders have landed and turned a substantial portion of the population into beings completely out of touch with reality and logic. For the sake of dampening the enthusiasm of any in Canada who might applaud decisions like that taken by the Maryland Board, let us dissect it. Natural Gas Production in Pennsylvania Has Nothing to Do with Fracking in Maryland Whatever the merits of Maryland’s decision to ban hydraulic fracturing within the state, they presumably concern the allegations that this production system may have adverse effects on earthquakes and on groundwater quality in Maryland. It is not the responsibility of the Maryland government or any of its agencies to make judgments about the safety of natural gas production techniques in other states. In fact, Pennsylvania has been a significant gas producer for many decades and has the fastest rate of production growth in the U.S. Pennsylvania is fully capable of judging how to protect its environment and economy. Constructing Natural Gas Pipelines Does Not Pose Undue Environmental Effects It should be obvious that construction of a pipeline to transport natural gas across Maryland poses none of the issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. Natural gas transmission pipelines have been built in the United States for over a century. As indicated in the following graphs, there are about 320,000 miles of gas transmission and gathering systems in the United States. Mileage of Natural Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines in the United States 2004-2017 Source: U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety AdministrationWhy, one wonders, would anyone think that natural gas pipeline systems will pose unacceptable local environmental risks in Maryland when no other state in the union has found this to be so? Those 320,000 miles of gathering and transmission lines cross millions of wetlands, rivers and lakes. Indeed, constructing gas pipelines so as to safely cross waterways has been part of the engineering of pipelines for decades. Systems for avoiding adverse water effects are constantly improving, not deteriorating. Blocking Natural Gas Supplies to Neighbouring States will Not Support Renewable Energy The natural gas that would have been transported by the Trans Canada system was intended for delivery to West Virginia, one of the poorest U.S. states, but one that is seeking to have additional natural gas supplies for residential, commercial and utility purposes. To the extent that the natural gas would have been used for power generation, it largely would have replaced coal-fired generation, as gas is a cheaper fuel. The State representatives’ argument that denying the pipeline right of way would “enable” fossil fuel production is clearly wrong, in that fossil fuel-based electricity generation in West Virginia has been going on for many decades, and will go on for many decades to come. Blocking one source of natural gas supply does not mean that one has blocked them all, and West Virginia and its residents will almost certainly continue to search for the lowest cost, as well as the most reliable, source of electricity generation. That is not wind and solar energy. By attempting to constrain West Virginia’s decision as to its future sources of energy, Maryland demonstrated similar presumption as it did in judging that Pennsylvania should not produce natural gas by hydraulic fracturing. The Arrogance of Environmentalists Canadians, and Albertans in particular, will recognize the actions of Maryland as similar to those of British Columbia and Quebec in blocking oil pipeline access to export markets. In all these cases, those who claim that humans are causing a global environmental problem are choosing to use their geographic position as a blunt tool to deprive their fellow citizens of access to energy markets and/or access to secure and competitively priced energy supplies. They are doing so when the amounts of energy and related emissions involved are tiny compared to the global growth in emissions, which are driven by Asian economies. In effect, they are imposing significant economic harm on others for no environmental gain. These actions should be identified and condemned wherever they occur. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

 Guest essay by Steve Goreham
Large-scale storage of electricity is the latest proposed solution to boost the deployment of renewables. Renewable energy advocates, businesses, and state governments plan to use batteries to store electricity to solve the problem of intermittent wind and solar output. But large-scale storage is only an insignificant part of the electrical power industry and doomed to remain so for decades to come.

Last month, Senator Susan Collins of Maine introduced a bi-partisan bill named “The Better Energy Storage Technology Act,” proposing to spend $300 million to promote the development of battery solutions for electrical power. Collins stated, “Next-generation energy storage devices will help enhance the efficiency and reliability of our electric grid, reduce energy costs, and promote the adoption of renewable resources.”
Arizona, California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon adopted statutes or goals to develop storage systems for grid power, with New York committing to most ambitious target in the nation. In January, as part of his mandate for “100 percent clean power by 2040,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a target to deploy 3,000 megawatts (MW) of storage by 2030.
Today, 29 states have renewable portfolio standards laws, requiring utilities to purchase increasing amounts of renewable energy. But the electricity output from wind and solar systems is intermittent. On average, wind output is between 25% and 35% of rated output. Solar output is even less, delivering an average of about 15% to 20% percent of rated output.
Mandating the addition of wind and solar to power systems is like forcing a one-car family to buy a second car that runs only 30% of the time. The family can’t replace the original car with the new intermittent car, but must then maintain two cars.
Renewable advocates now propose electricity storage to solve the intermittency problem and to help renewable energy replace traditional coal, natural gas, and nuclear generators. When wind and solar output is high, excess electricity would be stored in batteries and then delivered when renewable output is low, to try to replace traditional power plants that generate electricity around the clock.
Headlines laud the growth of battery installations for grid storage, growing 80% last year and up 400% from 2014. But the amount of US electricity stored by batteries today is less than miniscule.

Pumped storage, not batteries, provides about 97% of grid power storage in the United States today. Pumped storage uses electricity to pump water into an elevated reservoir to be used to drive a turbine when electricity is needed. But less than one in every 100,000 watts of US electricity comes from pumped storage.
In 2018, US power plants generated 4.2 million GW-hours of electrical power. Pumped storage capacity totaled about 23 GW-hrs. Battery storage provided only about 1 GW-hr of capacity. Less than one-millionth of our electricity is stored in grid-scale batteries.
Electricity storage is expensive. Pumped storage is the least costly form of grid storage at about $2,000 per kilowatt, but requires areas where an elevated reservoir can be used. Battery storage costs about $2,500 per kilowatt for discharge duration of two hours or more. Batteries are more expensive than onshore wind energy, which has an installed market price of under $1,000 per kilowatt. But a key factor in the effectiveness of storage is the length of time that the system can deliver stored electricity.
In the case of New York State, plans call for the installation of 9,000 MW of offshore wind capacity by 2035 and 3,000 MW of battery storage by 2030. The wind system will likely cost in excess of $9 billion, and the battery system will likely cost about $7.5 billion. But this planned battery deployment is wholly inadequate to remove the wind intermittency.
If the wind system has an average output of 33% of its rated output, then the planned 3,000 MW of battery storage would only be able to deliver the average wind output for about two hours. To replace output for a full day when the wind isn’t blowing, 36,000 MW of storage would be needed at a cost of $90 billion, or about ten times as much as the wind system itself. Since several days without wind in most locations is common, even a day of battery backup is inadequate.
In addition, the 10-15 year lifetime of grid-scale batteries is no bargain. Wind and solar systems are rated for 20-25 years of service life. Traditional coal, natural gas, and nuclear systems last for 35 years or more.
Storage of electricity should be regarded as foolish by anyone in the manufacturing industry. For decades, major companies pursued just-in-time manufacturing, “lot size one,” Kanban, lean manufacturing, and other programs designed to eliminate finished goods inventory to reduce costs. Electricity is delivered immediately upon generation, the ultimate zero-finished-goods-inventory product. But many organizations now clamor for electricity storage to try to fix the intermittency weakness of renewables.
Today, battery grid storage capacity is less than one millionth of national electricity output. Practical battery storage adds a cost factor of at least ten to the cost of the partner renewable system. It will be decades before battery storage plays a significant role in large-scale power systems, if ever.

"The recent Earth Hour advertisements exhorted us to turn off the lights in the evening and enjoy a “candle-lit dinner” instead.
This crystallised in my mind the idiocy of this event – everyone knows candles produce more CO2 per lumen than the incandescent bulb, and lots more than a fluorescent bulb. 
This is symbolic of the retreat from reason that is Earth Hour – not one single coal-powered station in the country will shut down for earth hour, so no power will be saved, it will instead be wasted.
The fact that “2,848 cities, towns and municipalities in 84 countries have already committed to Vote Earth for Earth Hour 2009” is evidence of nothing but a form of mass hysteria.
The fact that China, India and emerging countries lead the call for action on climate change is a cynical act of hypocrisy, given that they are calling for action by everyone else but China, India and emerging countries. 
These countries are themselves the fastest growing “polluters” in the world – China now exceeds the carbon footprint of the USA, and India is not far behind.
The Vote Earth movement seems to me to be a rejection of the Age of Enlightenment in favour of a return to the dim glow of medieval ignorance, where modern-day peasants will sit smugly in the dark as a form of Mother Nature worship. 
As Earth Hour asks us to symbolically turn off the light of reason, I have decided to Vote Human instead and turn every light in the house on tomorrow night – I encourage you all to do the same.

November’s _Scientific American_ features a profile of Georgia Tech atmospheric scientist Judith Curry, who has committed the mortal sin of reaching out to other scientists who hypothesize that global warming isn’t the disaster it’s been cracked up to be. I have personal experience with this, as she invited me to give a research seminar in Tech’s prestigious School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences in 2008. My lecture summarizing the reasons for doubting the apocalyptic synthesis of climate change was well‐​received by an overflow crowd.   
  
  
Written by Michael Lemonick, who hails from the shrill blog _Climate Central_ , the article isn’t devoid of the usual swipes, calling her a “heretic„ which is hardly at all true. She’s simply another hardworking scientist who lets the data take her wherever it must, even if that leads her to question some of our more alarmist colleagues.   
  
  
But, as a make‐​up call for calling attention to Curry, _Scientific American_ has run a poll of its readers on climate change. Remember that _SciAm_ has been shilling for the climate apocalypse for years, publishing a particularly vicious series of attacks on Denmark’s __ Bjorn Lomborg’s _Skeptical Environmentalist_. The magazine also featured NASA’s James Hansen and his outlandish claims on sea‐​level rise. Hansen has stated, under oath in a deposition, that a twenty foot rise is quite possible within the next 89 years; oddly, he has failed to note that in 1988 he predicted that the West Side Highway in Manhattan would go permanently under water in twenty years.   
  
  
_SciAm_ probably expected a lot of people would agree with the key statement in their poll that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is “an effective group of government representatives and other experts.”   
  
  
Hardly. As of this morning, only 16% of the 6655 respondents agreed. 84%—that is not a typo—described the IPCC as “a corrupt organization, prone to groupthink, with a political agenda.”   
  
  
The poll also asks “What should we do about climate change?” 69% say “nothing, we are powerless to stop it.” When asked about policy options, an astonishingly low 7% support cap‐​and‐​trade, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in June, 2009, and cost approximately two dozen congressmen their seats.   
  
  
The real killer is question “What is causing climate change?” For this one, multiple answers are allowed. 26% said greenhouse gases from human activity, 32% solar variation, and 78% “natural processes.” (In reality all three are causes of climate change.)   
  
  
And finally, “How much would you be willing to pay to forestall the risk of catastrophic climate change?” 80% of the respondents said “nothing.”   
  
  
Remember that this comes from what is hardly a random sample. _Scientific American_ is a reliably statist publication and therefore appeals to a readership that is skewed to the left of the political center. This poll demonstrates that virtually everyone now acknowledges that the UN has corrupted climate science, that climate change is impossible to stop, and that futile attempts like cap‐​and‐​trade do nothing but waste money and burn political capital, things that Cato’s scholars have been saying for years.

" Contributed by Viv Forbes @ 2019Australia is a land of deserts, droughts, floods, bushfires, flammable forests and fire-prone grasslands – these conditions have developed since the start of the Holocene Warm Era about twelve thousand years ago.All previous Australian bushies, both black and white, have recognised the key principle of fire management in Australia – you can have many small managed “cool” fires in early spring or a few unplanned disastrous “hot” fires consuming a heavy fuel load in hot dry winds in late spring. (Arsonists have other priorities and light their fires at these most dangerous times.)Every generation of Australians sees its fire disasters and the worst ones get names – “Black Thursday” in 1851, “Black Friday” in 1939, “Ash Wednesday” in 1983, and the worst to date “Black Saturday” in 2009. Not even an armada of expensive water bombers will stop these bushfires – at that stage fire can only be prevented or contained by fire.Good fire management disappeared as rural voters were outvoted by the green leafy suburbs. Urban greens thought we could prevent all fires and encourage wildlife by locking up more parks and encouraging fire-loving, oil-containing eucalypts and flammable weeds close to towns and dwellings. (Many native plants require fire to burst open their rock-hard seed pods.) Graham Lloyd of the Australian notes that even the Hippies of Nimbin blame greens for “the incendiary state of the Australian bush”.If this image is missing it can be downloaded from: https://saltbushclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/green-fires.jpgEven more stupid are those who think politicians can control or abolish droughts and bushfires by banning the use of coal and oil in a futile attempt to lower global temperature.

"Nearly 200 of the approximately 450 people who asked Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont to forgive their misdemeanor marijuana convictions had their wish fulfilled this week. In one of his final acts in office, Governor Shumlin on Tuesday pardoned 192 people convicted of marijuana possession, fulfilling a promise he made early last month to consider forgiveness for anyone who applied by Christmas. “While attitudes and laws about marijuana use are rapidly changing, there is still a harmful stigma associated with it,” Mr. Shumlin, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday. “My hope was to help as many individuals as I could overcome that stigma and the very real struggles that too often go along with it. ” Such charges can stand in the way of finding work, being accepted to college and traveling internationally. The pardons were limited to people who had no violent criminal histories or felony convictions, and who had not been found guilty of driving under the influence or reckless driving. People who did not apply for a pardon under Mr. Shumilin can still apply to have marijuana possession convictions expunged from their record through a court process established under a 2013 state decriminalization law. Mr. Shumlin cited that law and his own support for legalizing marijuana as the basis for the pardons. “Vermont should follow the many states that are legalizing and regulating the use of marijuana and put to an end the incredible failure that is the War on Drugs,” he said in the statement. His successor, Phil Scott, a Republican, has urged caution, though he has signaled he may be open to legalization eventually. He is scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday and has said that he supports the pardons, according to local news reports. Those who received the pardons ranged in age from 22 to 69, though most were younger than 40. All but 15 live in Vermont. In all, Mr. Shumlin has issued 208 pardons since taking office in 2010, more than any other governor in the history of the state, his office said."

Len Mills sends us a study of wind farms reported in the Daily Mail. It emerges that their real production history falls a long way short of the breathless claims some make for them.
I too wish to save the world, but not by using wind turbines, because they’ll ruin us first. They’re expensive, ugly, short-lived, noisy to the point of ill-health, ugly, kill bats and birds, they stop generating if there’s too little or too much wind, they demand lots of rare metals and they’re ugly. 
Incidentally, if you actually want to contaminate a dependable schedule with a wind turbine’s unpredictable variability, a wind farm needs instant, reliable backup (meaning fossil-fuelled spinning reserve), meaning you greatly increase your establishment costs, about double your operating costs and your CO2 emissions are not reduced by a jot or tittle. I ought to mention they brutalise the landscape.

People should learn from their mistakes. The last time President Obama took it upon himself to “lead” a U.N. climate fest was at Copenhagen in December, 2009, which, from the point of view of my greener friends, was a notorious failure.   
  
  
Today, he’s back, this time at Ban Ki-moon’s U.N. “climate summit,” but not a lot of his global peers are going to be there. Prime Ministers from China, India, Canada, Australia and Germany have all decided to stay home.   
  
  
Together, they emit almost three _times_ what the U.S. does, which means we are going it alone in New York. Any policy we agree to is meaningless. According to the EPAs “Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse‐​gas Induced Climate Change” (yes, it is MAGICC), if we emitted not another molecule of carbon dioxide between tomorrow and January 1, 2100, the amount of warming that would be prevented is a mere 0.14°C, an amount too small to reliably measure. That’s probably an overestimate, too, as the EPA appears to have overestimated 21st century warming.   
  
  
EPA assumes that the “sensitivity” of surface temperature to a carbon dioxide doubling is 3°C, an amount very likely far too great, compared to what is being observed. Or, perhaps, compared to what is _not_ being observed, as global surface temperatures have held constant for 17+ years now (actually 19, according to Cato scholar and eco‐​statistician Ross McKitrick), according to the surface annual temperature history that climate scientists cite the most. So the “saved” warming from any policy is likely to be even less than what MAGICC says.   
  
  
You’re not going to hear that from the President. As happened at the 2009 Copenhagen disaster, the President and the Secretary‐​General will declare a roaring success.   
  
  
In Copenhagen, that meant that all participants had to submit specific action plans to reduce emissions within two months. But, a bit more than a month before the deadline, the U.N.’s climate commissioner, Yvo deBoer, announced that they really didn’t have to. Then he resigned.   
  
  
There’s still no new international agreement to replace the failed Kyoto Protocol. But, last month, the President got people pretty worked up when he proposed a new, U.N.-sponsored agreement (a treaty—or a modification of an existing one—by any other name) on climate change that he didn’t think would require ratification by a two‐​thirds vote of the Senate, counter to what is explicitly stated in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of our constitution:   




[The President] shall have Power, by and with Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur… 



Not only is the president going to be quite lonely at the U.N., he could be setting the country up for a huge constitutional conflagration.   
  
  
It’s not going to happen on his watch, though. Any agreement that he signs on to won’t likely take effect until at least 2016. Even under the most rosy Democrat‐​wave election that year (one is likely to happen, given the demographics of the Senate crowd that is up for re‐​election), there’s no way 67 are going to vote to ratify a treaty that differentially harms the U.S. while China and India keep increasing their emissions dramatically.   
  
  
Of course we’re going to hear the rhetoric, repeated again today, that the U.S. has to “lead by example.” Well, Mr. President, with those big emitters and the developing world saying “no way,” no one is going to follow. In 2012, the last year for which we have reliable data, the U.S. contributed 14% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Together, the five big no‐​shows emitted almost three _times_ as much as us, and their fraction can only grow as both China and India are determined to develop their economies.   
  
  
If we were really going to lead by example we would show the world how our free economy has resulted in investments in clean, big power sources like shale gas. The developing world is currently lacking in large sources of dense energy. If we’re going “lead by example,” maybe that example should be that governments should get out of the way of economic development and cleaner energy will follow.

"**Across Britain, people are spending more money on vegan products, and plant-based diets are trending online.**
With major supermarkets catching on and stocking up on vegan-friendly food - BBC News asks what's behind the rise?
A vegan diet involves cutting out animal products like meat, fish, dairy and eggs.
According to the latest research by the Vegan Society, conducted in 2018, there are around 600,000 vegans in Great Britain.
It's estimated that this is up from 150,000 in 2006, and that there are twice as many women than men who are vegan.
Around 360,000 people also describe themselves as lifestyle vegans, who commit to only using or buying cosmetics and clothes free from animal products, for example.
Supermarket chains in the UK are stocking more vegan options to keep up with consumers' food choices.
In 2018 Waitrose introduced a dedicated vegan section in more than 130 shops, while Iceland reported that sales of its plant-based food have risen by 10% over the last year.
And a range of fast-food companies, from Greggs to McDonalds and Burger King to KFC, have launched, or announced, vegan options for the UK.
The UK market for meat-free foods was reportedly worth Â£740m in 2018, according to market researchers Mintel, up from Â£539m only three years ago.
Interest in vegetarian and vegan products shows no sign of slowing down, as retail sales are expected to increase to Â£658m by 2021.
Social media has had a big part to play in the rise of the plant-based lifestyle.
Celebrities like Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Ellen DeGeneres are some of the well-known figures who don't eat animal products, while #vegan has more than 87 million posts listed on Instagram.
Veganism is a hot topic - the number of Google searches worldwide has also spiked in recent years.
The search engine uses a number out of 100 to represent interest in a search term. In 2009, the word ""veganism"" had a peak popularity score of only 33 but it had increased to 100 only 10 years later.
The top three most-searched questions on the topic in the UK ask what veganism is, about its sustainability and how it affects climate change.
Giles Quick, director at market researcher Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""The vegan market has changed fundamentally in the last six or seven years - it's now for everyone.
""Social media has brought it to the forefront of customer's minds, and the mainstream. It's not seen any more as a choice for life, but as a choice for one meal, one moment, for one or two days a week.""
Flexitarianism, part-time vegetarianism or veganism, is becoming more and more popular. And in January 2019, 250,000 people pledged to go vegan for the first month of the year, under the Veganuary campaign.
Launched in the UK in 2014, and supported by a wide range of social media, Veganuary encourages people ""to try vegan for January and beyond"".
According to analysts, young women are driving the growth of the vegan movement.
But, a range of reasons lie behind veganism's rise.
A total of 49% of those interested in cutting down on their meat consumption said they would do so for health reasons, according to a survey of more than 1,000 adults in Great Britain by Mintel.
Weight management, animal welfare and environmental concerns were also big motivators.
With interest increasing all the time in healthy eating, part-time veganism might well become a full-time fixture in many people's lives.

It is a fact that land surface temperature records going back before 1900 globally are very few and sparse. Worldwide there are only 116 stations Version 3, unadjusted datasets that go all the way back to January 1880 – most of them are located in USA and Europe (northern hemisphere).
1 dataset per 3 million sq km
That’s just 116 stations for measuring the earth’s 510.1 million km². Obviously the data are nowhere near sufficient to allow any conclusions that have any degree of certainty.
Only a dozen for the entire southern hemisphere
What is astonishing is that of these 116 stations, less than a dozen are located in the southern hemisphere. Yes, 10 stations for 250 million sq km of earth surface. Discerning a hemispheric mean temperature from them would be something like counting the number of people living in Greenland and then extrapolating the earth’s population from it. In other words, the result is just a meaningless guess.
Former NASA researcher: Data too scarce, no certainty
So statements claiming that the Earth’s mean temperature for the time around 1880 is known are in truth fraught with huge uncertainty.
“This is nothing new,” wrote Japanese climate expert Dr. Mototaka Nakamura in an email to NTZ on the topic of earlier surface coverage.
“We simply did not have many observing stations in the 1800s and early 1900s. They can produce ‘new data sets’ and claim that they have ‘better data sets’ all day long, but they just can’t make any meaningful difference for periods up to 1980,” said the former NASA researcher.
Southern hemisphere
For the southern hemisphere we do have from NASA ten long-term, Version 3 unadjusted temperature datasets, going back to 1880. Today we will examine them to look at what they tell us.
4 of 7 Australia charts show cooling
Let’s begin with Australia. Here the large country down under has 7 such datasets going back to 1880, at the locations depicted by the following chart:

Note how the entire western part of the country is totally void of data.
To put it in perspective, Australia’s vast 7,692,024 square kilometers have been covered long-term by only 7 stations, which means an average of one station for every 1.1 million sq. km. – an area that is 3 times larger than Germany! By comparison today, the German DWD national weather service uses about 2000 stations to monitor the country’s weather conditions.
Plotting the data available from these 7 long-term stations, we get the following result:



<!--

/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Here we see in fact that 4 of the 7 stations have a cooling trend, not something we’d expect amid all the alarmist talk of warming.
South Africa: Capetown shows no warming trend
The lone southern hemisphere Version 3 unadjusted dataset coming from Africa was produced by a station Capetown, South Africa. What follows is a plot of the data:

Here as well we see no warming since 1880. And notice the cyclic nature of the temperature changes. And it’s remarkable to see how strongly Capetown temperature behavior lines up with the AMO:

Of course the scientists at NASA altered the V3 unadjusted data and created a V4 “unadjusted” dataset, one whose plot is very different today and obscures the potential link to the AMO.
Argentina showed no warming
Like Africa, South America also has only one single Version 3, unadjusted dataset going back to 1880, located at Bahia Blanca, Argentina:

This data set also shows no warming since 1880, and warming only appears after NASA scientists when back and changed the data, as shown above.
Antarctica
Though the South Pole has no stations going back to 1880, a number of stations were set up starting in the mid 20th century by a variety of countries. Here’s what these datasets show since 1979:

The East Antarctic stations show a lot of cooling and very little warming, according to a 2018 publication by Clem et al.
And at the Antarctic Peninsula, which we hear is supposed to be melting down:

Here as well we see more cooling than warming. Clearly scientists would have an easier time supporting cooling.
Take-aways:

The global surface temperature data going back to 1880 is far to scarce to allow any trend conclusions with any certainty.
Data on the temperature history of the southern  hemisphere before 1900 is practically non-existent.
The data that are available support cooling more than warming.
NASA finds warming only by altering the data.
The data from the South Pole also support cooling more than warming.

Globally, the surface temperature data is inadequate in volume, and what we do have have been altered to fit a political agenda. The best we have are satellite data, and they go back only 40 years.

"**A ""reverse advent calendar"" has been set up by a food bank to help families who need items after Christmas Day.**
The Bedford Foodbank is asking for donations such as tinned fruit, saucepans and tea bags in the New Year.
Sarah Broughton, project manager, said January could be a ""bleak month"" as many people had spent their money.
It has a list of 24 most-needed items and asked for donations to start in January, rather than on 1 December.
""People are so generous up to Christmas, but donations drop off into the New Year, which is understandable,"" she said.
""Everyone needs to tighten their belts in January and they also spend more on heating and lighting.""
Wendie Harvey, the chief executive of Bedford-based charity Family and Children's Early-help Services (Faces), said: ""People just don't realise how hard January is as most families have spent the money they have making sure the children have something.""
Mr Broughton said their warehouse was ""bursting at the seams"" before Christmas, but things were expected to change, as people with ""very strict budgets"" would still need their help afterwards.
She said a man called to make a donation and she asked him to delay it by a few weeks and he told her that was a ""brilliant idea"".
The charity said it feeds about 650 people a month, and handed out 3,500 food parcels in the last 12 months.
Donations can be taken to its warehouse on Murdock Road on 2, 3, 6 and 10 January."

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.

The fossil fuel industry, political lobbyists, media moguls and individuals have spent the past 30 years sowing doubt about the reality of climate change – where none exists. The latest estimate is that the world’s five largest publicly-owned oil and gas companies spend about US$200 million a year on lobbying to control, delay or block binding climate policy.
Their hold on the public seems to be waning. Two recent polls suggested over 75% of Americans think humans are causing climate change. School climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion protests, national governments declaring a climate emergency, improved media coverage of climate change and an increasing number of extreme weather events have all contributed to this shift. There also seems to be a renewed optimism that we can deal with the crisis.
But this means lobbying has changed, now employing more subtle and more vicious approaches – what has been termed as “climate sadism”. It is used to mock young people going on climate protests and to ridicule Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old young woman with Asperger’s, who is simply telling the scientific truth.

At such a crossroads, it is important to be able to identify the different types of denial. The below taxonomy will help you spot the different ways that are being used to convince you to delay action on climate change.
1. Science denial
This is the type of denial we are all familiar with: that the science of climate change is not settled. Deniers suggest climate change is just part of the natural cycle. Or that climate models are unreliable and too sensitive to carbon dioxide.
Some even suggest that CO₂ is such a small part of the atmosphere it cannot have a large heating affect. Or that climate scientists are fixing the data to show the climate is changing (a global conspiracy that would take thousands of scientists in more than a 100 countries to pull off).
All these arguments are false and there is a clear consensus among scientists about the causes of climate change. The climate models that predict global temperature rises have remained very similar over the last 30 years despite the huge increase in complexity, showing it is a robust outcome of the science.

The shift in public opinion means that undermining the science will increasingly have little or no effect. So climate change deniers are switching to new tactics. One of Britain’s leading deniers, Nigel Lawson, the former UK chancellor, now agrees that humans are causing climate change, despite having founded the sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation in 2009.
It says it is “open-minded on the contested science of global warming, [but] is deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated”. In other words, climate change is now about the cost not the science.
2. Economic denial
The idea that climate change is too expensive to fix is a more subtle form of climate denial. Economists, however, suggest we could fix climate change now by spending 1% of world GDP. Perhaps even less if the cost savings from improved human health and expansion of the global green economy are taken into account. But if we don’t act now, by 2050 it could cost over 20% of world GDP.
We should also remember that in 2018 the world generated US$86,000,000,000,000 and every year this World GDP grows by 3.5%. So setting aside just 1% to deal with climate change would make little overall difference and would save the world a huge amount of money. What the climate change deniers also forget to tell you is that they are protecting a fossil fuel industry that receives US$5.2 trillion in annual subsidies – which includes subsidised supply costs, tax breaks and environmental costs. This amounts to 6% of world GDP.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that efficient fossil fuel pricing would lower global carbon emissions by 28%, fossil fuel air pollution deaths by 46%, and increase government revenue by 3.8% of the country’s GDP.
3. Humanitarian denial
Climate change deniers also argue that climate change is good for us. They suggest longer, warmer summers in the temperate zone will make farming more productive. These gains, however, are often offset by the drier summers and increased frequency of heatwaves in those same areas. For example, the 2010 “Moscow” heatwave killed 11,000 people, devastated the Russian wheat harvest and increased global food prices.

More than 40% of the world’s population also lives in the Tropics – where from both a human health prospective and an increase in desertification no one wants summer temperatures to rise.
Deniers also point out that plants need atmospheric carbon dioxide to grow so having more of it acts like a fertiliser. This is indeed true and the land biosphere has been absorbing about a quarter of our carbon dioxide pollution every year. Another quarter of our emissions is absorbed by the oceans. But losing massive areas of natural vegetation through deforestation and changes in land use completely nullifies this minor fertilisation effect.
Climate change deniers will tell you that more people die of the cold than heat, so warmer winters will be a good thing. This is deeply misleading. Vulnerable people die of the cold because of poor housing and not being able to afford to heat their homes. Society, not climate, kills them.
This argument is also factually incorrect. In the US, for example, heat-related deaths are four times higher than cold-related ones. This may even be an underestimate as many heat-related deaths are recorded by cause of death such as heart failure, stroke, or respiratory failure, all of which are exacerbated by excessive heat.

4. Political denial
Climate change deniers argue we cannot take action because other countries are not taking action. But not all countries are equally guilty of causing current climate change. For example, 25% of the human-produced CO₂ in the atmosphere is generated by the US, another 22% is produced by the EU. Africa produces just under 5%.
Given the historic legacy of greenhouse gas pollution, developed countries have an ethical responsibility to lead the way in cutting emissions. But ultimately, all countries need to act because if we want to minimise the effects of climate change then the world must go carbon zero by 2050.

Deniers will also tell you that there are problems to fix closer to home without bothering with global issues. But many of the solutions to climate change are win-win and will improve the lives of normal people. Switching to renewable energy and electric vehicles, for example, reduces air pollution, which improves people’s overall health.
Developing a green economy provides economic benefits and creates jobs. Improving the environment and reforestation provides protection from extreme weather events and can in turn improve food and water security.
5. Crisis denial
The final piece of climate change denial is the argument that we should not rush into changing things, especially given the uncertainty raised by the other four areas of denial above. Deniers argue that climate change is not as bad as scientists make out. We will be much richer in the future and better able to fix climate change. They also play on our emotions as many of us don’t like change and can feel we are living in the best of times – especially if we are richer or in power.
But similarly hollow arguments were used in the past to delay ending slavery, granting the vote to women, ending colonial rule, ending segregation, decriminalising homosexuality, bolstering worker’s rights and environmental regulations, allowing same sex marriages and banning smoking.
The fundamental question is why are we allowing the people with the most privilege and power to convince us to delay saving our planet from climate change?

We have long suspected that the never‐​ending _sturm und drang_ surrounding climate change would have little real impact on public policy or energy markets because no politician ever got elected by promising to impose — or defending the imposition of — significant, observable costs on the present for the well‐​being of the future … in _any_ policy arena. Believe what you like about the science, but the inescapable political fact is that voters — and in particular, swing voters — have the time horizons of newborn babes. Any serious policy response to climate change would, by force, require a rather steep increase in fossil fuel prices and American voters have demonstrated time‐​and‐​time‐​again a deep aversion to exactly that. Good luck finding the pol‐​on‐​the‐​make willing to put his or her head into _that_ political wood chipper.



If you listened to conservative policy activists, however, you might think we’ve found exactly that pol in the person of President Barrack Obama. Almost five months ago, his EPA issued its long‐​awaited regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, regulations that were required by law once the EPA deemed those gases a pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act (a finding that was, in fact, made on December 15, 2009). And … the Right promptly went nuts. “EPA’s new rule will do much more than kill coal,” warned Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. “The higher electricity prices caused by the EPA rule will close American factories and send jobs overseas.” The Manhattan Institute’s Robert Bryce charged that the proposed regulations would ultimately cost around $700 billion (the cost of replacing coal‐​fired power plants with natural gas‐​fired power plants) and, accordingly, “result in significant price increases for domestic electricity consumers.” Mike Brownfield and Nicolas Loris — both of the Heritage Foundation — argued that the regs mean “higher energy costs, fewer jobs, a less prosperous economy.” And so another talking point was born for the political Right as we enter the home stretch of the 2012 presidential campaign.



And yet … it’s simply not true. The regulation at issue proposes an emissions target of 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt‐​hour of generation — something impossible for coal‐​fired power plants to meet without expensive carbon capture technology — but it applies only to brand‐​spanking‐​new, non‐​peaking natural gas power plants and coal‐​fired power plants that might be built some day in the future. Not to existing power plants. Not to existing power plants that undertake extensive upgrades that might deem them a “new source” for regulatory purposes under the Clean Air Act. And not to peaking gas‐​fired power generators.



That’s the key to understanding this regulation because — as the EPA points out (and as CEOs in the utility sector confirm) — there are no new coal‐​fired power plants in the pipeline that this rule might cover and no prospect of the same unless natural gas prices hit at least $9.60 per million BTU (in 2007 dollars) on a sustained basis. Moreover, almost all of the gas‐​fired power plants that will be built will meet these standards without any additional costs.



Hence the regulation will impose negligible costs and, as the EPA itself confesses, negligible benefits.



So why do it? EPA has two arguments. First — who knows? — the fuel market could change, and if it does — whammo! — the regs will bite. Second, the electricity market will be calmed by the removal of regulatory uncertainty.



The second rationale is fine, but what about the first? The Energy Information Administration (the analytic arm of the Department of Energy) finds that even in its high‐​economic‐​growth, low‐​coal‐​price, low‐​capital‐​cost for new coal‐​fired capacity, and high‐​gas‐​price scenario — that is, a perfect storm — no new coal‐​fired power plants would be built through 2025 (when the modeling ends) in its baseline scenario. EPA’s also examined an alternative scenario where shale gas production is only half what is expected and electricity demand almost 50 percent higher than expected. Still, no new coal through 2020 (when that particular model ends its analysis).



Now, friends of ours on the Right might counter — reasonably enough — that history is littered with forecasts of energy price futures that look ridiculous in retrospect, so we shouldn’t be so confident that natural gas prices won’t skyrocket in the future. Well, anything’s possible, but it’s worth noting that the futures price for natural gas in August 2022 (the farthest out that one can buy gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange) is $3.01 per million BTU. Likewise, published forecasts from the various for‐​profit consulting operations all expect gas prices in the foreseeable future to be only a smidge higher than they are today. For context, the average annual price of natural gas has _never_ exceed $9.60 per million BTU. And the price has been above $9.60 in only 8 months over the last 15 years.



For gas prices to get this high on a sustained basis, you have to assume that either (a) shale gas will prove a colossal, over‐​hyped, mega‐​bust (something the Right is most definitely _not_ in the usual business of positing) or (b) the U.S. auto‐​fleet will quickly transition to natural gas powered engines, driving up the demand for natural gas and, thus, the price. Either is theoretically possible, but neither is very likely, much less something one might posit in the course of making claims about the ultimate cost of EPA’s regulations.



One might think that conservatives would be positively _euphoric_ about these regs … and environmentalists, likewise, spitting mad. Once the Supreme Court gave the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the aegis of the Clean Air Act, draconian rules to shut‐​down the coal sector could have been imposed unilaterally by the Obama administration. They could have gone after existing coal‐​fired generation, but didn’t. They could have gone after coal‐​fired power plants that upgraded into “new source” status, but didn’t. They could have imposed steep requirements on old and/​or new gas‐​fired generators, but didn’t. They essentially … did nothing: And this from an administration that had long argued that political opponents better come to the negotiating table and sign‐​on to a cap‐​and‐​trade bill lest the administration grow tired of talk and ram something through unilaterally.



Alas, the Right’s hysteria is given political credence by the Left’s inexplicable enthusiasm for this regulatory nothing‐​burger. _The New York Times_ editorialized that the rule is “an important step” that “will accelerate the shift from coal to natural gas and cleaner fuels.” The Center for American Progress and the Sierra Club, for their part, strongly endorsed the rule because, they say, it will stop 22 coal‐​fired power plants currently in the pipeline from going forward, which will in turn cut carbon emissions by 123 billion pounds annually (a whopping 1 percent of projected total U.S. emissions). Apparently, they, too, either haven’t read the rule or are spinning madly for their Obama‐​voting membership base. The rule, in fact, notes that “transitional sources” — that is, coal‐​fired power plants that have applied for permits but haven’t begun construction as of yet — aren’t covered by these regulations as long as investors put a shovel in the ground within a year after the new rules take full legal effect. And for the record, the EPA counts 15 such “transitional sources” that might be in play; not 22.



What do we make of this? First, the Obama administration believes that championing regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a political loser and simply isn’t going to do so until political conditions change (and that isn’t likely). Second, the political heat is so great in the climate change kitchen that a great deal of the analysis about what is, and is not, going on simply cannot be trusted. Third, we were right. The climate change debate is like the population debate of the 1970s; something that people often pound the table about but are never going to pound‐​out meaningful legislation over.

"**Ajinomoto, a Japanese company, is not a household name in the West - but a product it makes, monosodium glutamate, is notorious.**
Commonly referred to as MSG, the flavouring agent conjures up images of greasy meals followed by headaches.
Now Ajinomoto has launched a campaign to recover MSG's reputation by taking on an unlikely target - Merriam-Webster's Dictionary.
The publisher is being pressed to change ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"".
The dictionary entry is racist and unscientific, says Ajinomoto, and unfairly vilifies MSG.
A campaign video featuring Asian-American celebrities declaring that ""MSG is delicious"" and urging an edit has helped prompt the publisher to say it will reconsider.
Tucked between ""Chinese red"" and ""Chinese rose"", the disputed entry in Merriam-Webster's is defined as:
_""A group of symptoms (such as numbness of the neck, arms, and back with headache, dizziness, and palpitations) that is held to affect susceptible persons eating food and especially Chinese food heavily seasoned with monosodium glutamate.""_
It first appeared in the reference book in 1993, but entered American parlance decades earlier.
The etymology is traced to a 1968 letter that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine claiming that Chinese food brought forth ailments.
The letter was uncovered to be a hoax, but the myth remains. The US Food and Drug Administration has long approved MSG for consumption, and studies have failed to show that the chemical causes the alleged ""syndrome"".
The flavour enhancer works when molecules of MSG bind to receptors on the tongue that naturally sense the key flavour chemical it contains - glutamate.
Glutamate is a compound naturally found in foods from breast milk to parmesan cheese.
MSG was patented in 1909 by the Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda, who gave his invention the name ""the essence of taste"" and described its ineffable flavour as ""umami"", now recognised as one of the five basic flavours.
Although anecdotal claims that MSG has adverse effects have proliferated since the mid-20th Century, no studies have established any accepted mechanism for harm.
A 2019 review of scientific literature in the journal Food Science and Food Safety concluded that claims linking MSG to an assortment of ailments were unsubstantiated.
The comedian and chef Eddie Huang and the TV host Jeannie Mai were recruited to bolster the MSG's cause.
""You know what gives me a headache? Racism,"" says Ms Mai.
The campaign theme fits within a larger movement to elevate ethnic foods, which chefs like Mr Huang have argued are unfairly seen as inferior to European fare.
Merriam-Webster's has said that it will consider revising ""Chinese restaurant syndrome""."

A thought about climate change. Politicians around the world have been calling for faster and faster action to reduce emissions. Our own Prime Minister has joined the political hype-train by announcing climate change is “my”/her generation’s nuclear-free moment. (Who made everyone under 40 “her” generation? and why are we now pitting different generations against each other?) 



Politicians around the world have clamoured over each other to announce they will do more than the other for climate change, but, so far, we haven’t seen any material change in emissions. Labour-Greens have had power for 2 years and haven’t yet passed an amendment to the emissions trading scheme. But there are a few home truths that no-one on the political left, and few on the right, are willing to discuss. 



Firstly, the World will not end if we pass 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5C)of warming. The children marching in the street with signs saying “You will die of old age, I will die of climate change” have been needlessly exploited by an increasingly fanatical Green lobby. The _NZ Herald_ has reported a “breakthrough” report that predicted the end of civilisation due to climate change. It was a case of a media article over-hyping a non-peer reviewed report, which itself had overstated and misrepresented findings of other reports, already considered fringe. 



Scientists expect the impacts of 1.5 C warming to be lower than 2 C. But the same statement is true for the difference between 2.0 and 2.5 degrees. The IPCC predicts that, by the year 2100, 1.5C warming will result in 10cm less sea level rise than 2.0C. The costs of global warming are real, but there is no indication they are insurmountable. And there is nothing magically different that happens at 1.5C that doesn’t happen at 1.6C. 



The IPCC has not predicted that 1.5C is the magic number where climate change becomes catastrophic. This is not what last year’s IPCC report stated. The OECD has estimated that the cost of inaction on global warming by 2060 will be about 2% of GDP. About equal to the cost of one recession. Potentially this Government’s impact on business confidence has already had a larger impact on the New Zealand economy.



Secondly, assuming the IPCC models reflect the relationship between carbon dioxide and global warming, there is almost no chance the world will avoid 1.5C. If every country achieves the target they promised in Paris, global emissions will be 52 – 58 billion tonnes per year by 2030. The IPCC states the globe needs to have 25 – 30 billion tonnes by 2030. In other words, emissions need to be half what we expect.



 **There is almost zero chance the globe will achieve such a reduction.** We would have to reduce emissions close to 4% per year for the next 11 years. At the moment, global emissions are going up. It is fantasy land to think, after 30 years of negotiations, countries like China, Brazil and India, who are **rightfully focused on poverty eradication, are going to suddenly sacrifice economic development for climate change.** But this is the pathway the Zero Carbon Bill aims to sign NZ up to.



So this is the problem: On one hand, the likely impacts of climate change are being **hugely overstated by the media and political left**. On the other hand, there is a massive gap between what politicians say they think the world should do and the plain reality of global emissions. There is a major ‘reality gap’ in the debate on global warming. I believe this has been allowed to manifest as a result of any politician, scientist or economist who questions global warming policy, instantly being ostracised as a global warming ‘denier’. 



James Shaw has already tried to insert this into the debate on his Zero Carbon Bill by labelling the National Party’s political opposition as the new climate denialism in his speech at this year’s Green Party Conference. The science of climate change is complex, but the economics are more complex again, and the domestic and global politics even more difficult again. We have to be able to have an adult debate on how we respond to the proposal that we radically revolutionise the global economy. 



Economists and politicians have to be allowed to offer considered and balanced perspectives. I can’t accept the proposal we are expected to and just never question any legislation that has the aim of reducing emissions, no matter what the cost, simply for moral reasons. **How can politicians defend signing NZ up to an emissions target that has almost zero chance of being achieved, both here or abroad, and isn’t justified by any scientific or economic findings?**



These issues need to be debated properly. I am interested in your views.

When will our greener friends at the UN learn that it’s just not a good idea to make definite predictions about certain disasters?



This time they have been called out on their 2005 prediction that by now there would be 50 million “climate refugees” — people choosing to emigrate because of bad weather. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) even came up with a global map showing precisely where people would migrate from.



Pretty much every forecast about climate change or its effects should be viewed as a hypothesis rather than a fact. After all, as Firesign Theater once noted, “the future’s not here yet”. But the UN named a specific year (2010) which allows for an actual test of their prediction.





Pretty much every forecast about climate change or its effects should be viewed as a hypothesis rather than a fact.



Census takers around the world have inadvertently adjudicated the UN’s forecast. It was dead wrong. Pretty much every recent census reveals that populations are growing rapidly precisely where everyone was supposed to be migrating from. (And where is the story that global warming causes babies?).



Folks were supposed to be streaming away from low‐​lying tropical islands because of worse and more frequent hurricanes. The population of the Bahamas, which catches about as many tropical cyclones as any place on earth, is up 14% since 2000. The Solomons, up 20%. Sychelles: 9%.



Did I mention that global hurricane activity has recently sunk to its all time measured low, despite the UN’s strident statements about more frequent and terrible storms? (Note that the hurricane data is only reliable for the last fifty years or so, hence the word “measured”.)



Is this exaggeration of an affect of climate change by the UN an isolated incident? Hardly. Recent history reveals the UN to be a systematic engine of climate disinformation.



In 2007, the UN famously stated that, if warming continued at present rates (whatever that means — there hasn’t been any since the mid‐​late 1990s), the massive Himalayan glaciers would disappear 23 years from now. While the source, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proclaims itself the consensus of climate science, there’s no credentialed climatologist on earth who believes that this ice cap, which is hundreds of feet thick, could possibly disappear so soon.



When the government of India, which knows something about the Himalayan glaciers that feed the great Ganges River, challenged the UN’s forecast, the head of the IPCC, Rajenda Pachauri, labeled it “voodoo science”.



It turns out that the UN was the voodoo practitioner. Dr. Murari Lal, who authored the statement, eventually admitted that it was in the UN climate report to spur the governments of India and China into reducing their carbon dioxide emissions, and that it was not based on anything in the peer‐​reviewed scientific literature.



In the same report, the IPCC claimed that even a slight variation in tropical rainfall would cause a disastrous loss of the verdant rainforest — despite incoming satellite data that showed a remarkable resilience to an ongoing sharp drought.



Then it made the absurd claims that 55% of the Netherlands was below sea level, and that there has been no change in ice coverage in the southern hemisphere, where polar ice is indeed growing significantly.



The IPCC also stated that a mere nine years from now, tropical crop yields would be cut in half by a massive decline in annual rainfall. Even computer models that assume large scale drought reduce yields by about half of this.



Is all of this due to chance?



Scientists, as humans, make judgemental errors. But what is odd about the UN is that its gaffes are all in one direction. All are exaggeration of the effects of climate change. In each case, the IPCC was relying upon scientific literature that was not peer‐​reviewed in the traditional sense. No one has found analogous errors in the other direction (which would be an underestimation of climate change based upon the “grey” literature), and you can bet that people have been looking very hard in an effort to exonerate the UN.



In an unbiased world there should be an equal chance of either underestimating or overestimating the climate change and its effects, which allows us to test whether this string of errors is simply scientists behaving normally or being naughty.



What’s the chance of throwing a coin six times and getting all heads (or tails)? It’s .015. Most scientists consider the .050 level sufficient to warrant retention of a hypothesis, which in this case, is that the UN’s climate science is biased.

The Oil Age Is Coming to a Close Noah SmithBloomberg October 29, 2019(Bloomberg Opinion) — The oil industry faces an uncertain future. The world is rapidly waking up to the severity and immediacy of the threat from climate change. At the same time, electric vehicles are getting cheap enough to compete with internal-combustion engines. BloombergNEF expects electrics to begin taking over in about a decade:[…]Yahoo! Finance
Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He was an assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University, and he blogs at Noahpinion. Bloomberg
Which is it?
Does “the oil industry face an uncertain future”?  Or is “the Oil Age coming to an end”?  “The Oil Age is coming to an end” doesn’t sound very uncertain to me.  Or maybe Former Professor Smith listened to too many Doors albums in college (I know I did)…
The future’s uncertain and the end is always near…Jim Morrison, The Doors, Roadhouse Blues, 1970
Before “electrics begin to take over,” they first need to top Ford F-Series pickup trucks.

 Figure 2. Looks like Ford F-Series pickup trucks will still be outselling all EV’s in 2050. (US Energy Information Administration) 
EV’s may be taking over in the parking lots of the ivory halls of academia and LaLa Land of BNEF blogging, but the developing world likes SUV’s.
Oct 23, 2019SUVs: A Reality Check On Oil Use And CO2 EmissionsJude Clemente Contributor  Energy I cover oil, gas, power, LNG markets, linking to human development.The never-ending spirit of wanting a more enjoyable and easier life is a constant reality that far too many of us involved in our energy-environment discussion unwisely choose to ignore.A perfect example of this is SUVs: gas-guzzling Sport Utility Vehicles that are increasing both oil demand and CO2 emissions.Much bigger, much safer, and much more fun to drive, the harsh fact for some is that people love SUVs.The Paris-based International Energy Agency gives us a much-needed reality check on SUVs, oil demand, and the corresponding CO2 emissions.SUVs are becoming more popular in the emerging economies of the world, where urbanization and expanding middle classes are giving more people more access to buy.Many see SUVs as a symbol of wealth and status. And why not?Even environmentalists Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mayor De Blasio love oil-swilling SUVs. […]Forbes
Figure 3. “Share of SUVs in global car salesDATA SOURCE: IEA; JTC”   Forbes 
Jude Clemente actually understands the energy industries… as opposed to the  to the former professor of finance, who seems to be clueless about… everything…
 Meanwhile, concerns over groundwater pollution are leading to growing calls for a ban on hydraulic fracturing, the main source of increased U.S. production during the past decade.  Former professor of finance 
The former professor of finance is almost half right.  Frac’ing is the leading “source of increased U.S. production during the past decade.”  The second-leading source is the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, where “shale” scale frac’ing isn’t a factor (1)(2)(3).
However “concerns over groundwater pollution” are only “leading to growing calls for a ban on hydraulic fracturing” from left-wing (Marxist) politicians.  There is no evidence whatsoever that frac’ing is any threat to groundwater.
Can anyone guess how many times I’ve heard this sort of thing the past 38 years?
 Reduced demand for crude will send prices plunging, cutting into profits at oil extractors and refiners. Share prices of oil majors have drifted lower in recent years:[…]Workers in the energy industry need to be prepared for this shift. For knowledge workers, such as geologists, chemists and software engineers, this means cultivating technical skills that can be useful in other fields such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, health care or finance.   Former professor of finance 
Clearly, this former professor of finance doesn’t know Jack Schist about the oil industry.  The oil & gas business follows a “boom & bust” cycle.  High oil prices reduce demand relative to supply.  Low oil prices reduce supply relative to demand, ad nauseum. Shares of most oil companies have been beaten down since 2014-2015 because the price crash destroyed a lot of equity. If “reduced demand for crude” sends “prices plunging,” it will spur an increase in demand.  That’s how business works.  Maybe they don’t teach this in former professor of finance school.
While the oil industry certainly employs some chemists and software engineers (although, I’ve never worked for a company that did), the “knowledge workers” primarily consist of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, accountants, lawyers, petroleum land management professionals and compliance specialists.  At least he mentioned geologists.   Cyclical downturns have led to several episodes of layoffs since 1986 and the voluntary exodus of many “knowledge workers”.  Most of the geoscientists (geologists and geophysicists) I started out with at Enserch Exploration in 1981 left the industry in the late 1980’s through 1990’s.  Most went into hydrology/environmental/engineering geology, a few became schoolteachers, one became a NASA astronaut and is currently the Director of the USGS.  I know of maybe 2 or 3 who went into finance… And none who went into pharmaceuticals or health care.   Otherwise, no schist Sherlock… Back up plans are sort of de rigueur in this business.
This is where the former professor of finance went full Tropic Thunder.
Lower-skilled workers and fracking boom towns, however, will have a much harder time landing on their feet.[…]The problem will be compounded for those who live in the small towns and cities that grew up around oil-extraction sites. Americans have been less willing to move from place to place in search of work in recent decades, and big cities are no longer lands of opportunity for those without an advanced education. The decline of the oil industry may leave the country dotted with yet more decaying half-empty ghost towns, unable to pay for the upkeep on their infrastructure, afflicted with drugs and alcoholism and suicide.Governments at the local, state and federal levels should work to prevent this unhappy future. People in decaying oil towns can be given vouchers to help them to move, perhaps to a nearby thriving college town. Former professor of finance 
Did I mention that this former professor of finance doesn’t know Jack Schist about the oil industry?  What does he think Houston, Midland, Tyler and a whole lot of other oil towns looked like in the late 1980’s, early 1990’s and other bust cycles?
Did he seriously suggest giving hard-working blue collar workers “vouchers to help them move to…  a nearby thriving college town”?  

But… Then he sped right on past full Tropic Thunder.  
The march of technology means oil’s days are numbered.  Former professor of finance 
The oil industry is a helluva lot more high tech than wind and solar.  Due to advances in seismic imaging technology over the past 40 years, we can literally “see” oil & gas accumulations more than 30,000′ below sea level in geological settings that couldn’t even be imagined, much less imaged, just 10 years ago.   Due to advances in drilling technology, we can now drill highly precise directional wells in over 10,000′ water depths, through thick layers of salt, to hit pinpoint targets we didn’t even know were there just a few years ago.
The “march of technology” means that “oil’s days are numbered in decades, if not centuries.
 Figure 4. Demand for 110 to 130 million bbl of petroleum liquids in 2050 will require “all hands on deck,” rather than vouchers to move to “a nearby thriving college town.”  (US Energy Information Administration)  
I have read a lot of truly idiotic articles about the demise of the oil industry, often sponsored by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, but this one takes the cake.  The former professor of finance earns a Distinguished Ron White Cross with a The Stupid it Burns Service Device and a Billy Madison Lifetime Achievement Award…

By **Gregory Wrightstone**  
Gregory is a geologist and author of the popular bestselling book _[Inconvenient Facts – the science that Al Gore doesn’t want you to know](https://inconvenientfacts.xyz/)_



On April 29, 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf released the latest version of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) Climate Action Plan, announcing that Pennsylvania would join the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 states committed to implementing policies that **support the Paris Agreement** — an international collaboration from which the U.S. has withdrawn.



According to the governor, “states like Pennsylvania must take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect our communities, economies, infrastructures, and environments from the risks of a warming climate.”



The plan’s primary objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 80% by 2050 in the Keystone State to reduce the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere and keep future increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius.



Described in the 231-page plan are more than 100 actions intended to reduce GHG emissions, 15 of which are analyzed in detail. **Each action involves increased taxation, increased regulation, increased spending or restrictions on citizens’ freedoms.**



Some very relevant questions should be answered by the governor and the PA DEP concerning this far-reaching plan that will necessarily have significant negative impacts on the Commonwealth’s citizens and businesses:



The overarching goal of the proposal is to lower the Earth’s temperature by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Pennsylvania. **However, nowhere does this hefty document estimate a reduction of temperature.**



To obtain an estimate, we used the **MAGICC** simulator (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change) that was developed by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research under funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The model estimates how much temperature rise would be averted globally by various reductions of CO2 for the United States.



Calculations using this assume an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions, a climate sensitivity of 2.0 and the latest estimate of Pennsylvania’s share of U.S. emissions (4.2%) to reveal the following theoretical reductions: 



This extremely small effect should be a very important component in the discussions on whether to impose the significant burdens of the Climate Action Plan on the state and its citizens. 



Listed on page 14 of the plan is a section titled “Why Does Pennsylvania Need a Climate Action Plan?” It lays out justifications for why the plan is needed, listing 10 climate impacts that were “already occurring and put Pennsylvanians and local industries at risk.” **Many of the impacts it described as occurring are, in fact, not happening and in some cases are improving the state’s ecosystems.**



We will look at only a few of the most egregious examples of misinformation due to space restrictions, but these should serve to illustrate that **this document is more of a political tool than science-based justification for action.**



 **Claim: More frequent extreme weather events including drought**



 **Claim: Increased risks of injury and death from extreme weather events.**



 **Claim: Increased human health risks from air pollution**



Most of what was listed as justification for implementation of this far-reaching plan were **projections of what may or may not occur many decades in the future**. These projections are based on climate models that **over-predict warming by 2.5 to 3 times too much.** It is important to separate speculation of what may occur in the future based on failed climate models from the actual events that can be empirically observed. […]



The Plan identified 15 actions that were most impactful for reducing GHG emissions and would require increased taxation, spending and government control, some of which are listed below. 



In the Energy sector, the Plan would: 



Transportation 



Please note the repeated use of the terms “invest” and “incentivize” as **code for spending more taxpayer dollars**. Additionally, the Cap & Trade program that is proposed will be a huge revenue generation scheme that would draw large sums of money into Harrisburg for redistribution to favored programs. 



Pennsylvania’s citizens would not only be burdened by new direct taxation, but additional costs of regulation and **higher energy costs would be passed on to customers.** While the plan offers no estimates of costs, they surely would run into the millions if not billions of dollars.



According to the Plan itself, the 15 action items would only reduce the state’s GHG emissions by 21%, far less than the 80% targeted. **In order to reach the higher targeted goals, ever more onerous and economically crippling actions would be required.**



Pennsylvania’s Climate Action Plan will **impose huge costs** on the Commonwealth’s citizens and businesses while burdening them with additional levels of restrictions and regulations.



Companies will pass these higher costs on to consumers or absorb the costs, which will deter hiring and new investment. A rise in prices means that consumers will buy less, and companies will drop employees, close entirely, or move to other states where the cost of doing business is lower. The consequence means fewer opportunities for Pennsylvania’s workers, **less economic growth, lower incomes, and higher unemployment.**



The justifications for imposing this plan are flawed, the costs and regulations are economically crippling, and **the result is a temperature reduction so low that it is indistinguishable from zero**. 



_–_  
 _Those who will not learn from the mistakes of others are doomed to repeat them. Why do Ardern, Shaw, Woods et al think that they can do any better? Why will reduction of New Zealand emissions make any difference to global temperatures? It is always the same mantra: Wind, solar, electric vehicles, public transport … Hasn’t worked, won’t work._

Grasslands and arable land cover just 10% of Earth’s surface but (with the oceans) they produce all of our food and fibre. But the productivity and health of our grasslands, farms and livestock are under threat from global warming alarmists and green preservationists.
We are afflicted by climate crazies and methane madness. It is poor public policy that condones restrictions on grazing operations, or taxes on grazing animals, based on disputed theories that claim that bodily emissions from farm animals will cause dangerous global warming.
New Zealand was the first cattle country to propose a “livestock fart tax”. Four hundred farmers then drove 20 tractors to the Parliament in Wellington waving placards and banners saying “STOP THE FART TAX”. The proposal was laughed out of Parliament. But the war on farmers and livestock continues.

Ruminants such as sheep, cattle and goats cannot make long-term additions to the gases in the atmosphere – they just recycle atmospheric carbon and nitrogen nutrients in a cycle-of-life that has operated for millennia.
Grazing ruminant animals with their emission products have always been part of healthy grasslands. Only when large numbers of animals are fed artificially and confined on the one patch of land do pollution problems appear.
Many otherwise genuine environmentalists are assisting the destruction of grasslands with their native pastures and endangered grass birds. Blinded by their love for the trees, they neglect the grasses, legumes, herbs and livestock that provide their food. In Australia they pass laws to protect weedy eucalypts invading the grasslands but ignore the valuable and declining Mitchell grass that once dominated Australia’s treeless plains.
Grasslands are also under threat from cultivation for biofuel crops, from subsidised carbon credit forests and from the remorseless encroachment of fire-prone government reserves and pest havens.
Trying to control atmospheric carbon-bearing gases with taxes is futile and anti-life. Even if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere doubled, or more, the climate effect if any, is probably beneficial (warmer at night and near the poles and with more moisture in the atmosphere). More importantly, all life on Earth already benefits from the additional CO2 plant nutrient in the atmosphere, and would benefit even more were CO2 levels to double.
Nitrogen is the most abundant natural gas in the atmosphere, inhaled in every breath and an essential component of all protein. Grazing livestock merely recycle a few compounds of nitrogen, all of which either return to the atmosphere or provide valuable nitrogen fertilisers for the plants they graze on.
We also have the modern methane madness. Mobs of grazing ruminants have been roaming the grasslands since cave-man days. Methane has also been seeping from marshes, bubbling out of oceans, leaking from coal seams and oil seeps and being released in huge quantities from volcanoes. So what more can a few domestic cows and sheep do to affect this? Methane from domestic ruminants is a non-problem.
It is a foolish and costly fantasy to believe that Earth’s climate can be controlled by passing laws, imposing taxes, attempting to manipulate the bodily emissions of farm animals or trying to prevent farmers from clearing woody weeds invading their pastures.

"MEXICO CITY  —   An official working at the United States consulate in Guadalajara, the   city in Mexico, was shot and wounded on Friday evening by a young man who stalked him in the parking lot of a shopping mall and then fired as he drove out. The State Department official, who was not identified, was in stable condition after the shooting, a spokeswoman from the United States Embassy in Mexico City said on Saturday. Neither embassy officials nor the Mexican attorney general’s office commented on a possible motive. Guadalajara is the capital of Jalisco, the headquarters of the New Generation Jalisco cartel, an organized crime gang that has carried out violent attacks on the Mexican military and police over the past two years. But residents of the city have rarely been a focus of cartel violence. Security footage released by the consulate on its Facebook page shows the gunman, dressed in a loosefitting dark blue   and pants and wearing glasses, waiting on the sidewalk adjacent to the exit ramp of an underground parking lot in an upscale neighborhood. A white car pulls up to the barrier gate, waits for the arm to lift and drives off. Then, as the consular official’s black car pulls up, the gunman raises his arm, fires and runs away. In a separate video, taken a few minutes earlier, at 6:16 p. m. the consular official, wearing red shorts and with a gym bag slung over his shoulder, pays at the automated ticket machine and walks off, with the gunman following him. The F. B. I. said it was offering a $20, 000 reward to anybody who could provide information leading to the identification of the gunman. “The safety and security of our employees overseas is our highest priority,” the United States Embassy spokeswoman said. Eduardo Almaguer, the attorney general for Jalisco, told the local news media that the consular employee worked in the visa section of the consulate. State and federal authorities are working on the investigation. Employees of the United States Embassy and consulates in Mexico have been victims of drug violence in the past few years, though they have sometimes been targeted by mistake. That was the case in 2010 of a consulate employee in the border city of Ciudad Juárez, her husband and the husband of another employee who were killed. The white S. U. V. that the employee and her husband were driving in was mistaken for the vehicle of a gang leader whose killing was ordered by a rival. In 2011, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was killed and another injured when they were ambushed by members of a drug gang hit squad on a highway. The next year, two C. I. A. employees were wounded when federal police officers fired at their armored car in an attack that has never been explained."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreen hubris: ARD German public television commentary labels its audience “consumption addicts” – mentally ill – and pleads they be punished with “so damn expensive” prices.
Germany’s equivalent of the BBC, publicly (forced) funded ARD Broadcasting aired a commentary on Monday evening by journalist Lorenz Beckhardt. The commentary was to respond to the latest Earth Overshoot Day report. Eckhardt’s angry commentary was a scathing tirade against western society’s “addiction to consumerism” and an unveiled call for a collective punishment so harsh so as to lead to submission.
According to international sustainability organization Global Footprint Network, humanity has already used up nature’s resource budget for the entire year. According to the organization, this means that humanity needs almost 2 earths to satiate the human demand for her resources.
Over the years, Germany’s massive ARD public broadcasting network has increasingly moved to the left, and has since embraced extreme environmentalism and climate protection. And if anyone had any doubts about this, Beckhardt’s anti-free market tirade last Monday night puts these doubts to rest.

— tagesthemen (@tagesthemen) July 29, 2019

 
In his angry 1-min 41 sec. tirade, Beckhardt tells the audience how he’s fed up with hearing year after year how western societies are consuming way beyond the limits and that nothing is being done about it. He demands that policymakers take action to punish the ARD audience.

Consumption junkie
To drive home his point, Beckhardt admits how earlier in the evening he too had “a nice piece of meat on the grill” and that this is something he has “often”. He also tells the audience he often uses his car and flies all over the world because he loves coral reefs. He admits: “I’m a consumption junkie” and that he cannot help it.
He says he does it because “it’s fun, rewarding, enjoyment, lust and everyone else does it.” Next he indirectly calls the entire audience mentally ill, addicts who are in need of extremely harsh medicine.
Beckhardt’s “so damn expensive” medicine
Beckhardt then characterizes western consumption as a disease, telling the nationwide audience:
Everybody knows addicts need help. The problem is that no doctor is able to cure environment-damaging consumption addiction. This can only be done by courageous policymakers. That’s why the request: make meat consumption, car driving and flying so damn expensive that we get ourselves off it. Please! Quickly! Then we’ll vote for all of you!”
What’s astonishing is that the ARD is perfectly comfortable with airing such deranged commentaries that call for the draconian blanket punishment of its audience while harboring the delusion that we all want this punishment and that we would all vote for it.
Here’s what the ARD and the Greens really want to say: “Make meat, car driving and flying so damn expensive that you all get yourselves off it. Please! Quickly! Then only the very rich, the elite and me – the ARD journalist – will afford it. The rest of you will live as peasants in serfdom.”
And if that doesn’t take the cake:
The ARD has a budget of €6.9 billion and 22,612 employees. The budget comes primarily from a licence fee which every household, company and public institution are required by law to pay. For an ordinary household the fee is currently €17.50 per month.” – Wikipedia.

A Short Easy-To-Read Book On Climate
Mirrors and Mazes: A guide to the climate debate. Dr Howard Thomas Brady.
Emeritus Professor Cliff Ollier, has reviewed this book in the New Concepts in Global Tectonics Journal (V4,no1,2016). Ollier explains that the title Mirrors and Mazes reflects the author’s idea of how the IPCC and others have acted like magicians tricking their audience and Ollier comments: I have read many books on climate but have found much new material here. 
The late Professor Bob Carter commented: this book is just plain interesting and reads extremely well.
Emeritus Professor Peter Flood in his review comments: “This is indeed one of those rare book on climate: it is a concise and clear reader, while also profoundly rich in its concepts, analysis and scope, addressing the critical issues in the climate debate. There are no distracting emotional attacks on individuals. There is humour. There are interesting stories.
http://www.mirrorsandmazes.com.au
As background, the author was one of the site geologists for the first drill holes into rock on the Antarctic mainland (Dry Valley Drilling Project) and the first drill holes through the Ross Ice Shelf (Ross Ice Shelf Project). In 2011 Dr. Brady was presented the Alumnus Scientist of the Year Award by the Dean of Northern Illinois University for his contributions to Antarctic science. The author now lives in Canberra, Australia.
Publisher: Mirrors and Mazes, Canberra, Australia. 2016, 175p.  In Australia the book can be purchased for $20.00 from the website http://www.mirrorsandmazes.com.au. You can actually give this book to your non-scientists friends for an enjoyable quiet afternoon read. It was written for them. Full details and reviews of the book can be read on the website. Overseas the book is printed and distributed by Amazon in North America, UK and Europe in the currencies of those countries.

Last week, I noted that public comments on what should be called the “necessarily bankrupt” regulation from EPA will close on June 25. There, the EPA proposes standards on new power plants that are so stringent that, indeed, anyone who tries to build a new one might as well burn dollars in it instead of coal.



I noted there that the EPA’s regulation, when it comes to climate and climate change in the U.S. was based on the 2009 document _Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States_ , by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and that the Center for the Study of Public Science and Public Policy at the Cato Institute was preparing an _Addendum_ to that document that would tell, as they say, “the rest of the story.”



Indeed, it does. Here’s the link to the original USGCRP report, and here’s one to the Cato report.





[R]elying on dated and incomplete science is a recipe for bad regulations.



Downloading both and looking side‐​by‐​side can be very amusing. Note that the Cato report is in draft form and there is a big fat disclaimer on it that says you can expect to find spelling, typographical, and grammatical errors in this version, but future revisions are likely to be more minor than major.



So, the bomb has now been dropped into EPA’s court. The accompanying comments to them note that, with regard to the “necessarily bankrupt” proposal, EPA contends:



There is no reason to revisit the 2009 Endangerment Finding given recent scientific findings that strengthen the scientific conclusion that GHG (greenhouse‐​gas) air pollution endangers human health and welfare.



Our comments note that the original USGCRP report is “clearly slanted towards negative impacts from climate change when there is a large body of scientific evidence…that argues for the contrary.”



The comments assert that many papers published since the 2009 document show that the likelihood of extreme climate change is much lower than assumed in that report. This alone challenges EPA’s assertion that things are just hunky‐​dory in Apocalypse Land, and requires them to reassess their Endangerment Finding.



In addition, the rapid evolution of climate science — for better or worse, for warmer or cooler — mandates that the EPA reassess their Endangerment Finding at least on an annual basis.



As the comments note, relying on dated and incomplete science is a recipe for bad regulations.



Admittedly, the _Addendum_ is perfectly cheeky. In many cases it uses the USGCRP’s own words, followed by what they somehow forgot to mention. In others, it borrows directly from their format. Finally, it commits the cardinal Washington sin of dissing bureaucracy.



The last section of the USGCRP report is called “An Agenda for Climate Impacts Science,” which is nothing more than a wish list for more and more $$$ to go to the USGCRP. How predictable.



On the other hand, the Executive Summary of the Addendum concludes:



This report does not end with a self‐​serving list of areas from which its authors can generate even more federal taxpayer funding for their own projects. For an example of that, see the original USGCRP volume.



The Addendum ends, as did the original USGCRP report, with a section on future U.S. climate assessments. It has both bad news and good news:



Future assessments of climate change are likely to be as poor in quality as _Climate Change Impacts in the United States_. Regardless of who is President, the same figures will remain in the civil service, with every incentive to expand their turf and further their careers. It is a sad fact of American life that such unelected officials can impose such enormous costs on the citizenry without being subject to recall.  
  
However, if this _Addendum_ has significant impact, each new federal assessment is likely to be answered like the USGCRP report was — with more science than our federal government chooses to recognize.



Harrumph! I’m done now.

"The British actress Naomie Harris, 40, might have splashed on the scene as the Bond girl Moneypenny, but these days she is banking on riskier roles. Her turn as a crack addict in the lauded “Moonlight” earned her supporting actress nods for the Critics’ Choice Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes, on Sunday. So, too, her red carpet style will keep you guessing. Friend to cutouts, splashy prints, allover sequins, tuxedos and plunging necklines, Ms. Harris seems determined to avoid being typecast. And the fashion establishment appears to love her chameleonic quality. She sat front row at Christian Dior and Michael Kors, and she attended the Met Gala with Burberry. Of course, Ms. Harris doesn’t accomplish her sartorial variety on her own. She has been working with Nola Singer, also a close friend, for the last five years. “She loves to experiment,” Ms. Singer said of their choices. “It’s not so serious. If I tell her someone is a new designer, she gets excited. She gets that this is a kind of freedom. That’s beautiful about her. ” Ms. Singer, who is based in Los Angeles, styled many of Ms. Harris’s looks over the past year, but the actress also worked with Micaela Erlanger, Lupita Nyong’o’s   for her “Collateral Beauty” press tour. With Ms. Singer, Ms. Harris has favored simple fitted silhouettes but often lets color do the talking. Witness a sequined goldenrod Ralph Lauren halterneck dress worn to the Hollywood Foreign Press   cocktail party in November. “Every actress was at that event, and she really stood out, not because she was trying but because of that color, and because it flattered her figure  —   her arms!  —   without showing too much skin,” Ms. Singer said. No   triceps dips were needed for the visual statement made by a Gucci silver metallic tuxedo at the Hollywood Film Awards the same month. Ms. Singer said the outfit, with its sharp tailoring and lion embroidered on the back, was a nod to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “It was about women being empowered,” she said. Though Ms. Harris knows her way around a pantsuit (see also a white Emanuel Ungaro option at Variety’s Women of Power Luncheon, and a white   Dolce  Gabbana number worn to the TimesTalks event for “Moonlight”) occasionally she likes to go retro. In the navy Carolina Herrera ball gown she wore (with Christian Louboutin flats) to the Governors Awards in November, she was having an Old Hollywood meets modern practicalities moment. Less successful are her quirky moments. An orange Gucci minidress with a frilly black neckline that she wore at the British Independent Film Awards and a brown print Rodarte with    white bust at the “Collateral Beauty” London premiere read   on her lithe frame. Ms. Erlanger’s choice for the “Collateral Beauty” New York premiere was more on point: a neon floral Rosie Assoulin dress that ended above the ankle with Dick   pumps. Sure it was December, but what’s a little   chill when an   campaign is at stake? More unexpected picks with Ms. Erlanger included an offbeat (perhaps dated?) Stella McCartney strapless black bodice with sheer skirt design for the Critics’ Choice Awards last month, and a winning gold sequined tunic and pants by Monse at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November. And if her predictability is in her unpredictability, Ms. Harris is throwing another wrench in for awards season. She is going back to Ms. Singer but adding the New York stylist Laura Jones, known for her work with Alicia Keys, to her team. It will be Ms. Harris’s first time working with Ms. Jones."
"At the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. scientists are trying to get time to run backward. Biological time, that is. In the first attempt to reverse aging by reprogramming the genome, they have rejuvenated the organs of mice and lengthened their life spans by 30 percent. The technique, which requires genetic engineering, cannot be applied directly to people, but the achievement points toward better understanding of human aging and the possibility of rejuvenating human tissues by other means. The Salk team’s discovery, reported in the Thursday issue of the journal Cell, is “novel and exciting,” said Jan Vijg, an expert on aging at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Leonard Guarente, who studies the biology of aging at M. I. T. said, “This is huge,” citing the novelty of the finding and the opportunity it creates to slow down, if not reverse, aging. “It’s a pretty remarkable finding, and if it holds up it could be quite important in the history of aging research,” Dr. Guarente said. The finding is based on the heterodox idea that aging is not irreversible and that an animal’s biological clock can in principle be wound back to a more youthful state. The aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body’s cells. In one of the deepest mysteries of biology, the clock’s hands are always set back to zero at conception: However old the parents and their reproductive cells, a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age. Ten years ago, the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg. The four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state. Dr. Yamanaka’s method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg. Scientists next began to wonder if the four Yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal. The results were disastrous. As two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014, the animals all died, some because their adult tissue cells had lost their identity and others from cancer. Embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth, which easily becomes uncontrolled. But at the Salk Institute, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte had been contemplating a different approach. He has long been interested in regeneration, the phenomenon in which certain animals, like lizards and fish, can regenerate lost tails or limbs. The cells near the lost appendage revert to a stage midway between an embryonic cell, which is open to all fates, and an adult cell, which is committed to being a particular type of cell, before rebuilding the missing limb. This partial reprogramming suggested to him that reprogramming is a stepwise process, and that a small dose of the Yamanaka factors might rejuvenate cells without the total reprogramming that converts cells to the embryonic state. With Alejandro Ocampo and other Salk researchers, Dr. Izpisua Belmonte has spent five years devising ways to deliver a nonlethal dose of Yamanaka factors to mice. The solution his team developed was to genetically engineer mice with extra copies of the four Yamanaka genes, and to have the genes activated only when the mice received a certain drug in their drinking water, applied just two days a week. The Salk team worked first with mice that age prematurely, so as to get quick results. “What we saw is that the animal has fewer signs of aging, healthier organs, and at the end of the experiment we could see they had lived 30 percent longer than control mice,” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. The team also saw improved organ health in normal mice but, because the mice are still living, could not yet say if longevity was extended. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte believes these beneficial effects have been obtained by resetting the clock of the aging process. The clock is created by the epigenome, the system of proteins that clads the cell’s DNA and controls which genes are active and which are suppressed. When an egg develops into a whole animal, the epigenome plays a critical role by letting a heart cell, say, activate just the genes specific to its role but switching off all the genes used by other types of cells. This process lets the embryo’s cells differentiate into all the various types of cells required by the adult body. The epigenome is also involved throughout life in maintaining each cell and letting it switch genes on and off as required for its housekeeping duties. The epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups, known as marks, to its proteins. Only in the last few years have biologists come to realize that the state of the epigenome may be a major cause of aging. If the epigenome is damaged, perhaps by accumulating too many marks, the cell’s efficiency is degraded. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte sees the epigenome as being like a manuscript that is continually edited. “At the end of life there are many marks and it is difficult for the cell to read them,” he said. What the Yamanaka genes are doing in his mice, he believes, is eliminating the extra marks, thus reverting the cell to a more youthful state. The Salk biologists “do indeed provide what I believe to be the first evidence that partial reprogramming of the genome ameliorated symptoms of tissue degeneration and improved regenerative capacity,” Dr. Vijg said. But he cautioned the   mice used in the study might not be fully representative of ordinary aging. Dr. Guarente said it was more likely that the Yamanaka genes were not erasing the epigenomic marks directly, but rather were activating the genes which are responsible for the immense health and vitality of embryonic cells. This gene activation is a natural function of the Yamanaka factors. It is these embryonic   genes that are rejuvenating the tissues in the mice, Dr. Guarente suggested, and causing changes in the epigenome through their activity. Thomas A. Rando, an expert on stem cells and aging at Stanford, said that it should be possible in theory to uncouple the differentiation program and the aging process, and that “if that’s what’s happening, this is the first demonstration of that. ” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said he was testing drugs to see if he could achieve the same rejuvenation as with the Yamanaka factors. The use of chemicals “will be more translatable to human therapies and clinical applications,” he said."

Pondering the tendency of elites to the most extreme manifestations of gibbering climate hysteria, _Australian_ columnist the Mocker has a theory: concentrating so many oxygen thieves in one room cripples their already diminished cognitive abilities.



Consequently, people at those forums become irrational, paranoid and prone to hysteria […] It is a phenomenon extending through all levels of hierarchy, whether it be dictators, prime ministers or tinpot popinjays.



Which naturally brings to mind Jacinda Ardern and the Pacific Island Forum.



For those unfamiliar with this, it is a get-together of Oceania’s smallest nations and **biggest freeloaders,** with the exception of Australia’s arts community and the Northern Territory government.



Like the conga-line of grandstanding town councils declaring asinine “climate emergencies”, the Pacific Island Forum provides an unwarranted forum for the incompetent, corrupt and greedy to put on silly shirts and attempt to outdo each other in fatuous grand-standing and hypocritical virtue-signalling.



Among their demands was that Australia end coal mining. That would present absolutely no problem for this country, aside from leaving a $67 billion hole in our exports, which would make it impossible to sustain the $1.4 billion in aid we give annually to Pacific nations.



That’s **aid**. Australia is **giving** these moochers money. Certain other nations are keeping the strings firmly attached.



Tonga owes about US$108 million to China’s Export-Import Bank, which equates to around 25 per cent of its gross domestic product.



But, hey, while we’re on the subject of virtue-signalling oxygen thieves…



Never one to miss an opportunity for grandstanding, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern pronounced that “Australia has to answer to the Pacific.” Former foreign minister Alexander Downer rightly observed via Twitter she was virtue signalling at Australia’s expense. The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, ever looking for an opportunity to wedge Australia, gleefully tweeted “it’s good to have an ally like New Zealand in your corner”.



He said, even as he trousered another hundred million or so of Australian money. Adages about biting hands that feed come to mind.



Notably, Chinese representatives were not pressed about how their country planned to reduce its 30 per cent of global emissions, a fact explained by New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters’ observation that many Pacific nations are seeking loans from China.



Who wants to bet that in a few decades, China will be facing the same situation as the World Bank ended up in: a ledger full of red ink from mendicant banana republics with no hope of paying? In fact, just a few decades after the IMF, World Bank and G8 cancelled billions owed by developing nations, those same tinpot developing nations are once again billions in debt – to China.



Who also wants to bet that China won’t roll over on “debt forgiveness” so easily?



Meanwhile, what to do with hysterical oxygen thieves banging on about the end of the world?



Easy, my theory is the same way deep sea commercial divers avoid nitrogen narcosis. Instead of breathing normal air in a pressurised environment, those prone to climate histrionics would be made to inhale Trimix, a combination of oxygen, helium and nitrogen. One side effect though: after doing so they will talk like Donald Duck.



At least then they’ll actually sound like the fools that they are.

_Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Yesterday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a press release announcing the publication of its “State of the Climate 2012” report. The global media, predictably, are all over it, loving the gloomsaying.   
  
None of it is new. The NOAA report is simply a collection of rehashed stories that have already had their 15 minutes of fame, stories that we (and others) have already commented on, put into perspective, or debunked.   
  
Usually, “Year in Review” type of stories are saved up until the end of the year, but when it comes to climate change—an issue for which the president has declared “we need to act”—once a year is apparently not enough. So, NOAA’s “Year in Review” comes out at the end of December and then is rerun like old Seinfeld episodes the next summer.   
  
The NOAA press release contains this manner of introduction from its acting head, Kathryn Sullivan:   




""Many of the events that made 2012 such an interesting year are part of the long-term trends we see in a changing and varying climate—carbon levels are climbing, sea levels are rising, Arctic sea ice is melting, and our planet as a whole is becoming a warmer place,"" said acting NOAA Administrator Kathryn D. Sullivan, Ph.D. ""This annual report is well-researched, well-respected, and well-used; it is a superb example of the timely, actionable climate information that people need from NOAA to help prepare for extremes in our ever-changing environment.""



It is interesting that she terms the information contained in the report as “timely.”   
  
Below is a list of our comments, each made at least several months ago, on the topics highlighted in her statement.   




Sullivan: “carbon levels are climbing”   
  
Us: CO2 400ppm and Growing, (May 14, 2013)   
  
Sullivan: “sea levels are rising”   
  
Us: New Research Calls into Question High Rates of Sea Level Rise (December 20, 2012)   
  
Sullivan: “Arctic sea ice is melting”   
  
Us: How Much Sea Ice?  (August 28, 2012)   
  
Sullivan: “our planet as a whole is becoming a warmer place”   
  
Us: Global Lukewarming: Another Good Intellectual Year (2012 Edition) (February 4, 2013)   
  
And we’ll include this as a bonus:   
  
Sullivan: “it is a superb example of the timely, actionable climate information that people need from NOAA to help prepare for extremes in our ever-changing environment""   
  
Us: Averting Disasters (June 21, 2013)   
  
For this administration, when it comes to global warming, no news is bad news. So in times of no news, just repeat the old news. Two can play at that game!

It’s no secret that climate alarmists have been trying to scare us for decades.
They seem to truly believe that the world is at risk from climate change, and make up “scary scenarios” to prod people into action, lifestyle changes, and idiotic self-taxation. Because as we all know taxes solve everything. /sarc
The late Dr. Steven Schneider said it best:  
On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we’d like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broadbased support, to capture the public’s imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. –  (Quoted in Discover, pp. 45–48, October 1989.) 
This morning, Dr. Gavin Schmidt was true to form, even though a couple of weeks ago he called me “stupid” for suggesting climate scientists do this.

I replied, showing how the GISS temperature data looks when you put it in normal range. It’s hardly noticeable.

And then there’s Greta Thunberg, who “tries” to be scary, but comes off as laughable most of the time. I asked cartoonist Rick McKee if he would do a special for me for Halloween, and he obliged:

He was recently let go from his position at The Augusta Chronicle, because (this is my opinion only) his cartoons hit too close to home for some liberals and they complained.So, help him out, buy him a beer (use link below), and please spread this cartoon far and wide on social media.

"As is so often the case, the party doesn’t really get going until everybody is good and drunk. Then, after much wine, vodka and awkward conversation, comes a fabulous eruption of runaway hedonism. Maybe, you think, coming to this shindig wasn’t such a bad idea, after all. You’ve known such moments, surely, when the spectacle of people going stark raving wild carries its own irresistible, anarchic logic. A feeling of vital connection saturates the room like the fizz from an exploded bottle of Champagne. Alas, the thrill is   a lonely cascade of fireworks in a night of damp squibs. And the briefly, beautifully animated revelers go back to being their soggy, miserable selves. That’s what happens  —   in terms of both plot and performance  —   toward the end of the first half of “The Present,” the Sydney Theater Company’s sprawling and confused adaptation of a sprawling and confused play written by a young Anton Chekhov. This fitful Australian import, which opened on Sunday night at the Barrymore Theater, chronicles the bad behavior at one   birthday celebration. The mistress of these revels, I am happy to report, is the extraordinary screen star Cate Blanchett, making a   Broadway debut. Ms. Blanchett is portraying the hostess and birthday girl, Anna, a ravishing widow who is unhappily turning 40. Ms. Blanchett knows how to hold a stage and, if necessary, hijack it. Her   performances in “A Streetcar Named Desire” (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and “Uncle Vanya” (at New York City Center) both for the Sydney Theater Company, were as brilliant as they were brave. Such commanding,   charisma is useful if you’re attempting to hold together a badly assembled party or, for that matter, play. But here Ms. Blanchett’s   inventiveness is as sorely taxed as that of her character. Anna’s party turns into the kind of disaster that ends not only in tears but also bloodshed. This production, on the other hand, feels moribund from the beginning. Frantic attempts at resuscitation by Ms. Blanchett and her valiant leading man (and unforgettable   in “Uncle Vanya”) a tireless Richard Roxburgh as a hapless homme fatale, only occasionally succeed in eliciting a pulse. “The Present,” which has been adapted by Andrew Upton (Ms. Blanchett’s husband) and directed by John Crowley, is the Chekhov play that almost got away. Though the scholarship on its origins is uncertain, it appears that Chekhov began writing it as an    student, and it exudes a youthful, passionate untidiness. Its manuscript, a whopper in length, wasn’t published until nearly two decades after his death. An uncut version would take at least five hours this one is three. The eminent playwrights Michael Frayn and David Hare, among others, have done their best to domesticate this shaggy behemoth. Mr. Frayn reconceived it as an elegant sex farce, under the title “Wild Honey” (seen briefly on Broadway in the  ) while Mr. Hare’s adaptation hewed closer to the more brooding, tragicomic template usually associated with Chekhov. That version is called “Platonov,” and I saw a fine production of it at London’s National Theater last summer. Directed by Jonathan Kent, it was set in the period in which it was written. And the vestiges of   decorum served as an appropriately chafing corset for the flabby plot. Mr. Upton drags the story out of the twilight of the czars and into the   morning after of the  . As in the original script, it’s a period of profound uneasiness, when a nation’s future is murky and its citizens unsure of their roles. But despite the inclusion of several   soliloquies on recent Russian history, it’s hard to comprehend what they’re reacting against here. Exit the robber barons (and the real aristocrats) enter the   oligarchs and their murderous henchmen. Farewell, balalaikas hello, the Clash. As for those without a fixed part in the new scheme of things, they’re the same old kvetchers of yore, doomed to circular philosophizing and   drinking. Chief among these is Mikhail Platonov (Mr. Roxburgh) a provincial schoolteacher of vaulting wit and unfulfilled aspirations. He knew Anna when she was the young trophy wife of a powerful general, now dead. It’s at the general’s summer dacha  —   rendered with all the personality of an Ikea showroom by the show’s designer, Alice Babidge  —   that Anna has chosen to celebrate her birthday. Her guests include her stepson, Sergei (Chris Ryan) who as a youth was best friends with Nikolai (Toby Schmitz) and Mikhail, who is married to Nikolai’s sister, Sasha (Susan Prior). Though Mikhail is a bloviator, a womanizer and a mean drunk, Sasha loves her   husband. So, more problematically, do all the other women in the play, who, in addition to the patrician Anna, include Sergei’s wife, Sophia (Jacqueline McKenzie) a humanitarian physician, and Nikolai’s girlfriend, Maria (Anna Bamford). It’s hard to fathom the attraction, but apparently once you’ve had your first whiff of him, Mikhail is as addictive and dangerous as crack cocaine. Maybe it’s because he’s livelier and more subversive than the other guys, who include Anna’s rich older suitors, Alexei (Martin Jacobs) and Yegor (David Downer). But like most of his contemporaries, Mikhail can’t stop talking about how directionless his life is. Such flailing is common in Chekhov. But usually you understand the specific, idiosyncratic places his characters are coming from. In this version, everyone seems to be flailing interchangeably, in the same stale vacuum, for all eternity. (Setting the play’s third section in what looks like a   dreamscape only compounds the impression.) Ms. Blanchett does bring colorful shades of excitement to being bored. Her Anna plays a great game of dramatically uninterested chess, and her response to a rambling speech by Mikhail at the lunch table is priceless. (Hint: it involves the removal of an undergarment.) That comes just before that     bacchanal I wrote about earlier. It’s one of the most memorable party sequences I’ve ever seen, a volcanic channeling of a displaced class’s fear, anger and disgust. These people want to blow up their world, and in a way they do, most entertainingly. That leaves us with another full hour of tediously sorting through the ashes."

“… But surely the most surreal episode of the march was Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. saying Morano and I and thousands like us should be jailed for expressing doubts about “dangerous manmade climate change.”
“I think they should be in jail … with all the other war criminals.” Republican politicians too – “those guys are doing the Koch brothers bidding and are against all the evidence, saying global warming does not exist. They are contemptible human beings,” he fumed.
“So RFK the younger wants to punish us for the “crimes” of exercising our First Amendment rights, demanding actual evidence to support alarmist assertions, saying people’s needs for reliable, affordable energy must be part of the conversation – and insisting that those needs take precedence over absurd claims that climate change is “the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction,” posing “greater long-term consequences” than ISIL, terrorism or Ebola, as Secretary of State John Kerry insists.”

" Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here. Introduction The purpose of this article is to explore the possible next steps in the efforts by governments to reduce emissions in the emissions-intensive sectors of the Canadian economy. Much of the media and public attention recently has focused on the oil and gas sector. In 2017, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from oil and gas production were 195 million tonnes, making this the largest single source, at 27 % of the total. Most of these occurred in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Oil and gas, however, is only one of the emissions-intensive industrial sectors, the rest of which are spread across Canada.  Canadian Climate Policy and Targets The present Canadian government climate policy target is to reduce emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. This would reduce them from 716 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2017 to 512 million tonnes in 2030, a reduction of 204 million tonnes. The New Democratic Party, the Green Party and many environmental groups are urging the Liberal government to adopt a more stringent emissions reduction target, such as a 45 per cent reduction (i.e. to 401 million tonnes) or even lower by 2030. So, in theory, one could completely eliminate all emissions from oil and gas production, and that alone would not attain the current 2030 target. It would go nowhere near meeting the proposed 45%-by-2030 target.What if the government were to augment its emissions reductions effort by also addressing the other energy intensive industries in Canada? What would that mean for the other provinces and especially for the central provinces of Ontario and Quebec? A Profile of Canada’s Energy-Intensive Industry We can gain insights into this by using the data collected by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in its GHG Reporting Program. Under this program, all large emitting facilities (i.e. those emitting more than 10,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year) in Canada must report annually. In 2017, 1,622 facilities reported to this program; these facilities accounted for 290 million tonnes, or 41%, of Canada’s emissions. I used the ECCC data to compile lists of the largest industrial facility emitters in Ontario and Quebec, the ones that could offer the largest contribution to the attainment of the government’s climate policy goals. The lists are set out in the annexes to this paper. Table 1 (Annex 1) indicates the company, facility location, and 2017 emissions of large emitters in Ontario, and Table 2 (Annex 2) does the same for Quebec.In 2017, mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction accounted for 36% of the emissions reported by emissions-intensive facilities; utilities 30%; and manufacturing, 29%. 187 Mt, or 64% of these emissions, originated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Forty-three Mt (15%) originated in Ontario and 23 Mt (8 %) originated in Quebec. A review of the list of facilities in Ontario indicates that, while the facilities are diverse in size and located in several different industries, there are five industries that dominate: steel making (Dofasco and Stelco in Hamilton), petroleum refining (Sarnia area and Nanticoke), petrochemicals (Sarnia area mainly), cement manufacturing (Bowmanville, Bath and Woodstock) and mines and metals processing (in many places). A review of the list of facilities in the province of Quebec indicates that, while the largest emitters are the oil refineries in Montreal and Levis, there are many other facilities spread across the province in the aluminum, mining, cement and other industries. It is also striking how many of these facilities are in relatively small centres in rural Quebec (e.g. Baie-Comeau, Saguenay, Jonquiere, Alma, Saint-Constant, etc.). The closing of these facilities due to loss of competitiveness would have large effects on jobs in the small communities, as often the plant is the largest employer. This, of course, is a phenomenon sadly well known in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The ”Opportunity” and the Risks If the federal and provincial governments are to take advantage of the “opportunity” to reduce emissions from these plants, they will face some difficult questions as to how to do so. Their most likely approach would be to continue to raise carbon dioxide taxes to and beyond the levels that are now planned (i.e. $50 per tonne in 2022). If the federal government is to reach its 2030 target, this seems inevitable. If it adopts even more demanding targets for reductions in energy use, the level of taxes must be high enough to force facilities to cut back emissions or to close. The Conference Board of Canada recently published a report entitled Tipping the Scales. The report examined the likely effects of Canada’s current carbon dioxide pricing system on emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries (EITEIs). In other words, EITEIs are a subset of the emissions-intensive facilities on which ECCC collects emissions data, but with a special focus on the trade effects from two perspectives: first, whether the added taxes would increase costs so as to disadvantage Canadian firms in domestic and export markets; and second, whether the results of firms’ moving their operations outside of Canada in response to these pressures would to increase emissions more than would have occurred had the firms continued their operations in Canada. The Conference Board report can be found here:https://www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library/abstract.aspx?did=10485In the terminology of climate policy, the Conference Board report raised the question of “carbon leakage”. As defined by the report, “Carbon leakage is what happens when an economy-wide pricing policy meets on-the-ground business competition. It occurs when firms faced with incremental compliance costs transfer some of their activities to jurisdictions with less stringent policies. And they take the associated GHG emissions with them.Emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries are the most exposed to carbon leakage risks. They rely on fossil fuels as production inputs and have limited room to pass on incremental costs to their end users.”Compliance costs vary considerably across Canada because of the balkanized nature of the Canadian carbon dioxide pricing regime. For a detailed description of the regime, see my report published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation.https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/06/Lyman-carbontax.pdfHowever, the difference in compliance costs across Canada pale in comparison with the differences between compliance costs in Canada and in our principal trading partners. Of our three most important trading partners, accounting for 56 % of Canadian trade, the United States has no federal carbon dioxide pricing regime, Mexico’s carbon dioxide tax is about $3.00 per tonne and China’s regional government carbon dioxide taxes are about $2.00 per tonne. That compares to the current carbon dioxide charge under the Canadian federal government “backstop” regime of $20 per tonne in 2019, which will rise to $50 per tonne in 2022. In addition, the Canadian regime covers about 80% of our total emissions and 86% of the emissions of the EITEI firms, while the carbon dioxide pricing regimes among Canada’s 18 largest trading partners cover only 16% of the peer companies’ emissions. The Conference Board concluded that:• “The competitive pressures from carbon pricing are significant for the majority of Canada’s EITEIs;• The magnitude of potential leakages is large; the risks of leakage are high;• The potential magnitude of carbon leakage from non-energy EITEs is greatest for non-ferrous metals manufacturing and chemicals; it is lower for non-energy mining, wood products manufacturing, and iron and steel manufacturing;• Across Canada’s oil and gas industry, the emissions intensity of producing different outputs – natural gas, conventional crude oil, or oil sands crudes, varies significantly; therefore, the potential magnitude of carbon leakage for Canada’s oil and gas industry varies considerably by product.”The Conference Board study did not attempt to analyze the effect on Canadian firms of the over 600 regulations, programs, special measures and taxes not related to the carbon dioxide pricing regime. It also did not assess the negative effects of government policies actively to discourage investment in the Canadian hydrocarbons industry. The review of the carbon dioxide pricing regime alone was sufficient for the Conference Board to conclude that Canadian emissions-intensive firms are at serious competitive risk. It left largely unanswered the more difficult question of how much that is likely to shift emissions outside of Canada rather than reducing them.  Conclusion If federal and provincial governments implement more stringent and intrusive measures to reduce emissions from the industrial sector, it is unlikely that any emissions-intensive industry or region will be exempt or will be able to escape the adverse effects on their profitability and competitiveness, and ultimately their viability. Those in Ontario and Quebec who observe dispassionately the economic stresses climate policies now impose on western Canada should take note.

" By Michelle Stirling © 2019These are my personal opinions.Markham Hislop recently wrote an article which appears to claim that Vivian Krause has come up with a conspiracy theory about foreign funding and pipeline/oil sands development in Canada – when in fact it is a matter of public record that foreign-funded environmental groups, most of them charities, have made a coordinated attack on the oil sands and other natural resource developments, with the help of millions of dollars from foreign sources. Let me present my argument.  I have been following this story since 2005.Key points:Foreign funding to ENGOs to stop economic activity is very different than foreign funding to develop legal and approved economic activity that pays taxes, creates jobs and product streams, which creates more jobs and pays more taxes.Geopolitical games by transnational corporations and foundations operate at a level that is unelected and unaccountable, and through working directly or indirectly, or funding directly or indirectly certain ENGOs, favorable climate and energy policies can be established which appear to be from the ‘grassroots’ when they may not be.ENGOs are unelected, unaccountable and mostly unregulated; they are able to willingly make over-the-top statements or make misleading claims about various resource industries, laws, or policies – but industry is not able to fight back in the same way because essential service industries are highly regulated by governments and closely watched by shareholders, investors and regulatory agencies.“Non-profits” and “charities” play on the perceived moral virtue of not being a commercial enterprise, but they live off the subsidies of hard-working taxpayers while immorally putting thousands of people out of work and driving off the good will of investors who do want to make money, but who also share their profits with all via taxes, buying goods and services, making donations to the arts and social charities, and employing people in well-paying jobs.Following the implementation of the Alberta Climate Leadership plan, Hislop writes that this ‘collapsed’ the tar sands campaign, in fact it blossomed! The Prime Minister, aligning with ENGOs on Northern Gateway, cancelled the pipeline and established Bill C-48 (tanker ban), then ‘Tar Sands Campaign’ ENGOs went after the National Energy Board (NEB), turning it upside down and into Bill C-69. That has left most major projects in Canada and potential investors in limbo for 4 years, as reported by lawyer Terri-Lee Oleniuk of Blakes, during a University of Calgary law forum on Bill C-69.[1][2]  Many former ‘Tar Sands Campaigners’ were hired in-house in government, making it even easier to block progress.[3] According to Counterpunch, that was the plan.[4]Excerpts of “Money Matters” report: The revenues received by the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts over the period 200-2018 was over 18 times the revenues received by all federal political parties, and over 27 times the revenues received by the market oriented institutes.“Money Matters” The revenue received by the Tides organization alone is more than the combined revenues of Canada’s two largest federal political parties, the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada over the period.“Money Matters” The David Suzuki Foundation’s average annual revenues exceed the annual revenues of the federal New Democratic Party.“Money Matters” Eight ENGOs have annual revenues that exceed those of the governing Liberal Party of Canada.As Bank of Canada Governor Steve Poloz warned last week, investors have lost confidence in Canada, Canadian fossil fuel assets, particularly the oil sands, are ripe for vulture investors and market mayhem.[5] Who is behind that? Was that the original plan? To dupe Canadians into locking in and giving up the third largest oil reserves in the world, that we own, on the premise that using our oil would kill the planet, while oil producing competitor nations laugh all the way to market and then to the bank.Markham Hislop wrote a 9,000-word article, published May 14, 2019,[6] in which he claims to debunk the work of Vivian Krause, the researcher who spent about a decade tracking the foreign-funding of the various Canadian environmental groups via IRS and CRA filings. Most of these environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) are federally registered charities, meaning that you and I subsidize them.Hislop takes aim at what he calls Krause’s ‘conspiracy’ theories on the Tar Sands Campaign, as if she wears a tin-foil hat and got her numbers from playing with an Ouija board instead of painstakingly tracking records of the IRS, CRA and related annual filings.Conspiracies normally take place in secret.  So…what if it was all out in the open…but so open and vast it would be almost impossible to connect the dots. Not a ‘conspiracy’ but… a global plan.Matthew Nisbet is a very accomplished, very prolific Professor of Communications at Northeastern University.  He has contributed to dozens of journals and books on climate change communications.  And he has been tracking this group of billionaires who have been running the “Design to Win” campaign for many years. Their plan is on-line, too.In his 2011 ClimateShift report, climateshift_report_americanuniversity-updated nisbet 2011 he documents how a group of billionaire philanthropists combined forces in 2005 to create the “Design to Win” plan to fund local ENGOs worldwide, to push for global cap and trade systems, carbon pricing and renewables.  In 2018, he published an update[7] showing that hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent by these ‘green billionaires’ – most of whom have vested interests in renewables, on denigrating fossil fuels, millions on demarketing coal and phasing-out fossil fuels, millions on ‘social justice’ and pushing electric vehicles, cap and trade, carbon pricing and renewables.Source: Excerpt of Nisbet (2018)We find that the ClimateWorks partners are reported funders of the environmental groups that Vivian Krause has researched.  Her reports on funding and activities match up with many aspects of the reports of Dr. Nisbet, though the Tar Sands Campaign (likely part of “OilTrain” in ClimateWorks docs) is just a small subset of the much larger ClimateWorks global plan.  ClimateWorks partners want to set up global cap and trade systems, carbon pricing and put their vested interest renewables on the grid. So, they have been demarketing coal, oil, oil sands and to some extent, natural gas, and pushing electric vehicles as ‘the answer’ for over a decade. To do this, they have funded local ENGOs to create the aura of a ‘grassroots’ demand for climate and energy policies that favour their goals.  They have done this worldwide, and as far as I can see, have no permission from any sovereign government to interfere in this way.  It is not clear to what extent any Tar Sands Campaign partner might know of this plan.The much larger plan was exposed in the ClimateWorks Podesta Wikileaks files where a full case study of the Design to Win plan was revealed. In this document it was revealed that McKinsey & Co., the world’s most influential management firm, was a key consultant to the project.ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165To cross reference the funding information, one can download the on-line Oak Foundations grant database like we did and see the many grants to Canadian ENGOs…and to international ENGOs – many of which are engaged in things like the UK Tar Sands Network or the efforts to denigrate Canadian oil sands product via the European fuel quality directive.The facts are a matter of public record both online, open‐source vanity presses – such as Oak Foundation – as well as publicly available IRS‐990 filings.   These are the facts repeated by many. They are not contestable.  What Vivian Krause and Ron Arnold, and others have done is to “harvest” and aggregate them for analysis and interpretation. This information is readily available to any interested person.   Why well‐paid and capable talented research journalists – like Markham Hislop – have been unwilling to check the source information is perhaps the biggest mystery.The Tar Sands Campaign is a project of Corporate Ethics International, formerly CEI, now known as CorpEthics. Indeed, on CorpEthics website, in Michael Marx’ bio he claims to have managed 100 ENGOs in Canada, the US and Europe.Who knew that the Tar Sands Campaign was in fact so international?Here are a few selected grants to establish the case I present, but there are dozens more.In Canada, we see that in this 2007 grant from the foreign Oak foundation, Greenpeace Canada (a non-profit, but not a charity) planned to enact its Phase-out Tar Sands by driving off investors and in its 2010 grant, by raising the risks of the oil sands in the minds of Members of Parliament.Source: Close up excerpt of Oak Foundation grant to Greenpeace.Original source of close up above.In this grant (below) for the foreign Oak Foundation, we find TIDES Foundation (we assume in Canada) was given $700,000 in 2009 to fund research on the Athabasca river quality downstream from the oil sands.Source: Oak grant databaseThis appears to have been the funding for one of the well-known Schindler/Kelly studies linking the oil sands to cancer. At the time of the release more than 20 ENGOs in Canada, all related to the Tar Sands Campaign, publicized the Schindler/Kelly findings across all media, causing a tremendous outcry across the country and indeed, around the world.Source: https://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16178.shortThe CBC co-produced a documentary based on the uproar from that PNAS ‘contributed’ study. “The Tipping Point: Age of the Oil Sands”  starred many key players from the Tar Sands Campaign-funded organizations.  Only two oil sands defenders appeared on camera for a few minutes out of a ~2-hour documentary (Rob Renner, then Alberta Environment Minister and Don Thompson, then President of the Oil Sands Developers Group. Thompson had 35 years experience in the oil sands,[1] compared to little-to-none for the activists) CBC told me other oil sands executives declined to appear, likely sensing a “drive-by shooting” in the offing.The most important aspects of the documentary are the facts that were left out.  I put many of them in my compilation of letters of complaint to the CBC. [2]Here are some more examples of foreign funding and economic damage to Canada and to investors.We see that West Coast Environmental Law was granted money to create a legislated tanker ban and it is noted in the grant description that this would cause the cancellation of Northern Gateway. It’s a small amount of money, but contrary to what Hislop reports, these ENGOs collaborate to amplify their powers.Source: Oak Foundation databaseRead: “Manufacturing a Climate Crisis” – a case study about West Coast Environmental Law’s activities. We find the online document of the International Funders of Indigenous People where American Michael Marx of Corporate Ethics, lead organization of the Tar Sands Campaign, reports on how ENGOs in the US and Canada were going to collaborate on the Rethink Alberta Campaign – intended to smear and destroy Alberta’s tourism sector and drive off industry.  He explains that ENGOs on both sides of the border and First Nations groups were working together to block Keystone XL in order to shut down the oil sands.Source: International Funders for Indigenous Peoples 9th Annual Conference Report page 47Climate Action Network (CAN), in an undated “Tar Sands Report” claimed Canada was not only exporting ‘dirty oil’ but also ‘dirty policies.’[1]  For a bunch of folks that say they don’t collaborate, sure seems like they do.[2] My count of the members of CAN who are literally ‘all on the same page’ comes up with 117 parties in the network, including major unions like CUPE and UNIFOR and major faith groups.On the face of all this evidence, it is hard to see how Markham Hislop can claim there is no coordinated campaign – there obviously is.  And billions of dollars in economic losses to Canadians and investors.People might wonder why blocking pipelines could benefit these foreign billionaire groups who actually want cap and trade, to sell more of their vested interest renewables and to push carbon pricing.Well, here’s a proposal as to why – by making Canadians believe we are a global pariah, we are willing to give up control of the oil sands – seeing it as a detriment to our reputation and a potential threat to the world. Vulture investors love that!By talking us into locking in the Boreal Forest or Great Bear Rainforest, they are setting up the basis for using the forests as carbon sinks for carbon trading. In fact, two such large carbon trading projects exist right now – perhaps more. Remember the Great Bear Rainforest?[3] Remember how Canadians threw in money to protect that rare Kermode Bear?  Well, it’s a carbon trading property now.Now about Darkwoods – Nature Conservancy of Canada has guaranteed it as a carbon sink for a hundred years,[4] kind of a risky thing in a wildfire region.  Who will pay the tab if it all goes up in smoke?So, we are carbon dupes, Canada, and totally naïve to geopolitics.The land locking of Canadian oil is certainly of benefit to other oil exporting nations; certainly, US producers benefit from our competition being pushed off the market as Vivian Krause has pointed out in the past; though they benefit, to me, it doesn’t seem like US oil producers are behind this campaign. It seems more likely that Canada and our economy are being squeezed to force us into carbon trading….in fact, shortly after Minister McKenna returned from the COP-21 Paris Agreement, this op-ed appeared…. “Trading for Tidewater.”Source: https://youtu.be/Uv60bC11qqcIn some circles, this kind of arrangement might be known as a …shakedown.While Hislop makes the case with all of his interviewees about Vivian Krause’s work that the ENGOs have only received nominal funding from foreign entities, here we see that Oak funded Tides in Canada to set up a $30 million fund (2010) – presumably drawn from Canadian philanthropies and corporations. (The other grants shown were in 2006 for media campaign and 2005 for Kyoto Protocol plan).Source: Oak Foundation grant database.Millions of dollars were poured into Quebec early on. Global Climate Change Action group – or tcktcktck.org – was funded to enlist unions and faith groups – both of which had existing large constituencies that could be easily converted to support climate catastrophe ideology by claims of profitable pension fund investment in renewables, or religious and moral mantras about virtuous acts of saving the planet. [1]And…who is funding BankTrack – a group of some 40 ENGOs that regularly attack and harass banks who finance oil, oil sands, natural gas and coal projects? (Answer – I don’t know but would like to know)Who funded the Global Climate Change Action group in Montreal for millions of dollars – a group that now claims to have 470 partner ENGOs in 70 countries worldwide, all opposed to fossil fuels? No collaboration? Come on, Markham!It is hard to believe that a journalist with the credentials of Markham Hislop was unable to find this information, because I found most of it by using google and…following the money.In fact, the ‘conspiracy’ has elevated itself to transnational levels with the development of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment group – whose guru on ESG is Al Gore.  And the Rockefeller Philanthropic Advisors’ charity called the CDP Worldwide – or Carbon Disclosure Project.  This innocent sounding charity invites cities and corporations to voluntarily report their carbon footprint and any local ‘climate change events’ – this information is aggregated into a report by a firm like PwC or Accenture – and then UNPRI investors decide to invest according to the report’s “Black” or “White” list ratings on who is producing ‘clean’ energy or who is ‘dirty’.  Thus, as a corporation, reporting your climate risk footprint in good faith makes you a target to green fanatics and activist investors.That’s what happened to the oil sands in 2016 when CDP issued this report.[2]It is a matter of public record that many banks, institutional investors (who are signatory to the UNPRI) and major transnational corporations have funded ENGOs to buy them ‘social license’ or to push for things that benefit their vested interests, directly or indirectly.Case in point?David Suzuki Foundation.  Funded by Power Corporation since 2007.Source: Power Corporation CDP ReportDavid Suzuki Foundation pushed for coal phase-out in Alberta…pushed the Alberta NDP government climate plan with a submission for the implementation of renewables, especially wind.Source: Cover of David Suzuki Fund submission to Alberta Climate Panel. Power Corporation has a renewables subsidiary. Now, Power Corporation’s subsidiary is building a wind farm in Jenner, Alberta!What a happy coincidence!We can confirm that Vivian Krause is certainly on the right track with her research.  We have issued four reports that Robert Lyman produced independently.  Robert Lyman is a former public servant and diplomat who spent decades in government in senior policy positions advising on things like the Kyoto Accord, GHG reductions in the Transport Division of Environment Canada – and Robert expands the scope of Vivian’s work and shows us the impacts on the Canadian economy.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/07/environmental-charities-a-compilation-of-reports-on-their-finances-power-and-implications-for-canada/   Other than the evidence shown, we cannot ascribe intent or motivation to any of the individuals or groups involved, but – we can see the outcome.Bill C-48, the tanker ban, killed a major pipeline project that had been approved by the NEB. Some ENGOs were overjoyed.Source: https://www.ecojustice.ca/enbridges-northern-gateway-pipeline-bites-the-dust/  Perhaps to ensure Northern Gateway could not be revived and that Trans Mountain would be held up forever, ENGOs then went after the NEB to turn its 60 year track record of excellence, it’s fair and thorough, highly technical process upside down.Source: Ecojustice.caThat became the contentious BillC-69.We know the outcome of all this activity by ENGOs is that US energy investment banker, PPHB, has stated in its newsletter “Musings” that Canada has become “hostile” to investment.Source: PPHB “Musings” April 27, 2018 pg. 27 http://www.pphb.com/pdfs/musings/Musings041718.pdf  How did that happen?Over a decade of international smearing of the oil sands reputation, harassing of bankers, insurers and investors, over a decade of driving up regulatory and operational costs by The Tar Sands Campaign and all its actors. And this came on the heels of decades of attacks on the forestry industry in the “War of the Woods” using similar tactics.And no one fighting back for the oil sands – until now.Until Premier Jason Kenney.Citing the research of Vivian Krause. So, of course the ‘greens’ must delegitimize her!Underlying the Tar Sands Campaign has always been the claim that our ‘dirty oil’ was more destructive to the world than anything else – because it had higher carbon dioxide emissions.In fact, two leaders of foreign-funded ENGOs, Marlo Raynolds of Pembina Institute and Steven Gilbeault of Equiterre were the first to call oil sands production ‘dirty oil’ – back in 2008.  How patriotic of them! [1] [2] (Both are now in federal government advisory capacities.)Contrary to Hislop’s reported claims by Simon Dyer of Pembina that there was no climate change legislation or environmental management of the oil sands a decade ago, the Alberta government had implemented the Climate Change and Environment legislation in 2002 – 16 years ago! The first legislation of its kind in North America.http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/C16P7.pdfI personally know there was careful attention to the oil sands on the environmental and climate issues because I worked at Alberta Environment in 2005. I had to interview many of the field experts on environmental issues in Alberta – they were all scientifically qualified and very balanced in their comments.The ClimateWorks campaign is all about the alleged human causation of climate change – because without climate hysteria you have no reason for cap and trade or carbon pricing or renewables. With climate hysteria, you also have a means to constantly create make-work industries at the expense of taxpayers.For instance, you build a wind farm telling the public it is ‘free’ or ‘cheaper than coal’ – only later do they find out they need to add a $1.4 billion natural gas plant or risk blackouts, plus they have to pay for billions in transmission lines and IT upgrades to manage fluctuating wind power. But that’s good business for whoever invested in it – and the wind farms typically guarantee your rate of income for 20-40 years, even if output of energy is tiny by comparison to investment.  The climate change claim is that wind and solar farms are renewables – but nope. They all have to be backed up with a natural gas plant (or large hydro facilities). Source: https://energypost.eu/wind-solars-achilles-heel-methane-meltdown-porter-ranch-means-energy-transition/ Google engineers found that wind and solar do not stop climate change, after years of research and an unlimited budget. Bill Gates says “…let’s quit jerking around with wind and solar…”  But wind and solar do generate trade-able Renewable Energy Certificates and subsidies by the boat load.  And everyone of the Tar Sands Campaign ENGOs pushes for….carbon price, renewable energy, phase-out coal and phase-out oil sands.Now here’s the problem.Since 2002, the science community has found that carbon dioxide is not the main driver of climate change.  By 2013 the IPCC reported there had been no statistically significant warming since 2012.Source: IPCC AR5 Working Group I reportAnd today we have dozens of studies showing that the effect of carbon dioxide on global warming is nominal.  Scientists miscalculated the effect of carbon dioxide, but climate campaigners and the ‘clean-growth’ industry paid no attention as scientists began to turn the ‘carbon Titanic’ around – if anything, the ‘green billionaires’ and ENGOs ramped up the hysteria, rather like Festinger reports on the Failed Prophecies of Cults.  Now it has accelerated to the level of ‘climate emergency’ and a 16 year old girl is on the cover of TIME, dressed in green. She is telling the adults what to do, while others tell her what to do.So, all the efforts to impose carbon taxes, cap and trade – to lock in Alberta oil until we gave in to the CO2 coercion, and to kill the oil sands…that was all for naught.  It was foreign interference in domestic climate and energy policies, enacted in a subversive manner that perhaps even key players did not understand. (See Lenin: useful idiots)Now environmental groups in Canada have amassed hundreds of millions, billions of dollars in revenues and physical assets. It is the cumulative nature of funding; the draw-down from the tax pool for all their special projects (as per our “Green” ENGO series of reports above). Many ENGOs have more far more money than political parties. And now, the federal government has given them free rein to use that power politically (where once they were limited to only employing 10% of their funds for politics).But their power has its roots in those millions of dollars of seed funding from foreign sources with an agenda. And Canadians have unwittingly, for the most part, also tax-subsidized the federally registered ENGO charities that have played such a key role in destroying our resource economy and blocking access to world markets.In my personal opinion, any policies driven by these foreign-funded ENGOs should be circumspect and rescinded, overturned, and a full inquiry made into the damage caused to the Canadian economy.Please read our reports and understand what we’re up against.

"CHICAGO  —   The appalling video seized the nation’s attention this week: A group of young people kidnapped, bound, beat, slashed, gagged, humiliated and threatened to kill a teenager with mental disabilities over nearly three days, and laughed about it as they carried out their acts. But by far, the most unusual thing about the episode, advocates for people with disabilities have said, was not the abuse itself, but the fact that it was recorded. Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize, advocates have said, and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously. The victim in the attack here, an    white man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday. The four accused attackers, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are black. The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail. The defendants are accused of multiple felonies, including hate crimes. Prosecutors said the victim, who was found by the police on Tuesday, was targeted based on his race and his disability. During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants, another can be heard denouncing white people, and, at one point, a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic. “I’m wondering as I’m hearing this, ‘Where was the sense of decency?’ ” Judge Kuriakos Ciesil asked. In explaining her denial of bail, she added, “How do you put someone out there who has allegedly committed such horrible offenses against a person?” People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities, according to a Justice Department report based on Census Bureau surveys. And people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized. But some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater, saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement. They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously. “There are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don’t know about it,” said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. “In a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?” Advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude, conscious or not, that people with disabilities are not fully human. They pointed to a recent case in Idaho, where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager, who was black and had mental disabilities, after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months. Though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault, he was sentenced to probation rather than prison. “We have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,” said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. “What we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, ‘Oh, this case is hard, it’s not worth our trouble. This person is hard to understand, or they’re not credible, or they won’t stand up to  . ’” Mr. Decker said that when Congress spent years drafting, debating, and finally voting on hate crimes legislation, which passed in 2009, it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities, as well as bias based on categories like race or sex.   of the 50 states have hate crimes laws, according to the   League, but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group. Vilissa Thompson, an organizer of the Harriet Tubman Collective, a coalition of advocates for disabled black people, said, “People are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people, but what’s worse is that there’s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator, especially when it’s a parent or caregiver. ”"

Former Vice President Al Gore said President Donald Trump’s “assault on science” threatens “the capacity of the human species to endure” on Earth.
Gore issued his warning in a speech to Harvard University students and faculty Wednesday, stressing “reason” and “rational debate,” indeed democracy itself, were under threat from the “ideology of authoritarianism.”
Science “is now being slandered as a conspiracy based on a hoax,” Gore said, likely referring to a 2012 Trump tweet where he called man-made global warming a “Chinese hoax.”
WATCH:

“The subordination of the best scientific evidence to the cynical greed of those buttressing the power of a would-be-autocrat is yet another strategy for controlling policy by distorting and suppressing the best available information,” Gore said.
“So the ideology of authoritarianism is not only a threat to democracy in America, now because of the attacks on climate science, it has become a threat to the survival of human civilization as we know it and even potentially to the capacity of the human species to endure,” Gore continued.
“In order to solve the climate crisis, we must solve the democracy crisis,” Gore said.
While Gore, a Harvard alumni and producer of two films of questionable accuracy on global warming, did not refer to Trump by name, the former vice president’s message was clear.
“The system of checks and balances that has protected the integrity of our American system for more than two centuries has already been dangerously eroded,” Gore said.
Gore, however, also went after social media, which he claimed is driven by “surveillance capitalism.” Gore said social media “enhances cynicism and magnifies divisions” that erode society. (RELATED: Supreme Court Asked To Hear Case Involving Leaked ‘Climategate’ Emails)

Gore went on to blame rampant flooding and tornado sightings in the Midwest on man-made global warming, echoing recent attempts by Democratic presidential candidates to do the same in Iowa.
“Speaking of wind, the winds are increasingly destructive in our world,” Gore said. “Yesterday was the thirteenth day in a row when multiple tornadoes touched down in the United States — 500 this month.”
“Hurricanes have become much stronger. Today, the Arkansas River is four feet higher than the all-time record flood stage. The Mississippi River is setting records as the longest flood ever. Thirty-nine million Americans today are at risk from flooding,” Gore said.
Gore also implored Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuel holdings, comparing it to the 1980s campaigns to pull investments in South Africa during apartheid. Gore has often compared climate activism to the anti-apartheid, civil rights and abolition movements.
“It was immoral to continue investing in apartheid,” Gore said before going on to accuse fossil fuel companies of using the tobacco industry’s strategy to keep the American public ignorant of climate science — a narrative pushed by some liberal media outlets.
“The American people have been the targets of a massive, well-organized and lavishly-funded campaign of disinformation, designed to spread doubt and confusion and prevent the formation of a political consensus necessary to adopt new policies to save the future of human civilization,” Gore said.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
NYT have just noticed that not all climate activists are PC hippies, though they still seem blind to the possibility that some of their own political fellow travellers could be bad.
White Supremacy Goes GreenWhy is the Far Right Suddenly Paying Attention to climate change?By Beth GardinerAs an environmental journalist, I’ve been covering the frightening acceleration of climate change for more than a decade. As a person who believes in the tenets of liberal democracy, I’ve watched the rise of white-supremacist, anti-immigrant and nationalistic ideologies with similar dread over the past few years.But I always thought of those two trends “looming ecological dangers and the gathering strength of the far right” as unrelated, parallel crises in a turbulent time. Only recently have I begun to understand that they are deeply interconnected, an ugly pairing of forces drawing power from each other.From France to Washington to New Zealand, angry voices on the hard right nationalists, populists and others beyond conventional conservatism are picking up old environmental tropes and adapting them to a moment charged with fears for the future. In doing so, they are giving potent new framing to a set of issues more typically associated with the left. Often, they emphasize what they see as the deep ties between a nation’s land and its people to exclude those they believe do not belong. Some twist scientific terms such as invasive species foreign plants or animals that spread unchecked in a new ecosystem to target immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities. And here’s what really frightens me: This dynamic is likely to intensify as climate change creates new stresses that could pit nations and groups against one another.Although the pressures of a warming planet are new, the deployment of environmental language for racist, nativist and nationalistic ends has a long, dark history. Before environmentalism became a mainstream and progressive cause in the 1970s, many American conservationists were also white supremacists, who argued that those they saw as outsiders threatened the nation’s landscape or lacked the values to care for it properly. Such thinking was common in Europe, too. The Nazis embraced notions of a symbiotic connection between the German homeland and its people.…Read more (paywalled): https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/opinion/far-right-climate-change.html
Gee, who could have seen this coming? 
Greens, traditional hippy greens, thought that by creating a fake climate crisis people they would recruit more people to their cause. 
But this isn’t what is happening. Frightened believers are turning to whoever is closest, whoever offers the most immediate relief from their fear. 
For many of the fearful, traditional greens, with their discredited hippy era economic and social ideas and their dismal multi-decade track record of political failure are not a credible source of comfort. Dangerous demagogues on both the left and the right are starting to displace traditional greens from a political stage they thought would be theirs.
I give NYT reporter Beth Gardiner half marks for this one. She might have noticed that dangerous right wing extremists are starting to hijack the climate movement, but she still seems blind to the crazies in her own political camp.

The Current Wisdom _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science, reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press._   
  
Have climate models, which are claimed by our friends like Ben Santer, to accurately represent the climate of the 20th century gotten things right for the wrong reasons? New research on the role of carbon aerosols suggests that this may be the case. If it is, it does not bode well for the accuracy of forward projections made by the same climate models.   
  
This would represent a classic case of “overfitting”— building a model with bells and whistles added and tuned so as to match the data at hand, but which then breaks down when trying to predict out-of-sample observations. This occurs because the overfitted model has been polished up to give the appearance of capturing the underlying behaviors driving the system—an appearance that is often good enough to fool even the model builders—but, in fact, the appearance is only skin deep, and the mechanisms driving things in the real world differ from those from which the model was built.   
  
A recent paper by Dr. Tami Bond and colleagues finds that carbon aerosols—particulates released into that atmosphere from a variety of human activities including diesel engines, open cook stoves, poorly filtered coal burning, and open burning, etc.—have played a _much_ larger role in impacting the climate than has been previously recognized (and included in climate models).   
  
For instance, Bond et al. report  that black carbon aerosol, or soot, is second only to carbon dioxide as the substance emitted by human activity that has the greatest warming influence on the climate—contributing a quarter (or perhaps even a bit more) to the current overall anthropogenic warming effect. Bond et al. find that the total warming impact from black carbon emissions is about 70% as large as that from carbon dioxide emissions.   
  
These finding are similar to those reported a few years ago by Ramanathan and Carmichael but grossly dissimilar to those from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says that black carbon is responsible for only about 10% of the total anthropogenic warming influence.   
  
Apparently, climate models incorporate even less of an influence from black carbon. According to Bond et al. “global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models, and should be increased by a factor of almost three.”   
  
There are several interesting implications.   




When divvying up the causes of the observed global warming over the past 50 years, a much larger percentage is now recognized to result from something other than carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.   
  
Figure 1 shows our tally, based on the IPCC’s latest climate compendium, and the results from Bond et al.   






Figure 1. Relative warming influence of the major anthropogenic emissions (whiskers are the 90% uncertainly bounds).   
  
If you combine the results in Figure 1 with those recently reported concerning other (non -greenhouse gas) influences on the observed temperature history, you must conclude that carbon dioxide was responsible for less than one-third of the observed warming since the mid-20th century reported in the IPCC’s _Fourth Assessment Report_. Further, the warming from _all_ greenhouse gases amounts to something less than 60% of the total.   
  
There seems a disproportionate amount of handwringing about the climate influence of carbon dioxide, when the climate influence on black carbon is nearly as great. And, of course, soot doesn’t come with the plant fertilization benefits that carbon dioxide emissions provide (see here for example).   
  
Another eye-opening consequence of the Bond et al. finding is that the modeled climate change “fingerprints” are missing the influence of black carbon—which is now much larger (and consequently much more important) than has been recognized.   
  
That “fingerprint” studies have proclaimed success at matching observed patterns of climate change with those projected by climate models run with anthropogenic atmospheric inputs—yet which omit black carbon—can only be a sign of overfitting.   
  
All else being equal, if the black carbon absorption in climate models were to be increased by a factor of almost three (to better match the findings of Bond et al.), they would certainly predict far too much warming to have already occurred. But these models have already accomplished this _without_ black carbon!   
  
One potential reason is that “all else is _not_ equal.” When black carbon is emitted, so is all sorts of other stuff, like sulfur dioxide and organic carbon. These tend to have a cooling impact on the climate, as they generally act to increase the amount of solar energy that is reflected back into space.   
  
According to Bond et al., although the amount of (warming) black carbon emitted into the atmosphere has been underestimated, so too has the amount of the (cooling) co-emissions. When everything is tallied up in net, the effect turns out to be very near zero.   
  
One might argue that if the net impact is zero, it doesn’t matter that the climate models have the wrong amount of black carbon (and co-emissions) in them.   
  
But this would be a far too generous and simplistic. The historical (in both time and space) characteristics of black carbon emissions, although not well known, are almost certainly different from the characteristics of historical emissions of greenhouse gases (and sulfate aerosols). The difference arises because the sources of the different types of emissions are, to an important degree, not the same.   
  
Which means the behavior of the true climate system is different from the behavior of the (overfitted) model climate system.   
  
Until you have a pretty good handle on the sources, and how they have changed over time (in magnitude and space), there is no way to way to get an accurate handle on projections, either in the past or the future.   
  
So “fingerprint” studies which claim to find close correspondence between climate model projections and actual observations during the past 50 to 100 years are confused as to both causes and effects.   
  
The bottom line of the Bond et al. study is that the relative impact of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions is much less than widely thought, the relative impact of black carbon is greater than thought, and climate models’ views of the past and projections of the future must therefore be tainted.   
  
Tainted and confused models are the last thing we need for producing science-based policy.

"WASHINGTON  —   Rex W. Tillerson owns more than $50 million of Exxon Mobil stock, has earned an annual salary of $10 million and holds a range of positions  —   from director at the Boy Scouts of America to the managing director of a Texas horse and cattle ranch. But Mr. Tillerson is prepared to resign from all those posts, sell all his stock and put much of his money into bland investments like Treasury bonds if he becomes secretary of state, according to an “ethics undertakings” memo he filed this week with the State Department. And, if he returns to the oil industry in the next decade, he could lose as much as $180 million. The   ethics letter detailing Mr. Tillerson’s commitments is the first of hundreds that will be made public in the coming weeks by members of   Donald J. Trump’s cabinet and other top political appointees, presenting a historic test of the federal government’s ability to identify conflicts of interest  —   and figure out ways to avoid them. Mr. Trump has selected what would be the wealthiest cabinet in modern American history, filled with millionaires and billionaires with complicated financial portfolios. Mr. Tillerson is worth at least $300 million, but is hardly the richest among them: Wilbur L. Ross Jr. the commerce secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, the education secretary nominee and Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, each hold assets estimated at more than a billion dollars. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s wealthy    is in the process of submitting his own forms as he prepares to take a formal White House position, people involved in the process said. “The Office of Government Ethics is stressed, no doubt about that,” said Robert Rizzi, a partner at Steptoe  Johnson, who represents half a dozen Trump administration nominees going through the process, although he would not name them, citing confidentiality agreements. “They are having some difficulty keeping up. ” All of the cabinet appointees and hundreds of others must submit a financial disclosure report detailing all the assets they own, their approximate value and income from any source they have made in the last year. Some of the nominees are so wealthy  —   and their assets so varied  —   there are not enough boxes on the standard form for them, lawyers involved in the process said. The disclosures are then used by the agencies they are to take over, along with the Office of Government Ethics, to identify potential conflicts of interest and to negotiate ethics letters to be signed by the nominees, committing to avoid conflicts of interest. At the same time, this class of wealthy incoming officials could save hundreds of millions of dollars in income tax payments, thanks to a special tax benefit created so that affluent Americans do not avoid federal government jobs. The Trump administration, lawyers involved in the effort said, is behind where it should be in this process of disentangling conflicts of interest. This is partly a reflection of the extraordinary complexity of negotiating such conflict of interest agreements for incoming government officials worth hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars. “Usually, you just own a bunch of stocks and bonds, but he’s getting people that own buildings and real estate and stuff you can’t sell,” said Alan Johnson, a New   compensation consultant. “He has Wilbur Ross, who is probably involved in a gazillion different things. I think it is going to be very complicated to try to disentangle all of these things. ” Mr. Ross is a billionaire investor and former banker who made a fortune in steel, coal, telecommunications and other industries. Under federal law, executive branch employees, including cabinet members, are prohibited from using their positions in the government to enrich themselves, meaning they are not allowed to participate in any particular matter that might directly financially benefit assets they own. The best way to avoid such a conflict, said Lawrence M. Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, is to sell any assets  —   like Exxon Mobil stock or any individual company stock  —   and put proceeds into Treasury bonds or mutual funds. “We don’t want the decisions that these individuals make to be influenced  —   in reality, or even appearance  —   by their own financial interests,” Mr. Noble said. “They are working for the American people, and not to enrich themselves or their families. ” The rules do not apply to the president and vice president, although ethics experts  —   and even the Office of Government Ethics  —   have urged Mr. Trump to divest his assets voluntarily to rid himself of potential concerns as he takes over the White House. He has thus far resisted such a move, saying that he plans to let his two oldest sons and other Trump Organization executives manage the business, perhaps with an outside monitor. For appointees like Mr. Tillerson, the transition to government can have lucrative benefits: They can take advantage of measures in the tax code meant to be an incentive for wealthy people to consider public service jobs. The measure was put in place during the administration of the first President George Bush. This tax benefit, which requires    approval by the Office of Government Ethics, allows government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on certain assets that they must sell in order to clear potential conflicts as they take office  —   essentially providing them with   loans. To gain the tax advantage, the liquidated proceeds must then be invested in Treasury bonds, mutual funds or   funds, and the official must seek a certificate of divestiture. Until now, Henry M. Paulson Jr. Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, has been the most prominent example of a public official who has taken advantage of the divestiture certificate. In 2006, Mr. Paulson left Goldman Sachs and sold an estimated $500 million in Goldman stock, deferring taxes on the sale. In his memo, Mr. Tillerson suggested that he was likely to seek such a certificate, and laid out a series of plans to divorce himself from financial engagements, board appointments and Exxon Mobil. This means he will most likely avoid capital gains taxes based on his sale of $50 million in Exxon Mobil stock he owns, as well as shares in more than 150 companies including Airbus and the Walt Disney Company, all of which he has promised to sell off within 90 days of his confirmation, his ethics documents suggest. But a more complicated task involved resolving the fate of two million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, worth about $180 million, that Mr. Tillerson was set to receive over the next decade. If he held on to this promised future payout from Exxon Mobil, he would still have a financial interest in matters that might affect the company and the oil industry. So Exxon Mobil agreed to take the unusual step of paying out the value of these sales and putting the money into an independent trust, with the money invested in neutral assets like Treasury bonds and mutual funds. Under the terms of the agreement, if Mr. Tillerson, 64, goes back into the oil industry during the next decade, he will forfeit any money left in the account. Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the administration of President George W. Bush, said this provision preventing Mr. Tillerson from returning to the oil industry was unusual and positive, as it removes the incentive for him to take steps while in government that might benefit an industry he planned to return to work for upon his departure. “It gives up something I had never been able to get from other government officials  —   a promise not to go back to an industry from which you came,” Mr. Painter said. Still, some environmental activists say such steps cannot address what they argue will be Mr. Tillerson’s inherent bias in the State Department. “It is impossible for this man to remove his career, and frankly his personality, from the oil and gas industry,” said Lena Moffitt, director of a Sierra Club campaign trying to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels. “He has been knee deep in this industry for more than four decades. ”"

From 1979 to 2011, satellite data provide documentation of a reduction in cloud cover and aerosol depth that allowed an additional 2.3 W/m² of positive shortwave energy to be absorbed by the Earth’s surface rather than reflected to space.
This change in absorbed solar radiation can account for the energy imbalance and warming during this period far better than the much smaller 0.2 W/m² forcing associated with a +22 ppm CO2 change over 10 years (representing just 10% of the overall trend in downwelling longwave).

Other satellite observations reveal a pronounced 6.8 W/m² positive solar forcing particularly concentrated during the 1984-2000 period due to a decrease in reflected shortwave energy (via clouds).

From 2014 to 2017, the reduction in cloud cover resulted in an additional 0.83 W/m² shortwave forcing, which explains the imbalance and the stark warming during this post-“pause” period.

"The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess. If there’s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that. The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money, as a percentage of the overall economy, than most of them. It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates. Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation. Among Washington’s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd, it’s known as a “  cash flow tax with border adjustment. ” It’s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago. And it could, if enacted, have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart. This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business  —   and for the   trajectory of the economy  —   are huge. The basic idea behind a D. B. C. F. T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy. Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company’s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are   the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along. The House Republicans’ approach, instead of taxing the    corporate income, goes after a firm’s domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. There’s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you’ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless. “With an income tax, one of the key issues is ‘how do you measure income,’ ” said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. “But with cash flow you just follow the money. ” And the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesn’t give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity. That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more. Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful. Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100. At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this. Many economists think it won’t work that way, however. That’s because as soon as a    tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent     effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started. Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a “textbook economic theory,” as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasn’t been tested in practice. If the dollar doesn’t strengthen as expected, for example,   industries, especially those with lean profit margins, could face disaster. That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry. Essentially, economists are telling them “trust us, our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash,” but if the models are wrong, for companies like Walmart, Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods, their viability could be threatened. If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects. Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, we don’t really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be. It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on, like clothing and gasoline. That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient. There’s still a lot of work to be done to understand the   consequences of the D. B. C. F. T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But there’s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly. No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system  —   with   economic consequences  —   will be up for grabs."

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”  
  
_   
  
— ** _Award-winning climate modeler experiences “a situation that reminds me about the time of McCarthy”_**   
  
An interesting juxtaposition of items appeared in our Inbox today.   
  
First was an announcement that Dr. Lennart Bengtsson, former director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, had resigned from the Academic Advisory Council of the U.K.’s Global Warming Policy Foundation. What was surprising about this announcement was that it was just announced a week or so ago that Dr. Bengtsson—a prominent and leading climate modeler and research scientist—was _joining_ the GWPF Council. At that time, there was some wondering aloud as to why Dr. Bengtsson would join an organization that was somewhat “skeptical” when it comes to the projections and impacts of climate change and the effectiveness and direction of climate change policy.   
  
During one recent interview Dr. Bengtsson explained:   




I think the climate community shall be more critical and spend more time to understand what they are doing instead of presenting endless and often superficial results and to do this with a critical mind. I do not believe that the IPCC machinery is what is best for science in the long term. We are still in a situation where our knowledge is insufficient and climate models are not good enough. What we need is more basic research freely organized and driven by leading scientists without time pressure to deliver and only deliver when they believe the result is good and solid enough. It is not for scientists to determine what society should do. In order for society to make sensible decisions in complex issues it is essential to have input from different areas and from different individuals. The whole concept behind IPCC is basically wrong.



A good summary of the buzz that surrounded Dr. Bengtsson and his association with GWPF is contained over at Judith Curry’s website, Climate Etc.   
  
So why did Dr. Bengtsson suddenly resign? 



Here is the content of his resignation letter, written to GWPF Academic Advisory Council Chairman, Dr. David Henderson:   




Dear Professor Henderson,   
  
I have been put under such an enormous group pressure in recent days from all over the world that has become virtually unbearable to me. If this is going to continue I will be unable to conduct my normal work and will even start to worry about my health and safety. I see therefore no other way out therefore than resigning from GWPF. I had not expect[ed] such an enormous world-wide pressure put at me from a community that I have been close to all my active life. Colleagues are withdrawing their support, other colleagues are withdrawing from joint authorship etc.   
  
I see no limit and end to what will happen. It is a situation that reminds me about the time of McCarthy. I would never have expect[ed] anything similar in such an original peaceful community as meteorology. Apparently it has been transformed in recent years.   
  
[ _glad you noticed!—eds]_   
  
Under these [sic] situation I will be unable to contribute positively to the work of GWPF and consequently therefore I believe it is the best for me to reverse my decision to join its Board at the earliest possible time.   
  
With my best regards   
  
Lennart Bengtsson



This letter is stunning in its candor and shows that that all the conspiring and bullying that the was on full display in the Climategate email release continues unabashedly today.   
  
Aside from a bit of personal embarrassment from particularly bad behavior, by and large the climate science establishment just shrugged its shoulders at the Climategate revelations with a “Yeah, so what?” That’s a fitting response as they seek to control the scientific discourse when it comes to climate change. Group pressure is an effective means of doing so.   
  
What Climategate taught the bully cohort of scientists was they could continue to bully their colleagues, sabotage their publications, and intimidate journal editors with impunity. As evidenced from Dr. Bengtsson's resignation letter, if it has changed at all, the situation in climate science is worse now than it was before the emails were leaked.   
  
Which leads to this email that we got today from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS):   






Anyone thinking that there is an open flow of ideas in climate science is 100 percent wrong.

" Cooling of Climate Sensitivity – Anthropogenic CO2 Global Warming Challenged by 60-Year CycleRefroidissement de la sensibilité climatique – Réchauffement dû au CO2 anthropique en compétition avec un cycle de 60 ans  Friends of Science Society offers this transcript of the video of Emeritus Prof. François Gervais Porto Basic Climate Science presentation in English and French.  Pour la transcription française ci-dessous. The timeline references in the transcript of the video are random and simply to help the reader find the section of the video.   A similar presentation in French is posted at the end of this transcript.The relevant peer-reviewed paper is here:Earth-Science Reviews_FG_2016 (1)The power point is here:8._gervais (2)Prof. Gervais:Is there a correlation between temperature of the earth and CO2 emissions?In black you see the data by the Hadley Center in Britain, and in red, the satellite measurements. At the University of Alabama at Huntsville. So is there a correlation?1:29I will say, no.Why?Because when CO2 started accelerating between 1945 and 1975, temperature was decreasing.Definitely there is no correlation.Okay, after that there has been an increase of temperature but no more than between 1910 and 1948.1:59No correlation.Of course, the CO2 emissions, nowadays are six times more than it was between the period of 1910 and 1945.2:13Conversely, we see a good fit with a 60-year cycle, plus a straight line. But this straight line doesn’t fit the CO2 emissions….due to the change in slope you see in 1945.2:36This fit with a 60-year cycle gives much better agreement with data, than this…which is a picture taken from IPCC AR5 report, you see during the first increase between 1910 and 1945 – the models CMIP5 – does not see (show) the increase that has been observed. And now there is the problem of this century, you see again there is disagreement …let’s have a zoom on our century.3:22This is a picture taken from the IPCC AR5!You see the measurements…and you see the models. Not only the models doesn’t fit the experiment, but they don’t fit each other.  They disagree with each other, the models. Even with the same colors which is the same scenario.3:52Another picture which is also from inside the IPCC AR5 report – another way to show the same thing. In red, you have the observation in the period indicated. And in black you see the CMIP5 models.They run too hot, that’s clear – all of them!So, the alarmism is not validated.4:22This 60-year cycle is not only seen in temperature measurements, but also in other climate sentinels. For example, the sea level rise of oceans which also shows….of course there is much uncertainty on the data, but anyway, the computer creates a sine function that is in agreement with the data. And also, in between, you see the area of Arctic ice.When the temperature was low, there was a maximum of arctic ice; then when the temperature was higher, there was a low of arctic ice, and so on. And we see the same now.5:16This 60-year cycle is reported in many peer-reviewed papers, including Nicola Scafetta, who is in the audience. And, there is a possible explanation by the tide effect.  The tide effect of big planets of the solar system upon the sun.5:47Which is easily deformable because it is gas.Another possibility is the correlation of this cycle with what is called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.6:09Here is a plot of climate sensitivity published in peer-reviewed papers. Some people in the audience are among the authors of some data.  Is it clearly the alternative or the post-modern definition of ‘consensus’?6:40(audience laughter)Is it?Well…I recall the definition of ‘climate sensitivity’ – it is the warming of the earth in case of CO2 doubling.There are two definitions – “Transient Climate Response” (TCR) and “Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity” (ECS) .  Transient is at the time of doubling of CO2 while Equilibrium assumes several more unknown centuries to arrive to this equilibrium.7:10But anyway, in both cases, just a linear regression of the data points shows there is a cooling. Why?Probably because a number of authors have just noticed that in the low troposphere temperatures, since two decades, there is no change except fluctuations.At 10 kilometers, temperature has not changed in four decades.And you will see in a few minutes, in the low stratosphere, the temperature has not changed in a quarter of a century.8:10So, that’s why, that’s the possibility. Anyway.What has increased, not the emissions, but the CO2 in the atmosphere?It has been increased til the beginning of this century.Since this beginning, it is almost a constant, 2 ppm/yr.8:45That will mean that until 2068, in 50 years, there will be, if we extrapolate, 100 more ppm CO2 in the atmosphere.Why 2068? It is because according to a paper by Ollila who uses the data of BP – British Petroleum – the known reserves of gas and oil – known today – will be finished in 50 years. Of course, for coal, it is much more time.  But, known reserves – of course, we can discover more. But anyway, …9:40In order to make some calculations, what is CO2 ? This is the infrared spectrum of the atmosphere.We see, essentially, the absorption by water vapour, essentially by water vapor.Only two peaks or absorption, since it is the transmission, two peaks correspond to CO2.It’s really easy to understand. You see that young girl…if she kisses, alternatively, each boy, that’s one vibrational mode.Or, she is just hesitating…She’s hesitating like that…like a Chinese reading a book.  So, very easy.Both those absorptions in the atmosphere, absorb 100% of the radiation emitted by the earth.100%. We could say it is almost saturated.10:56This is exactly what was published by Rasool and Schneider.  I chose Schneider although he has become a well-known alarmist, but at the time he was not.  Why? Because earth was cooling, at that time (1971)!11:17…and he considered the climate sensitivity of 0.8°K.And he explains that this is because the CO2 bands saturate, and the addition of more CO2 doesn’t substantially increase the opacity of the atmosphere. Well, I will not detail the calculation because it is very easy. We start with the Stefan Bolzmann equation, make its derivative and therefore arrive to a simple equation, almost 0.2 degrees of AGW in 2068.11:59Experimental verification.That’s very important.In the low stratosphere, we would expect temperature change.There is no temperature change, with two different satellite measurements, since a quarter of a century.No temperature change.12:25If we believe IPCC, you should have this temperature change.This is not observed.Why?The Greenhouse Effect, according to IPCC, the definition is there.It is to consider the lowering of emission by CO2 at high altitude, due to an excess of CO2.12:55Increase of altitude means increase of temperature – uh sorry – decrease of temperature with altitude.But what happens, actually?This is the infrared spectrum again and this is this band again at 15 microns, in the troposphere – below – above the tropopause, 11 kilometers – above – you see that the absorption in both cases is always 100%. And above 11 kilometers, the temperature no longer decreases, but starts to increase again. The increase of temperature means a cooling effect, decrease of temperature means a warming effect.Okay.13:47This is because simply, the saturation which is observed in the low atmosphere, is not observed at higher altitude because the pressure is lower. And since pressure is lower, the dissipation of heat is by another mechanism, no longer collision of molecules at low altitude, it becomes emission, radiative effect, at high altitude because much less collision of course, due to the low pressure.14:20In addition, but I will not discuss that, again, one of the authors of this work, is my chairman, so he knows wellYou see, CO2 is so dangerous that it warms the earth before it has been emitted… That’s what is said with these measurements. Of course, normally a consequence FOLLOWS a cause. But it’s reversed…Well, I will not discuss it because I will need time to discuss that, that means that the ocean release CO2 because there are 60 times more CO2 in the ocean than in the atmosphere, and that may be the explanation.15:18But if that is true, that would mean that, (well I’ll skip that one …well maybe not) ..this picture has already been shown today, there is no correlation again – why?If we admit that there is a climate sensitivity of 0.6°C, of course no correlation is observed.Because either a doubling of CO2 or dividing by 2 would not change anything within the temperature range.This is also true for… I just want to use the last minute…to insist on earth’s greening.This is observed by satellite.18 million square kilometers.More interesting is the increase in the seasonal oscillation with time,Now is La Jola, you see the increase of amplitude of this oscillation is larger than it has been, it increases more rapidly than CO2 itself. This is a way to arrive to this conclusion.I will let you read…(applause)(applaudissements)Français FRENCH TRANSLATION OF THE ENGLISH VIDEO: (a similar video presentation in French below)Refroidissement de la sensibilité climatique – Réchauffement dû au CO2 anthropique en compétition avec un cycle de 60 ans  Y a t-il une corrélation entre température de la Terre et émissions de CO2? En noir, on voit les données du Hadley Center britannique, et en rouge, les mesures par satellites publiées par l’Université d’Alabama à Huntsville. Y a-t’il corrélation ?1:29Je dirais, non.Pourquoi ?Parce que lorsque les émissions de CO2 ont commencé à accélérer entre 1945 et 1975, la température baissait.Clairement, il n’y a pas corrélation.Bon, après il y a eu un accroissement de température mais pas plus que de 1910 à 1948.1:59Pas de corrélation.Car les émissions de CO2 sont de nos jours six fois plus élevées que ce qu’elles étaient dans la période entre 1910 et 1945.2:13En revanche, nous constatons un bon accord avec un cycle de 60 ans. Par ailleurs, la ligne droite ne reflète pas vraiment les émissions de CO2 à cause du changement de pente que l’on voit en 1945.2:36L’accord des données avec le cycle de 60 ans apparait bien meilleur qu’avec les modèles repris par le rapport AR5 du GIEC comme le montre cette figure tirée du rapport. On voit que le premier accroissement de température entre 1910 et 1945 n’est pas reproduit par les modèles CMIP5. Le désaccord est encore pire depuis le début de ce siècle. Zoomons sur notre siècle.3:22Voici une autre figure issue du rapport AR5 du GIEC.On voit les mesures (en noir) et on voit les modèles (en couleur). Non seulement les modèles ne reproduisent pas les mesures, mais ils ne sont pas d’accord entre eux. Même pour une même couleur correspondant à un même scénario d’émissions.3:52Une autre figure qui est également extraite du rapport AR5 du GIEC, une autre méthode pour montrer la même chose. En rouge, on voit les observations dans la période indiquée. En noir, on voit les modèles CMIP5.Ils chauffent trop, c’est clair, tous !Donc l’alarmisme n’est nullement validé.4:22Ce cycle de 60 ans n’est pas seulement observé dans les mesures de température, mais aussi par d’autres sentinelles du climat. Par exemple, la hausse du niveau des océans le voit aussi avec bien sûr une certaine incertitude dans les données, car l’ordinateur trouve une fonction sinusoïdale donnant le meilleur accord avec les données. Entre ces deux courbes, est présentée la superficie de banquise Arctique.Lorsque la température était basse, il y avait un maximum de banquise Arctique ; puis lorsque la température a été plus élevée, il y avait un minimum de banquise Arctique, et ainsi de suite. On observe maintenant un minimum similaire.5:16Le cycle de 60 ans est rapporté dans beaucoup de publications dans des revues internationales à comité de lecture, dont plusieurs de Nicola Scafetta qui participe à ce colloque. Ainsi existe-t-il une explication possible par un effet de marée. L’effet de marée des plus grosses planètes du système solaire sur le soleil.5:47Qui est aisément déformable parce que c’est du gaz.Une autre possibilité est la corrélation de ce cycle avec ce qui est appelée l’Oscillation Atlantique Multidécennale.6:09Voici reportés les valeurs de sensibilité climatique publiées dans des revues internationales à comité de lecture. Quelques participants à ce colloque sont auteurs de certaines. Est-ce l’illustration de la définition « post-moderne » d’un « consensus » ?6:40(rires de l’auditoire)Est-ce le cas ?Bon. Je rappelle la définition de la « sensibilité climatique » – C’est le réchauffement de la Terre en cas de doublement du CO2 dans l’air.Il y a deux définitions – « Réponse climatique transitoire » (TCR) et « Sensibilité climatique à l’équilibre » (ECS). Transitoire s’entend au moment du doublement du CO2 tandis que l’équilibre suppose un nombre inconnu de siècles supplémentaires pour arriver à l’équilibre.7:10De toute manière, dans les deux cas, une simple régression linéaire des données montre qu’il y a refroidissement. Pourquoi ?Probablement parce qu’un certain nombre d’auteurs ont justement noté que depuis deux décennies, la température n’évolue pas dans la basse troposphère aux fluctuations près.A 10 kilomètre d’altitude, la température n’a pas évolué depuis quatre décennies.Et on va voir dans quelques minutes que dans la basse stratosphère, la température n’a pas évolué depuis un quart de siècle.8:10Voilà pourquoi. C’est du moins une possibilité.Ce qui s’est accru, non pas ici les émissions, mais la proportion de CO2 dans l’atmosphère.Elle s’est accrue jusqu’au début de ce siècle.Depuis, elle reste à peu près constante à 2 ppm par an.8:45Cela signifie d’ici 2068, dans 50 ans, si l’on extrapole, 100 ppm de CO2 supplémentaires dans l’atmosphère.Pourquoi 2068 ? Parce que d’après une publication de Ollila qui utilise les données de BP – British Petroleum – les réserves connues de gaz et de pétrole – connues aujourd’hui – seraient épuisées dans 50 ans. Bien sûr, pour le charbon, on en aura pour plus longtemps. Mais quant aux réserves connues, on peut bien sûr en découvrir d’autres. Mais bon…9:40Pour faire quelques calculs, qu’est-ce que le CO2 ? Voici le spectre infrarouge de l’atmosphère.On voit essentiellement l’absorption par la vapeur d’eau, essentiellement par la vapeur d’eau.Seulement deux pics ou absorptions, puisque c’est la transmission, deux pics correspondant au CO2.C’est vraiment facile à comprendre. Vous voyez cette jeune femme. Si elle bise, alternativement, chaque garçon, c’est un mode de vibration.Ou elle est simplement hésitante.Elle hésite comme cela (en hochant simplement la tête) comme un chinois lisant un livre. C’est ainsi très facile.Ces deux absorptions dans l’atmosphère absorbent 100 % du rayonnement émis par la Terre. On peut dire que l’effet est presque saturé.10:56C’est exactement ce qu’ont publié Rasool et Schneider. Je choisis Schneider bien qu’il soit devenu par la suite un alarmiste notoire qu’à l’époque il n’était pas. Pourquoi ? Parce qu’à cette époque (1971) la Terre se refroidissait !11:17…et il considérait une sensibilité climatique de 0,8°K.Et il explique que c’est parce que les bandes de CO2 saturent et que l’addition de davantage de CO2 n’accroit pas de façon substantielle l’opacité de l’atmosphère. Je ne vais pas détailler le calcul parce que c’est très simple. On part de l’équation de Boltzmann, on la dérive, et on arrive à une équation simple donnant à peu près 0,2°C de réchauffement anthropique d’ici 2068.11:59Vérification expérimentale.C’est très important.Dans la basse stratosphère, on s’attendrait à une évolution de température.Il n’y a pas d’évolution de température, selon deux mesures satellitaires différentes, depuis un quart de siècle.Pas d’évolution de température.12:25Si l’on en croit le GIEC, on devrait avoir cette évolution de température.Elle n’est pas observée.Pourquoi ?Selon le GIEC, la définition de l’effet de serre se trouve ici.Il considère un abaissement de l’émission par le CO2 à haute altitude dû à un excès de CO2.12:55L’accroissement d’altitude signifie accroissement de température – non, pardon – diminution de température avec l’altitude.Mais qu’est-ce qui se passe vraiment ?Voici à nouveau le spectre infrarouge et de nouveau cette bande à 15 microns, en-dessous dans la troposphère, et au-dessus de la tropopause à 11 kilomètre, dans la figure du dessus. On voit que l’absorption dans les deux cas est toujours de 100 %. Et au-dessus de 11 kilomètres, la température ne décroit plus mais commence à augmenter. Un accroissement de température signifie un effet refroidissant, alors qu’une diminution de température implique un effet réchauffant.Bon.13:47C’est simplement parce que la saturation qui est observée dans la basse atmosphère n’est plus observée à plus haute altitude parce que la pression est plus faible. Et puisque la pression est plus faible, la dissipation de chaleur se fait par un autre mécanisme, non plus par collisions de molécules comme à basse altitude, mais par émission, effet radiatif, à haute altitude en raison de moindres collisions, bien sûr, à cause d’une pression faible.14:20En plus, mais je ne vais pas en discuter, un des auteurs de ces travaux est mon président de séance, donc il connait bien.Vous voyez, le CO2 est si dangereux qu’il chauffe la Terre avant même d’avoir été émis… C’est ce qui découle de ces mesures. Bien sûr, normalement une conséquence SUIT une cause. Mais c’est inversé…Bon, je ne vais pas le discuter parce que j’aurais besoin de temps, cela signifie que l’océan relâche du CO2 parce qu’il y a 60 fois plus de CO2 dans les océans que dans l’atmosphère, et cela pourrait être l’explication.15:18Mais si c’est le cas, cela signifierait que (bon, je vais passer cette planche… peut-être pas – elle a déjà été montrée aujourd’hui) montrant à nouveau qu’il n’y a pas corrélation. Pourquoi ?Si l’on admet une sensibilité climatique de 0,6°C, bien sûr aucune corrélation n’est observée.Parce que soit un doublement du CO2 soit sa division par 2 ne changerait quoi que ce soit (de significatif) dans une telle gamme de température.C’est aussi vrai pour le siècle dernier… Je voudrais simplement utiliser la dernière minute pour insister sur le verdissement de la Terre.C’est observé par satellite.18 millions de kilomètres carrés.Plus intéressant est l’accroissement de l’oscillation saisonnière au fil des ans.Ici à La Jola, on voit que l’accroissement de l’amplitude de cette oscillation est plus grand que ce qu’elle a été, elle augmente plus rapidement que le CO2 lui-même. Tout cela pour arriver à ces conclusions.Je vous laisse lire…(applaudissements) François Gervais – L’urgence climatique est un leurrehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2810008515/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Martha Smith-Higgins, prosecuting for Pembrokeshire council, said Zhao ran the takeaway ""without having a basic understanding"" of what was required.
Following an inspection in January 2018, council officials found he had been banned by Maidstone council in 2009 from being involved in food businesses.
Representing Zhao, Craig Jones said he had surrendered the lease and as far as he knew the business had closed.
He had been staying with a friend on Argyle Street, Swansea, working as a delivery man.
In sentencing, Mr Walters said Zhao had no concept of labelling food or keeping proper records and no understanding of allergens.
He called for a national register of banning orders so local authorities are aware of them.
Zhao admitted three food hygiene offences relating to the condition of the premises, one of failing to comply with a food safety improvement notice and one of running a food businesses after being banned by a crown court.
He was jailed for four months and ordered to pay Â£1,000 prosecution costs."
"On the night of Nov. 16, a group of executives gathered in a private dining room of the restaurant La Chine at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The table was laden with Chinese delicacies and $2, 100 bottles of Château Lafite Rothschild. At one end sat Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of the Waldorf’s owner, Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese financial behemoth with estimated assets of $285 billion and an ownership structure shrouded in mystery. Close by sat Jared Kushner, a major New York real estate investor whose    Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States. It was a mutually auspicious moment. Mr. Wu and Mr. Kushner  —   who is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and is one of his closest advisers  —   were nearing agreement on a joint venture in Manhattan: the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue, the fading crown jewel of the Kushner family   empire. Anbang, which has close ties to the Chinese state, has seen its aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the United States slowed amid concerns raised by Obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk. Now, according to two people with knowledge of the   Mr. Wu toasted Mr. Trump and declared his desire to meet the   whose ascension, he was sure, would be good for global business. Since the election, intense scrutiny has been trained on Mr. Trump’s company and the potential conflicts of interest he will face. But with Mr. Kushner laying the groundwork for his own White House role, the meeting at the Waldorf shines a light on his family’s   business, Kushner Companies, and on the ethical thicket he would have to navigate while advising his    on policy that could affect his bottom line. Unlike the Trump Organization, which has shifted its focus from acquisition to branding of the Trump name, the Kushner family business, led by Mr. Kushner, is a major real estate investor across the New York area and beyond. The company has participated in roughly $7 billion in acquisitions in the last decade, many of them backed by opaque foreign money, as well as financial institutions Mr. Kushner’s    will soon have a hand in regulating. The Anbang talks, which have not previously been reported, began roughly six months ago  —   “Well before the  ’s victory,” Mr. Kushner’s spokeswoman, Risa Heller, noted. That was, however, just as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. While the talks are far along, representatives for Mr. Kushner said some points remained unresolved. Ms. Heller declined to outline the financial terms under discussion. Mr. Kushner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has hired a leading Washington law firm, WilmerHale, to advise him on how to comply with federal ethics laws should he join the White House staff as an adviser to the president. The firm has concluded that one potential sticking point, a federal   law, is not applicable, though not all ethics experts agree. While the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead, Mr. Kushner’s lawyers argue, among other things, that the White House is not an agency and is therefore exempt. As for conflicts of interest, Mr. Kushner would be required to make limited financial disclosures, which could give the public a clearer picture of his holdings. And, unlike Mr. Trump, who as president will be exempt from    laws, he would have to recuse himself from decisions with a “direct and predictable effect” on his financial interests. Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. “Mr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,” she said. He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest “substantial assets. ” She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue. Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner’s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies’ properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with   investments of its own. Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump’s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the   in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the  ’s   . Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump, who made the Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a bête noire of his presidential campaign, to appoint the firm’s president, Gary D. Cohn, as his chief economic adviser, according to several people involved in the transition. (Like a number of people interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.) Goldman Sachs has lent the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company   by Mr. Kushner and his brother. Mr. Trump has said that his    an Orthodox Jew, will play a central role in dealings with Israel, describing him as so talented that he could help “do peace in the Middle East. ” Mr. Kushner’s company has received multiple loans from Israel’s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The incoming Trump administration will inherit a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America’s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump’s attention should be relayed through his    according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement. So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States called the White House in early December to express what one official called China’s “deep displeasure” at Mr. Trump’s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by speaking by phone with the president of Taiwan, the White House did not call the  ’s national security team. Instead, it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner, whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with Anbang but also has Chinese investors. Ethics experts said that while the    law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner’s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions. Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin  Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul’s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang “might not be illegal under the    rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner’s business to try to influence U. S. policy. ” Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner’s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, “it strikes me as a  ” that “still poses a real    issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump’s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner’s role in policy making. ” Like the   Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father. In the 1980s, his father, Charles Kushner, took over the New   construction business started by his own father, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Charles expanded into office buildings and apartments, eventually assembling a $1 billion real estate business and becoming a leading Democratic donor, contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and winning appointment to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business’s proceeds were to be distributed. The fight, which played out in a federal courthouse in Newark, resulted in a plea deal for Charles, who in 2005 was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. The family infighting was so bitter that, at one point, Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his    videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister. Jared, 23 at the time of his father’s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M. B. A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city’s elite and   real estate. It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company’s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before. Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1. 8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States  —   and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier. Around this time, Mr. Kushner met the woman he would marry: Ivanka Trump. “” the headlines blared, as the New York tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven. Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn’t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans  —   and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm Vornado Realty Trust, then a   of two of Mr. Trump’s largest properties and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world’s wealthiest men. In the end, Mr. Kushner’s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international   circuit. In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an   of Rupert Murdoch, on the   yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin’s inner circle. Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner’s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia. Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country  —   to Philadelphia Baltimore Toledo, Ohio and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of ATT. In all, the company owns more than 20, 000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space. As the Kushners have expanded their businesses, they have also, by necessity, expanded their universe of investors and creditors. Lenders have included private equity giants like Blackstone, the French bank Natixis and Goldman Sachs. Another lender is Deutsche Bank, which recently reached a $7. 2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. But it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore. Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces. He has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital, a venture capital firm valued at about $1. 5 billion that is run by his brother, Joshua. The company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies, both in the United States and abroad. Among them is Oscar, a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle. Oscar’s investors have included Li   who is one of Hong Kong’s richest men, and China’s Ping An Insurance, which has close ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China. The Kushner brothers have counted the Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner and the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, as investors in another endeavor  —   Cadre, a   real estate investment company they started with a friend. Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures. But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner’s   investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies. One of the newest Kushner projects  —   a   luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City  —   got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified. The investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants   visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $500, 000. The program, known as   has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing in fiscal year 2015, the State Department issued 9, 764 of the visas  —   overwhelmingly to applicants from China. But the program, which must be renewed periodically by Congress, has lately come under fire. The Government Accountability Office has issued several reports raising concerns about what it termed the program’s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing. One applicant, the agency found, failed to report potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels. Then there are the Kushners’ continuing negotiations with Anbang’s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China. In 2015, Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 Fifth Avenue. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the       office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1, 400 feet. But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family’s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1. 1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant. Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington. The Times reported last year that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies, which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people, many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu, whose own power stems in part from marriage. In his case he married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Mr. Wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a People’s Liberation Army marshal, and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board. Anbang’s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their “know your client” guidelines. Anbang’s deep ties to the Chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol. Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he decided to seek other accommodations. American officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time a senior national security official cited security, counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns. National security concerns have also complicated Anbang’s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States. One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or   companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection. Last year, Anbang tried to purchase the Starwood Hotels chain, outbidding Marriott with a $14 billion offer. It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee. But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster, ultimately Anbang walked away from the deal before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail. And while Anbang’s planned $1. 57 billion purchase of Des   Fidelity  Guaranty Life, first announced in November 2015, was cleared by the committee, also known as Cfius, it stalled after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded more information about Anbang’s shareholding structure. But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment. Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building’s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment. It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner’s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while. By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get. Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has “not found Anbang to be a   enterprise”  —   an important technical point, given that the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments. Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria. Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say. It is a process with which Mr. Trump has some familiarity. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting, as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee, a deal that benefited donors to her family’s charitable foundation while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America’s   capacity. On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The   has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another   bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner’s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated. “I love you guys,” he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present."
" Contributed by Robert Lyman ©2019In a recent apocalyptic tweet, Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party, warned Canadians that we would face “unsafe levels” of heat and “climate catastrophe” if we do not transition off fossil fuels before the next election. It has charitably been interpreted that “by the next election” she meant four year from now (i.e. 2023). I thought that it might be interesting to imagine the briefing note that would be sent to Prime Minister May by the Clerk of the Privy Council in the (unlikely) event that she were to win the forthcoming federal election and ask for advice as to how to implement the transition.MemorandumTo: Prime Minister MayFrom: B.O. Crat, Clerk of the Privy CouncilSubject: Transition to a Non-Fossil Fuel EconomyThis note is In response to your request for a briefing on the measures that may be taken to honour your government’s commitment during the election campaign to transition the Canadian economy off of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) within four years. Here, I wish to give you a preliminary report based on internal consultations among the federal departments primarily involved. These included Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Finance Canada, Justice Canada and National Defence Canada.A full inventory of the measures required and a proposed plan of action will take considerably more time to develop. However, In view of the urgency, I thought you would wish to have an overview of our main conclusions.Planning to end the use of fossil fuels in Canada in four years is like the challenge given to various think tanks in the 1960’s of planning for the first year after a nuclear war. It takes one into the realm of the previously unthinkable.To state the basic facts, about 70% of the energy Canadians use is based on fossil fuels, the rest being supplied by hydro-electricity, nuclear energy, and some wind and solar energy.The combustion of coal, generally for electric power generation and in steel making, is the most carbon dioxide-intensive of the fossil fuel uses. Major efforts have already been made by the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia to phase out existing coal-fired power plants, but in some cases the currently planned phase out will not be completed before 2030. Shutting down all existing coal-fired power plants within four years would be feasible, but extremely costly, as many of them still have several years left on their economic lives. The Federal government could pass a regulation imposing this requirement under the Canadian Environmental Protect Act.  Unfortunately, this regulatory action would probably prompt legal challenges from Alberta and Saskatchewan. A federal-provincial dispute would result, which would require a considerable amount of the Government’s time and potentially delay implementation by months or years.As the power now produced by coal plants could not be replaced by natural gas-fired plants, the affected provinces would have to replace them by building solar and wind plants. Unfortunately, the power from such plants, in all the provinces, is intermittent and unreliable. Without backup natural gas plants or significant additional hydro and nuclear capacity, several provinces would henceforth face serious electricity reliability problems (i.e. frequent blackouts and brownouts in both summer and winter).Building more solar and wind plants, in the absence of proven and affordable bulk electricity storage systems, would only increase the risk of supply interruptions. To build additional hydro and nuclear power plants, in the face of existing regulatory and political constraints (notably from the Government’s core constituencies) would take at least ten years and probably much longer. In the meantime, residential and commercial electricity ratepayers would probably face sharply higher rates and be at permanent risk of supply loss, including during the heaviest power use periods (i.e. the coldest days of winter and hottest days of summer). There are several industries across Canada that depend on reliable electricity to operate. The most likely outcome of reduced reliability is that these firms would move their operations out of Canada. That would, of course, help to reduce emissions, but it would have quite noticeable impacts on employment and revenue generation for the Government.  It is possible, in other words, but rather problematic.Oil is used primarily for transportation and for petrochemical feedstocks. Passing legislation prohibiting the production, import and sale of oil and refined products is theoretically possible, although Justice Canada still has to evaluate the possible liabilities of the Government.  Enforcing such legislation would be an unprecedented compliance challenge. Not to put too fine a point on the matter, it would make enforcing the former anti-marijuana laws look like a cakewalk.Without oil, a small fraction of the population might be able to afford electric vehicles (and thereby be frustrated by the unreliable electricity supply), but the majority would be left with the choice of walking, riding bicycles or horses, or driving across the border to the U.S. to fill up their vehicles. There simply are not enough horses in Canada to provide the personal or freight transportation needed, and it would take at least 40 years if not more to breed that many horses. The public transit system, which now runs mostly on oil fuels, would also have to either shut down or begin a long, slow and costly electrification that would take several decades to complete. Getting around in winter would be a nightmare, especially in large cities. There would, of course, be no aircraft, so transporting goods to remote areas would take months, not hours, and moving people across the country  by steam locomotive (when they could be built and distributed) several days. Air travel for holidays and recreation, regrettably, must end. Electricity cannot be stored so as to power marine vessels, so all existing marine vessels must be converted to steam power and sail. As this will take much more than four years to effect, the shortage of timely freight transportation will have further significant adverse impacts on the economy.Oil and natural gas are the essential feedstocks for petrochemicals. Petrochemical products number in the thousands and include plastics, soaps, detergents, solvents (such as paint thinner), paints, drugs, fertilizer, pesticides, explosives, synthetic fibers and rubbers, and flooring and insulating materials. Eliminating their production would entail the shutting down of plants in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec.It would, of course, be possible to import these products from other countries, but it would be necessary to develop new horse-drawn tanks.Natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, as well as crop drying and electricity generation. The federal government could pass legislation to ban the production, sale and import of natural gas. As it would take several years, if not decades, to develop alternative heating systems, there is a substantial risk that thousands of people would experience adverse health effects and possibly die of cold in wintertime. The provinces, and no doubt some constituencies favoured by the Opposition, would object to this.Much of Canada’s oil and gas consumption occurs during the process of producing these energy sources. Shutting down all oil and gas production in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia. Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories would eliminate a major source of revenue for the federal treasury and create a rather large unemployment problem, especially in western Canada. It seems highly likely that this would result in legal challenges and possibly other retaliatory measures by the provincial governments. A well-designed communications strategy demonstrating how the Government is saving the planet will be one part of a concerted federal response.I noted previously that the federal government could pass legislation, but that depends on having majority support for this in Parliament and broad public support in the country at large. Based on recent polls, I regret to advise you that it is extremely unlikely that a majority of citizens would support these measures. Indeed, based on several formal and informal polls, it appears highly likely that many citizens would actually take hostile action against the Government.  This might make it necessary to invoke the War Measures Act and impose severe penalties on the recalcitrant citizens. Unfortunately, far more of them appear to have licenced firearms than do the citizens who form the Government’s core supporters.  In extremis, if a substantial portion of the public were to revolt, the Government could order the Canadian army to move tanks into the streets. The really bad news, Prime Minister, is that tanks run on diesel fuel.———Back in the realm of reality:Look Before You Leap into Climate Emergency Modehttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Look-Before-you-Leap-into-Emergency-Mode.pdfEnergy Policy Needs to Transition to Reality:https://www.thegwpf.org/energy-policy-needs-to-transition-to-reality/  Climate Change Policy – A Threat to CanadaShocking Realityhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shocking-Reality-FINAL.pdfEnergy Revolution?

In today’s odd academic culture, including the world of climate science, academic freedom applies selectively. People use their positions and their email for politicking and electioneering and have no trouble retaining their jobs. But using your email to send out some inconvenient, apolitical weather data that says something your boss or your governor may not like can get you fired.



I can’t count the number of emails I received in my thirty years at University of Virginia where this faculty member or that administrator urged me to support some piece of legislation. But the latest email kerfluffle, involving Phil Mote, director of the Oregaon Climate Change Research Institute at Oregon State University, goes a bit further.



Mote was upset that Art Robinson, a physician from Cave Junction, Oregon, won the Republican primary for Oregon’s fourth congressional district.



That’s because Robinson was behind the “Oregon Petition Project,” in which over 31,000 people, largely science professionals (including over 9,000 with doctorates), signed on to a document stating that there was “no scientific evidence” that greenhouse gas emissions could cause “catastrophic heating” in the foreseeable future.





Intolerance appears to be endemic in academic climatology.



Robinson did not harp on this issue in the campaign. Instead he ran against the general politics of 12‐​term incumbent Pete deFazio, including his March vote for President Obama’s health care bill. With that one, deFazio probably voted himself out of Congress.



In response to Robinson’s Republican primary win, Mote wrote to his colleagues at Oregon State University emphasizing that Robinson was the force behind the Petition Project and that, if he were elected, OSU would be put in the “tragic ranks of our climate colleagues at University of Oklahoma…and University of Alaska,” where elected officials have the temerity to disagree with Mote about global warming. He signed his missive as “Director, Oregon Climate Change Research Institute and Oregon Climate Services.” Eventually he emailed his colleagues, calling his initial message a “mistake.”



Hardly. Consider the shady track record of climatology in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere.



Mote’s previous position was Washington State Climatologist at the University of Washington, where he repeatedly pointed to a 50% decline in mountain snows between 1950 and the mid‐​1990s. But there are data available after 1995 and before 1950, and when all the data are taken together — thanks in part to the fact that it has snowed plenty there in the last 15 years — the strong decline is erased.



Mote’s then Associate State Climatologist, Mark Albright, emailed this information to several people. When he refused to stop telling the whole truth, Mote terminated his position.



Across the Columbia River at Oregon State University, the previous head of the Oregon Climate Services, George Taylor, put all of the Cascade snowfall data online for anyone to see. The long‐​term records clearly showed no decline at all. Ted Kulongoski, Oregon’s “green” governor, told Taylor he could no longer refer to himself as Oregon State Climatologist. Oregon State University showed little support, too (although Taylor was twice elected as President of the American Association of State Climatologists). Taylor quit rather than continue in such an environment.



George Taylor got into trouble for simply for telling the truth about the lack of a big decline in mountain snowfall, and his university seemed to not care. Mark Albright lost his position for the exact same offense. Phil Mote, who terminated Albright, replaced George Taylor.



Two things are very disturbing. Where was the hue and cry over “academic freedom” over the Albright and Taylor incidents? And how could Mote originally think it was just perfectly fine to use his official position concerning a local race for Congress?



Intolerance appears to be endemic in academic climatology. In Climategate, the University of East Anglia found nothing wrong with a culture of climate bullies blatantly attempting to bend the canon of knowledge, which is the peer reviewed scientific literature. Penn State did the same in its investigation of Michael Mann’s vituperative emails found in the East Anglia package.



The overarching issue is that political correctness has so infected the academy that academic freedom with regard to global warming is now a figment, while electioneering on the public’s dime results in no punishment whatsoever.

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  —   Signs of Esteban Santiago’s unraveling had mounted over the past year. But it was not until early November, when he walked into an F. B. I. office carrying an ammunition clip  —   leaving a pistol and his infant son in his car  —   to complain about a C. I. A. plot against him, that his behavior became disturbing enough to earn him a short stay in a psychiatric hospital unit. In the months before, the police were called repeatedly to his home about domestic disturbances, and the National Guard kicked him out because of “unsatisfactory performance” after nearly a decade of service. Mr. Santiago, an Iraq war veteran, increasingly spoke to relatives and associates about voices in his head that were tormenting him. Then, a little before 1 p. m. Friday, Mr. Santiago, 26, turned up far from his Alaska home, in Terminal 2 of the Fort   International Airport. There, law enforcement officials said, he retrieved his checked luggage, pulled a   handgun out of his suitcase and used it to kill five people and wound six others, setting off a panic that shut down the airport. After running out of ammunition, he lay   on the floor, waiting quietly to be arrested, witnesses said. Late Saturday afternoon, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida announced that Mr. Santiago had been arrested and charged on a federal criminal complaint “in connection with the deadly shooting of multiple victims at Fort   International Airport. ” His first court appearance was scheduled for Monday morning before a federal magistrate in Fort Lauderdale. Law enforcement officials said they had not determined a motive or cause for the attack. And while they said they could not exclude the possibility of terrorism, the initial investigation suggested that Mr. Santiago had acted alone and that there was no evidence that he had terrorist ties. “It’s way too early for us to really rule out anything,” George Piro, the agent in charge of the F. B. I. ’s Miami office, said at a news conference here on Saturday. But family members said they had a pretty good idea of what led to the attack. “He said he heard certain voices, that the U. S. government wanted to enroll him in certain groups for ISIS, and he was very paranoid,” Bryan Santiago Ruiz, an older brother of Mr. Santiago’s, said in an interview on Saturday in Peñuelas, the small town in Puerto Rico where they grew up. Esteban Santiago lived in Anchorage, and Bryan Santiago said he had visited him there, most recently staying with him from August through October. “He said that the C. I. A. controlled him through secret messages over the internet and told him the things he had to do,” he recalled. It was on Nov. 7 that Esteban Santiago went to the F. B. I. office in Anchorage “to report that his mind was being controlled by U. S. intelligence agencies,” Marlin L. Ritzman, the agent in charge of the office, said on Saturday. “During the interview, Mr. Santiago appeared agitated, incoherent and made disjointed statements. ” Elaborating, a senior law enforcement official said Mr. Santiago had claimed that the C. I. A. put terrorist propaganda on his computer. F. B. I. agents called the local police, who took him to a psychiatric facility. “Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS,” said Christopher Tolley, the Anchorage police chief, referring to the Islamic State. When Mr. Santiago went into the F. B. I. office, he left a pistol and his newborn in his vehicle, Chief Tolley said, and he had an ammunition clip in his pocket. The senior law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said the gun was the same weapon used in the airport shooting on Friday. The police confiscated the gun but returned it to Mr. Santiago in December, Chief Tolley said. Bryan Santiago said his brother was held at the hospital for just a few days before being released and, as far as he knew, did not have any   treatment, like medication or therapy. The Fort Lauderdale airport reopened on Saturday, as the F. B. I. led an investigation that sprawled across the country and airport officials tried to reunite people with what they said were 20, 000 items that had been recovered from the terminal, left behind by passengers and airport workers fleeing for their lives. Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but was raised in Puerto Rico, where he joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2007 before he finished high school. A classmate said he had always wanted to be a soldier. In 2010, Mr. Santiago was deployed to Iraq for nine months, working with the 130th Engineer Battalion clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. His company was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. Guard officials said at least two members of the company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is no record indicating that Mr. Santiago was ever involved in combat. Family members said Mr. Santiago was never quite the same after his return. “After Iraq, something happened,” Hernan Rivera, 70, Mr. Santiago’s uncle, said Saturday afternoon as he stood in his driveway in Union City, N. J. “When he came back from Iraq, he was a different person. ” He described his nephew as a “normal kid” who enjoyed reading. “He was a person who used to talk a lot,” Mr. Rivera said. “And then when he came back, he kept to himself, he’d go to his room, he wouldn’t talk to anybody. ” In 2014, Mr. Santiago moved to Alaska and joined the Alaska Army National Guard. He got a job as a security guard and found a girlfriend 14 years his senior. A few months ago, they had a baby a law enforcement official said it was not clear whether that was the same child that he brought with him to the F. B. I. office in November. In January 2016, the girlfriend told the police that Mr. Santiago had flown into a rage while she was using the bathroom, broke down the bathroom door and was “strangling her and smacking her in the side of the head” while screaming at her, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. A month later, he was charged with violating a court order to stay away from his girlfriend after the police found that he had been living with her again. In March, a deferred judgment was entered in the case, meaning that it could be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble, but the signs of unrest continued. Chief Tolley said that once in March and twice in October, Mr. Santiago was the subject of domestic disturbance calls, but each time, officers lacked the basis for making an arrest. In August, Mr. Santiago, who had reached the rank of private first class and had won several commendations for his earlier National Guard service  —   including the Army Good Conduct Medal  —   was discharged by the Alaska Guard for “unsatisfactory performance. ” Despite the disturbing nature of the episode with the F. B. I. in November, it did not land Mr. Santiago on any law enforcement watch lists or on the federal “ ” list. Neither did it impede his right to possess a gun. At a news conference on Saturday in Anchorage, officials with the F. B. I. and local law enforcement said that although Mr. Santiago was clearly incoherent during his encounter with F. B. I. agents, he was not deemed to be threatening. In two other mass killings, perpetrators had drawn attention from the F. B. I. before carrying out their attacks. Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June, had fallen under F. B. I. scrutiny twice for possible ties to terrorism. And Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was interviewed by agents looking into whether he had extremist tendencies, but their investigation of him ended there. On Thursday night, Mr. Santiago boarded a flight in Anchorage, changed planes in Minneapolis on Friday morning, and flew into Fort Lauderdale. Law enforcement officials said that he had a semiautomatic handgun in his checked suitcase and that he followed all legal procedures for transporting the weapon. He went into a terminal restroom, took out the gun and loaded it, then returned to the baggage claim area and started shooting, officials said. He apparently acted alone, Agent Piro said on Saturday, and “the early indication is that there was no specific reason that he chose Fort Lauderdale International Airport, but we’re still pursuing that and trying to really determine why he came here. ” “The suspect did cooperate with the interview team,” which Agent Piro described as a joint effort by the F. B. I. and the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. “The interview went over several hours and concluded sometime this morning. ” While people who knew Mr. Santiago recently saw anger, instability and paranoia, those who knew him earlier in his life had known someone very different. Relatives and acquaintances in Puerto Rico remembered him as being quiet and shy  —   so reserved that in his hometown, Peñuelas, on the island’s southwest coast, few people knew anything about him. Workers at the barbershop, the bakery and the furniture store, and parishioners at the churches near his family’s home, said they did not know Mr. Santiago or his family at all. At the police station, officers said they did not recognize him from the photograph that has been shown repeatedly on network and cable television since his arrest. A neighbor of the family’s, Carlos Cruz, a man in his 50s who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life, said he remembered speaking with Mr. Santiago just once. Those who did recall him described him as highly intelligent, kind and very quiet, part of a somewhat nerdy group who listened to American rock rather than music in Spanish. He spoke of joining the military, seeing it as a way out of the sleepy, economically stagnant region. Rosemarie Zapata, 27, who attended middle school and high school with him, credited him with persuading her to join the Puerto Rico National Guard. At first, she failed the exam by two points, but it was Mr. Santiago who talked her into persevering and introduced her to his recruiter, she said. “He told me, ‘Study, go, they will help us pay for college, so why don’t you try it out? ’” she said. He convinced her that she could do it, saying, “You are going to defy all odds,” she recalled. Years later, she ran into him in a Walgreens parking lot, shortly after he had returned from Iraq. “He was very different,” she said in a telephone interview from Puerto Rico. “He told me: ‘You would never want to go to Iraq. I saw horrible things, horrible.’ He was very different. He was sad. ” Delia Candelario, who went to Josefa Vélez Bauzá High School with Mr. Santiago, said he played basketball with the   boys, who always followed the teachers’ orders. “He was the most peaceful of all of them,” she said. “He participated in classes and all that, but he was pretty shy. ” Another classmate, Joshua Ortiz, said Mr. Santiago was so quiet that when word got out that someone from their school had committed a massacre, hardly anyone could remember his name. Mr. Santiago and his friends were “never known to be involved in any problem or any fight during the whole time we were in school,” Mr. Ortiz said. “We wonder, how could his life have changed so much for this to have happened?” José Hernández, who taught Mr. Santiago history at the school, said: “He was brilliant and did not show any indications of being disturbed. It’s one of those strange cases. There are students who you expect mischief from, but not this one. ”"
"Clemson upset Alabama and won the college football national championship,   in Tampa early Tuesday morning. Clemson was led by its star quarterback, Deshaun Watson, who threw for 420 yards despite facing a defense heralded as one of the best ever. With two minutes left, trailing by 3 points, Watson got the ball at his own 32 and started a drive. Nine plays and 68 yards later, with 1 second on the clock, Hunter Renfrow caught a   touchdown to win the game. The drive included six completed passes, notably a   to Watson’s favorite target, Mike Williams, and a goal line pass interference call. “I’m speechless right now man,” Watson said after the game. “We worked so hard for it we fell short last year. This game is not just for me, it’s for all the alumni, the fans, my family in Gainesville. ” It was the second big title game in a row for Watson, who threw for 405 yards in a loss in this game against Alabama last season. He is likely to go in the top 5 of the N. F. L. draft this year. Watson’s Achilles’ heel during the regular season was the interception, but he threw none in this game. Alabama for its part kept the ball mostly on the ground. Its freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts was   for only 131 yards. Alabama had raced to a   lead on two touchdowns by Bo Scarbrough. Watson cut the lead to   with a long drive that ended with his touchdown run. A game that started as a defensive struggle opened up in the second half. More Watson passing pulled Clemson to within   on a   touchdown to Renfrow. Hurts finally broke through with a   touchdown to a   O. J. Howard, making it   Alabama. Another long Clemson drive concluded with a   pass from Watson to Williams, and Clemson was back within 3,  . Clemson seized its first lead in the game,   as Wayne Gallman punched in a   touchdown run. The key play in the drive was a   pass to Williams, boosted by an unsportsmanlike conduct call against Alabama. Alabama answered like champions with a quick drive. Hurts completed several passes, including a   to O. J. Howard. Then he turned to his other strength, running, and barreled past defenders for a   score. But that only set up Watson for his two minutes of heroics. Here’s how Clemson won the championship: Alabama was 25 percent of the way to another national championship, leading Clemson,   after one quarter in Tampa. The early stages of the game were mostly dominated by defense, with the exception a lightning quick sequence of five plays that including a   scramble by quarterback Jalen Hurts and a   touchdown by Bo Scarbrough to put Alabama in front. Alabama, led by the freshman quarterback Hurts, mostly moved the ball on the ground. Hurts completed just 2 of 8 passes, for 10 yards. He looked especially ineffective going deep. Clemson had limited offensive success against the vaunted Alabama defense  —   quarterback Deshaun Watson was    for 23 yards. It never threatened to score. The Tigers were also hurt by an uninspired failed plunge on    at the Alabama 41. The Clemson highlight was probably a partially blocked punt that took an Alabama roll anyway. Turnovers were expected to be critical in the game, and Clemson had the only one of the quarter, a bobbled snap by quarterback Deshaun Watson that gifted Alabama the ball in Clemson territory with 1:50 left in the period. Alabama held a   lead at halftime of the College Football Playoff Championship in Tampa. The game looked as good as won when favored Alabama went up by   in the second quarter. Alabama was breaking runs and its defense was swamping Clemson’s star quarterback Deshaun Watson. Alabama did it on the ground, rushing for 143 yards. The freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts was    for only 40 yards. Watson woke up with a   drive through the previously impenetrable Alabama defense with six minutes left. He capped it by taking the ball into the end zone himself. He finished the half   for 153 yards. The game was dominated by the defenses, which frustrated most of the game’s drives on both sides. Watson avoided throwing an interception, which he was often guilty of during the season. Clemson did lose one fumble. A poor Alabama punt gave Clemson the ball at Alabama’s 42 and Deshaun Watson took advantage with a quick drive culminating in a   touchdown to Hunter Renfrow. Watson was up to 228 yards passing. That drive notwithstanding, defense was generally trumping offense in the second half. The best drive before the touchdown came from Clemson as Watson led the Tigers from their own 16 to Alabama’s 43. The drive might have gone farther, but a catch for a first down was overruled on review, leaving Clemson with a fourth and short. Watson stayed on the field, and it seemed the Tigers might go for it, but it was a bluff, and Watson punted the ball. Jalen Hurts of Alabama had barely registered in the first three quarters of the national championship. He was   for only 49 yards. And Alabama, after racing to a   lead, was up only  . Then O. J. Howard badly beat Clemson’s Van Smith, and raced down the sidelines for a   touchdown. Just like that Hurts more than doubled his yardage for the game and Alabama widened its lead to   as the third quarter drew to a close. It was a huge play for Alabama, which had been struggling on offense. Watson Takes Over: A mostly defensive game opened up as the third quarter turned into the fourth, with both teams scoring. After Alabama went up by   on a   pass play, Clemson answered with a   drive consisting mostly of shortish passes from Watson. It finished with a   pass from Watson to his favorite target all year, Mike Williams. Watson was up to 294 yards passing, but Alabama still led,   with 14 minutes left to play. Gallman Gives Clemson the Lead: Clemson seized its first lead in the national championship,   as Wayne Gallman punched in a   touchdown run. The key play in the drive was a   pass to Williams, boosted by an unsportsmanlike conduct call against Alabama. Watson continued to solve the toughest defense in the country and increased his passing numbers to   for 360 yards. Alabama Retakes Lead: Alabama, behind for the first time in the game, answered like champions with a quick drive. Jared Hurts, whose passing had been vastly overshadowed by Deshaun Watson of Clemson, completed several, including a   to O. J. Howard. Then for the touchdown he turned to his other strength, running, and barreled past defenders for a   score Alabama led   but Watson still had an opportunity for a   drill. We all know how that ended."
"The weather at any spot is usually defined by max/min temperatures, humidity, precipitation and wind strength/direction. Weather varies hourly, daily, season-to-season and place-to- place. These weather measurements at any place can be averaged over various time periods.

"What determines surface temperature at any spot on earth?
Apart from a tad of geothermal heat and a wisp of heat from nuclear power generators, every bit of surface energy (including coal and biomass) comes directly or indirectly from the sun. There is no other source of surface heat – everything else just stores, releases or re-directs solar energy.
Surface heat is maximised when the sun is directly overhead, near a peak in the sunspot cycle and when Earth’s orbit comes closest to the sun (perihelion). The hottest places on earth will be found near the equator, after mid-day, in mid-summer, at perihelion and when there are no clouds in the sky to reflect solar radiation. Temperature will be maximised when there is no cooling wind and no nearby surface water or moist soils to cool things by evaporation. Since higher temperature also occurs at lower altitudes, one of the hottest places on earth is Death Valley, a desert below sea level, where the temperature can reach 56 °C on a mid-summer afternoon.
Frigid temperatures are found near the poles, where solar energy is weak. The coldest place on Earth is Vostok at high altitude in Antarctica where the air is very dry and where the temperature can go as low as minus 89 °C with a cloudless sky in the dead of winter.
Since both extremes could occur simultaneously, Earth’s maximum daily temperature range is thus up to 145 °C. But at any single place, the diurnal variation is more likely to be about 15-40 °C.
Carbon dioxide has no effect on any of the above temperature drivers – it generates no new heat, cannot affect latitude, solar orbits, sun spots, altitude, season, time of day, clouds or the proximity of water. All it can possibly do is encourage plant growth, and intercept, absorb and redirect a tiny bit radiant energy passing either way between the sun, Earth’s surface and space. But that effect is almost exhausted at current levels of carbon dioxide. Doubling the carbon dioxide content from 400 ppm to 800 ppm (which may take the next 100 years) might possibly increase surface temperatures by up to 2 °C – not even noticeable compared to the daily temperature ranges we cope with now.
Everyone can feel the powerful warmth of the rising sun, the variations between summer and winter, the moderating effect of clouds and the shock of hot and cold winds.
But even if carbon dioxide levels doubled overnight, most people on earth would not notice any difference.

Instead of cutting forests and burning dung and charcoal, shouldn’t Africa have cheap electricity?
Duggan Flanakin
China, India, Vietnam and other nations are using more and more oil, natural gas and coal every year to electrify and modernize their nations, create jobs, and improve their people’s health, living standards and life spans. Why in this day and age are the World Bank and other international institutions demanding widespread use of charcoal for heating and cooking in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)? Why are African countries, the United States and human rights groups tolerating these lethal policies?
During the recent 2019 “climate week,” the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change touted increased reliance on biomass – which already comprises 60% of European “renewable” energy – as a tool in fighting climate change and stabilizing Earth’s never-stable climate.
(Europe’s “renewable” energy includes England’s Drax Power Plant, which is fueled by wood from millions of trees from thousands of acres of American and Canadian forest habitats. The trees are turned into wood pellets, which are hauled by truck to coastal ports and transported to North Yorkshire on oil-fueled cargo ships. From there the pellets are taken by train to the Drax Power Plant and burned in place of coal, to generate electricity – so that the UK can “meet its renewable fuel targets,” even though the overall process generates more carbon dioxide than coal or gas plants on a total life-cycle basis, and the trees are cut and burned much faster than new ones can grow. This is hardly sustainable.)
The Dogwood Alliance objected to the IPCC report, claiming that biomass (largely charcoal) contributes to deforestation. Dogwood’s arguments reflect the views of Norimitsu Onishi, whose 2016 New York Times article pointed out that burning charcoal not only poses human health concerns, but also constitutes a massive threat to the environment and numerous plant and animal species whose habitats are being destroyed by people using their trees to make charcoal.
The UN Environment Programme predicts that Africa’s demand for charcoal – currently 23 million tons a year – is likely to double or triple by 2050. Africa’s charcoal production doubled in the past two decades and now accounts for more than 60% of the world’s total, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Rapid urbanization increased demand for charcoal, the preferred way to cook in SSA cities.
Onishi acknowledged that charcoal is cleaner and easier to use than firewood, and cheaper and more readily available in much of Africa than gas or electricity. As a result, 80% of SSA families use charcoal as their primary energy source.
The World Health Organization reports that worldwide over 4.3 million people a year die prematurely from illnesses attributable to household air pollution resulting from burning charcoal and other solid fuels in open fires and leaky stoves. That’s more deaths than from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.
The WHO also noted that the lack of access to electricity for at least 1.2 billion people around the world exposes families to very high levels of fine particulate matter and other toxic materials in smoke – and to many intestinal diseases from spoiled food and unsafe drinking water. Lack of electricity also results in other health risks, such as burns, injuries and poisonings.
The lack of plentiful, reliable, affordable electricity also restricts opportunities to read and study at night, enjoy access to computers and the internet, engage in small crafts and trades, develop larger businesses and industries, create jobs, build modern homes, hospitals, schools and infrastructure, and take other steps that greatly improve people’s living standards, health and nutrition. 
Why, in heaven’s name, more than century after affordable electricity began to transform Western society, is over half of Africa still not connected to any electric grid? Can any American, European, Australian or Canadian imagine life without abundant, reliable, affordable, 24/7/365 electricity?
The World Bank points out that SSA’s household electrification rate averaged a mere 42% in 2016 – with Rwanda at 80% and Guinea-Bissau at an abysmal 30% – leaving hundreds of millions of Africans with no electricity or only very limited, totally unpredictable access to this vital energy source.
ZimbabweSituation.com says three factors hinder demand for electric power in much of Africa. First, many firms and households that are already connected to the grid in SSA face regular blackouts, due to insufficient electricity and poor grid reliability. That means continued reliance on charcoal, forcing connected households and businesses to pay for two energy sources.
Next, where electricity bills take up a large share of household income, access to electricity is very low. Countries with poor grid penetration typically use high tariffs to finance infrastructure to improve their electric grids. But high tariffs translate into high energy bills that deter consumers and make it very hard for to launch and sustain businesses that create jobs and enable people to afford electricity.
Third, the cost and complexity of the connection process further hampers electrification. Where generation capacity is insufficient, utilities may delay new connections until infrastructure investments catch up with consumer demand. The Catch-22 is that these administrative barriers, red tape and connection costs drive down demand, postponing electrification almost forever.
In most places, says Patrick Conners, The Energy Guy, wood competes dollar for dollar with natural gas but pollutes much more and requires far more work: hauling and stacking the wood, stoking and tending the fire, and cleaning out the ashes afterward. A modern furnace gives much more uniform heat without the smoke and draft issues, but even these are unavailable and unaffordable in Africa.
African electricity costs and reliability will only come with modernization and expansion of the electric grid. The late Steven Lyazi, who worked with the Congress of Racial Equality Uganda, acknowledged that the availability of solar energy is good news to millions of Africans who rely on firewood, dung and charcoal for cooking. However, he added, solar and wind are at best stopgap solutions on the way to energy security – which UN, World Bank and other policies all but ensure will never arrive.
“Many people,” said Lyazi, “don’t know that Africa has some big dreams.” Just one – the proposed 466-mile Trans East Africa electric railway – would require much more energy than wind and solar can provide. Much of Africa has great potential for nuclear energy, coal, oil and natural gas, he explained – but powerful (largely European) environmentalists (including the World Bank) have opposed funding such projects.
Lyazi, who died in a bus accident in 2017, urged Africans to use their abundant natural resources. He challenged Africans to defy European environmentalists, who have stymied fossil fuel, hydroelectric and nuclear power projects in Africa. He said Uganda and other SSA countries should build natural gas pipelines to power plants, to generate affordable electricity for millions. Today, African oilfields mostly burn and waste the gas, while exporting the oil is mostly exported, benefitting elites while leaving millions energy-deprived, impoverished and desperate.
Why not also build nuclear and coal power plants and hydroelectric projects? Why not indeed? Why should Africans continue to barely survive at the hands of eco-imperialist, neo-colonialist, environmentally destructive organizations policies that ignore the most basic human rights: the rights to energy, modern health and living standards, and decent lives?
As South African nuclear engineer, energy consultant and activist Kelvin Kemm has noted, no single energy source will work for all of Africa. All have shortcomings in various regions, for a wide variety of reasons – except that small pebble bed modular nuclear reactors could probably be employed anywhere.
But Africa, and individual African countries and regions, should be the ones making those decisions – not outsiders, and not based on disinformation, pressure and bullying from those outsiders. They should not be forced to accept biomess energy imposed on them by global eco-imperialists.

"Carbon Dioxide May Calm the Climate, but it Cannot Cause Wild Weird Weather
Every day some place in the world has “wild weather”. And in recent times, human industry gets the blame. “It’s all caused by man-made global warming” (generally shortened to “global warming”, or GW by alarmists).
Floods or droughts – blame GW; bushfires or snowstorms – blame GW; frosts or heatwaves – blame GW; hail storms or dust storms – blame GW; cyclones or tornadoes – blame GW.
In fact, here is a complete list of all the things blamed on global warming:
http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/warmlist.htm
If all of this were true, then carbon dioxide is surely the most powerful and disruptive gas on the planet. That great scientist, John Kerry, even calls it a “weapon of mass destruction”.

Thanks to cartoonist Steve Hunter who has gambled again that we may raise enough money to pay him.
But carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most stable, predictable, unreactive and puny of all climate
factors. And its effect diminishes for each addition of CO2 to the atmosphere. Adding more now has
almost zero effect on temperature.

"A Statement by Viv Forbes, Founding Secretary of “Clexit” (Climate Exit).
31 August 2016
To view this release with all images intact click:
http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/clexit.pdf
For at least a decade we have been told by the UN/IPCC, by most government media and officials, by many politicians, and by the Green “charities” and their media friends that “the science is settled”. We are lectured by Hollywood stars, failed politicians and billionaire speculators that anyone who opposes the World War on Carbon Dioxide is ignorant, mischievous or supporting some hidden vested interest. We endure calls for an end to free speech for climate sceptics, smearing with derogatory terms like “denier”, and even aggressive punishments like dismissal and legal action against sceptics for speaking out. The new low is the use of anti-racketeer legislation against sceptics:
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/08/29/rico-charges-against-climate-deniers-a-case-of-goose-and-gander/
We notice the sudden and unexplained denial of pre-booked sceptic conference facilities and the steadfast refusal of alarmists to debate facts and issues.
Why are they so afraid of words? Surely this is a sign that their facts are shonky and their arguments are feeble? They fear they are losing the confidence of the public.

The tide is turning, and informed opposition is growing. It is time for the thinking media to give sceptical evidence and conclusions a fair go in the court of public opinion.
In a short time with no costly international meetings and very little publicity, Clexit has gathered the support of over 115 members in 20 countries. Please look at the list of Foundation Members and countries:
http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit-members.pdf
Look at the skills, qualifications, experience and wisdom of our founding members; and the many other well-qualified dissenters listed at the end. The science is not settled.
This global warming alarm started with UN sponsored groups such as the IPCC. But Clexit has members who were official IPCC reviewers but they dissented from the final public IPCC reports which were prepared by political appointees.
The climate alarm rests totally on computerised models of atmospheric physics. But Clexit has highly qualified meteorologists, physicists, astro-physicists, radiation experts, climate modellers and long-range forecasters who reject the science, maths, assumptions and forecasts of the greenhouse-driven computer models.
We are told that Earth’s climate is controlled by the gradual increase of a tiny trace of one colourless gas in the atmosphere. But Clexit has specialists who can show that the warm and cold currents in the deep and extensive oceans, the variable water vapour in the atmosphere and Earth’s changing cover of ice, snow and clouds have far more effect on weather and climate than carbon dioxide.
We are told that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. But Clexit has organic chemists, biologists, physicians, naturalists, graziers, foresters and farmers who know that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is very beneficial for Earth’s biosphere – deserts are contracting, bush and forests are expanding, and crop yields are up.
We are told that sea levels are rising alarmingly. But Clexit has experts on sea level history and measurement who can prove that there is nothing unusual or alarming about current fluctuations in sea levels.
We are told that today’s climate is extreme and unusual. But Clexit has geologists and geographers who have studied eons of climate history via ice cores, stratigraphy, paleontology, deep-sea drilling, historical records, glaciers, ice sheets and landscapes and who say that climate change is normal and today’s climate is not extreme or unusual.
We are told to fear the coming global warming. But Clexit has geologists and researchers who have studied the cycles of the ice ages and the climate effects of the Milankovitch cycles in Earth’s orbit – obliquity, eccentricity and precession. They say we have passed the peak of this modern warm era and the long-term trend is now towards global cooling. We will still have short-term periods of hot and extreme weather, and some heat records may still be broken, but the 1,000 year climate averages are trending down towards the next glacial epoch of the Pleistocene Ice Age.
We are told that global warming threatens human health, and even our survival as a species, but Clexit has medical researchers who point to evidence that exposure to cold remains up to twenty times more lethal than exposure to heat. And Clexit has farmers who know that global cooling will slash food production, quickly causing hunger and starvation.
We are told repeatedly that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed by dangers that change annually – rising seas, river sediments, warm seas, ocean acidity, fertiliser run-off, coal port development, over-fishing or marauding star-fish. But Clexit has qualified members who have studied oceanography and ancient and modern corals and report that the Reef is healthy, and corals have survived far more dramatic changes in sea levels and climate in the past.
Solar cycles get no consideration in the IPCC climate models but Clexit has astro-physicists and long range weather forecasters who have demonstrated that solar and lunar cycles have big effects on Earth’s climate and weather cycles. In addition, while billions of dollars are spent fruitlessly on failed climate models and endless climate conferences, little is known about the strings of undersea volcanoes or how much geothermal heat is released from Earth’s molten interior during orogenic upheavals.
We are told that we must embrace zero-emission green energy. But Clexit has power engineers and logistics experts who say that wind and solar power cannot run modern industrial societies, modern transport or big cities except by installing massive overcapacity and giganticShowbox for iPhone transmission webs at exorbitant costs. 100% wind/solar is a recipe for blackouts and starvation. Clexit also has naturalists and conservationists who see more harm than good in extensive wind, solar and bio-fuel developments.
Finally, we are told that to save the world we need to hand powerful taxing and regulating powers to unelected officials of the United Nations. But Clexit has politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen, columnists, lawyers, army officers and bloggers who see that this political agenda will destroy the freedoms we cherish.
Many Clexit members have held very senior positions in research, industry or academia but no longer have sensitive positions, careers or incomes to protect, so are free to express honest opinions, which they have done by supporting “Clexit”.
We ask the media to give our soundly-based dissenting conclusions a fair hearing – there are two sides to most stories, but only one side is being aired.
The Clexit initiative was launched with no budget, promises or funds. So, unlike the alarmists with an agenda, those receiving rivers of government funds and those posing as tax-exempt charities, we cannot afford massive advertising costs.
We hope, in the interests of fair play, you see fit to give our valid concerns some space in the free media.
Note: The first informal meeting of many Clexit members will take place in London on Sept 8/9, 2016 at this conference (whose first booked venue had to be changed because of controversy and opposition):
https://geoethic.com/london-conference-2016/
Disclosure: The formation of Clexit was not prompted or supported by any industry, corporation, group or lobby nor have they had any say in our statements or conclusions.

Ingolstadt-today.de here reports on Professor Dr. Jörg Wellnitz from the Technical University in Ingolstadt calling the future of electric cars a “pointless dream” and that this is an opinion shared by many other experts.


Mechanical engineering professor says electric mobility “will never work”. Photo credit. 

“Pointless” endeavor
“The uncompromising path to e-mobility is as pointless as it is without any discernible effect on the Earth’s climate,” he told the Ingolstadt-today.de. “The German professor of mechanical engineering has “stepped on a lot of people’s toes with this,” the Ingolstadt-today.de reports.




E-mobility has become a “question of faith,” Wellnitz says, adding that “people either believe in the evil CO2 as a climate killer, or they don’t.”
Enormous costs for no benefit
Wellnitz quotes Danish climate researcher Björn Lomborg, who sees Germany’s foray into green energy as a huge waste of resources, and who calculated that if Germany spent 43 billion on CO2 reduction over 80 years, global warming would be reduced by just 0.01 degrees.”
Industrial suicide for Germany
Wellnitz thinks that the ambitious targets for sales of electric cars will end with a slump in sales for German car manufacturers, is sure the electric car “can’t work”, that it is “industrial suicide”and it too is also “a climate catastrophe”. He thinks people should be given what they need, a highly efficient and clean engine like the diesel, for example.

google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




According to Wellnitz, around eight percent of global CO2 emissions are attributable to the car.
CO2 easy to politicize
The distinguished expert also says CO2 is not a climate killer, but a vital gas, one that it is extremely easy to politicize. “It is easy to turn this screw, everyone understands it and it can be measured immediately, people believe. But recent research, says Wellnitz, has shown that even if the saturation of CO2 in the atmosphere were to reach 800 ppm, an almost unattainable value, global warming would only be affected by around 0.4 degrees.
He adds: “If there is a greenhouse effect, it’s been around for a long time.” Other gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs are far more harmful to the climate and relevant to global warming than CO2, writes Ingolstadt-today.de. “But we focused on CO2 and the car has to be evil,” says Wellnitz.
“Massive renunciation of cherished amenities”
The professor of mechanical engineering also claims that a climate-neutral Europe is impossible as long as we produce our goods in China or India and that consumer behavior would have to change radically if we want to achieve CO2 neutrality. In plain language that would mean: “a massive renunciation of cherished amenities.”
Ingolstadt-today.de also writes that Wellnitz also reacts with some incomprehension to “15-year-old climate ambassadors who don’t even know how to spell C02, but who let their parents drive them to tree-planting campaigns in their SUVs.”
Middle Age trading of indulgences
Wellnitz himself says CO2 has become a question of faith and that the trade in pollution certificates is reminiscent of the indulgence trade of the Middle Ages. For him it makes more sense to prepare for global warming of two degrees and that the shortage of water will become a massive problem for the next decades, a problem that is not as easy to solve as the problem with fossil fuels.
“Will never work”
Germany is sacrificing its high level of competence in engine design for an electrical future that, according to Wellnitz, “will never work.”

Carbon dioxide does not “endanger” our health – and it’s time EPA recognized that simply fact
Tom Harris and Dr. Jay Lehr
On August 6, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (Washington) that it be granted intervenor status concerning litigation launched by environmental groups against the Trump administration’s new Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.
The case in question, American Lung Association v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 19-1140, concerns attempts by environmental groups to strike down the ACE rule and resurrect the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). The Chamber wants to be able to intervene in the case in defense of ACE.
The Chamber’s focus is on the legal aspects of ACE and CPP, and this will perhaps be valuable. However, it sidesteps the most important issue: both ACE and CPP are unnecessary since they rest on a faulty premise, namely, the misguided notion that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions must be reduced to avoid a climate crisis.
The appellants for the case, the American Lung Association and American Public Health Association, represented by attorneys from the so-called Clean Air Task Force, certainly pull no punches in their pronouncements. Their July 8 press release alleges that “EPA’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan and replace it with the ACE rule continues to disregard the vast health consequences of climate change and puts more lives at risk.”
That is nonsense, of course. But that didn’t stop other groups from taking a similar approach. Carter Roberts, President & CEO of the World Wildlife Fund, said, “This [ACE] rule enables dirty power plants to keep polluting – grounding federal energy policy firmly in the past and saddling future generations with the costs of unchecked climate change.” He too apparently wants people to believe the CO2 that we exhale and plants require for photosynthesis is a “dirty pollutant” and the primary factor in driving Earth’s climate – more important than the Sun and hundreds of other natural forces that do regulate climate.
Sierra Club director Michael Brune said, “This is an immoral and illegal attack on clean air, clean energy and the health of the public, and it shows just how heartless the Trump administration is when it comes to appeasing its polluter allies.”
Environmentalists, Democrats and some state attorneys general dubbed the regulation the “Dirty Power Plan,” and more lawsuits against ACE are apparently on the way.
As to clean energy and public health, the forced elimination of fossil fuels that provide over 80% of U.S. and global energy would be devastating to our economies, jobs, living standards, health and welfare. Any forced reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels would negate and roll back the tremendous plant growth that has been “greening” our planet for two decades.
Forcing America to install literally millions of wind turbines and tens of millions of solar panels, and plant tens of millions more acres in biofuel crops, would devastate wildlife habitats and countless species, while driving up electricity prices for families, factories, farms, businesses, schools and hospitals. The wind and sunlight may be free, clean and green. But the massive technologies required to harness those forces for human benefit certainly are not.
If Trump Administration advisors thought they could appease their opponents by implementing a rule focused on the useless and ultimately dangerous goal of limiting CO2 emissions, they were sorely mistaken. But as long as they did not contest the scientifically flawed idea that CO2 is a dangerous pollutant that must be controlled, they really had no choice but to replace the even worse Obama era rule with some form of CO2 reduction regulation.
Dr. Sterling Burnett, Senior Fellow of the Arlington Heights, IL-based Heartland Institute, explained recently on the internet “Think Radio” program Exploratory Journeys: The ACE rule was effectively “forced on the Trump administration because they didn’t, at the same time [they drafted the rule], say we are going to re-examine the Endangerment Finding” [EF] – the EPA’s 2009 finding that CO2 and other “greenhouse gases” (GHG) somehow endanger the health and welfare of Americans.
“As long as the Endangerment Finding exists,” said Burnett, “any administration, no matter how skeptical of the claims that humans are causing catastrophic climate change, … the courts will order them to come up with plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. So, it’s time to go back and examine that finding.”
It is hard to believe that attacks that would ensue against the current administration for opening the GHG Endangerment Finding to re-examination would be any more severe than what they are already being subjected to by enabling the ACE rule. So there is little, if any, political upside to bringing in a weaker version of Obama’s misguided Clean Power Plan.
If you are going to infuriate your opponents to the extent that they will take out lawsuits against you and publicly label you “the worst president in U.S. history for protecting the air and our climate,” as Brune did after Trump’s July 8 environment speech, you might as well do what you really wanted to do, instead of taking half measures.
Burnett explained that ACE has another serious downside that will limit the Trump EPA going forward.
“ACE is dangerous because it cements for a second time, this time by a Republican, supposedly skeptical administration, the idea that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that needs to be regulated,” said Burnett.
“This gives the Endangerment Finding the Trump administration’s stamp of public approval, which environmentalists will cite when they fight this in court saying, ‘even the Trump administration acknowledges carbon dioxide is damaging the U.S., but they are unwilling to take the steps necessary to truly fight carbon pollution.’” For even more reasons to reverse the EF, read this policy brief.
It’s time for the Trump administration, the Chamber, and indeed everyone who wants sensible environmental policy to call a spade a spade. Rather than merely engaging their enemies in legal arguments, while fighting activists on their own ground, they should clearly state that CO2 endangers no one and the EF should be reopened.
They should demand that alarmist scientists and advocacy groups prove clearly, with convincing data and evidence, and against vigorous counter evidence and cross examination, that the small manmade portion of atmospheric CO2 and far tinier manmade portions of other greenhouse gases: are dirty and poisonous; control Earth’s climate and weather; are doing so to a dangerous and unprecedented degree never experienced in prior Earth or human history; and can be manipulated by the United States and other nations so as to stabilize planetary climate and weather systems that have never been stable.
When the re-examination inevitably reveals that effectively classifying CO2 as a pollutant was a mistake, administration officials should not be quiet about it. They must follow Winston Churchill’s advice:
“If you have an important point to make, don’t try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time – a tremendous whack.”
Extremists in the climate change movement clearly hate fossil fuels and apparently humanity. Ridding the world of the inexpensive, life-enhancing fossil fuels would devastate society and especially hurt our working class and poor families, as our standard of living is reduced to that of third world nations. Moreover, the environmental devastation caused by their proposed “solutions” to the supposed climate crisis would be far worse than anything caused by any foreseeable human impact on climate.
It’s time to defuse the climate scare at its source. The greenhouse gas Endangerment Finding must be given a tremendous whack, and sent to the dustbin of history.
Tom Harris is Executive Director of the Ottawa, Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition (ICSC) and a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute.  Dr. Jay Lehr is Senior Policy Analyst with ICSC.

"Is your workout getting you nowhere? Research and lived experience indicate that many people who begin a new exercise program see little if any improvement in their health and fitness even after weeks of studiously sticking with their new routine. Among fitness scientists, these people are known as “nonresponders. ” Their bodies simply don’t respond to the exercise they are doing. And once discouraged, they often return to being nonexercisers. But an inspiring and timely new study suggests that nonresponders to one form of exercise can probably switch to another exercise regimen to which their body will respond. And a simple test you can do at home will help you determine how well your workout is working for you. One of the first major studies to report the phenomenon of nonresponders appeared in 2001, when researchers parsed data from dozens of previously published studies of running, cycling and other endurance exercise. The studies showed that, on aggregate, endurance training increased people’s endurance. But when the researchers examined individual outcomes, the variations were staggering. Some people had improved their endurance by as much as 100 percent, while others had actually become less fit, even though they were following the same workout routine. Age, sex and ethnicity had not mattered, the researchers noted. Young people and old had been outliers, as had women and men, black volunteers and white. Interestingly, nonresponse to endurance training ran in families, the researchers discovered, suggesting that genetics probably plays a significant role in how people’s bodies react to exercise. Since then, other researchers have found that people can have extremely erratic reactions to weight training regimens, with some packing on power and mass and others losing both. And a study published last year concentrating on brief bouts of intense interval training concluded that some people barely gained endurance with this type of workout, while others flourished, greatly augmenting their fitness. These studies, however, were not generally designed to tell us whether someone who failed to benefit from one form of exercise might do well with another. So for the new experiment, which was published in December in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of Ottawa decided to focus intently on whether a nonresponder to one form of exercise could benefit by switching to another. They began by gathering 21 healthy men and women and determining their VO2 max, a measure of how much oxygen the lungs can deliver to the muscles heart rates and other physiological parameters related to aerobic fitness. Then they had each volunteer complete two very different types of workouts. Each training regimen lasted three weeks, and the researchers waited several months before starting the next regimen, so that volunteers could return to their baseline fitness. One   routine involved typical endurance training: riding a stationary bicycle four times a week for 30 minutes at a moderately strenuous pace. The second type of exercise revolved around   intervals. Each volunteer completed eight   intervals of very hard pedaling on a stationary bicycle, with 10 seconds of rest after each bout. The intervals were brutal but brief. At the end of each   session, the researchers again checked each volunteer’s VO2 max and other fitness measures. As a group, they had gained admirable amounts of fitness from both workouts and to about the same extent. But individually, the responses varied considerably. About a third of the people had failed to show much if any improvement in one of the measures of fitness after three weeks of endurance training. Similarly, about a third had not improved their fitness much with interval training. And after each type of workout, some participants were found to be in worse shape. A majority of the participants, in other words, had failed to respond as expected after one of the workouts. But, importantly, no one had failed to respond at all. Every man and woman had measurably improved his or her fitness in some way after one of the sessions, if not the other. Those who had shown little response to endurance training generally showed a robust improvement after the interval sessions, and vice versa. These data suggest that “there is no     approach to exercise,” says Brendon Gurd, an associate professor of kinesiology at Queen’s University who oversaw the study. “But it does seem as if there is some size that fits everyone. ” The question is how to determine which form of exercise best fits you. The answer, Dr. Gurd says, is simple trial and error. Before beginning a new exercise routine, he says, measure your fitness. You can do this by briskly walking up several flights of stairs or quickly stepping onto and off a box three or four times. Then check your pulse. This is your baseline number. Now start working out. Walk. Jog. Attend interval training or spin classes. After about a month, Dr. Gurd says, repeat the stair or step test. Your pulse rate should be slower now. Your workout sessions should also be feeling easier. If not, you may be a nonresponder to your current exercise routine. In that case, switch things up, Dr. Gurd recommends. If you have primarily been walking, maybe try sprinting up a few flights of stairs and walking back down, which is a simple form of interval training. Or if you have been exercising with intervals and feeling no fitter, perhaps jog for a month or two. The message he hopes people will glean from his and other studies of exercise nonresponders “is not that you shouldn’t bother exercising because exercise might not help you,” Dr. Gurd says. “It does help everyone, once you find your own best exercise. ”"

The Current Wisdom _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science, reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press._   
  
In this _Current Wisdom_ we report further on our ongoing effort to prepare comments on the latest, greatest (or, more aptly, most recent, most indecent) edition of the government’s assessment of climate change impacts in the United States (if you are interested in submitting your own comments, you should hurry, because the public comment period closes on this Friday, April 12).   
  
A disturbing yet ubiquitous aspect of the current draft National Climate Assessment (and for that matter, both earlier editions of the NCA) is the use of future projections of climate change before demonstrating that they work in the recent past, as greenhouse-gas concentrations have increased.   
  
Discussions of future impacts from changes in precipitation resulting from human emissions of greenhouse gases are everywhere in the report and they are usually bad—increased droughts, floods, and longer dry spells, for example. The NCA folks weren’t quite so enthusiastic at generating many forecasts of salutary changes. Perhaps Dr. Pangloss is their spiritual adviser.   
  
NCA’s precipitation forecasts turn out to be uglier than Candide’s fair Cunegonde became. Do the models accurately simulate past changes that have been observed? If the answer is “no,” then the whole impact exercise is meaningless because the models provide no reliable information about what the future may bring.   
  
The answer isn’t just “no.” It’s NO, NON, ONAY, NEIN.   




Back in 2007, Xuebin Zhang and colleagues compared large-scale observations of precipitation changes with climate model emulations. They looked at the observed behavior within latitude bands in which the modeled precipitation changes were more or less of the same character.   
  
While Zhang et al. (2007) concluded globally that they had detected an anthropogenic influence on the overall latitudinal patterns of precipitation trends (that is, the climate model trends were of the same sign as the observed trends), in the latitude band that includes the majority of the United States population a mismatch between model projections and precipitation trends was found (Figure 1). In that band, the climate models predicted a downward trend in precipitation, while observations show an upwards trend.   
  
  






More recently, Beena Sarojini and colleagues (2012) examined the performance of a new (and supposedly improved) crop of climate models and found much the same as Zhang et al. (2007).   
  
Sarojini et al. (2012) found little if any anthropogenic climate change signal in either the annual or seasonal observed precipitation trends in land areas in the latitude band which contains the majority of the U.S. (Figure 2). Instead they found that the natural influence on precipitation over land areas with observations in the 30 to 60N latitude band is indistinguishable from the natural+anthropogenic signal indicating that anthropogenic forcing has played no detectable role in the evolution of seasonal precipitation in this latitude band either in seasonal or annual totals.   






  
  
Obviously, climate models whose hindcasts differ in sign from what is observed (Zhang et al., 2007), or which indicate that human influences are indistinguishable from natural changes (Sarojini et al., 2012) possess no skill in identifying a human-induced climate signal on observed precipitation across the U.S. and therefore should not be used to make future projections.   
  
And while Zhang et al. (2007) and Sarojini et al. (2012) looked only at the match within latitude bands, just-published research by a team led by Debbie Polson ( 2013) showed more specific results.   
  
Across the U.S., Polson et al. (2013) find that for most of the country during all seasons, that the sign of the observed precipitation changes (since 1950) differs from the sign of the climate model projected changes (Figure 3).   
  
  




We are beginning to sound like a broken record here, but again, it is impossible to present reliable future projections for precipitations changes across the U.S. (seasonal or annual) from a collection of climate models which largely cannot even get the sign (much less the magnitude) of the observed changes correct.   
  
Here is our recommendation to the NCA author team:   




“Unless/until the GCMs can be demonstrated to accurately capture observed characteristics (spatial and temporal patterns and magnitudes) of precipitation changes across the U.S., all discussion from the NCA concerning future patterns of precipitation change should be removed.”



Or as the late Johnnie Cochran so simply put it, “if [the glove] doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”

"**Pharmacists are calling for better regulation of products claiming to contain cannabis derivative CBD.**
There has been a spike in demand within the last twelve months, according to manufacturers.
Non-medicinal CBD is now on sale in High Street shops across the country, including chemists.
But the National Pharmacy Association says the products need clearer information and better checks on content.
CBD - cannabidiol - isn't marketed as medicinal cannabis. It doesn't have a psychoactive element that makes the user high.
Some studies indicate it can help with childhood epilepsy seizures, and other people think it helps them too.
Cannabidiol oil is being added to a range of products - from water, to chocolate, to make-up, tea and coffee.
Manufacturers claim sales in the UK are as much as Â£300m at the moment.
It's illegal to print any health claims on the products, but it's a grey area as to who checks the ingredients, or the amount of CBD oil actually contained in each product, many of which can be very expensive.
Jasmine Shah from the National Pharmacy Association, which represents hundreds of independent pharmacies, says an increasing number of pharmacists are stocking CBD products, despite the fact that she says ""at the moment there is very limited research on the safety and efficacy of these products"".
She says pharmacists would like ""clear authoritative guidance which makes it easy for healthcare professions, consumers and patients to make informed choices"".
CBD is classed as a food supplement, so it's governed by the Food Standards Agency.
Because it's a brand-new type of food there's a grace period, where it's allowed to be sold in stores, but the FSA has now asked manufacturers to give specific information about the product.
Manufacturers will have to include important scientific details like what it contains, purity levels, manufacturing practices, as well as providing detailed information to demonstrate it is safe for people to consume.
The FSA says that despite ample time and repeated requests to CBD manufacturers they've not heard enough from any company in this multimillion pound industry to give them authorisation yet.
That leaves those selling the product in a difficult position. Ms Shah doesn't think that selling CBD in pharmacies gives the products extra legitimacy.
She says ""It's for each pharmacist to decide whether its suitable to stock a CBD product or not, but in terms of the safety and efficacy of it more research is required.""
The Association for the Cannabinoid Industry is a new group representing around 20 CBD brands.
It says members are ""unequivocally committed to achieving Novel Foods status via the Food Standards Agency"".
But the FSA appears to be losing patience with the industry and said it expects ""companies to comply with the novel foods process, which includes submitting safety information about their products"".
""The FSA is considering the best way to ensure CBD food-related products currently on the market move towards compliance,"" it added.
In the meantime, customers buying any CBD product have no guarantees if the product is safe, or indeed if it contains any CBD oil at all."
"**For many businesses, becoming a viral hit is a dream scenario but what happens after you're no longer flavour of the week?**
Tiffany Fixter, 35, is the owner of Pizzability, a restaurant in Denver, Colorado, that is primarily staffed by disabled workers.
The pizzeria, which opened in the Cherry Creek district last December, became famous in July after she revealed that people were insulting the staff because of stigmas over disability.
Fixter told the BBC: ""Since the day we opened we have had people stop and stare at us and we've heard them saying awful things like 'this is where the retards work'.
""It was made clear we're not wanted. It's been hard, though, as the staff want to know why people are so mean.""
But when a local journalist reported on this, things took a sharp turn.
And from seeing just a handful of customers a day, the queues started to form. People came from all over the country and were willing to wait for up to four hours just to try the pizza.
""When we became viral we went from making $50 (Â£40) a day to $4,000 (Â£3,090) day. It was a real shock and I had to take on more staff, get more food in and really ramp everything up,"" says Fixter.
It was a strange time, as the new customers would get frustrated at the length of the queues, she says.
""I would ask people why they came and they said they saw us on the internet and they were here to help. Yet they would get upset at the fact they had to wait in line.""
But that peak lasted just two weeks.
And while the restaurant remains ""instafamous"", with people just checking in on social media or taking a picture to prove they made it to this hotspot, they're not buying anything.
Ms Fixter says: ""People come by still as they want to take selfies and they take pictures of the food and the site but they aren't coming for the full experience. They are not engaging with the staff.
""It was great to see the social media attention but we became a trend for those weeks. After that peak we went back to the way it was, and right now, we are barely covering our rent let alone staff costs.
""We had a guy come in the other day who took a selfie, ordered a pizza, cancelled it and left. Is it really that hard to order a $2 pizza?""
Fixter, a former special needs teacher, says the whole experience has been an education.
She deliberately set out to hire disabled people because she felt it was important to create a more inclusive society.
She says: ""It is a challenge though. Some people require more supervision for certain tasks [such as] chopping stuff up, so we do have to factor that in.
""Most of our staff members are deemed disabled and find it hard to find a job elsewhere."" But she says she has found ways of working with people who are blind or deaf, or have disabilities such as cerebral palsy, autism, or obsessive compulsive disorder.
Everything in the restaurant has been created to be accessible from the Braille labels on the fizzy drinks machine, to the weighted cutlery, to the sensory wall and the wide spaces for wheelchairs to easily move through.
And in 2016, Fixter set up America's first brewery staffed primarily by disabled people, Brewability. This was a success but for various reasons this year she also had to prepare to relaunch the brewery at a new Colorado location while dealing the situation at the pizzeria.
But, she stresses, the businesses are not ""a sob story"".
""We don't want people coming here out of pity. We want people to come because the food is good and the drink is good and because there is a need for a pizzeria and brewery that are accessible and give people an opportunity,"" she says.
On the day the BBC visited, while there was a quiet period in the morning where the staff kept themselves busy preparing pizzas and cleaning, a trickle of customers soon began.
Brittany Freyta came with her husband and daughter to mark her birthday.
""I'd never been here before. I thought it was a cool idea and I'd seen information about it being shared on Facebook. I think it's great they are giving people with disabilities a chance to feel included.""
After eating the pizza, she said she would definitely be returning as she'd really enjoyed her meal.
Beshear Randle, a regular customer at Brewability, donated furniture parts to Ms Fixter's business. He came by to taste the pizza and said: ""I like [that] she hires people with disabilities and gives them an opportunity to work. The pizza is also great.""
But while the food got a thumbs-up from customers on the day, even staff members share Fixter's concerns about the viability of the business.
Aaron Harris, who is autistic, bipolar and has ADHD, has been with the company since the pizzeria opened.
He said: ""I love making pizzas and having a stable job. But if nobody comes, I am concerned about what we will do next.""
But Fixter says she's not about to give up: ""It's been a tough year. I sold my house in Kansas City to help me achieve this dream.
""It's important to me to keep going and I will do. As much as I can."""

September is coming to an end and signs of autumn are everywhere. On everyone’s mind now is the question of what kind of winter to expect: bitter cold and white, or wet and mild?
The US weather agency NOAA has just put out its outlook for October and November. Its CFSv2 model foresees colder than normal temperatures for both October and November, from eastern Canada to Russia and from Africa to the Arctic.
Hat-tip: Schneefan.
Here’s the latest CFSv2 temperature anomaly outlook for October, via Meteociel:

Chart: Meteociel CFSv2
Of course we need to be wary when it comes to the accuracy of these long-term forecasts. Yet, October is right ahead and forecasters should at least have a pretty good idea of how the month will end up. For the time being the weather outlook for first 14 days does look to be on the cool side. But beyond October 15, things do get far more speculative.
Here’s the NOAA CFSv2 for November:

Chart: Meteociel CFSv2
Above for November see that the cold anomalies are projected to spread across Europe, which would mean an early winter start over Europe.

NAO and solar activity
Other reasons why Europe’s coming winter may be a cold one are North Atlantic patterns and solar activity. Europe’s winters are largely dependent on the prevailing North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Recently this index has swung to the negative mode. If this persists then, Europe likely will find itself shivering for awhile.

NAO currently negative. Chart: NOAA.
Looking at the NAO since 1950:

Chart: NOAA.
In the 1950s and 10960s, Europe experienced a number of harsh winters. Over the past 8 years, the NAO has been often very positive, meaning milder European winters, which has been the case for that period.
A number of studies have shown that the NAO tends to go negative in the wintertime during periods of low solar activity, which we are now experiencing. Read here, here and here.
Global warming causes both warm and cold!
But for the media and alarmists, if the NOAA projected temperature anomalies for the next two months had been projected to be warm, then manmade global warming would be to blame. And if the temperatures do in fact later come in below average, then that too will be because of global warming-induced weather pattern changes. Such is the “science” of global warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA long-term (50 years) study of a Great Barrier Reef (GBR) ecoystem finds corals may quickly recover from El Niño disturbances.
According to scientists (Yan et al., 2019), coral reef ecosystems thrive in centennial-scale warming phases such as the Medieval Warm Period and Current Warm Period, whereas they experience population declines (“switch-off” episodes) during cold periods (the Little Ice Age).

Indeed, corals prefer the warmest waters, which is why they predominantly live near the equator.

Popularized claims of a greater than 90% coral reef mortality after the 2015-’16 El Niño event are common in media circles (“93 Percent Of The Great Barrier Reef Is Practically Dead“).
Yet GBR expert Dr. Peter Ridd reports (at the 6:00 mark) that even the “extreme” estimate of reef deaths may not have exceeded 8%, and that corals “can actually recover from that within a year.”
Further, Ridd states that between 2011 and 2016, there was a 250% increase in coral cover in the southern GBR, and the abundance of corals in 2019 is no less than 1985.

In a new paper (Davis et al., 2019), scientists compare the growth (calcification) rates for corals observed in the 1970s at One Tree Island (Great Barrier Reef) to today.
Though it’s thought it may take about 9-12 years for corals to recover from El Niño disturbances (Guoezo et al., 2019), Davis and colleagues document a 400% increase in coral growth rates between 2014 and 2017, or before and after the “devastating” 2015-’16 El Niño event.
Furthermore, when comparing the 1970s to 2017, they find calcification rates were “comparable” for corals over the 50-year period.
Long-term observations would appear to offer necessary context to claims that climate change is igniting irreparable and unprecedented harm to coral ecosystems.

" Cher Alec,Très aimable de nous avoir écrit. Plusieurs de mes meilleurs amis en Alberta sont franco-canadiens. Moi aussi j’ai des amis au Québec, et j’y ai même travaillé dans le passé avec Claude Fournier et Marie-José Raymond. Curieusement, notre projet de scénario s’intitulait « Les cavaliers de la terre promise » – racontant la randonnée de la GRC dans l’Ouest pour y forger une nation, qui n’était qu’une idée à l’époque.C’était dans les années 1980, avant que l’Alberta n’ait acquis la réputation d’avoir du «pétrole sale». Comment est apparu ce sobriquet? Peut-être avez-vous entendu parler de la « campagne des sables bitumineux »? C’était un effort délibéré de verrouiller la troisième plus grande ressource pétrolière du monde et de garder un concurrent mondial, le Canada (via les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta et de la Saskatchewan), hors des marchés mondiaux.Jusqu’à présent, cela a été très efficace.Mais, vous ne savez probablement pas que le Québec y a joué un rôle de premier plan!En effet, à partir de 2009, la « Oak Foundation » suisse, basée en Amérique, l’un des partenaires de la fondation milliardaire « ClimateWorks », a octroyé $5milliards USD à la « Campagne mondiale pour l’action pour le climat » (GCCA www.tcktcktck.org ), basée à Montréal. Leur but était de « mobiliser l’opinion publique et revendications au Canada ». Les trois années suivantes, la Oak Foundation subventionna jusqu’à $2 million USD afin de faire pression sur les politiques, organisations et individus pour leur permettre d’agir sur le dossier du changement climatique.En 2010, la  « Sea Change Foundation », autre partenaire de ClimateWorks, injecta $4million USD dans la GCCA afin de « réduire la dépendance d’une énergie à haute teneur en carbone », « et le développement d’un programme. » Le but était de mobiliser le public via les syndicats et les groupes confessionnels afin d’influencer les traités internationaux sur le climat.On en arrive donc à environ $11.75 million USD déversés au Québec pour lutter contre des projets comme les sables bitumineux.Vous dites dans votre lettre: «Je comprends, vous êtes en colère.”Je ne peux pas parler au nom de tous les Albertains, mais en tant qu’amoureux du Québec et de ma propre province, la nausée me gagne quand je découvre le logo de la province du Québec sur le site Web “tcktcktck.org” de la GCCA, tout à côté du logo de la Fondation Oak… un portail de la province en direct au moment où j’ai pris cette capture d’écran !Ces bailleurs de fonds étrangers ont créé avec succès au Québec « Blockadia » des pipelines et ressources, bien avant que les Albertains aient la moindre idée de la campagne contre les sables bitumineux.Vous avez donc tort de dire que Trans Canada a tout gâché. Le Québec s’est radicalisé contre les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta via des saboteurs financés par des fonds étrangers depuis plus d’une décennie. Énergie Est était bien conçue ; des militants ont tout contrecarré, alléguant qu’une brasserie québécoise serait mise en danger, jusqu’à une professeure de Concordia qui, lors d’un groupe de discussion sur les sables bitumineux, éclata en sanglots, criant qu’elle ne pourrait jamais avoir d’enfants à cause des sables bitumineux de l’Alberta.Il est étonnant qu’elle n’ait pas pleuré sur la présence de raffineries et de pétrole étranger chez vous !The Grand Quebec Hypocrisy on Energy East, de Robert LymanObjectifs de Reduction des Emissions – Le Cas du Québec Nous-mêmes n’avions aucune idée de la gravité de la situation au Québec jusqu’à notre innocente campagne d’affichage en 2014. Nous nous concentrions sur les sciences du climat et leurs implications sur les politiques énergétiques.Et vlan ! Il apparut que mentionnner quelques faits scientifiques méritait une peine de prison ! J’ai analysé les thèmes contenus dans le fichier de plaintes que nous avons reçues du Ad Standards Council, et ai été surprise de la véhémente «frénésie convulsive» d’affirmations émotionnelles, si inattendu des franco-canadiens normalement rationnels que je connais – des gens qui adorent débattre des faits, pas les sentiments.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2766823Ce n’est que quelques années plus tard que les fonds mentionnés ci-dessus ont été portés à mon attention. Maintenant, tout cela a du sens, y compris la folle réaction de l’ACS.Et à propos de l’hydroélectricité que vous voulez vendre !Avant de critiquer les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta, où la réhabilitation des sols est loi, allons d’abord jeter un coup d’œil sur votre arrière-cour.  Carte de la baie JamesCentrale électrique principaleLa centrale électrique est encadrée en jaune, sur une carte du réservoir de 300 km de large Intégralité de la zone d’exploitation des sables bitumineuxEt voici l’ensemble de l’exploitation des sables bitumineux sur une carte de 300 km de largeD’après Norm Kalmanovitch, P.GeophComparons maintenant les empreintes respectives de la baie James et des sables bitumineux, chaque carte faisant 300 km de large.Voici à quoi ressemble la zone d’extraction des sables bitumineux lors de la remise en état, Alec. La baie James, elle, ne sera jamais récupérée. Source: https://www.syncrude.ca/environment/land-reclamation/our-progress/ Alec, vous dites «Keystone XL est à nouveau retardé aux États-Unis….»Non, pas du tout ! Keystone XL a été intentionnellement bloqué par la campagne contre les sables bitumineux. Les mêmes millions qui ont envahi le Québec pour radicaliser votre peuple contre le pétrole de l’Alberta et les sables bitumineux ont également financé « Blockadia au sud ».Alec, vous dites aussi: “et B.C. ne veut pas de l’extension TransMountain, qu’Ottawa a finalement décidé de nationaliser pour tenter de le compléter. ”Non ! La Colombie-Britannique a versé des millions de dollars à des organisations non gouvernementales de l’environnement – dont beaucoup d’organismes de bienfaisance subventionnés (!) – afin d’emprisonner le pétrole albertain.Vous dites que nous sommes en colère, Alec. Vous avez tout à fait raison !Nous sommes fâchés d’apprendre que le principal bloqueur de TransMountain, la Fondation David Suzuki, est financé par Power Corporation du Québec depuis 2007. Nous sommes vraiment sidérés de découvrir que la Caisse de dépôt et de placement du Québec était le deuxième actionnaire en importance de Kinder Morgan Canada. Qui a donc bénéficié de Blockadia et de l’achat ultérieur de TMX par le gouvernement fédéral?Ce qui nous rend furieux, c’est de découvrir que la Caisse de dépôt partage le lit d’Al Gore, ce type qui encourageait le Blockadia du pipeline TMX – un milliardaire qui applaudit à la perte d’emplois de centaines de milliers de Canadiens et aux suicides de ceux qui ne peuvent plus surmonter la perspective d’une ruine financière.Et maintenant vous nous dites que vous voulez vendre votre hydro aux autres provinces. On vous souhaite bonne chance!Nous savons que l’équipe du Manifeste LEAP, celle de Skoll and Gore, la famille Lewis-Klein et la bande Trottier «Acting on Climate» de McGill ont tous de grands espoirs d’avoir un réseau national éolien-hydroélectrique au Canada.Mais disons-le maintenant: ARRÊTEZ TOUT DE SUITE !C’est techniquement irréalisable, Alec. Il est insensé que des investisseurs idéologiques et éco-activistes financés par des fonds étrangers animent le programme énergétique au Canada – et le poursuivent vers la catastrophe.Nous avons interrogé des ingénieurs en production d’énergie à propos de cette idée de réseau éolien-hydroélectrique, qui, selon les LEAP, pourrait être facilement réalisée d’ici 2035.No chance, Alec. Here’s why.Aucune chance, Alec. Voici pourquoi.http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/09/29/power-generation-information-on-difficulties-of-instituting-the-proposed-wind-hydro-national-grid-network-in-acting-on-climate-change/https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/01/23/un-reseau-national-hybride-denergie-hydroelectrique-et-eolienne-le-plan-est-techniquement-irrealisable/?highlight=reseauNous n’en avons pas la certitude, mais soupçonnons, que depuis que les Amis de la science ont eu l’audace de dire aux Canadiens la vérité sur cette idée de production d’énergie, un groupe d’entre eux a tenté de nous faire emprisonner pour nos panneaux publicitaires.https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/12/03/news/breaking-ecojustice-files-complaint-competition-bureau-against-climate-denial-groupsEt quant aux objectifs de l’accord de Paris? Voulez-vous dire ceux qui sont principalement définis par la « World Resources Institute », collaborateur de « Generation Investment Management » d’Al Gore? Ceci ressemble beaucoup au bras public des milliardaires de « ClimateWorks » qui essaient de forcer le monde à adopter un système de « plafonnement et d’échange de charbone » mondial, et mettre leurs 12 trillions de dollars d’énergies renouvelables sur leurs intérêts propres sur le réseau…? Ce sont ces cibles dont vous parlez?ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165Nisbet https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.524Excusez-nous si nous trouvons tout cela un peu trop «commode» et semé de conflits d’intérêts. D’après les données scientifiques sur le climat, la planète se porte bien et le changement climatique n’est affecté que de façon nominale par les émissions humaines… (Mais de manière significative par les détournements importants d’eau comme la Baie James). Depuis 2013, le rapport du GIEC a clairement montré que le dioxyde de carbone n’était pas le « bouton de commande » du climat.  Et pour ce qui en est de la péréquation chez les Albertains, ce n’est pas le programme ou le transfert qui est si irritant. Nous sommes un pays confédéré, et le principe de cette confédération – comme dans le cas du chemin de fer Trans Canada il y a bien longtemps – était de faire en sorte que toutes les régions du pays puissent bénéficier des avantages naturels des richesses géographiques et des ressources… Nous, Albertains, «attendons» de pouvoir construire des pipelines à partir de nos bienfaits naturels des sables bitumineux vers les provinces qui possèdent les avantages naturels des ports océaniques. N’êtes-vous pas heureux de nous expédier sans question vos gallons de sirop d’érable ?Puisque nous avons partagé nos richesses d’environ 200 milliards de dollars de péréquation (2000-2014), cela ne semble pas être une attente déraisonnable…Vos excuses faiblardes, ça ne marche pas ! Surement pas avec moi. Et j’aime toujours le Québec et mes amis franco-canadiens, et bien plus que votre sirop !Je méprise ce que votre Blockadia, fondé par des étrangers, nous a infligé dans l’Ouest du Canada !Je suis également dégoutée de votre hypocrisie hautaine et condescendante envers une province meurtrie et ses citoyens. J’attends de lire si vous aurez la décence de publier ces constats et vérités que je vous ai indiqués dans ma lettre. Si c’est le cas, j’achèterai le premier tour de bière Big Rock.Big Rock…???And …”Is Abacus Data asking the right questions on Climate Change?”à plus tardMichellemedia@friendsofscience.org  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"TOPEKA, Kan.  —   Timothy Shahid and Joshua Kalina met, went drinking, became friends and then had a falling out that lead to the murder of one of the young men, all in a matter of hours. The victim’s mother, her life suddenly a disordered jumble marked by panic attacks and nightmares, decided to seek out her son’s killer to try to understand what had prompted an act of violence so baffling that even the gunman was at a loss.  With the aid of a restorative justice program, which brings together victims and those who have caused them harm, the two ultimately met  —   each seeking a way out of grief, fear and guilt. Here’s a look at Timothy, Joshua and Joshua’s mother as she becomes involved in the program. (In this related article, read about a meeting between the parents of a college student and the man convicted in the   accident that killed their son.) “I probably broke my mom’s heart when I told her that,” Timothy, now 30, said. “The road I was leading, I knew I was going to end up in one of those two places. ” At 14, Timothy and some other boys robbed a pawnshop, and he spent two years in a juvenile facility. By age 16, he was “religiously” carrying a gun that he sometimes used. He did not elaborate. “Hanging out with a group of kids gave me hope,” said Timothy, who was tormented by his adoption, and the parents he never knew. “I didn’t think my biological mother loved me. ” At the time of the shooting, Timothy was working at a telemarketing center. He spent his free hours smoking pot and drinking at least a pint of Hennessy a day. He customized the black 2005 Nissan Altima with special wheel rims, and was methodical about keeping the car looking pristine. Joshua grew up in Topeka with his mother, Judi Bergquist, and was especially close to his older brother. He liked to play practical jokes on those close to him. “He was so funny,” his mother said. He had severe attention deficit disorder and graduated from an alternative high school. Problems with social anxiety prompted him to wear a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap pulled low over his face. Ms. Bergquist said Joshua began hanging out with what she described as a “rougher” group of friends after graduating, so she sent him to Texas to live with her parents. He returned to Topeka about two years later and found work at a   service. But persistent money problems forced him to rely on his mother and grandmother. “The day he died, he called me in the late afternoon,” Ms. Bergquist said. “He was extremely upset because my mom had shut off his cellphone and he had a car payment to make. ” He’d screamed at her. A few hours later, she said Joshua drove slowly by her house but didn’t stop. It was the last time she saw him alive. Hours later, Timothy and Joshua met for the first time through a mutual friend. The two seemed to hit it off. “He didn’t come off as a person I couldn’t get along with. I was easy to get along with,” Timothy said. “I rode around with Josh in his car. ” But as the night of April 23, 2007, wore on, their easy conversation deteriorated into bickering, and the two argued loudly while drinking at a bar. “He said something about one of my friends, so I said something about one of his friends,” said Timothy, who called someone to pick him up. “We were going out the door at the same time, still arguing. I actually opened his car door and then I walk off. I just told him to get in the car. That’s when me and his friend, we’re arguing now . .. All I see was him pull out a weapon . .. I thought he had a gun. ” He fired eight times, and a friend of Timothy’s fired twice more before they fled, the police said. Joshua was left in the parking lot with four gunshot wounds in the chest, one in the left hip, two in the buttocks and three in the left hand. “My   was it was better him than me,” Timothy said. “I didn’t believe in fighting. I just pulled out my gun. I actually ran up to him when I shot him. I don’t blame alcohol. I knew what I was doing. I just saw something in his hand. ” Joshua was unarmed, police said Timothy’s accomplice was never arrested. During pretrial hearings, Timothy would see Ms. Bergquist in the courtroom, and at one court appearance, he taunted her. “I actually took her son’s photo, and held it up and turned around, and that’s when I laughed at her,” he said. Ms. Bergquist, suffering from memory loss and insomnia, panicked every time she saw a tall   man  —   the loose description of Timothy’s accomplice. “If I saw anybody with that vague description, I would just lose it,” she said. Finally, wanting to avoid a trial, Ms. Bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which Timothy would receive about 20 years. Timothy was impassive: “I didn’t care about life. ” “I knew that Timothy held the answers that I needed. I needed reassurance from Timothy that the other person was never going to bother me,” said Ms. Bergquist. “I needed to feel safe. At the same time, I needed to know if Timothy was working to change his life. I didn’t want this to happen to anyone else. ” The first step toward a meeting came after a prison official showed Timothy an article that Ms. Bergquist had written about Joshua. Ms. Bergquist also contacted Holly Chavez, the restorative justice coordinator at the Kansas Department of Corrections, and asked whether a    meeting would be possible. Timothy was also growing more introspective. He was reading the Bible as well as a book that included a passage that seemed written for him: “If you always do what you always did, you always get what you always got. ” The solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was. “I had a lot of time,” he said. “You got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own. It made me go back and look at the things in my life. I became Christian. I understood forgiveness  —   that I took a life that I can never give back. ” What follows is a discussion of the reactions of Timothy and Ms. Bergquist as they worked with Ms. Chavez toward a    encounter. The excerpts, which are from separate interviews that took place after the meeting, capture the thinking of those involved. Judi Bergquist, the victim’s mother Holly Chavez, the program coordinator The pivotal moment came when Ms. Bergquist acknowledged that she knew her son was flawed. Timothy, who killed Joshua Ms. Chavez Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist In April 2016, the two met again  —   this time at a victims’ awareness event at the prison in front of inmates. “She called me her friend,” Timothy said. “A woman forgiving her son’s killer and calling him her friend. And at the end, she got up and gave me a hug. You just don’t see that too often. ” (In this related article, Zachary Harrison struggles to understand why the parents of the man he killed want to meet him.) "

Extreme E – Formula E’s sister series – aims to highlight climate change in five remote locations as 12 cars go head-to-head in electric SUVs.



“Racing in incredible locations, raising awareness for climate change… what’s not to love,” said Chadwick.



Well, that is certainly going to save the planet!



Extreme E is an “environmentally focused racing series” and it has secured its first location at the Russell Glacier, in south-west Greenland, starting in February 2021. Drivers will race head-to-head over three days in each one of five locations, with routes designed within a 10km radius with natural obstacles in fully electric SUVs, which are capable of reaching 0-100 kph in 4.5 seconds. 



In order to reach the five locations, the series will have a ‘floating paddock’ which is estimated to reduce freight emissions by two-thirds compared with air travel.



This wonderful nod to the climate will still create evil “carbon emissions”, it will simply create a few less than flying, but more than staying home and not tripping off to remote exotic locations.



Are all the media covering this (supposing there are enough woke followers to require media coverage) going to travel by ship? No – they will fly! Their time is too valuable.



The former Royal Mail cargo ship RMS St Helena will undergo renovations, to become this ‘floating paddock’ and will host drivers, teams and their garages, as well as having a team of environmental experts on-board to study the environmental impact of climate change in each region.



As part of the agreement, race organisers must ensure that assessments are carried out with a local third party to safeguard the environment and the social impact. […]



Alongside racing, environmental experts from Cambridge University will join Extreme E, to conduct research **and restore areas affected by climate change.** Locations include the Arctic, the Himalayas, desert terrain, the Amazon rainforest and an island in the Indian Ocean. 



  
Oh well, that is alright then, roll out some experts to study these ‘fragile environments’ while the teams rip around the place in electric SUVs. Seems legit.



Testing begins in mid-2020, with the series starting in Greenland in February 2021.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





Last fall, I testified before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment at a hearing titled “A Rational Discussion of Climate Change: the Science, the Evidence, the Response” (http://​gop​.sci​ence​.house​.gov/​H​e​a​r​i​n​g​s​/​D​e​t​a​i​l​.​a​s​p​x​?​I​D=255). I was on a panel that included Benjamin Santer, Richard Alley, and Richard Feely (from left to right in the photo below).





My testimony had four primary objectives:



1) Demonstrate that the rate of greenhouse‐​related warming is clearly below the mean of climate forecasts from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which are based upon changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that are closest to what is actually being observed.



2) Demonstrate that the Finding of Endangerment from greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency is based upon a very dubious and critical assumption.



3) Demonstrate that the definition of science as a public good induces certain biases that substantially devalue efforts to synthesize science, such as those undertaken by the IPCC and the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP).



4) Demonstrate that there is substantial discontent with governmental and intergovernmental syntheses of climate change and with policies passed by this House of Representatives.



In this article, I want to discuss work surrounding Objective 1 (for those interested in the other three objectives, my testimony is available here in its entirety).



To meet this objective, I undertook an analysis in which I and my colleagues compared the current value of trends in global temperatures that have been observed over the past 5, 6, 7, … 15 years against the distribution of all trends of similar lengths projected by the group of climate models included in the IPCC _Fourth Assessment Report_.



My findings are summarized in Figure 1, which is the same figure I included in my written testimony and in my oral presentation. It shows that the observed rate of greenhouse‐​related warming (heavy blue line) is clearly below the mean of climate forecasts from the IPCC (bold dashed line running horizontally through the center of the plot). Additionally, it shows that the observed trends for several lengths are flirting with lower of the two 95% certainty bounds (bold solid black lines which define the upper and lower bounds of the shaded region) of the climate model projections — the range outside of which the observed trends fail to statistically fit into the family of model projections. In other words, the models are verging on failing to contain reality.





The methodology with which we approached this analysis produced such a strong and thorough test of climate model performance, that in the months immediately following my testimony, my colleagues and I formalized our work and submitted it to one of the scientific journals published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU), _Geophysical Research Letters_. After two rounds of review, our paper was rejected — the primary reason given was that we were too pessimistic in our conclusions about what our results revealed about climate model performance. To me, our results indicated a “cause for concern regarding the consistency between climate model projections and observed climate behavior under conditions of increasing anthropogenic greenhouse‐​gas emissions.”



However, our reviewers were less concerned. One reviewer, who identified himself to us as Tom Wigley of Climategate fame, suggested that the reason that the models were overpredicting the amount of observed warming was that other factors, which the models had not included (such as the decline in solar output over the past decade and the indirect effect of reflective aerosols), were to blame. Had these other factors been accounted for, there would, in fact, have been no real “cause for concern.” Thus our conclusion was unacceptable.



Our paper never got any further.



Recently I was alerted to a paper soon‐​to‐​be‐​published in the _Journal of Geophysical Research_ , another publication in the AGU stable. The lead author of this paper is none other than my co‐​panelist (with the no‐​longer‐​secret desire “to beat the crap out” of me) Ben Santer joined by a long list of co‐​authors, including Tom Wigley. In their paper, Santer and Wigley _et al._ set out to assess the consistency between observed trends and model projected trends, and they include this rather familiar‐​looking figure that I include as Figure 2. Apparently, Ben and Tom liked my approach enough to copy it!



Note that Santer and Wigley compare models to satellite‐​sensed temperatures. There are two versions that they use; “RSS” is the microwave sounding unit data analyzed by Remote Sensing Systems, a California consultancy, and “UAH” is University of Alabama‐​Huntsville, which has been the primary analysis point of the data since its first publication in 1990.





Despite same striking methodological similarities, there are some key differences.



1) Our analysis examined trends from length 5 to 15 years. Santer’s analysis examined trends from length 10 to 32 years. The reason they could include longer trends than we could, was that we limited our analysis — and this is important — _to the period of time in which the climate models were making true projections_ , which was post‐​2000. Santer _et al._ extended the period of record by splicing model hindcasts from 1979–2000 onto model projections from 2001–2010. During the hindcasting period, the folks who developed the various climate models had the observations available to them, and they could thus tinker with the myriad control knobs built into each climate model to insure that the models well‐​replicated reality. It would seem hardly fair to include this period in a test which is aimed at measuring the consistency between models and observations. After all, who fails a test with the answer key on their desk? But that concern seems to have escaped the reviewers (or was overridden).



2) In our analysis, we examined a period during which there were no volcanic eruptions (which can have a sizeable impact on decadal‐​scale trends) — either in the models or the observations — so that the recent observed warming (or lack thereof) could be compared, apples‐​to‐​apples, with model projections of that warming. In their analysis, Santer _et al._ included a period of time in which there were two major volcanic eruptions. An influence on these eruptions is to broaden the range of the collection of modeled trends (the yellow area in Figure 2), thereby making the mean of the observed trends (the blue and the red lines) look like they were better enveloped by the model projections. Had Santer _et al._ examined a period of time free from large volcanic eruptions, then the current lack of warming (which occurred during largely volcano‐​free conditions) would fall further out on the low tail of model trend projections and the consistency between the observations and the model projections would degrade.



3) In our analysis, we show the value of the current observed trend against the backdrop of the distribution of the collection of individual model trends (Figure 1). This is an apples‐​to‐​apples comparison. You can visually gauge the degree to which the current observed trend falls within the population of model projected trends. In their analysis (Figure 2), they plot the _mean_ of a collection of overlapping observed trends of a particular length derived from the period from 1979 through 2010 against a backdrop of the collection of _individual_ model trends. This is not apples‐​to‐​apples. And it is thus impossible to judge from this figure the level of correspondence between the observations and the models (although the authors a want you to believe that it is relatively close). In order to make this graphic useful, Santer _et al._ should have included the distribution of observed trends along with the mean — just as they did for the model output (the yellow area around the green line).



But, even given the problems with the Santer _et al._ analysis as presented in Figure 2, there is still an interesting message lurking within: _at all trends lengths over the past 32 years, the average observed rate of warming falls below the average of the climate model projected rate of warming, and as the trend gets longer, the discrepancy gets worse_.



The model average projected trend for the lower atmosphere is about 0.25°C/decade over all time scales (from 1979 through 2010) (green line in Figure 2). The various averages of the observed trends over the different time scales range from about 0.14 to 0.21°C/decade (data from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), red lines; data from the University of Alabama‐​Huntsville (UAH), blue line).



To me, this is cause for concern.



And I become even more concerned when I consider the _current_ behavior of the global temperatures (as I did in my paper), rather than the _mean_ behavior over the past 32 years (as examined by Santer _et al._ ). In Figure 3, I took the liberty to plot the current (through August 2011) trend in global temperatures for periods from 10 to 32 years against Santer _et al._ ‘s backdrop of model projections (as I previously mentioned, this is much closer to being apples‐​to‐​apples than how Santer _et al._ originally presented the Figure). The current observed trends are in the bold dashed lines (again, RSS, red; UAH, blue).





Several things of note:



1) At lengths of longer than about 20 years, the current value of the observed trends are very similar to the mean of the collection of overlapping trends of the same length calculated during the period 1979–2010. Bu that during periods less than 20 years, the current value of the observed trend falls beneath the mean value of the observed trend — and indication that the rate of global warming has slowed and the discrepancy with models projections has widened.



2) Even considering that Santer _et al._ ‘s model spread is too wide (as a result of the inclusion of volcanic variability) for the shorter time scales, the RSS observed data set indicates that the current trend of length 14 years is a) _negative_ , and b) _outside the 95% range of model projections_.



Santer and Wigley attempt to be re‐​assuring, telling us that, in fact, that there are a litany of reasons why the models predict too much warming:



Possible explanations for these results include the neglect of negative forcings in many of the CMIP-3 simulations of forced climate change …, omission of recent temporal changes in solar and volcanic forcing …, forcing discontinuities at the ‘splice points’ between [model] simulations of 20th and 21st century climate change …, model response errors, residual observational errors …, and an unusual manifestation of natural internal variability in the observations … 



One phrase begs for translation: we think “an unusual manifestation of natural internal variability in the observations” means “something that our climate models failed to predict.” And, we might add, what is so “unusual” about the lack of warming for the last fifteen‐​odd years? The same thing occurred in 1966–75, which means that Santer and Wigley feel their models would have failed then, too. That is, their model would have failed for 30 out of the last 45 years, which makes its reliability questionable. 



The funny thing is, is that in our paper, we also listed several reasons for the model/​observation discrepancy, including many of these same ones (we also threw in the possibility that model‐​based climate sensitivity was too large, a possibility that either escaped mentioned by Santer _et al._ , or was buried in their “model response errors”). But alas, our reviewers (including Wigely) would hear none of it.



For a bit of insight on how this happens, consult the Climategate emails, where Santer and Wigley (along with hockey‐​stick defender Michael Mann) discuss how to remove journal editors that committed the sin of publishing my papers. He who controls the journal, controls the message.



But, no matter how you spin it, or where the analysis appears, this fact remains: over the last three decades, the climate model projections offered up thus far, have been, and continue to be, sizeable overestimates of reality. Give me all the excuses that you want, but if the excuses are indeed real, then obviously they are important drivers of the climate systems and therefore must be considered when offering up future climate projections. Failing to do so, as we have seen, leads to failing forecasts. And until significant improvements are made in the models (improvements that may very well result in a determination of a lower climate sensitivity), I see no compelling reason why we should bank on existing climate model projections for the future state/​behavior of the climate.

"Napoleon’s Grand Army was defeated in the Battle of the Nations in 1813. The Emperor abdicated and was banished to Elba. But his army was not disarmed and destroyed by the victors – they rested.
Just 2 years later, Napoleon escaped and quickly re-mobilised his army. Only Wellington blocked his path to Brussels, at Waterloo.
After a fierce day of battle, a weary line of redcoats still held the ridge at Waterloo. But Napoleon’s Old Guard had been held in reserve for this decisive moment. Advancing like a spear, three columns wide, “The Invincibles” aimed to pierce the middle of the thin red line.
But a miracle occurred. Withering fire on both sides of the spear from the thin red line sapped their strength – Napoleon’s “Invincible” Old Guard broke and ran.
This was the critical point of that battle (and for the Climate War now). It is at the moment of defeat, with the enemy disorganised and demoralised, that the greatest gains can be made. Too often, however, the weary victors waste this opportunity to pursue and destroy the enemy.
Wellington’s exhausted army was incapable of pursuit, but a miracle occurred – General Blucher arrived at sundown with fresh Prussian troops. The avenging German lancers pursued, captured, disarmed and slaughtered the fleeing French all the way back to Paris. They captured Napoleon. Never again did the Grand Army threaten Europe.
In the global Climate Wars, Trump and Brexit have given us a victory of Waterloo dimensions. But this will be only a temporary setback for the Green Globalists unless they are now ruthlessly disarmed and de-funded. If we rest and relax, we will soon be ground under their green sandals again.
We must immediately deny them funds, tax shelters, manpower and legal support.
Not a cent more for climate conferences – send just one representative whose only power is to “vote no to everything”. Rescind or ignore past climate “agreements”, defund all UN/IPCC activities, remove all green energy subsidies and mandates and halve government funding of the ABC, BBC and all other GreenBC’s.
Subtract all “climate aid” from foreign aid budgets, divert all climate research funding to weather-proofing infrastructure, and replace green propaganda with hard science in education agendas.
Starved of public funding and propaganda, and with constant fire at their flanks with bullets of truth, the “invincible” green army will soon falter and run.
Chase them all the way back to Paris. Give them no rest until their infamous Grab for Global Power called the Paris Climate Treaty is rejected, never to rise again.

"**People have been stockpiling food, supermarket online delivery slots are full, items are restricted in stores and vulnerable people are being sent food parcels by the government.**
So what is being done to make sure people can get food?
A total of one-and-a-half million people in England have been identified as being extremely medically vulnerable.
The government has contacted 900,000 of these and has started distributing free weekly food parcels to those who have no family or friends to help them. This could eventually total more than 50,000 people.
The identical parcels contain essential supplies including pasta, cereal, fruit, tea bags, and toilet paper.
There have been concerns about healthy over-70s or people with other medical conditions not finding themselves eligible for these parcels.
A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are working quickly to support people who do not fall into the category of being clinically vulnerable, but still need help getting essential food supplies.""
In Wales, people who are extremely vulnerable will receive a letter from the country's chief medical officer. If nobody can help them get food, then from this week they can request a free weekly food box.
Detail on schemes being set up in Scotland and Northern Ireland are set to be announced in the coming days.
Branches of the main supermarkets have introduced policies to keep customers at a safe distance from one other.
These include having somebody on the door controlling customer numbers, and spacing out those queuing outside.
Inside, many supermarkets are providing hand sanitiser for customers and floor markers for till queues.
In addition, some are putting up screens between the cashiers and the public.
Other initiatives include **Tesco** introducing floor markings showing which direction to walk down the aisles in some of its larger stores. **Morrisons** has a queuing zone if there are too many customers to be separated by the floor markings, while **Asda** is bringing in directional barriers.
Empty shelves caused by panic buying led to the supermarkets imposing restrictions on how many of individual items customers could buy.
However, with stock levels improving, on Tuesday, Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda lifted some of the limits.
Sainsbury's will start to remove restrictions on some of its items from Sunday, while Tesco and Co-op are not changing their current restriction policies.
The supermarkets have introduced allotted times of the day when only the elderly, vulnerable and disabled, or NHS staff and other key workers, can shop.
Several food retailers are ""drastically cutting"" the range of products they sell. They are also telling manufacturers to stop making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand.
Meanwhile, Morrisons is launching a pre-order food box collection service for NHS staff.
This has been a sticking point for many people who, despite following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's request to stay at home and use online deliveries, find themselves unable to book slots.
**Tesco,** which last week limited online orders to 80 items only, has now expanded its home delivery and click-and-collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks.
It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet.
The supermarket has also suspended all fees on its Delivery Saver scheme until it can offer its full service again.
**Asda** is also recruiting more delivery drivers, while **Sainsbury's** has offered priority booking slots to more than 450,000 elderly and vulnerable customers.
**Morrisons** is creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, while **Waitrose** says it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers.
Rules have been relaxed by the government to allow supermarkets to work together.
They can now share resources like distribution depots, delivery vans and staff, and co-ordinate stock levels across the country.
Rules around drivers' hours have been eased and the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders, to speed up deliveries."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFrom 1993 to 2018, the satellite altimetry sea level changes reveal both positive and negative accelerations, align with oscillatory patterns, and are dominated by internal variability (e.g., PDO, ENSO). The “forced acceleration pattern” assumed to be associated with anthropogenic global warming “has not emerged”.

Image Source: Hamlington et al., 2020
Negative or negligible sea level accelerations both in recent years and in the long-term record.
For years scientists have been trying to detect an anthropogenic influence in sea level changes globe as manifested by an acceleration that rises out of the range of natural variability.
While there was an acceleration in sea level rise trends from 1993 to 2003, since 2004 negative accelerations (-0.08 mm/year²) have emerged in the global satellite record (Chen et al., 2014; Dean and Houston, 2013).

For the long-term trend, when cleared of multi-decadal oscillations, “there is no sign of acceleration” in sea level changes across the globe.
In the locations where the tide gauge record do evince acceleration, they are still “remarkably close to zero” (Boretti, 2020).

An anthropogenic fingerprint in post-1993 sea level changes still “too small” to be detected

The Pacific Ocean is where the largest sea level rise trends have emerged in recent years.
But even in locations where sea level rise is most pronounced, there have been positive as well as negative accelerations reminiscent of oscillatory patterns since the satellite altimetry era began in 1993.
Consequently, scientists (Palanisamy et al., 2015) have concluded that “an anthropogenic sea level fingerprint…is still too small to be observable by satellite altimetry” and the trend is “mainly due to internal variability“.

Image Source: Palanisamy et al., 2015
A new study (Hamlington et al., 2020) published last week in Geophysical Research Letters again affirms that recent sea level changes – including negative accelerations – indicate any trends in the 1993-2018 satellite altimetry era are dominated by internal variability (e.g., PDO, ENSO).
The authors suggest the forced acceleration assumed to be connected to anthropogenic climate change “has not emerged” yet.
Further, “most locations do not display a significant acceleration,” and for those locations where an acceleration is significant, it is still mostly due to internal variability.
Perhaps there will be a point in the future when scientists can declare an anthropogenic influence has been spotted in sea level changes.
For now, though, internal variability “masks” a potential attribution.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   




""Scientists look at the past response of the climate to natural factors like volcanoes to better understand how sensitive Earth's climate might be to the human impact of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations,"" said Mann. ""Our findings suggest that past studies using tree-ring data to infer this sensitivity have likely underestimated it.""



Fast forward to today.   
  
Appearing on-line in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ (and _sans_ press release) is a paper led by Penn State’s Martin Tingley that examined how the temperature response from volcanic inferred from tree-rings compared with that of observations. Tingley’s team concluded that tree-ring based temperature proxies _over_ estimated the temperature response caused by large volcanic eruptions. Instead of responding only to the cooler temperatures, the tree rings also included signals from reduced light availability (from the shading effect of volcanic aerosols) and the two effects together produced a signal greater than what would have been produced by cooler temperatures alone. This is basically the opposite of what Mann and colleagues concluded.   




In an article posted to the website RealClimate back in 2012 touting his team’s findings, Mann took time to point out the “wider implication” of his findings:   




Finally it is worth discussing the potential wider implication of these findings. Climate scientists use the past response of the climate to natural factors like volcanoes to better understand how sensitive Earth’s climate might be to the human impact of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, e.g. to estimate the equilibrium sensitivity of the climate to CO2 doubling i.e. the warming expected for an increase in radiative forcing equivalent to doubling of CO2 concentrations. Hegerl et al (2006) for example used comparisons during the pre-industrial of EBM simulations and proxy temperature reconstructions based entirely or partially on tree-ring data to estimate the equilibrium 2xCO2 climate sensitivity, arguing for a substantially lower 5%-95% range of 1.5–6.2C than found in several previous studies. The primary radiative forcing during the pre-industrial period, however, is that provided by volcanic forcing. Our findings therefore suggest that such studies, because of the underestimate of the response to volcanic forcing in the underlying data, may well have underestimated the true climate sensitivity.   
  
It will be interesting to see if accounting for the potential biases identified in this study leads to an upward revision in the estimated sensitivity range. Our study, in this regard, once again only puts forward a hypothesis. It will be up to other researchers, in further work, to assess the validity and potential implications of this hypothesis.



Based on the new results of Team Tingley, it seems that Mann’s hypothesis is wrong. Using tree ring temperature proxies would overestimate the climate sensitivity.   
  
“It will be interesting to see” if this is recognized over at RealClimate.   
  
But regardless, there is no escaping the fact that the Tingley study provides additional evidence that the earth’s climate sensitivity to human greenhouse gas emissions is likely less than advertised by the UN IPCC and the Obama Administration. The direct result being that headlong pursuit of carbon dioxide emissions limits should be reconsidered in light of this and other scientific literature.

It was the recent headline on _Whaleoil_ regurgitating JAG’s statement: [“Climate change is our generation’s WW2 moment”](https://www.thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/climate-change-our-wwii-moment/) that absolutely flabbergasted me.



Climate change is not our WW2 moment, **climate change is a con job**.



Our current climate and climate changes are all normal and well within the historical pattern of change: certainly over the last 10,000 years.



Unfortunately, despite efforts by logical critical thinkers, including those climate scientists who make the correct information available, the world believes otherwise. Sadly they have achieved little or no change in understanding, attitude, or most importantly, policy on the world stage. 



Everywhere we travelled in Europe and the UK over the last two months, most politicians, the media and people’s conversations espoused the predetermined definition, that climate change is accepted as a major risk and that it is mankind’s responsibility to remedy the situation. This deception is now what people accept, although they don’t necessarily believe or really understand it. But because of the indoctrination, it is now the underlying motive for all energy and environment policies that are the mainstay of most western and business-world views.



The main risk is not the climate, but the fallacy that globalist governments have created to gain financial power and control. Using climate pseudoscience, they have affected the foundations of our society: from energy to the environment; from industry to business and even our daily lives. The penalties imposed on us are expensive and completely unnecessary.



Ironically, I see from recent NASA data that the real **climate change risk** we face is **a shift to colder weather** , **** whilst all the globalists are warning us to be prepared for warmer conditions in future. The globalists are unlikely to change their story, even when we are shivering.



Besides being frustrated by the success of the deception, I am disappointed about the waste of time and money, and the opportunities lost. Think about the trillions wasted addressing a non-existent problem, whilst real problems, such as providing clean water, adequate sewage and a hand-up to lift the third world out of poverty, remain unsolved.



Even if people could identify all the bad science, manipulation of data, the creation of false and misleading reports and **deliberate amplification of fear** , it would do little to spread the truth and correct the story. The ‘deniers’ have failed to convince the ‘believers’ and have now successfully been labelled as ‘conspiracy theorists’ – Identity Politics 101.



The Left, however, wants far more. Its goal is totalitarianism: the total control of every aspect of human life, which they attempt to justify by instilling a religious fear of climate change.



It is important to understand that ‘a small group’ has managed to deceive the world into believing that a trace gas (0.04% of the total atmosphere) is changing the entire climate, and that group has convinced many others to participate in the deception!



The public might believe that deceiving so many people isn’t possible, but it has actually happened. Now, most governments including the New Zealand CoL and the National opposition believe it and act on this deceptive belief. 



Since the 1980s, nations have succumbed to the lies, misrepresentations, and pressure of the eco-bullies who have used the environment and later, “climate change”, to advance their political agenda. As with all such shifts, globalists then seized on it for the power and financial rewards it provided. Using the Socialist toolkit, they introduced their environment and climate change plans at the Earth Summit conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992; this was Agenda 21.



The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate plan that identified and demonised CO2 was designed and implemented at the national level in every nation throughout the world. This put the control of those countries almost completely in the hands of the globalists.



Now the Climate Action Plan is being imposed at the **local council level,** putting the plan of **thinking globally and acting locally** into practice.



Let us be frank, **this is a con trick to take power and control** , garner our hard-earned money by another form of ‘taxation’ and redistribute wealth (but definitely not for the poor). Our government banning offshore drilling at Taranaki was excused by many as only virtue signalling by the prime minister; however, in my opinion, she was carrying out the globalist plan. 



The massive cost of this anti-CO2 virtue-signalling is only possible because of the one thing that it demonises: fossil fuels. 



I think the idea is so attractive to all politicians who want to control us, because it goes under the cloak of ‘saving the planet’ so it fits the narrative. The only differences are in the degree and methods of implementation.



In this age of the big lie, our survival is more challenging than ever. It is important to influence your friends and local politicians before it is too late.

"LOS ANGELES  —   To understand how Andrew Garfield successfully made the leap from   to holy man, it’s helpful to know that when he was 8, his hero was Mahatma Gandhi. And that one of his life goals at the time was to seek out the schoolyard bully and envelop him in a warm embrace. “He was a brilliant terror, kind of like a ” Mr. Garfield recalled during an interview one warm night in the fall. “My first impulse was to give him a hug and a kiss and tell him he was all right, and that he didn’t have to behave that way. ” He paused, a few moments later adding, “Of course, I became his main target, because I saw him so deeply. ” After a few hours of conversation with Mr. Garfield about, among other things, celebrity toxicity, spiritual steadfastness, authentic living and God, it was evident that Mr. Garfield sees many things deeply. This attribute was integral to his landing starring roles in two meaty movies that are receiving awards attention this season. The first is Mel Gibson’s “Hacksaw Ridge,” about Desmond T. Doss, a   World War II hero, a   Adventist and conscientious objector who refused to carry weaponry the part has landed Mr. Garfield his second Golden Globe nomination. The other is Martin Scorsese’s   “Silence,” in which Mr. Garfield plays a   Jesuit priest, Sebastien Rodrigues, on a mission in hostile Japan. Both directors said Mr. Garfield possessed a moral conviction necessary for playing their protagonists, each of whom happen to be devout and forced to face down Japanese antagonists. Mr. Garfield, who is 33, said he could not have done “Hacksaw” were it not for the intensive preparation he underwent for “Silence. ” For the Scorsese film, which was produced first but released second, he spent a year under the tutelage of the Jesuit priest and author Father James Martin, praying, fasting, using a small rented West Village apartment as a   retreat and undergoing rigorous spiritual exercises. “I got not only a theological education, but a deep spiritually transformative experience,” Mr. Garfield said, his brown eyes blazing with the intensity of a tractor beam. Lithe and nimble  —   not for nothing was he    —   and as finely tuned as a whippet, Mr. Garfield came across as a friendly, engaged presence, with a crackling intelligence that Mr. Gibson described as “through the roof. ” “There’s something about fasting, about being empty enough to allow the spirit in, to hear and to listen and to be guided,” Mr. Garfield said. “To be with that silent void, that chaos in ourselves, that’s what the character goes through. He gets the most profound bliss and joy because he hangs in there with the void, with the seeming darkness. ” Mr. Garfield met to chat at the Sunset Marquis in West Hollywood, a spot arranged by his publicist even though Mr. Garfield was staying on the city’s east side he was in production for the coming noir thriller “Under the Silver Lake. ” The Marquis is deluxe  —   “through the breezeway and over the koi bridge” were a clerk’s directions to the restaurant  —   and couldn’t have been farther from the spartan surroundings Mr. Garfield put himself in to prepare for “Silence. ” That spiritual work, in turn, seems to have left Mr. Garfield ever more at odds with the Hollywood culture he has resisted even as his star has steadily risen. The night before, he’d attended the Governors Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ annual   gala. While Mr. Garfield said he marveled at the screened montages of the night’s honorary award winners, he was painfully aware of the constant inflation and deflation of egos, including his own. “It’s a really sick old Hollywood kind of patriarchal value system, based on commerce and money and who’s the hottest and who’s going to bring in the big bucks,” he said. “I’m not saying that an organization like the academy doesn’t acknowledge and honor talent it’s evident they do. But it coexists with the commerce aspect. Sometimes I feel the tail is wagging the dog. And I struggle with that. ” Of course, the reason Mr. Garfield is getting such plum parts is because he is ascending that hierarchy, despite himself. Born in Los Angeles to an English mum and an American father, Mr. Garfield was raised from toddlerhood in Surrey, England. His family was a loving one, he said, and his father was Jewish and resisted the notion that any one people were chosen. Mr. Garfield began acting as a child, working his way up from the theater to British television and then feature films. He came to international attention in 2010 for his lauded performances in “Never Let Me Go” and “The Social Network. ” But it was his casting as   for “The Amazing  ” (2012) and subsequent romance with his   Emma Stone, that catapulted him to a wider fame, which he knew was coming and dreaded when he took the Peter Parker role.   had always been Mr. Garfield’s favorite superhero, and he said he adored the character and couldn’t say no, even though being in such a spotlight made him cringe. “If I could have kept the mask on the whole time, it would have been better, because I don’t have interest in being known for a character,” Mr. Garfield said of his time as Spidey (he also starred in the 2014 sequel). “I have no interest in being known as a celebrity celebrity is a pretty disgusting word. It’s part of the brainwashing of the culture, part of the false idolatry of those that are only human, and I don’t want to participate in that. ” The paparazzi had other ideas, which Mr. Garfield pushed back against. When photographers caught him strolling New York’s streets with Ms. Stone, the pair hid their faces behind handwritten signs directing readers to charity websites. In 2015, when it was announced that another actor would be playing   Mr. Garfield found himself relieved: He wanted to continue working on himself as an actor, which isn’t easy in a franchise. “It’s a moneymaking exercise, and I don’t know if I’m criticizing that,” he said. “I’m trying not to judge that, all I knew is that I found it very painful to be a part of in that regard. ” But he had already been spreading his wings. In 2012, Mr. Garfield earned a Tony nomination for his performance as Biff in Broadway’s “Death of a Salesman,” starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and directed by Mike Nichols. Mr. Nichols became one of Mr. Garfield’s dearest mentors, and his death, along with Mr. Hoffman’s in 2014  —   “I’m so lucky I got to brush my soul against him every night,” Mr. Garfield said  —   left him lastingly bereft. The performance was recommended to Mr. Scorsese, who was finally getting a passion project three decades in the making off the ground. In 2013, while Mr. Garfield was in the middle of “The Amazing   2,” he found himself in Mr. Scorsese’s Upper West Side offices for an audition that would last three hours, and leave the director thrilled. “I felt the film come alive at that point,” Mr. Scorsese wrote in an email. “Andrew let me know right away that he had to go deep into the role and that it had to take time  —   he had to live it. ” This would involve intensive work with Father Martin, who, despite his initial wariness, ended up guiding Mr. Garfield through St. Ignatius Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises, which often mark the summit of a spiritual journey. “God drew him into the exercises immediately,” Father Martin said. “At one point, Marty said: ‘I’m sorry you won’t be with me in Taiwan. We won’t have an expert in Jesuit spirituality with us.’ And I said, ‘Yes, you will, you’ll have Andrew. ’” The production was in 2015, and shortly after Mr. Garfield returned, he read the script for “Hacksaw Ridge. ” It was positioned as a comeback for Mr. Gibson, who had been disgraced a decade earlier for drunkenly spewing   epithets. Mr. Garfield said he read the script, wept  —   Mr. Doss had   rescued 75 men from a brutal battleground in Japan  —   and that any hesitation he might have had vanished after he asked Mr. Gibson about the controversy  . “We talked about everything, all about that period in his life, and the years since, and his sobriety, and the work he’s done and the healing he’s done within himself, and those others that he consulted and hurt,” Mr. Garfield said. “He’s a very loving man, a crazy loyal man, sensitive and caretaking, and he’s not drinking, and it’s a really beautiful, beautiful thing. ” As for Mr. Gibson, he said Mr. Garfield filled every hope he had. “The pump was primed,” Mr. Gibson said over the phone. “This character needed to be profound down to the bootstraps of his soul. ” After a few months’ breather once filming wrapped, Mr. Garfield quickly went back to work and he’s also starring this year in a revival of “Angels in America” in the West End. But his very immediate future is being dictated by awards  —   his work in “Hacksaw” also landed a Screen Actors Guild award, and the Golden Globes are Sunday, Jan. 8  —   meaning he’ll be back on red carpets, schmoozing again, a reluctant cog in the Hollywood machine."
"Cosmic Cycles, not Carbon Dioxide, Control Climate

Those who think the political war on carbon will lower Earth’s temperature or keep climate stable need to study climate history.
Temperatures on Earth dance to a cyclic rhythm every hour, every day, every month, every season, every year, and to every beat of the sun-spot and glacial cycles.
The daily solar cycle causes continual changes in temperature for every spot on Earth. It produces the frosts at dawn, the mid-day heat and the cooling at sunset. It is regulated by rotation of the Earth.
Superimposed on the daily solar cycle is the monthly lunar cycle, driven by the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. These two cycles interact to produce variations in atmospheric pressure and tides, and currents in the oceans and the atmosphere. These are the daily weather makers.

The yearly seasonal cycle is caused as the tilted axis of Earth’s rotation affects the intensity of solar energy received by each hemisphere. This produces spring, summer, autumn and winter for every spot on Earth.
Then there is the 22 year sun-spot cycle, which correlates with cycles of floods and droughts. Sunspot cycles are indicators of solar activity which causes periods of global warming and cooling.
Original Research on Sunspots and Rainfall Cycles – Prof Will Alexander:
http://carbon-sense.com/2008/05/26/alexander-2008/
Variations on the sun also affect the intensity of cosmic rays reaching Earth’s surface – cosmic rays create nuclei for low level cloud formation, and the shading from such clouds reduces surface temperatures.
See:  http://www.globalwarming-sowhat.com/warm–cool-/cosmic-rays–clouds-0500.pdf
Earth’s climate is also disrupted periodically by the effects of changing winds, ocean hot spots and submarine volcanism that produce the El Nino Southern Oscillation.
The least recognised but most dangerous climate cycle is the glacial cycle. We are fortunate to live in the Holocene Epoch, the latest warm phase of the Pleistocene Ice Age. The climate history of the Holocene, and its predecessor the Eemian, are well documented in ice core logs and other records in the rocks. Each cycle consists of a glacial age of about 80,000 years followed by a warmer age of about 20,000 years, with the peak warming occurring over about 12,000 years. Our modern warm era commenced 12,000 years ago and peaked during the Medieval Warming, so it is probably nearing its end.
The Holocene Warmth as revealed by the Greenland Ice Cores:
http://carbon-sense.com/2009/10/03/climate-always-changing/
The Eemian Warm Period was warmer than today:
http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/news/news13/greenland-ice-cores-reveal-warm-climate-of-the-past/
There have been eight warm eras separated by long glacial winters over the last 800,000 years of the Pleistocene. In every beat of this cycle, the vast ice sheets melt, sea levels rise dramatically, coral reefs and coastal settlements are drowned, and forests and animals re-colonise the higher land released from the ice. Warm climate animals such as hippos, water buffaloes and elephants got as far north as Germany in the last warm era. Then suddenly the ice returned, covering the northern hemisphere as far south as Chicago and London, destroying the forests, lowering the seas, stranding the relocated coral reefs and eliminating unprepared species. (Some dopey grizzly bears got stranded in the Arctic Ice and the most enterprising of them survived to evolve into white grizzlies now called polar bears.)
How Grizzlies evolved into polar bears:
http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/arctic-bears-how-grizzlies-evolved-into-polar-bears/777/
This regular repetition of natural climate change is partially explained by the Milankovitch cycles relating to changes in Earth’s precession, orbit and tilt. These drive variations in solar energy received by Earth and have the greatest temperature effect on the large land masses of the Northern Hemisphere.
On an even longer time scale, oscillation of the solar system through the plane of the Galaxy seems to trigger magnetic reversals and violent spasms of volcanism, crustal movements, glaciation and species extinction. Earth is never still for long.
These cycles interact to produce a wide range of ever-changing temperatures. Even at the same moment, temperatures vary dramatically from the equator to the poles and from the surface to the stratosphere. For would-be climate “managers” to claim they can calculate a mythical “global temperature” with precision greater than thermometers can measure is statistical nonsense.
It is a wonder of the modern era that people who cannot accurately forecast next weekend’s weather claim they can regulate the temperature of the whole globe by bashing industry and taxing carbon.
What is the role of carbon dioxide in climate? Al Gore did a great job to dramatise the recurring glacial cycles in his widely acclaimed work of science fiction. But he missed two inconvenient truths.
First, ice cores show that in the glacial spring-time the temperature rose BEFORE the CO2 levels rose. Therefore the rising CO2 cannot be a CAUSE of the warming – it is a RESULT of CO2 being expelled from the warming oceans.
Second, at the top of every summer-time in the glacial cycle, the high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere were unable to prevent the cooling into the next cycle of ice.
We are already in the autumn of the current glacial cycle and nothing man can do will change that. Global temperatures today are lower than they were in Roman and Medieval times. They will still fluctuate with the effects of daily, lunar, yearly and sun-spot cycles, but the long-term trend of maximum and minimum temperatures will continue drifting downwards. Once summer temperatures in places like Siberia are unable to melt last winter’s snow, the already growing glaciers will join to form ice sheets and Earth will once again be gripped by another long Glacial Winter.
The transition from Greenhouse Earth to Icehouse Earth always occurs suddenly. Once our verdant greenhouse is gone, life on Earth will never be the same again. Greenhouse Earth will surely come around again, but many of today’s species will probably not survive to welcome the return of the warmth.
The warm days, seasons, years and epochs have never been a deadly threat to life on Earth. Frost, snow, hail and ice are the killers. If our descendants do not have the energy, resources and wisdom to keep their people warm and fed through the coming glacial epoch, humans may follow our Neanderthal cousins who perished in the last glacial winter, just 20,000 years ago.
There is NO evidence in climate history that carbon dioxide has a detectable effect on global temperatures. However if our continued use of cheap reliable hydro-carbon energy does slightly delay the onset of the next glacial winter, we and all life on Earth should count ourselves extremely lucky.

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



From _Kingsport News_ 12 December, 1974. 



This past week has seen the area of deep thinning cover just over f **ive million square km.** This time last year it was beyond **20 million square km** , although in 2017 it was just above **10 million sq km**. In other words, there is a good degree of variability from year to year. 



2018 was above average at 22.9km2. Conclusion – the experts have not got a clue about why it grows and shrinks. It appears the Montreal Protocol with the expensive re-gassing of air-con etc has had little to do with year to year fluctuations.

"The 21 st Birthday Party in Paris – It’s Time they Grew Up
Global Warming Alarmists are about to gather in Paris for the biggest climate carnival in their 21 year history – they hoped to see 25,000 official guests and 15,000 hangers on. Surely on their 21st birthday it is time they grew up and faced some adult world problems.
Any urchin on the streets of Paris today could tell buffoons like Ban Ki-moon and Barack Obama that the “biggest security threat facing the world today” is NOT a miniscule increase in atmospheric plant food, caused mainly by gentle natural global warming which has triggered minor expulsion of carbon dioxide from the oceans.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).



One of the repeating nightmares about global warming is that the current very pokey rate of sea level rise will suddenly accelerate. Now, it turns out that multiple lines of evidence say this has not happened and isn’t likely to, either.



Recently, _Science_ magazine reported that glacial flow in Greenland has not been accelerating as fast as previously reported (Moon et al., 2012). The major implication is that the contribution of ice loss from Greenland to global sea level rise is not increasing at the rate once expected. Now, _Geophysical Research Letters_ (GRL) reports that glacier loss in the Russian high Arctic is contributing about 0.025 mm of sea level rise per year, but that contribution has likely been largely unchanged for at least 30 years (Moholdt et al., 2012). More from GRL (Levitus et al., 2012) is that the rate of increase in the ocean’s heat content—which raises sea level—has recently slowed. And finally, from a soon‐​to‐​be‐​published paper in GRL comes word that the net _non‐​climate_ contributions of human activity to sea level rise have been speeding up (Wada et al., 2012).



Here, I’ll tie them all together and tell you what they mean.



I’ll focus on the Wada et al. (2012) paper because from the results presented there, we can derive the global implications of all the others.



Wada and colleagues, in a paper titled “Past and future contribution of global groundwater depletion to sea‐​level rise,” examine how much human removal of water from deep aquifers (for irrigation, etc.), also known as “dewatering” of the continents—water that eventually finds it way into the sea—has contributed to observed sea level rise from 1900 through 2000, as well as how much it may contribute in the future (through 2100). 



I have discussed previous work from Yoshihide Wada (https://​www​.cato​.org/​t​h​e​-​c​u​r​r​e​n​t​-​w​i​s​d​om-2/) and there has been a complimentary analysis done by Leonard Konikow of the U.S. Geological Survey (see here for details, http://​www​.mas​ter​re​source​.org/​2​0​1​1​/​0​9​/​r​a​p​i​d​-​s​e​a​-​l​e​v​e​l​-​r​i​s​e​-​n​a​t​u​r​e-no/ ).  
The take‐​home message from those articles was that the “dewatering” was adding a significant, growing, but often overlooked, input of water to the global oceans and was responsible for a non‐​negligible amount of sea level rise.



In fact, between the Wada and Konikow calculations, the contribution was estimated to range from 15 percent to 25 percent of the current rate of sea level rise, which stands at about 2.5 mm/​year (a rate which has been declining in recent decades, see here http://​sealev​el​.col​orado​.edu/).



You would think that a factor contributing such a substantial proportion to current sea level rise wouldn’t be overlooked, after all, the media hyperventilated last week when a report came out about the potential speedup of glaciers in Antarctica which currently contribute ~0.25 mm/​year of sea level rise—a value about half the current groundwater depletion contribution.



In what is becoming a depressingly repetitive pattern, “big science” assessments of climate change, like those made by our government, or those of the United Nations, simply ignore legitimate findings that don’t fit with the established (end of the world) meme. 



According to Wada et al. (2012) “[i]n the IPCC fourth assessment report, the contribution of non‐​frozen terrestrial waters to sea‐​level variation is not included due to its perceived uncertainty and assumption that negative contributions such as dam impoundment compensate for positive contributions (mainly from groundwater depletion).” This situation is drastically changing. Wada et al. continue “However, recent work on global groundwater depletion [Wada et al., 2010; Konikow, 2011] suggests a rapid increase of this positive contribution to sea‐​level rise during the last decade that warrants a re‐​appraisal of the contribution of terrestrial water and in particular groundwater depletion to projected 21st century sea‐​level change.”



As indicated in the quote above, human activity contributes to changes in sea level in two ways besides any impact from climate change. The first is through the pumping of water from aquifers at a rate greater than is the replenishment rate, and the second is through water impoundment—that is, building dams to hold water than normally would have been in the ocean. The former acts to increase sea level, the latter acts to decrease it. But, the contribution from impoundment is a one‐​off deal for each dam because once it is built and the reservoir filled, the water then flows through as before. The contribution, however, from deep aquifer pumping is on‐​going.



Wada and colleagues derive a long‐​term record, extending back to 1900, of both impoundment and dewatering on a global level, and make projections as to the future course of these two processes across the 21st century (Figure 1). The dark blue line which peaks in the 1960s and 1970s is the annual contribution to sea level rise from water impoundments (in Figure 1, the sign is flipped for this process), the light blue area is the annual contribution (including estimate uncertainty) to global sea level from dewatering. The grey line in Figure 1 is the combination of two (plus some other minor elements) which represent the net change in global sea level annually supplied by human activity not associated with significant climate change.









Figure 1. History of the estimated and projected annual contribution of terrestrial water storage change to global sea‐​level over the period 1900–2100 (figure from Wada et al., 2012).



Notice in Figure 1 that the grey line (the net contribution) rises above zero in the early 1980s—meaning that since then, human activity has been putting more water in the ocean than we are holding back. Also notice that our net positive contribution to sea level rise has been rapidly rising since then.



Consider the above in light of the one of the favorite climate change alarmist talking points—that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating and instead of perhaps a foot of sea level rise by century’s end, we should be expecting 3 feet or more.



Let’s look at the data. Figure 2 shows the latest‐​greatest sea level rise history as assembled by John Church and colleagues (Church and White, 2011; red line) along with the same thing once we remove net human contribution from impoundment and dewatering (blue line). Notice that the shapes of the two curves are a bit different after about 1950 (when the direct human contribution starts to be significant—see Figure 1). The red curve (total sea level) appears to be slightly cupped upwards (that is, accelerating), while the blue curve (sea level less direct human contribution) appears more linear (i.e., constant).









Figure 2. Observed change in sea level, 1900–2010. Raw sea level values (red); sea level after removing contribution from impoundments and continental dewatering (blue) (data from Church and White, 2011; Wada et al., 2012).



Figure 3 shows the running 10‐​yr trend through each of the two datasets, beginning with data in 1950. The red curve (which is the raw sea level data) shows an upward trend (again, indicating an acceleration in the rate of sea level rise), with the highest values at the end of the curve. On the other hand, the blue curve (which is the raw sea level less the direct human contribution), shows no such upwards trend (indicating that no acceleration) and the current rate of sea level rise (right‐​hand end of the curve) is neither the highest, nor far from being unique.









Figure 3. 10‐​yr moving linear trend through the raw sea level values (red), and the sea level after removing the contribution from impoundments and continental dewatering (blue), 1960–2009 (data from Church and White, 2011; Wada et al., 2012).



What this means is that the apparent acceleration in the rate of sea level rise has been caused solely by the changes in the direct contribution from human activity (which continues to increase) _and not by climate change_.



This makes perfect sense given the other papers I listed at the beginning of the article, which indicate modest increases from the world’s glacial fields along with a modest decrease in the rate of thermal expansion as the build‐​up of heat content in the oceans slows, reflecting the hiatus in global temperature rise that began over 15 years ago. 



So much for another alarmist talking point. This one simply doesn’t hold water.

"Speech to the Senate
 Carbon Farming Initiative Bill
 2nd Reading
Parliament House, Canberra
 31 October, 2014
Bob Day AO
 Senator for South Australia
Thank you Mr President.
This year the world will enjoy its greatest grain crop on record. Let me say that again. This year the world will enjoy its greatest grain crop on record. After the world food security crisis of 2007 which saw civil unrest in some countries, it is fantastic to see that in just 7 years we are producing record amounts of food for a growing world population. The US Department of Agriculture recently raised global crop predictions for corn, soy and wheat. Yet the World Bank indicates that over the last 10 reporting years, the percentage of agricultural land worldwide has not changed.
So what is driving this world food production boom?
Mr President, plants are thriving on the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A recent study showed that climate modellers over-estimated the amount of carbon dioxide that would remain in the atmosphere. Lo and behold, they have now discovered that plants are soaking up the additional carbon dioxide and growing more vigorously. Plants and trees and crops will absorb 130 billion tonnes more carbon dioxide this century than expected. It’s called the ‘carbon dioxide fertilisation effect’. This is not just a benefit to food crops- it is a boon to native vegetation, from the ancient forests to desert scrub that environmental activists have been trying to preserve for decades. Then there is the latest science on how the oceans are absorbing carbon dioxide with plankton growing faster than previously thought.
So why is this Government spending billions of dollars to reduce this airborne saviour of vegetation and food crops?
I am stunned by the number of politicians who are either ignorant or wilfully misleading the public on this topic. A whole political industry has developed around new arcane language to describe what we have known for centuries about producing food and improving our environment. A whole false economy has developed, fuelled by taxpayer funding through an Emissions Reduction Fund, An Emissions Trading Scheme, Renewable Energy Targets, The Renewable Energy Agency, The Climate Change Authority, Climate Change Departments and more. This Bill seeks to subsidise activities because they have so-called ‘co-benefits’ – well, if there are benefits in activities that also arguably help the environment, people should be doing them anyway without massive taxpayer subsidies – just as landfill operators have been doing – and I commend them for doing so over the years – in capturing gas emissions from landfills, until the rent seeking, carpet-bagging, bootlegging crony capitalists jumped on the climate change bandwagon to suck money from the taxpayer.
With the carbon tax, families felt and could clearly see for the first time the direct impact on their personal budgets from spending money to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This Emissions Reduction Fund is no different, but by sleight of hand people will be less able to see how their taxes will need to stay higher than they should be in order to pay for this scheme.
Taking money from low-income families and spending it on dodgy activities with a spurious scientific basis punishes the poor, rewards the rent-seekers and churns money in taxes, grants and rebates.
Mr President, Australia can not afford this Emissions Reduction Fund during what the Government has told us is a budget emergency.
While many families struggle with the cost of living, while mums and dads struggle to find jobs to make ends meet, the Government spends their money appeasing high-income elites enthralled by this latest cause and championed by celebrities, self-promoting ‘experts’ and certain elements of the media.
Rent-seekers like wind tower companies and solar panel manufacturers get paid handsomely and advocates in the climate change industry are living very nicely off the system flying around in private jets irrespective of whether these schemes improve the environment or human living conditions.
$2.5bn of taxpayers money spent on reducing carbon dioxide to stop so-called global warming while Arctic and Antarctic sea ice is growing. Growing, not shrinking. It’s bizarre!
I am dismayed that honest, intelligent people in this place can sit mute and watch this blatant trashing of both science and economics.
Mr President, I have a science background but any high school student can tell you that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. CO2 in the atmosphere is not pollution!
Now I know there are colleagues in this chamber who agree with me on all this but feel they must toe a party line but I for one am not so constrained and perhaps I speak for them also in saying that I will not sit mute and support this nonsense.
Minister Cormann told this place just two days ago, and I quote:
“Coal is good. Coal is good. It is at the heart of our economic prosperity here in Australia and around the world. It has helped lift living standards for people right across the world. It will continue to help lift living standards around the world.”
If that is so, if colleagues believe in all good conscience that this Bill is wrong, then I urge them to speak up – don’t be scientific girly men!
I oppose the Bill.

There was no ice cover in the Western Arctic for about 2 to 5 months of the year during the Little Ice Age (1500s-1700s C.E.).
Since 1800, the Western Arctic has only been free of ice cover for less than 1 month of the year.

"WASHINGTON  —   Smartphone users in Russia can no longer download the LinkedIn app on iPhone or Android devices, following a similar move in China to block The New York Times app on iPhones. The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation’s borders. The action is the equivalent of a nation banning “Catcher in The Rye” and then forcing booksellers to remove the title from their shelves. It puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens. When LinkedIn’s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps. Direct blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia, Turkey and several other nations for years, usually through their   internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle. “Apps are the new choke point of free expression,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America. Increasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country’s internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was “disappointed” with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores. “It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,” said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates. More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its   founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request. Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet. “Internet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes,” said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. “It appears to be a   ratchet with speech control getting tighter. ” LinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation. Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment. The action came at a tense moment in   States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in a declassified report released on Friday that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign."

With the recent revelations of a prominent scientist using dirty tricks against global‐​warming skeptics, the overheated climate debate has taken another ugly turn. Worse, the scandal reveals that our children’s minds may be the newest battleground in the unending global warming war.



The scandal revolves around the unauthorized publication of internal documents from the Heartland Institute, an organization in the forefront of global‐​warming skepticism. Among the items exposed was a plan to create a K-12 curriculum casting doubt on the “consensus” that global warming is real, man‐​made, and dangerous. Indeed, the most damning document — which Heartland maintains is fake while confirming the authenticity of the others — says the lessons are aimed at “dissuading teachers from teaching science.”



The scandal doesn’t end with publication of the documents, or the possibility that one is a forged fraud, however. It is how Peter Gleick — hydroclimatologist, president of the Pacific Institute, and admitted deceiver — obtained some of them: by assuming the identity of a Heartland board member.



“In a serious lapse of… judgment and ethics,” Gleick stated on his _Huffington Post_ blog, “I solicited and received additional materials directly from the Heartland Institute under someone else’s name.”



This is hardly the only behavior in the climate debate jarringly inconsistent with the image of scientists as even‐​handed truth‐​seekers who simply analyze facts and report objective conclusions.



A couple of years ago a similar act of legerdemain — publication of a purloined trove of emails from climate‐​change believers — produced considerable evidence that the discussants had tried to strong‐​arm scientific journals into blackballing anyone who cast doubts on their views. “Climategate” was like getting a rancid pizza from a guy with the flu — both the delivery method, and what was delivered, made you sick.



All this illustrates why everyone — no matter where they fall on climate change — should be greatly concerned about mixing global warming with public schools. It reveals both how contentious the issue is, and how subject scientists — like all people — are to uncertainty and selfishness.



The shear contentiousness of the issue is a mammoth problem because public schools — institutions that diverse people are all forced to support — can’t handle it. Trying to teach hot‐​button issues usually creates, first, highly divisive conflict, and then barren curricula.



The battle over evolution is illustrative. The debate over the teaching human origins kicked off at least as far back as the famous Scopes “Monkey” trial of 1925, and it still tears communities apart today.



And what’s kept what peace we have? Avoiding the topic, as a recent survey of high school biology teachers found. Roughly 60 percent of teachers reported that they gloss over or skip evolution — even if state standards require it — because of the conflict they fear would result.



But what if one view could be imposed on all kids, without rancor or watering down?



That’s even more troubling. The main purpose of science is to tackle matters we do not fully understand. To teach that there is only one right view on such matters, then, is inimical to this purpose. It is also extremely dangerous, taking everyone down darkened paths, eliminating alternate routes, and leaving no options for escape if what’s “right” turns out to be wrong.



Finally, we see in these scandals that scientists will sometimes stoop to trickery and bullying rather than rely on the power of their evidence. It’s because they are human. If you invest huge amounts of your time and reputation into an idea you will fight to defend it, both because you think you are right, and for your advancement.



What is the best defense against basic, human self‐​interest? Not handing anyone all the levers of power.



In the case of education, that means moving away from a system of schooling controlled by government, and towards parental choice and educator freedom. It means enabling all to access a curriculum that’s coherent because it’s not a compromise. It means making ideas compete, and giving no one special access to children’s minds.



People on all sides of the global‐​warming debate will take issue with this, insisting that it would be wrong not to make all children learn their, often biased, “truth.” But climate change isn’t scientifically settled, and even if it were, most public schools still wouldn’t touch it. Only school choice overcomes these myriad, treacherous problems.

"**Food banks say they have a shortage of basic items because shoppers are stockpiling as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus.**
London food bank Sufra, which donates 9,540 parcels annually, says the likes of pasta and rice are hard to get.
A food bank in Bedfordshire has warned stockpiling ""will hit the vulnerable"".
In Coventry, one food bank said supplies have ""never been so low"" and in Billingham donations have dropped considerably in recent days.
Food bank charity The Trussell Trust said it hoped the ""generous public"" would continue donating.
""We're working with our network on how best to support people as the situation unfolds,"" it said.
The North Paddington Foodbank (NPF) in London said its donations were down by 25% meaning it had to spend an additional Â£200 per week to top up supplies.
But manager James Quayle said finding supplies has been difficult.
""The items we are trying to purchase may not be available [from supermarkets],"" he said.
""We've been hit quite hard by it to be honest.""
In Coventry, the Queen's Road Baptist Church Food Bank, which has been operating for a decade, usually helps up to 4,000 people each year.
Although now is traditionally a quieter time for donations, contingency plans are in place, in the event the virus takes hold.
But Graham Carpmail, from the bank, said his fridge is all but empty and supplies have diminished.
""I've never been so low with what we've got to give people,"" he added.
On Teesside, the Billingham and Stockton Borough Food Bank said donations had dropped.
""I think we're lower on stock because people have started to stockpile and so don't give as much,"" Jill Coyle, from the bank, said.
""We put [long-life] milk in every bag and we are low. Likewise with juice and squash.
""Sugar and coffee are the other things everybody wants. Coffee is a bit more expensive so we get less of it donated.
""Shops don't donate food as such, but have a basket at the end of the tills so people can shop and donate an item. It's that collection that's been lower.""
Back in Paddington, King Anthony Sarkar, a regular food bank user, said he could not manage without it.
""Tinned foods, rice and pasta, everything here makes a meal,"" he said. ""You get a meal all the time.""
Mr Quayle said he was concerned they could have to close their doors and run a delivery service only to those in greatest need.
His experience was echoed by Rajesh Makwana, from the Sufra food bank in north-west London, who said 40% of its users are refugees or asylum seekers who rely on the food banks as they are not allowed to work.
It has put out an emergency appeal for donations after receiving fewer items from its collection points at schools, churches and local small businesses.
Mr Makwana said they have struggled to buy staple items from their normal outlets as supermarkets ran out of these cheaper items.
""The families we support simply can't afford to panic buy and hoard food, they're already knocking on our door in search of basic supplies,"" he said.
Mr Makwana said the charity had now started rationing things like pasta and toiletries.
Like NPF, Sufra is also looking at running a delivery-only service in order to protect volunteers from cross-contamination.
""We want to provide a service but we're struggling on so many fronts,"" he added.
The Parson Cross Initiative in Sheffield is planning for a fall off in donations in the coming weeks.
The food bank said it was also taking precautions by issuing ""grab bags"" from next week in a bid to cut down on person-to-person contact.
Normally, people can have a snack and a drink while they wait.
The Felix Project in Enfield, London, which collects just-in-date and surplus food from supermarkets and restaurants to distribute to 330 charities and schools, said its warehouses were now short.
""Everyone is scaling back and we've seen a significant drop. It is worrying,"" Damian Conrad said.
He was especially concerned for his schools which have a high percentage of pupils relying on a school dinner as their main meal.
The Oasis Project in Plymouth is almost empty and has seen a run on its meat, fruit juices and tinned tomatoes.
Eunice Halliday said: ""If more people self-isolate and only get statutory sick pay, that's likely to lead to an increase in people needing the food bank."""
"WASHINGTON  —   The Obama administration has blacklisted five Russians, including the government’s chief public investigator, who is a close aide to President Vladimir V. Putin, for human rights abuses, laying down a marker for   Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before he takes office with a vow to thaw relations with Russia. The sanctions, announced Monday by the Treasury Department, are not related to allegations of Russian hacking during the presidential election, according to a senior administration official. But they carry symbolic weight at a charged moment, as likely the last visible act the United States will take against Russia before power is transferred in Washington. The biggest name added to the list is that of Aleksandr I. Bastrykin, who reports directly to Mr. Putin and has carried out political investigations on his behalf. Mr. Bastrykin, officials said, was complicit in the case of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in detention in murky circumstances in November 2009 and for whom the Magnitsky Act was named. Under that 2012 law, passed by Congress with Democratic and Republican support, the Treasury and Justice Departments must investigate and penalize Russian individuals involved in that case and subsequent   or in other human rights abuses. The Obama administration has now put 44 people on the list. The sanctions announced Monday include a ban on travel to the United States and a freezing of any assets held by or transactions with American financial institutions. The White House has enforced the law with varying degrees of enthusiasm, depending on relations between the United States and Russia. In late 2013, human rights activists said, it delayed releasing the list because it worried that the move  —   coming just before the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia  —   would further curdle relations. But the administration’s final list, particularly with the inclusion of Mr. Bastrykin, is considered robust. “The mood and atmosphere are very different this year,” said David J. Kramer, the senior director for human rights and democracy at the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a policy research center. “Adding a few more names to the sanctions list sends a couple of signals,” Mr. Kramer said. “That this administration, as it goes out the door, is still going to implement the Magnitsky Act. It’s also sending a signal to the next administration that it hopes it will continue this policy. ” Shortly after the law was passed, Russia’s Parliament banned the adoption of Russian children by Americans. In 2013, Russia released a list of Americans barred from traveling to Russia because of what it claimed were human rights violations. Late last year, Congress passed legislation that would impose sanctions on people anywhere in the world for the kinds of human rights abuses that surfaced in the Magnitsky case. Much to the frustration of the Russian government, the bill again bore his name. In December, the Treasury Department put sanctions on 15 Russian individuals and companies for their dealings in Crimea and Ukraine. Mr. Trump is widely expected to ease that campaign. On Monday, Kellyanne Conway, one of his top advisers, said Mr. Trump might also relax the sanctions imposed by Mr. Obama in response to the hacking, which include travel bans and financial restrictions on senior Russian intelligence officials. “I predict that President Trump will want to make sure that our actions are proportionate to what occurred, based on what we know,” she said in an interview with USA Today. It will be harder for him to ignore the requirements of the Magnitsky Act, but the administration has considerable flexibility in how aggressively it pursues people. “The bureaucracy will grind away and produce more names, but senior people have the final say,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia. In addition to Mr. Bastrykin, the administration is targeting Andrei K. Lugovoi and Dmitri V. Kovtun, two Russian intelligence officers who the British authorities said poisoned a fellow Russian spy, Alexander V. Litvinenko, in London in 2006. Also added to the list are Stanislav Gordievsky and Gennady Plaksin, two   officials, who the United States said were involved in the   of Mr. Magnitsky’s death."
"WASHINGTON  —   Russian warplanes have carried out airstrikes to support Turkey’s offensive in northern Syria against the Islamic State, an important evolution in a budding   partnership. The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syria’s ultimate fate. The air missions, which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab, represent the Kremlin’s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group. The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey, a NATO member, as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa, the Islamic State’s   capital. The Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015, when a Turkish   fighter jet shot down a Russian   attack plane that had violated Turkey’s airspace. Russia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a   in Syria  —   one that does not involve the United States. At the same time, ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y. P. G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in Syria. Some analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern Syria to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region. In return, the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar   of Syria, who, with Russian help, is strengthening his hold on the country’s major cities to the south. “The   rapprochement is largely tactical,” said James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. “Russia can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern Syria if it does not threaten the Assad regime. And it allows Russia to exploit the U. S. shift to Turkey’s rival, the Y. P. G. by providing air support to the Turks against the Islamic State, which the U. S. inexplicably is not providing. ”   Donald J. Trump has spoken positively, though in vague terms, about the possibility of cooperating with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But the Obama administration’s efforts to forge a common political and military strategy with the Kremlin on Syria collapsed after Russia supported Syrian forces and   fighters with its air power in the brutal retaking of Aleppo. Turkey began the operation at Al Bab, east of Aleppo, without coordinating with the United States and without the benefit of American airstrikes. “This is something that they’ve decided to do independently,” Col. John Dorrian, the spokesman for the   operation against the Islamic State, said in November. Turkey appeared to have assumed that it would make short work of the Islamic State fighters there. But the fighting has been stiff. In late November, the Turkish military’s problems were compounded when three of its soldiers were killed in what Turkish forces said was a Syrian airstrike. Mr. Erdogan later spoke by phone with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, who assured him that Russia had not been involved in the air attack, according to Turkish news reports. The improving ties between the two autocratic leaders opened the door to greater cooperation. The Turkish military spoke publicly about the Russian role in a Jan. 2 statement that noted that Russian warplanes had struck targets the previous day about five miles south of Al Bab. American officials, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing intelligence, said that Russian airstrikes in the Al Bab area began at the end of December, and that Russian aircraft were flying near Al Bab as recently as Friday. The effectiveness of the Russian air operations, which have mainly involved dropping “dumb,” or unguided, bombs, is unclear. As Turkey’s casualties have mounted in the Al Bab operation, Turkish officials have complained about the lack of American air support and have even made veiled threats that Turkey might suspend allied combat flights against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria from its major base at Incirlik, which would be a major blow to the   air campaign. American officials suggested that the holdup in carrying out allied airstrikes in recent weeks was related to a Turkish decision to ban the Americans from flying reconnaissance drones in and around Al Bab to help identify and confirm targets, as well as bad weather. The Turkish military said that measure was needed to ensure that no potentially hostile aircraft flew over its troops, but it has hampered the United States’ ability to carry out airstrikes without endangering civilians. Operating without the benefit of precise intelligence, the United States recently engaged in what officials called a “show of force” operation in which American aircraft flew low over Al Bab and dropped flares. But last week, the Turks agreed that the United States could fly drones and other aircraft to gather intelligence, which paves the way for the   coalition to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Al Bab, American officials said. The United States regards the Kurdish forces as some of the most effective fighters in the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. But in deference to Turkish sensitivities, the Americans have declined to arm them directly. The Turks, however, regard them as nothing more than an arm of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an insurgent Kurdish group in Turkey and Iraq. The Turks have blamed the group for killing dozens of Turkish security forces in recent weeks. By any measure, the nascent cooperation between Russia and Turkey is a striking development. The situation was far different when Russian warplanes arrived at Latakia, Syria, in September 2015 to help the Assad government take on rebel groups, including some backed by the United States and Turkey. Relations were thrown into a crisis after a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian   attack plane and the Russian pilot was fatally shot by Syrian rebels as he was parachuting down. Mr. Putin denounced the   as a “stab in the back. ” Russia responded by deploying the   an advanced   system, at Latakia, and imposed economic sanctions against Turkey. But over the past year, the calculations of the two countries have changed. While President Obama warned that Syria would become a Russian military “quagmire,” the Russians, working with Iran,   forces and the Syrian military, helped Mr. Assad take back Aleppo in the waning months of the Obama administration without substantial Russian casualties. Still, Russia has to reckon with the fact that the Syrian military lacks the troops to control all of the country. At the same time, Turkey’s immediate objectives have shifted. Worried about the possibility that Kurdish fighters might link up separate cantons to establish an autonomous enclave across northern Syria, as well as about the presence of Islamic State fighters near its borders, Turkey sent its own forces into northern Syria in August. The Turkish offensive, which has enlisted the support of Syrian opposition groups that Turkey has backed, succeeded in taking the town of Jarabulus. But it has become bogged down near Al Bab, the last major town west of Raqqa still held by the Islamic State. The Russians notified the United States about the flights using a special hotline between Russian forces in Syria and the American air war command at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The hotline’s goal is to “deconflict” air missions carried out by the Russians and the   coalition."
"SEATTLE  —   For a technology to crack the mainstream, there is an unspoken understanding: It shouldn’t make the people who use it want to throw up. And yet there was a reminder, at last week’s International CES trade show in Las Vegas, of how far virtual reality has to go until everyone is ready to fasten   goggles to their faces. At a news conference, Intel, the chip maker, provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a   video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits. Intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone, in case anybody felt inclined to vomit, an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people. Laura Anderson, an Intel spokeswoman, said the company had provided the bags “out of an abundance of caution and to be tongue in cheek about our immersive experience. ” No one used the bags, she said. It is time for a reality check for virtual reality, one of the most hyped technologies of last year. Sales of the most capable headsets have been sluggish by most estimates, held back by high costs, a lack of   content, and the complexity and awkwardness of the products. Less expensive mobile headsets that use smartphones as their screens are selling better, but are far more limited in what they can do. Many technologists and early adopters of virtual reality remain unchanged in their conviction that the technology will eventually change how entertainment, including games and movies, is experienced by the masses. The major virtual reality headsets from Oculus, HTC and Sony went on sale to the public only last year, and those who thought they would find a large audience within months of release had unrealistic expectations, virtual reality’s advocates say. “This is going to be a long slog, as the technology continues to improve, more content becomes available and awareness increases,” said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research. Virtual reality now appears to be headed for a phase in the evolution of new technologies known as the “trough of disillusionment,” said Sunny Dhillon, a venture capitalist at Signia Venture Partners, which has invested in virtual reality  . According to the technology research firm Gartner, this stage of the hype cycle for new technologies comes after a period of inflated expectations, but before a phase in which their benefits become commonly accepted. The excitement around virtual reality took a huge leap in March 2014 when Facebook announced it planned to acquire Oculus for $2 billion and the social network’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, suggested that virtual reality could be the next big thing in technology after mobile. That deal sparked a wave of   creating products for virtual reality and a related technology called augmented reality, which overlays digital imagery on a view of the real world, as seen through smartphones and headsets. Last year, $1. 48 billion was invested in   in that category, compared with $331 million the prior year, estimated Pitchbook, a financial data firm. Many of those   were funded before major headsets went on sale to the public. Entrepreneurs raising money in the future are likely to encounter tougher questions about what kind of use their products are getting. “All the major headsets have launched  —   the numbers are coming in,” said Alex Rosenfeld, the founder of Vrideo, a   that acted as a   hub for virtual reality videos. “You’re going to have some companies here that don’t survive. If the industry is going to continue to attract dollars, there’s going to have to be real numbers. ” Vrideo was one of those that did not make it. Mr. Rosenfeld announced at the end of November that he was shutting the company down. He said investors were skeptical about whether Vrideo could compete against larger players like Google’s YouTube and Facebook not pessimistic about the overall future of virtual reality. The companies that make the major headsets do not report their sales, and all of them said they were pleased with the results so far. SuperData Research, a technology research firm, estimated that Oculus had sold 360, 000 headsets and HTC 450, 000 since their products went on sale in March and June, respectively. Both of those headsets require   PCs with powerful processors. The firm estimated that Sony, which began selling a virtual reality headset in October, has sold about 750, 000. Sony’s headset was seen as a potentially big boost to the virtual reality industry because it is less expensive than rival headsets and relies on a PlayStation 4 console, more than 53 million of which have already been sold. A bundle with the PlayStation VR headset and specialized controllers sells for $500, while comparable bundles from HTC and Oculus sell for just under $800 each. Less expensive Sony and Oculus headsets are available without controllers designed for virtual reality. Still, the Sony sales were fewer than SuperData and others had expected. “The holidays were pretty disappointing for many in the industry,” said Doug Renert, a venture capitalist with Tandem Capital. “I’m not all that surprised. ” In a bright spot, Samsung said last week at CES that is had shipped more than five million of its Gear VR headsets, which act as a cradle for a mobile phone, with lenses that create a   image from the phone’s screen. Samsung often runs promotions in which it gives away a headset with the purchase of a Samsung smartphone. Price drops on technology are likely to be a big factor in mainstream acceptance of virtual reality. Starting Monday, a company that makes gaming PCs, CyberPower, will begin selling a $499 computer that can play virtual reality content when used with an Oculus headset. That is hundreds of dollars less than the normal cost. Ergonomic challenges with virtual reality headsets are likely to take longer to overcome. The more powerful headsets must be tethered by thick cables to PCs or consoles, which can tangle up players’ legs when these rigs occlude their view of the real world. Some players have come up with clever solutions to this problem by repurposing Ikea lamps to dangle the cables above their heads. At CES, a   called Sixa showed a wireless adapter called Rivvr that eliminates the need for those cables. “With wireless, V. R. will be ready for the mass market,” said Mykola Minchenko, chief executive of Sixa, which plans to sell its adapter for $200. Mr. Renert, the venture capitalist, said his firm had invested in several   working in virtual reality, including Sixa, despite slow sales of headsets, though the companies are working on technologies in other categories, too. He is confident that virtual reality will one day be a mainstream technology, comparing its evolution to   devices from Apple that were flops and hits. “We’re not at the Newton stage, but I don’t think we’re at iPhone stage,” Mr. Renert said."

The front page of yesterday’s _New York Times_ included the beginning of a long article about geoengineering—in this case, as it applies to purposeful activities aimed at changing the earth’s climate at a large scale. Why on earth would anyone even think of doing something like that? Why to avoid catastrophic global warming, of course!   
  
Thankfully, most signs point to only a modest global temperature increase resulting from our fossil fuel usage—a rise that will be readily adapted to and which actually may work out to be more beneficial than detrimental. Thankfully, we say, because geoengineering schemes seem like really bad ideas full of nasty consequences (unintentional and otherwise) and we are glad that no one is seriously entertaining them.   
  
Most folks who spend much time critically thinking about geoengineering the climate arrive at the same conclusion.   




Here are a couple of reasons why:   
  
● Who would be in charge of the global thermostat?   
  
● What temperature would it be set to?   
  
● Who gets to decide?   
  
● What if a country doesn’t like the decision?   
  
● Does the thermostat control rotate between counties every so often?   
  
● If you don’t like the weather can you lobby someone to change it?   
  
● If you don’t like the weather can you sue the entity responsible?   
  
● The unintended consequences are mind-boggling!   
  
● How do you know it is effective (climate models can’t accurately foresee annual to decadal variability)?   
  
● Schemes to remove CO2 from the air are detrimental to agriculture.   
  
These are just tastes of the problem, it shouldn’t be hard to come up with more on your own. If you need some help, the always insightful Roger Pielke Jr. has a series of articles on his blog over the years dedicated to this highly controversial topic (see here for starters).   
  
So next time you hear someone offer up geoengineering as a way to “offset” anthropogenic climate change, just say “No, thank you, I’d much rather take my chances with the climate that comes than risk the alternative.”

"Delivering the first of six State of the State addresses planned around the state this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday located the cure to the nation’s political fever in New York State, implicitly offering himself as an antidote to a   whose name went unmentioned. “New York knows that our progressive principles of acceptance and diversity are not the enemy of our middle class, and we know that   success is not the enemy of our progressive beliefs,” he said. “In fact, it was the progressive policies that created the nation’s middle class in the first place. ” Ahead of his scheduled stops in western and central New York, on Long Island, in Westchester County and in Albany, Mr. Cuomo’s remarks in a   room at 1 World Trade Center colored largely within state lines. But remarkably for a politician who has avoided even the appearance of White House ambitions since entering the governor’s mansion in 2011, his speech also seemed aimed at an audience outside New York. Mr. Cuomo reiterated his promise to upgrade Queens’s two major airports, but he dwelled far longer on the reality on Queens’s streets. There, he said, the economic recovery trumpeted by the Obama administration had somehow never gotten around to the Hillside Avenue gas station where he worked as a teenager or the “pizzeria where we hung out. ” “It is not what they feel,” he said, referring to the white   voters who proved so receptive to Donald J. Trump’s candidacy. “It is not their reality. ” Lines drawn from the Elizabeth Warren syllabus got the Cuomo treatment (at one point, he noted that the Wall Street executives who presided over the financial crisis were never punished). One of Mr. Cuomo’s chief proposals on Monday was a “  recovery act” that he said would provide jobs and erect infrastructure, expand access to education and lower taxes. Lest anybody miss the point, the governor’s staff circulated “key takeaways” and quotations from the speech, billing the address as a groundbreaking blueprint for moving forward in the Trump era. There were   ’   proposals covering what seemed like the whole spectrum of liberal causes. Doubling the   tax credit for more than 200, 000 families. Executive orders intended to reduce a wage gap for women working for the state. Criminal justice reforms affecting the state’s bail system, recordings of police interrogations, the age of criminal liability and access to a speedy trial.   voter registration and early voting. Mr. Cuomo proposed a defense fund guaranteeing legal representation to immigrants, as well as passing the Dream Act, a   piece of legislation that would open financial aid at state colleges to undocumented immigrants. For environmentalists, Mr. Cuomo unveiled a deal, reported by The New York Times on Friday, that would lead to the shutdown of Indian Point, a nuclear plant north of New York City. The governor had already announced several initiatives before the speech, including a pledge to cover tuition costs at state universities and community colleges for families making up to $125, 000 a year. Some of his ideas seemed to be flags planted directly on the liberal territory previously staked out by Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, who listened from the second row on Monday  —   the latest subplot of a feud between governor and mayor that recently reached new depths over the death of a   deer. Mr. Cuomo even took credit for establishing a universal prekindergarten program in New York City, a mayoral proposal ultimately financed by Albany. Yet for all that Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont might find to like in the speech, Mr. Cuomo, who has been criticized by the left over collaborating with Republicans, faces a bumpy session in Albany. Legislators have taken the governor’s decision to split the traditional State of the State address in Albany into six regional events as a snub, and legislative leaders have declined to attend. But there was someone present who wanted to air the legislators’ grievances, however lonely the quest. About 64 floors below the pristine white room in which Mr. Cuomo spoke, Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party and a Trump supporter who had been denied entrance, monitored the proceedings from a Joe  the Juice shop. “He’s afraid to face them,” Mr. Cox said outside afterward, referring to state legislators. “So he’s running around the state giving great speeches that really sound like speeches for someone who’d like to be president of the United States, rather than someone who’s governor of New York State. ” In the cold wind, Mr. Cox fended off a shiver. He planned to follow the governor to his afternoon speech in Buffalo, where Mr. Cox would be, doubtless, equally unwelcome."
"The 2030 Agenda: Australian Government invites the UN to control our rights, laws, freedoms, private property, energy use, & life style
Graham Williamson
July 2016
The UN, having spent  more than half a $trillion in 70 years, is an undemocratic, unaccountable international policeman that is in the business of inventing ‘global problems’ which can only be ‘solved’ by a transfer of power and money from nation states to the UN. It has been elevated to this status by cooperative national governments.  As noted by Peter Faris QC, thanks to the eager cooperation of successive Australian governments “laws are imported (as some sort of universal truths) from the UN.”
On 27th September 2015 the UN continued their campaign of global control and undemocratic interference in the affairs of nations around the world with their ‘Transforming Our World‘ 2030 SDG agenda which was  signed by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on behalf of all Australians. With a predicted  annual price tag of $2-3 trillion, the agenda is to be sold to the people as ‘voluntary’, although  the people will be given no choice, and essential provisions will be undemocratically enforced by national governments. Although both major Parties refused to mention this during the recent election campaign, implementation of this undemocratic bipartisan supported agenda commenced in Australia on 1st January 2016.
The 2030 agenda is a UN driven “master plan” or “roadmap to global socialism” aimed at controlling the planet, including so called ‘climate change’, and the life styles and energy consumption of all people and all countries.  Their 15 year goals include:


Redistributing the wealth of Australia and other Western nations, under the control of the UN, to poorer countries, especially impoverished dictatorships, around the world. According to the 2030 Agenda, ‘poverty’ can only be addressed by undemocratically giving money and power to the UN.


 The  COP21 Paris climate change agreement, comprising SDG 13, is just one part of the 2030 Agenda. The UN version of climate change though,  is about global power and money. As UNFCCC chief  Christiana Figueres pointed out, the aim of the UN is to bring about a “centralized transformation“… “one that is going to make the life of everyone on the planet very different.”  Figueres continues: “global society, is moving to the point where we are going to need more and more global governance muscle… Climate change is only the first of the major, major planetary challenges that we are being given, almost as a playground… to go into that playground and exercise our global governance capacity”


Controlling lifestyles, energy use, and consumption by defining which activities are accepted by the UN as being ‘sustainable’. Only the UN can control ‘sustainability’.


Controlling education around the globe to ensure all children become activists promoting the UN sustainability agenda.


Moving towards global enforcement by developing global monitoring, accountability mechanisms, and surveillance systems so “no one is left behind”.


The UN 2030 agenda is completely open ended, stating no total costs, and stating no limits as far as loss of sovereignty and enforcement mechanisms are concerned.


The American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) advances the interior design profession and communicates the impact of design on the human experience. Laurel & Wolf interior designers in Banglore specialize in every design style, space type and specification. See designer portfolios and styles here!
 The people have been betrayed. The 2030 Agenda is all about  betrayal, UN control, and global socialism, and  expanding global law. The United Nations has “conned governments, citizens andbusiness into adopting the 2030 Agenda“, but “business does not understand” that it will destroy “Capitalism and Free Enterprise.” And all this has been made possible by the Australian government, and governments of other ‘democratic’ countries, who invite the UN to interfere in the domestic affairs of their respective countries  WITHOUT the democratic approval of the people.
The choice is clear: do you want UN control and interference, or do you want democracy, freedom and prosperity? Should our destiny be decided by us, or by the dictators that comprise the UN?  Do you want democratic Australian laws, or foreign laws dictated by the UN?

"IT’S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the wrong person. Partly, it’s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others. We seem normal only to those who don’t know us very well. In a wiser, more   society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: “And how are you crazy?” Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working perhaps we’re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation. Nobody’s perfect. The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day. As for our friends, they don’t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more  . Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we’ve done our homework. We haven’t. Marriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating. For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons: because her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle to keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text. And from such reasonable marriages, there flowed loneliness, infidelity, abuse, hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors. The marriage of reason was not, in hindsight, reasonable at all it was often expedient,   snobbish and exploitative. That is why what has replaced it  —   the marriage of feeling  —   has largely been spared the need to account for itself. What matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right. Indeed, the more imprudent a marriage appears (perhaps it’s been only six months since they met one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens) the safer it can feel. Recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason, that catalyst of misery, that accountant’s demand. The prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason. But though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage, it isn’t that simple. What we really seek is familiarity  —   which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness. We are looking to recreate, within our adult relationships, the feelings we knew so well in childhood. The love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent’s warmth or scared of his anger, of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes. How logical, then, that we should as   find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right  —   too balanced, mature, understanding and reliable  —   given that in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign. We marry the wrong people because we don’t associate being loved with feeling happy. We make mistakes, too, because we are so lonely. No one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky otherwise, we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate. Finally, we marry to make a nice feeling permanent. We imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: Perhaps we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea, chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before, with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later. We married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage. Indeed, marriage tends decisively to move us onto another, very different and more administrative plane, which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house, with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle. The good news is that it doesn’t matter if we find we have married the wrong person. We mustn’t abandon him or her, only the founding Romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning. We need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us  —   and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for. This philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage. It might sound odd, but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage. The failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded. The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn’t exist) but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently  —   the person who is good at disagreement. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the “not overly wrong” person. Compatibility is an achievement of love it must not be its precondition. Romanticism has been unhelpful to us it is a harsh philosophy. It has made a lot of what we go through in marriage seem exceptional and appalling. We end up lonely and convinced that our union, with its imperfections, is not “normal. ” We should learn to accommodate ourselves to “wrongness,” striving always to adopt a more forgiving, humorous and kindly perspective on its multiple examples in ourselves and in our partners."
"Playing Snakes and Ladders with Australia’s Electricity Supply.
By Viv Forbes & Helpers
Every day some green energy promoter or a battery salesman tells us how green energy with battery backup will supply Australia’s future electricity needs.
A battery stores energy. Energy can be stored using lead-acid, nickel/cadmium, lithium, molten salt, pumped hydro, hydrogen, flywheels, compressed air or some other smart gizmo. But NOT ONE battery produces new energy – they simply store and discharge energy produced by other means.OnePlus 5 specs They all deliver less energy than they consume. Moreover, to manufacture, charge, use and dispose of batteries consumes energy and resources.
The idea of producing reliable grid power from intermittent green energy backed up by batteries looks possible in green doodle-diagrams, but would be absurdly inefficient and expensive.
Solar works a Six hour day
Consider a solar panel which is rated to collect say 100 units of energy per day at full capacity, in full mid-day sunlight, with a clean panel, properly aligned to face the sun.
No solar energy arrives overnight and only minimal amounts arrive during the three hours after dawn or before dusk. That means that significant solar energy can only be collected for about 6 hours per day, providing it is not cloudy, raining or snowing. No amount of research or regulation will change this – the solar energy union only works a six-hour day and takes quite a few sickies. So instead of feeding 100 units of energy per day into the grid, at best, the panel supplies just 25 units.
Can the addition of batteries give us 24/7 power from solar?
To deliver 100 units of energy in 24 hours will require an extra 75 units of energy to be collected, stored and delivered by the batteries every sunny day. This will require another three solar units devoted solely to re-charging batteries in just 6 sunny hours.
Cloudy/wet days are what really expose the problems of solar plus batteries. (This is why isolated green power systems must have a diesel generator in the shed.)
To insure against, say, 7 days of cloudy weather would require a solar/battery system capable of collecting and storing 700 units of energy while still delivering 100 units to consumers every day. However if several consecutive weeks of sunny weather then occur, this bloated system is capable of delivering 7 times more power than needed, causing power prices to plunge, driving reliable generators out of business and wasting the life of solar panels producing unwanted electricity. 192.168.l.254
Solar energy obviously does best in sunny equatorial deserts, but that is not where most people live. And the huge Desertec Solar Power Dream for the northern Sahara has failed.
The report card on wind energy is different, but equally depressing.
When Australia had reliable, predictable coal-gas-hydro power in every state, the need for heavy interstate transmission was minimal. But green power will require robust and costly interstate transmission facilities to send large amounts of power at short notice from sunny coal-rich Queensland to cloudy Victoria, windless South Australia or droughted Tasmania.

Guest “geologist tag-teaming” by David Middleton
This is a follow up to Gregory Wrightstone’s article from yesterday.  A couple of the first few comments reminded me that I’ve been meaning to write a post on the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab and what their data has to say about “the snows of yesteryear” and the faux climate crisis du jour.
First the comments:

Second, Loydo
While it appears that Greenland has lost about 0.4% of its ice mass since 1900, that loss began at the end of the Little Ice Age, the coldest climatic episode of the Holocene Epoch.

Ice mass losses from 2002-2017 were estimated from gravity data obtained by the GRACE satellites.  
The GRACE measurements upon which the accelerating ice loss claims are based are heavily dependent on the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). While not as large as Antarctica (where the GIA’s margin of error is nearly as large as the asserted ice loss), GIA variations can result in totally different ice loss values… And the GRACE time series isn’t any longer than the MODIS time series.
Wu et al., 2010 determined that the GIA commonly assumed for Greenland was way too high and that the 2002-2008 ice loss rate was 104 Gt/yr rather than the oft cited 230 Gt/yr. Even at 230 Gt/yr, it would take 1,000 years for Greenland to lose 5% of its ice mass.
Riva et al., 2007 concluded that the ice mass-loss rate in Antarctica from 2002-2007 could have been anywhere from zero-point-zero Gt/yr up to 120 Gt/yr. Dr. Riva recently co-authored a paper in GRL (Thomas et al., 2011) which concluded that GPS observations suggest “that modeled or empirical GIA uplift signals are often over-estimated” and that “the spatial pattern of secular ice mass change derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and GIA models may be unreliable, and that several recent secular Antarctic ice mass loss estimates are systematically biased, mainly too high.”
So… We have barely 15 years worth of data and no idea if the recent mass losses are anomalous relative to the early 20th century Arctic warming, Medieval Warm Period or any of the other millennial-scale Holocene warming periods.  
In 2017 the Greenland ice sheet appeared to have gained mass.  The GRACE mission ended in 2017; so we don’t know what it’s done since then
The ice mass estimates ostensibly take into account:
Mass lost to iceberg calving.Surface Mass Balance (SMB).
The “funny” thing is that icebergs have a tough time calving if outlet glaciers aren’t advancing toward the sea.   Glacial “dropstones” are geological evidence of past “ice house” climates.  Dropstones are boulders and large rocks that are carried out to sea by icebergs.  When the icebergs melt, the boulders drop to the bottom of the ocean.  Increased calving of icebergs has been evidence for colder climates from “Snowball Earth” right up until Al Gore invented Gorebal Warming.
SMB is the net difference of snow accumulation and ablation.  The Greenland Ice Sheet has had positive SMB (gained ice) over the last 4 years.  More snow has accumulated than ice has melted.
2015-2016: +247 Gt2016-2017: +544 Gt2017-2018: +517 Gt2018-2019:  +169 Gt 
Here’s another odd thing about Greenland:
 Figure 1.  Greenland snow cover has increased since 1967. 
Greenland’s summer snow cover has increased since 1967.  The winter snow cover can’t increase very much.  It’s usually close to 100%.
Commentator Henry Pool just pointed out that when I labeled the graphs I generated yesterday, I dated them 31 January, 2010… D’oh!  If I get around to it, I will fix the labels.  The date should be 31 January 2020.
Third, on to Steve Mosher
 Steven Mosher January 30, 2020 at 10:20 pm Editwhat does the science say about winter snow ( your january chart) .Unlike spring and summer snow that is predicted to FALL under warming scenariosWinter snow may INCREASE in certain locations and decrease in others. understanding why is simple for most people.
Whatever the snow does, it will have been predicted by the climate models? Or did I read that wrong?
Let’s look  at what Northern Hemisphere snow has been up to since “The Ice Age Cometh?”
 Figure 2.  Northern Hemisphere snow cover since 1972. trailing 12-month average.  I started in 1972 because much of the summer data in 1968, 1969 and 1971 are missing. 
It does appear that for the Northern Hemisphere, as a whole, it was a little snowier from 1972-1988 than it has been since then.  However, the snow cover in 2019 was the same as it was when “The Ice Age Cometh?”  Although it does seem that Leonard Nimoy went In Search Of “The Next Ice Age” at just the right time.  1978 was one of the snowiest years in Connecticut that I can remember.  Regarding a meaningful trend, can you say:  R² = 0.0604?
Now let’s break it down.
The GSL provides weekly and monthly data sets for various Northern Hemisphere regions:
WeeklyMonthlyN. HemisphereN. HemisphereEurasiaEurasiaN. AmericaN. AmericaN. America(no Greenland)N. America(no Greenland)
I downloaded the monthly data sets for N. Hemisphere, N. America and N. America (no Greenland).  I calculated the Greenland snow cover using this equation:
N. America – N. America (no Greenland) = Greenland
In the graphs to follow, North America includes Greenland.  North America is a subset of Northern Hemisphere and Greenland is a subset of North America.
It appears that Mr. Wrightstone was correct about winter.
 Figure 3. Winter (Dec., Jan., Feb.) snow cover – No trend. 
Now let’s look at spring, month by month.
Figure 4.  Slight decline for the Northern Hemisphere as a whole, North America and Greenland insignificant changes.
Figure 5. April looks a lot like March.
May starts to get interesting.
Figure 6.  When was the last time you experienced snowfall in May in the Northern Hemisphere? 
Bear in mind that back when we had some snowy months of May, it was right in the middle of That 70’s Climate Crisis Show…

Hey! Who else had this album back in the 70’s?


 Hot August Night, ‎December 9, 1972
Well, apparently the August nights weren’t all that hot in 1972.
Figure 7. Who would have guessed that Greenland was snowier in August 2019 than it was when Neil Diamond had hair?
Steve didn’t tell us what the climate models predicted about the fall… I’m gonna guess that the models must have predicted more snowfall.
Figure 8.  How’s that for an October surprise?
Let’s just be thankful for the climate models.  They literally saved New York City from being bulldozed by a rampaging horde of godless glaciers.
Figure 9.  The Climatariat tell us that temperature observations have followed the black curve and that the blue curve is what the temperatures would have done if we just agreed to freeze in the dark for the sake of Polar Bears.   Modified after IPCC AR4 
According to the sacred climate models, if not for The Climate Wrecking Industry, the planet would be colder than “The Ice Age Cometh”…
This proud petroleum geologist says, “You’re welcome.”

Not only do New Zealanders have to deal with the farce of their local councils jumping onto the Chicken Little Climate Emergency Bandwagon, but now Lincoln University has jumped in gumboots and all as well!



In a press release yesterday, Lincoln University stated that it wholeheartedly supports its students’ association in “ **demanding urgent action on climate change.** “



The University’s Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Bruce McKenzie has given staff and students permission to attend the School Strike 4 Climate NZ on 27 September.



Professor McKenzie said Lincoln’s strong, agriculturally-based history is also where the future lies, and the university is passionate about the need to protect the land.



“Environmental sustainability is a huge part of who we are, and we completely support this initiative,” he said. “Sustainability is taught across the university’s academic programmes and is a major research focus in most departments.”



Addressing climate issues also forms a crucial part of Lincoln University’s strategic direction, with an $8m investment being made into **energy diversification** over the next decade.



If you have ever wondered how to write a whole paragraph of indecipherable waffle without actually saying anything wonder no more. Check this out…



“The university has initiated an energy review management programme across campus to achieve best practice sustainability outcomes, including adopting environmental sustainability metrics and responding to the objectives detailed in our Environmental Sustainability Policy,” Professor McKenzie said. “The review will help us to develop a campus energy strategy and provide a clearer picture of the options available, offering a framework for decision-making about energy choices.”



Lincoln will also phase out the use of coal over the next several years, with a commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. Its use of 50% coal will be reduced to 0% by 2025, when its resource consent for coal expires.



“The resource consent will not be renewed, with no new load added to the coal fire boiler,” Professor McKenzie said. “We’re also actively implementing alternative energy sources, with a focus on reducing the load as opportunities arise, while making the boiler cleaner by considering filter flue gas and replacing the fuel source with greener alternatives.”



Reinvestment options on the boiler and energy networks will be considered early next year.



“Lincoln’s current energy load is 50% electricity, to be further diversified by 2025. The university has recently signed a three-year contract with Meridian Energy, a carbon-neutral certified company.”



Additionally, there are plans to implement solar power on campus over the next few months, with solar to be installed on the roof of the Te Keta Ika Dining Hall. Other buildings will subsequently receive solar installations.



Further initiatives include modelling on wind-generated power and using ground source heat pumps. The university is also developing plans to transform the campus into a living laboratory, creating interactive spaces for learning and research.



“Also playing important roles in addressing the **climate crisis** are the Sustainability Action Group for our Environment, together with the student-run Lincoln Environmental Organisation, who receive strong support from LUSA,” said Professor McKenzie.



Do you remember the good old days when Universities were about equipping young people with skills that would help them to get well-paid jobs and not about saving the planet? Yeah me too.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman writer/rock singer Heinz Rudolf Kunze recently performed at at a city festival in Berlin Teltow, and had a message about today’s opinion intolerance, alarmism, political correctness, etc. for Germany’s leaders and supremacist activists.
Regular mainstream German citizens often run the risk of being attacked whenever expressing dissenting views on hot-button issues, such as climate and immigration, in Germany.
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne
What follows are some excerpts from Kunze’s message in Teltow (from YouTube clip (see below), text written by Severin Tatarczyk:
[…]We are the people who are deeply convinced that the best cure for narrow-mindedness, stupidity, fear and hatred is education. And we are horrified by the almost systematic stupefaction of our children in public schools, where performance-hostile, child-centred so-called educators set the tone, not teachers who deserve this name.
We are the people who worry about the future, but also about the present because we ‘ve already experienced enough hysteria, panic and excitement: the sixty-eighters, arms race, dying forests, nuclear fear… We don’t believe in the predominantly young crazy sects who want to crucify all SUV drivers like in the dark Middle Ages and with vegan mouth-foamers.
Future yes, but not with rabid prohibitions, regulations and constraints, but with creative innovations and initiatives. We are neither the moral superiors nor correctness-smartasses nor right-wing rats for these catchers. We are the inhabitants of this beautiful area. We are the citizens. We are the people.”

"**Sourdough bread has become a major food trend over the last few years, with loaves flying off the shelves at independent bakeries and cafes, often for high prices.**
But with major supermarkets now getting in on the act, a row has broken out about what constitutes real sourdough and how it should be made.
It's led one campaign group to dub the more commercial - and cheaper - products on offer at many retailers as ""sourfaux"".
""We have no problem at all with a supermarket selling genuine sourdough. Just don't cheat, don't fool people,"" said Chris Young, co-ordinator of The Real Bread Campaign.
Sourdough has been around in various forms for thousands of years. Proponents believe it is more nutritious and easier to digest than normal bread.
Known for its characteristic flavour and texture, it is made with live fermented cultures which act as a natural leavening agent and should not be made with baker's yeast, according to Mr Young.
But this week, a coalition of five trade groups representing commercial bakers and restaurants across the country proposed a wider definition, in an industry code of practice designed to clarify the labelling on sourdough products.
In it, they acknowledge that any product calling itself ""sourdough bread"" should contain live/active cultures ""as the principal leavening agent"".
But they also suggest that such a loaf may contain up to 0.2% of bakers' yeast and certain ""flour treatment agents"".
""Where space and skills are lacking, bakers have recourse to an increasing number of ingredients and raw materials that help to simplify the process,"" the guidelines state.
The group - which included the Federation of Bakers, among others - has asked food agency Defra to endorse the code, which would be voluntary.
But the Real Bread Campaign warned the rules risked ""undermining the integrity of the word sourdough, creating a sourfaux free-for-all"".
""When we started nine years ago, there were no sourdough loaves on supermarket shelves, they used to see it as elitist,"" Mr Young told the BBC.
""Big firms now see there's a demand. But rather than saying, 'We will bake genuine sourdough and make it more accessible,' they've said, 'Stuff it, we don't want to train our bakers or put in the time it takes to learn. We want to cut corners.'""
The kind of independent bakeries represented by the Campaign for Real Bread can charge as much as much as Â£5-Â£6 for an artisan sourdough loaf in some UK cities.
By contrast, products labelled as sourdough bread retail for a fraction of the price in many supermarkets - and there is no law dictating how such bread should be made, as long as it meets relevant food standards.
However, a study by consumer watchdog Which? last year found that just four of 19 supermarket sourdough loaves it tested contained the traditional four ingredients: flour, water, salt and a live yeast starter culture.
Mr Young said people would potentially get an inferior taste and miss out on the health benefits. ""This bread may cost less, but supermarkets may still be charging a premium for a non-premium product, which we think is unfair.""
The BBC asked the Craft Bakers Association, which is one of the groups backing the new code, for a comment.
Meanwhile, Gordon Polson, chief executive of the Federation of Bakers, said: ""A draft of the Baking Industry Code of Practice for the Labelling of Sourdough Bread and Rolls has been presented to Defra.
""We look forward to discussing it with Defra as an important step in helping with labelling sourdough, following guidelines which have been established in other EU countries."""

From The Daily Caller

Chris White Tech Reporter
February 28, 2020 4:47 PM ET

Moderate Democrats from battleground districts didn’t respond to questions about potential 2020 nominee Bernie Sanders’ anti-fracking policies. 
Reps. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania and Max Rose of New York were two such Democrats who declined comment despite their past willingness to push back against their party’s leftward lurch. 
Their unwillingness to talk comes as Sanders continues making inroads in the race for president while superdelegates are angling to find a way to stop the surging self-avowed socialist. 

Many Democrats distanced themselves from their party’s more radical elements before winning congressional seats in 2018, but some of those same lawmakers refused to respond when the Daily Caller News Foundation asked them about Sen. Bernie Sanders’ anti-fracking policies.
Neither Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, nor his colleagues Matt Cartwright and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania responded to questions about whether they support the self-avowed socialist. They also declined to discuss Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ill-fated Green New Deal with the DCNF.
In fact, only Rep. Kendra Horn of Oklahoma responded.
“I do not support the proposed ban on fracking or the Green New Deal,” Horn told the DCNF. “The oil and gas industry has fueled economic development and new opportunities in Oklahoma since statehood.” She refused to further discuss a possible Sanders nomination.
The Texas Democratic Party told the DCNF that they do “not comment on specific candidates right before a primary that we are administering,” and the Pennsylvania Democratic Party did not respond to questions. Both states’ economies are heavily dependent on the fossil fuel industry.
Democratic Rep. Max Rose of New York has come out in recent months against the GND, telling USA Today in April 2019 that Ocasio-Cortez’s solution to climate change is a “massive socialist economic policy platform. Just not needed.” He went on to say that “urgent and bold action” is needed.
Despite his past criticisms, Rose was unwilling to respond to the DCNF’s repeated requests for comment on Sanders’s policies, which many Democrats are calling socialistic. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg even called the senator a communist at the Feb. 18 Nevada debate.
Lamb, who won a tight race in 2018 against former Rep. Rick Saccone, has also demonstrated a willingness to criticize his own caucus. He wrote a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Feb. 15 rejecting a piece of legislation imposing a nationwide ban on fracking within the next five years.
Sanders, for his part, revealed his own GND in August 2019, promising everything from “virtually free” electricity and a “hunger-free” transition to green energy from fossil fuels. The democratic socialist’s nearly 14,000-page memo also lays out how he will deal with a variety of social justice issues.
Republicans in the Senate torpedoed Ocasio-Cortez’s legislation in March 2019 as Democrats called the vote a dog-and-pony show. The GOP defeated the proposal 57-0; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the bill a socialistic ploy designed to kill the economy. None of the Democratic senators supported the bill.
Ocasio-Cortez’s GND sought to phase out fossil fuel usage within 12 years, which would have cost tens of trillions of dollars, some reports show. Americans could be forced to pay up to $93 trillion to implement the proposal over a decade, the conservative-leaning American Action Forum (AAF) noted in a study in February 2019.
Other reports suggest the proposal, if it had become law, would have taken a sledgehammer to American households in swing states. Households would have ponied up between $74,287 and $76,683 in Colorado, Michigan and Pennsylvania, among others, a report Wednesday from the Competitive Enterprise Institute noted.
Meanwhile, the U.S. also became the world’s largest producer of fracked natural gas in 2012, surpassing Russia despite former President Barack Obama’s decision in 2015 to place a moratorium on such production on public lands. It also passed coal as the country’s leading source of electricity in July 2017.
Fracking technology helps energy producers extract natural gas out of places like the Permian Basin in Texas and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.(RELATED: Flashback: Bernie Sanders Says His Green New Deal Can Make Electricity ‘Virtually Free’ By 2035 — But There’s A Catch)
Lamb, Cartwright, Cuellar, Rose and Horn are running for re-election. They are running as the sand shifts underneath the Democratic Party’s proverbial feet, with Democrats worried that a potential Sanders win could mean disaster for a party that won control over the House less than two years ago.
More than 90 superdelegates told The New York Times in a report Thursday that say they are willing to sacrifice party cohesion to prevent a Sanders nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July.
Nearly 84 of those the NYT interviewed said that the progressive senator does not deserve to become the party’s nominee because he has not yet secured a majority of the delegates.

Will activists finally admit their sins and break out of their pesticide-blaming time loop?
Paul Driessen
Did you think Goundhog Day only comes in February?
For anti-insecticide zealots and others in the environmentalist movement who’ve been preoccupied for years with bees and “colony collapse disorder,” it actually comes every June. That’s when the Bee Informed Partnership – a University of Maryland-based project supported by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) – releases the results of its annual survey of honeybee colony losses and health.
In Bill Murray’s 1993 “Groundhog Day” movie, cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors is condemned to relive the same day over and over in a little Pennsylvania town until he learns the right “life lessons.” Each June, eco-campaigners work themselves into a carefully orchestrated lather over bee losses, getting caught in a time loop of endlessly repeating the same false and misguided claims about the BIP report.
Last week’s BIP report predictably garnered the usual hyperventilating headlines, sounding almost as alarming as in recent years. The 38% 2018-19 over-winter colony loss rate was the highest in the 13 years the survey has been taken. Combined with in-season (summer) honeybee colony losses of 20.5% this yielded an overall annual loss rate of 40.7% (computed using a special BIP methodology).
That’s slightly higher than 2017-18’s reported 40.1% overall loss rate and 2.9% higher than the average annual loss rate calculated since 2010. Hit the panic button.
Environmental worrywarts moved seamlessly into their annual spasm of anxiety and dire prognostication. “Honey bees are no longer disappearing suddenly and mysteriously. They’re dying persistently, and in plain sight,” the Washington Post lamented.
Will there be enough honeybee colonies left to pollinate California’s lucrative almond crop next winter? an environmental “investigative news organization” agonized. (Ironically, but predictably, this story was posted four weeks after the USDA predicted another record almond harvest in the state.)
Is the BIP report further evidence that the hyperventilating media and eco-campaigners were correct about the “bee-pocalypse” they’ve been “documenting” for the last half-dozen years? Hardly!
First, the alarmists who routinely over-react to the annual BIP survey forget (or ignore) its limitations. As the report makes clear, the survey is entirely voluntary, returned by beekeepers who take time to fill it out. It consequently does not even purport to be a scientific sampling of American beekeepers. It is a compilation and analysis of responses from those who voluntarily self-report. The results show this.
The roughly 4,700 beekeepers who responded this year account for only about 12% of all US honeybee colonies. Professor Dennis Van Engelsdorp – founder of the Bee Informed Partnership – showed in his own research that hobbyist and small-scale beekeepers (who account for the majority of the BIP respondents) have more severe parasite and pathogen infestations of their honeybee hives than large-scale commercial beekeepers. That increases colony loss rates.
Interestingly, while BIP survey results go up and down from year to year, the overall trend line over the survey’s first dozen years has been downward. But that may reflect small-scale beekeeper experiences.
In any case, US honeybee colony numbers aren’t shrinking; they’re growing, regardless of what the latest BIP survey results find. The USDA’s actual census of beekeepers and their colonies – which actually is systematic and scientific – shows that the overall number of US honeybee colonies grew by 4% in 2018.
Indeed, in releasing the latest BIP results, Van Engelsdorp himself said, “We’re not worried about honeybees going extinct. We’re worried about commercial beekeepers going extinct.” Hive infections, long distance travel and other aspects of the business have driven more beekeepers to other professions.
Second, there’s good news in the latest Bee Informed Partnership survey. Finally, after years of misleading media and activist rhetoric seeking to pin the blame for honey bees’ problems on agricultural pesticides –neonicotinoid insecticides in particular – attention is now focusing where it should have been all along: on Varroa destructor mites. These tiny, nasty critters and the multiple virulent diseases they spread to honeybee colonies are the foremost scourge of our beloved, and vital, insect pollinators.
This year’s BIP survey announcement and most of the resulting press coverage emphasized this point.
It’s about time. Neonics have become the world’s most widely used insecticides because they work – and pose minimal risks to bees. Some are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, but nearly 90% are used as seed coatings for corn, wheat, canola and other crops. They are absorbed into plant tissues as crops grow.
That means they target only pests that actually feed on the crops, particularly during early growth stages. Since they don’t wash off, they reduce the need for multiple sprays with insecticides that truly can harm bees, birds, fish, other animals and non-pest insects. And they are barely detectable in pollen and nectar – which is why neonic residues are well below levels that can adversely affect bees.
That makes it ironic, and outrageous, that relentless anti-pesticide campaigners – especially those who profess to be alarmed about the “plight of the bumblebee” and want to ban neonics – have said virtually nothing about Varroa mites. Nor have they proposed any plan to deal with this scourge.
Thankfully, recent USDA research has identified a promising new approach of using RNA interference (RNAi) to disrupt the reproduction of another bee parasite, Nosema ceranae – the honeybee’s second-worst scourge. USDA is also reporting progress in efforts to breed more Varroa-resistant or Varroa-tolerant honey bees, which somehow have better hygienic habits: removing mites from one other.
Activists and journalists concerned about bees and pollinator health should have focused on this all along – particularly since available Varroa treatments no longer work as well, due to the mite’s uncanny ability to develop resistance to treatments. Instead, years of energy and millions of dollars have been wasted pursuing a wrong-headed crusade against neonic insecticides that are irrelevant to any challenges facing honey bees and other pollinators.
Phil Connors finally escaped from his time loop after he ended his disdain for small town Punxsutawney, began performing good deeds and told Rita he truly loved her. Maybe now – finally – self-professed bee advocates and environmental crusaders will wake up from their Groundhog-Day-in-June time loop and devote some time, effort and honesty to addressing the real problems that affect honey and wild bees.
Maybe they will also stop treating modern conventional farming like an evil pariah, and organic farming like a planetary savior. Maybe they will stop repeating the organic food industry’s Big Lie: that it doesn’t use pesticides. In fact, as Professor David Zaruk explains on his RiskMonger.com website, organic farmers employ a dozen highly toxic “natural” pesticides and over 3,000 other “approved” pesticides.
Several are highly toxic to bees: acetic acid, copper sulfate, pyrethrins, hydrogen peroxide, azidirachtin, rotenone, citronella oil, eucalyptus oil and garlic extract, and spinosad. Several are very toxic to humans: boron can affect people’s brain, liver or heart; rotenone has been linked to Parkinson’s disease; nicotine sulfate is a neurotoxin that has actually killed several gardeners; and copper sulfate can readily and severely injure a user’s brain, liver, kidneys, stomach and intestinal linings, skin and eyes … or even kill!
But again, Varroa is the villain, the real, enduring threat to bees – not pesticides, synthetic or organic.
Unfortunately, persuading environmentalists to acknowledge these realities is not likely. They have too much ideology, power and prestige invested in their campaigns against synthetic pesticides and conventional farming – to say nothing of the billions of dollars they’ve gotten from organic interests.
Bottom line? Lies, deception and fraud are unethical, immoral and illegal no matter who engages in it, devises the strategies or finances the campaigns. These environmentalist campaigns have been employed over and over because they work – and because too many legislators, regulators, judges and journalists have repeated, approved and applauded them. It will be an uphill battle to change that dynamic.
Let’s hope a few brave lawmakers start applying the same standards of truth and ethics across the board.

" Op-ed contributed by William Walter Kay BA LL B ©2019 Climate Change dates to a 1970s Franco-German petroleum rationing initiative aimed at righting trade balances. In the 1980s it morphed into a petroleum and coal phase-out campaign ostensibly aimed at protecting Earth’s atmosphere from CO2 overload.European climate campaigners seek to level the playing field between their resource-poor homelands and the Anglosphere’s natural energy superpowers. German-led states use Climate Change to enhance renewable energy and electro-mobility exports. Success hinges on controlling cultural assets within the Anglosphere.Bertelsmann In 1835 Carl Bertelsmann’s began printing hymnals, prayer-books and a faith-based Westphalian newspaper. Carl sowed and reaped Evangelical revivalism. His son Heinrich added romantic novels to their traditionalist oeuvre. Heinrich’s only child, Fredericka, married loyal employee, Johannes Mohn, who took over operations upon Heinrich’s passing.Johannes’ son, Heinrich, was an early donor to the Nazis, as were his pastor and church. Heinrich joined the SS, as did his son Reinhard (1921-2009). Bertelsmann’s in-house theologian was pro-Nazi. Bertelsmann’s top-selling poet wrote the speech inaugurating the 1933 book-burnings.With wares freighted with Volkish and anti-Semitic content, Bertelsmann became the Third Reich’s largest publisher. In 1943 they ‘sold’ 19 million books. They supplied special editions to the Wehrmacht and boosted profits by exploiting slave labor in Eastern Europe and Holland.Post-WWII Bertelsmann stayed afloat partly by having hoarded paper but mainly by transferring control to Reinhard, whom Allied commanders found palatable. Reinhard spent much of WWII in a Kansas POW camp. Bertelsmann printed books commissioned by British intelligence.*Bertelsmann’s move into the Anglosphere began with the 1977-80 acquisition of Bantam Books. In 1986-7 they purchased Doubleday and opened a New York office. In 1998 they bought Random House. A 2013 merger hatched Penguin Random House; 75% owned by Bertelsmann, 25% by Pearson plc.Penguin Random House, the world’s largest commercial book publisher, churns-out 15,000 titles a year for English and Spanish-language markets. Annual sales of print, audio and e-books exceed 600 million units. A 10,000-strong workforce harvests yearly yields of $3.8 billion.The German market is supplied by Verlagsgruppe Random House, owner of 40 illustrious brands. Verlagsgruppe is Bertelsmann-owned, Penguin Random House-managed.Bertelsmann operates behind 315 brands or “imprints.” These imprints are the putative “publishers” named on books’ information pages. Imprints tally the venerable houses captured by Bertelsmann (Viking, Knopf, Ebury, Hamish, Putnam, Ballantine, Puffin, DK and Vintage etc.).Wholly-owned Bertelsmann subsidiary, Bertelsmann Printing Group, does all Bertelsmann’s printing; and prints catalogs and brochures for outside customers. In addition to German operations, Bertelsmann Printing owns one British, and five American, plants. Bertelsmann Printing has 8,200 employees and annual revenues of $1.8 billion.*Bertelsmann’s climate effort is multi-pronged. Regarding publishing, it has non-fiction and fiction fronts.The total number of non-fiction global warming alarmist books issued by Bertelsmann probably tops a thousand. Recent months witnessed the roll-out of: The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming (David Wallace-Wells); Climate Leviathan (Joel Wainwright); No Immediate Danger: Volume 1 of the Carbon Ideologies (William Vollmann); and the illustrated kids’ book: What is Climate Change? (Gail Herman). Releases come with book-tours and talk-show interviews; as were arranged for Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Sequel.Bertelsmann publishes alarmist supremo Bill McKibben’s works (End of Nature; Global Warming Reader etc.). They practically invented McKibben. They definitely invented Climate Central – a collective billed as: “the trusted source of information on all things climate-related” and generating collectibles like: Global Weirdness and Where is Climate Heading? Another Bertelsmann crew re-formatted US Global Change Research Program’s latest outpouring as: The Climate Report (2019).More insidious is Bertelsmann climate fiction. Christened “cli-fi” by academics circa 2007, this genre consists of fictitious literature set in apocalyptic futures wracked by human-induced global warming. Since 2007, some 400 cli-fi novels, countless cli-fi short-stories, and a dozen successful cli-fi screenplays have spilled forth. Notable Bertelsmann contributions: The Water Knife (Paola Bacigalupi); Year of the Flood (Margaret Atwood); Green Earth (Kim Stanley Robinson), The Gracekeepers (Kirsty Logan), Gold Fame Citrus (Clare Vaye Walkins), and Solar (Ian McEwan).Cli-fi was co-engineered with Holtzbrinck in whose catalogs one finds: The Dry (Jane Harper), The City in the Middle of the Night (Charlie Jane Anders), Odds Against Tomorrow (Nathaniel Rich), and Green Like Dying (Rouxi Chen) etc.Such pulp is bought in tonnage by librarians. Cli-fi potboilers are required reading in high school and university lit classes where they melt into millions of malleable minds.Bertelsmann knows education. Bertelsmann Education Group’s 2,030 staff sell: online training courses, digital teaching aids; and, school marketing and student recruitment services.*Bertelsmann SE’s 8 divisions collectively employ 117,000 workers and generate $20 billion in yearly sales.Wholly-owned, Arvato, provides e-commerce and IT services to banks and telecoms. As well, Arvato’s 36-language, 48,000-employee call-centre fields customer inquiries for hundreds of corporate clients.Bertelsmann’s RTL owns 60 television and 30 radio stations across Europe. RTL owns Germany’s largest private television network. RTL’s Radio Deutschland owns 17 stations. RTL’s 15,975 employees produce most RTL content. Annual revenues exceed $7 billion.Bertelsmann’s Gruner & Jahr showers 500 print and digital magazines across Europe but mainly upon Germany and France where half the population buys at least one G&J periodical. G&J wholly owns the weekly Stern (circulation: 750,000) and 25% of its rival, Der Spiegel (circulation: 840,000).G&J’s flagship daily, Dresden-based Sachsische Zeitung (circulation: 230,000), is co-owned with the Social Democratic Party.G&J and Holtzbrinck co-own Germany’s premier journalism college.RTL and G&J moil the online video market with 1,500 channels on YouTube and YouTube-wannabe platforms. Bertelsmann measures monthly views in the billions.Also mining the Internet is Bertelsmann’s music division, BMG, whose 840 employees work at 15 locations providing audiovisual, recording and steaming assistance to “indie” artists. They also offer marketing, licensing, royalty tracking and copyright administration services.Bertelsmann began hoarding pop music copyrights in 1984. BMG now owns 3 million songs including most vintage hits appearing in movie soundtracks and radio playlists.Bertelsmann Investments co-owns 185 Brazilian and Asian digital start-ups.Bertelsmann SE’s “corporate responsibility” webpage parades an array of carbon-cutting, paper-saving, tree-planting and obligatory employee “be green” initiatives.*Bertelsmann SE is owned 19.1% by the Mohns, 80.9% by three foundations: BVG, Reinhard Mohn Stiftung, and Bertelsmann Stiftung. BVG owns all voting shares.Christoph Mohn chairs Bertelsmann SE and Reinhard Mohn Stiftung; and is a BVG shareholder. Liz Mohn is: BVG’s Chair, Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Vice Chair, and a Bertelsmann SE director. Brigitte Mohn is an Executive Director of Bertelsmann Stiftung, a Bertelsmann SE director, and a BVG shareholder.Summoned by the Mohns to Bertelsmann SE’s board are four subsidiary managers and one rep each from: Daimler, Volkswagen, Nestle; German software giant, SAP; and French insurer, AXA (managers of a $1 trillion asset portfolio and a climate-obsessed website).*Liz followed her late husband Reinhard into the fanatically environmentalist Club of Rome. Bertelsmann Stiftung (BS) began collaborating with the Club in 1993.BS issues no grants. It is a self-financed think tank with annual expenditures of $100 million and 384 employees. BS hosts 200 confabs yearly to advance 70 projects – typically co-ventures with universities. BS spawns hundreds of reports and books (including a six-volume Reinhard Mohn compendium).BS’s annual 500-page Sustainable Development Report, co-written with UN Special Advisor Jeffrey Sachs, habitually bashes national governments for failing to combat climate change.Climate isn’t something BS bangs on about. Rather, it’s a bedrock assumption. “Enhancing international cooperation” translates into “promoting the Paris Accord.”BS scrutinises public opinion, especially voting behaviour.

His father sold their distressed estate after WWI then suffered hyperinflation. Unable to rely on the family fortune, Georg took up magazine distribution while a student.Georg joined the Nazi University Section in 1931; during the group’s proscription for assaulting Jewish students and professors. Uncle Erich was an SS Commander. Georg joined the Nazi Party in 1933.Georg parlayed personal commendations from Hitler’s lawyer, and aid from the Nazi Party newspaper, into acquiring distribution rights for German Labor Front magazines (annual circulation: 28 million). Georg personally designed a special edition celebrating Poland’s invasion.Georg was among a clique of businessmen who plundered Jewish-owned publishing. He became a prominent publisher; producing books for the Wehrmacht, specifically for Stormtroopers.Post-war prosecutors described Georg as a devoted Nazi who benefitted immensely from Party contacts. Georg got off with a fine and carried on. He also benefited immensely from hording paper at war’s end.In the late-1940s Georg took-over the German Book Association. Over the next 20 years he capitalised on his role as book middleman, and on close relationships with a clique of German publishers, to acquire minority stakes in newspaper and book publishing firms. In 1971 he pooled these holdings into Holtzbrinck Publishing Group. His son Georg-Dieter (b. 1941) assumed command in 1980. Georg died in 1983.Under Georg-Dieter (1980-2001) Holtzbrinck acquired German newspapers and English-language publishers; the latter specialising in science and education.Georg-Dieter transferred Holtzbrinck Publishing to his sister (Monika) and half-brother (Stefan) who now each own 50%. Georg-Dieter retained ownership of certain newspapers, and co-owns Die Zeit with his two siblings. All three are billionaires.*Stuttgart-headquartered Holtzbrinck Publishing Group is a multinational. Half its sales are in English-language markets.Springer Nature, is 57% owned by Holtzbrinck; 43% owned by BC Partners.The journal Nature was owned by the House of Macmillan from 1869 until its 1995 purchase by Holtzbrinck. Post-acquisition, several sister Nature publications emerged. The 2000s witnessed a proliferation of Nature-branded journals.Berlin-based Springer-Verlag dates to 1842. BC Partners bought Springer Science+Business Media in 2013 for $4 billion; merging it with Holtzbrinck’s Nature Group 18 months later.Springer Nature owns many of the world’s most-cited scientific journals. Key assets:Scientific American. Founded in 1845 and bought by Holtzbrinck in 1986, Scientific American comes out monthly in 14 languages. The magazine boasts 9.5 million print and tablet subscribers. Its website attracts over 10 million unique monthly visitors. Its social media reaches 7 million.Nature. The journal has 53,000 weekly subscribers and an 8.0 pass along rate (424,000 regular readers). Nature is the world’s second most influential science journal (behind AAAS’s Science).Scientific Reports. The world’s largest open access, scientific mega-journal, Scientific Reports’ extensive Earth Science and Enviro-science collections contain innumerable climate papers.Nature Communications publishes several dozen journals. Regarding climate, the most germane are: Nature Earth and Environmental Sciences, Nature Ecology and Evolution, Nature Sustainability, Nature Energy and Nature Climate Change. The latter might be the world’s highest impact climate publication.Nature Partner Journals are co-ventures between Springer Nature and various institutes. NPJ Climate and Atmospheric Sciences is co-published with King Abdullaziz University’s Center for Excellence in Climate Change Research (home to the world’s most powerful climate modelling computer).Holtzbrinck also owns Macmillan Learning, Macmillan Publishing and Palgrave Macmillan.Macmillan Learning sells educational materials, classroom kits, and interactive teaching tools. They: “maintain deep partnerships with the world’s best researchers, educators, administrators, and developers.”Macmillan Publishing targets English and German retail book markets. Among its dozen imprints are: St. Martin’s Press, Henry Holt and S. Fischer.Palgrave Macmillan targets academics and businesses with books and periodicals focussed on economics, history and political science.(Altogether Holtzbrinck owns hundreds of academic journals; scores of which run climate-related papers.)Holtzbrinck Digital and Holtzbrinck Science oversee 31 companies engaged in software development and marketing. These companies dovetail with 165 tech start-ups bankrolled by Holtzbrinck Ventures.*Family-owned newspapers include:Handelsblatt – a Dusseldorf-based business daily, circulation: 127,000.Tagesspiegel – a Berlin-based current affairs daily, circulation: 148,000.Die Zeit – a high-brow Hamburg-based weekly with 500,000 buyers and 2 million readers. For decades Die Zeit was co-published with former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt – a pioneering climate crusader.Die Zeit internet portals attract 12 million unique monthly visitors. (Europe’s German-speaking population: 97 million.)*CEO Stefan von Holtzbrinck directs several philanthropies and Chairs the Max Planck Foundation.Holtzbrinck’s board consists of: Klaus-Dieter Lehmann (Chair), Bernd Scheifele (Deputy Chair), Jurgen Mlynek, Monika Schoeller (and her daughter Christiane).Bernd Scheifele is Chair of Heidelberg Cement and Supervisory Chair of Phoenix Pharmaceuticals.Monika (b. 1939) was given reign over book publisher S. Fischer in 1974. She twice launched genres: one dealing with Germans’ processing of their Third Reich experiences; and one dealing with German women’s changing roles. Monika married literary scholar Bernd Schoeller.Monika manages multiple foundations, most importantly the S. Fischer Foundation which cooperates closely with Germany’s Foreign Office and the Goethe-Institut.Klaus-Dieter Lehmann ran West Germany’s national library before unification and the German National Library thereafter. A former Bertelsmann Stiftung Trustee, Lehmann now oversees 17 cultural foundations; and is a Deutsche Bank director. Since 2008 he has presided over the Goethe-Institut.(Pre-1945 the “German Academy” was a ‘worldview weapon’ and espionage center commanded by Rudolf Hess and later Joseph Goebbels. Renamed “Goethe-Institut,” it now deploys 1,000 staff and a $415 million stipend from Germany’s Foreign Office to: spread the German language; instil positive images of Germany; and facilitate cooperation with German institutions.)Theoretical physicist, Jurgen Mlynek, put 16 years in at the German Research Foundation (GSF); the last 4 as Vice President.(Despite its notorious past, GRF annually channels $4 billion in government funds to 100 university departments.)From 2005-15 Mlynek ran the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.(With a $5 billion budget the Helmholtz Association employs 40,000 science workers across 19 centres. Climate-oriented funding categories include: Polar and Marine, Environmental Health, Environmental Research, Geoscience, Coasts, and Oceans.)*Holtzbrinck subsidiaries and officials oversee some forty foundations most of which participate in the 22,000-member Association of German Foundations.Holtzbrinck communiques abound with references to: corporate responsibility, organic growth and sustainability. Subsidiaries agonise over their carbon footprints. Holtzbrinck donates to: Earth Day Network, Ocean Conservation, Goddard, Euroscience Open Forum, and Science Media Centres.ConclusionNot alone does Germany bear Climate’s cross. Germany is, however, uniquely burdened by an ecological industrial complex compelling kaiser-sized commitment to this crusade. German agriculture and industry require a climate-rationalised “energy transition.” Germany’s foreign policy establishment, Holtzbrinck and Bertelsmann included, press this request.Abandon all notions of impartial climate science. In publish-or-perish academia, publishers reign. In Holtzbrinck’s alarmist legions march a thousand journal editors.Shoppers at Barnes & Noble or Waterstones shouldn’t mistake hundreds of imprints for hundreds of publishers. Most books on display, nearly all climate ones, merit the imprint: “German Foreign Office.”SourcesBertelsmann SE & Cohttps://www.bertelsmann.com/#st-1Bertelsmann Stiftunghttps://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/home/Holtzbrinck Publishing Grouphttps://www.holtzbrinck.com/Landler, Mark.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and a former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is here. One of the foundational principles of democracy is that the public has a right to know. That right extends to what the government is doing and why. The practical application of this principle lies, in part, in the access that Parliament, the media and the general public have to information about the government’s policies, programs, revenues and expenditures. At the more detailed level, the “transparency” of government actions can be assured through the enforcement of the laws that govern public access to the information that the government has. Canada’s Access to Information Act is supposed to assure that access. Much of the time, the most valuable part of the information people seek is the analysis that underlies and justifies specific policies and actions. Governments are rightly expected to make decisions not just for political reasons to satisfy one group or constituency, but also based on evidence that the decisions taken will serve the broad public interest and are based on good advice. When a government refuses to provide such access, the public has good reason to be concerned. A Case in Point – Information about the Impact of Carbon Pricing on Canadians The implementation by the federal and provincial governments of various systems of carbon dioxide pricing is one of the central components of the current Canadian climate policy framework. Virtually all of the information issued by the federal government about the impact of carbon dioxide pricing, however, has been in the reports issued by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), all of which show that the pricing regimes will have generally low adverse impacts on the Canadian economy. I am a retired federal public servant who for several years worked on energy and environmental policy topics and for a brief period worked in Finance Canada. Based on this experience, I am well aware that the primary responsibility for assessing and analyzing the macroeconomic (i.e. all-economy) effects of major public policies lies with Finance Canada, not ECCC. On January 16, 2019, I wrote to Finance Canada seeking, under the Access to Information Act (ATIP), access to the documents containing analysis or comments by Finance Canada officials on the economic effects of carbon taxes on Canada. The period I requested correspondence from was January 1, 2017 to January 15, 2019. I received several notices stating that my request could not be answered within the timeframe normally required by the Act, which I protested. The Government’s Response In mid-September, 2019, eight months after my request, I received a response from Denise Brennan, Director of  the Access to Information and Privacy Division of Finance Canada enclosing a compact disk with some correspondence on it. I was astounded to find that, with one exception, the correspondence included bore little relationship to my request. The one document that was relevant was a memorandum from Sean Keenan of the Sales Tax Division to Andrew Marsland, Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, Tax Policy, concerning an attached report called the “Carbon Pricing Impact Write-Up”. This document was described as having been prepared jointly by officials of Finance Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada. In the event, almost every part of the document was blanked out except for the information that has already been published by the government. Notably, the entire section of analysis, including pages 191 to 238, were blanked out. The explanation given was that the information had been withheld in accordance with sections 14, 21(1) (a), and 21 (1) (b) of ATIP. Those sections relate to protection of information “injurious to the conduct by the government of federal-provincial relations”, “advice or recommendations developed by or for a government institution or minister of the Crown”, and “an account of consultations” in which officials participate. It is a travesty to suggest that the straight-forward analysis of economic impacts by itself fits under any of these exemptions. It is also simply unbelievable that Finance Canada at no time over the period January 1, 2017 to January 15, 2019 provided any analysis to the Minister of Finance Canada about the potential and actual macroeconomic effects of carbon taxation. In short, it seems highly likely that officials of Finance Canada deliberately denied my public access to information relating to the adverse effects of carbon dioxide pricing, in contravention of the  Act. One can only surmise that the delays in responding to the ATIP request, and the failure to reveal the contents of correspondence in accordance with the requirements of the Act, were motivated by political considerations; specifically, to avoid embarrassment to the government that would be caused if the true costs of the carbon taxing regime were revealed. As a former federal public servant, I am fully aware of the pressures that Ministers can place on officials to avoid the public release of information embarrassing to the government. I simply prefer that higher standards of integrity and non-partisanship prevail. I will write to the Office of the Information Commissioner to protest. Conclusion By denying my right, and by extension the public’s right, to fair disclosure of information about the impacts of carbon dioxide pricing, Finance Canada has helped the government to hide information that is of potentially great significance to an issue that will be prominent in the current federal election campaign. Carbon dioxide pricing will raise Canadians’ energy costs across the board, especially in the provinces and industries that rely heavily on oil, natural gas and coal. It will especially affect companies that bear the burden of additional taxes but will receive no rebates and will still have to compete with firms in countries with low or no carbon dioxide taxes, like the USA, Mexico and China, Canada’s three largest trading partners. Canadians should have the right to know what the government’s own economic experts warn about these impacts.  One can only conclude that the its intent is to hide bad news. By not allowing the information to be made public, the government has denied the public’s rights and undermined an important facet of our democracy. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

 Here is a list of key organisations actively promoting the war against civilisation. These are the internationalist thugs who want the poor to stay impoverished and the hungry to remain starving. These are the people who fraudulently claim tax deductibility for their actions in attacking every kind of genuine human progress. These are the dangerous elements who campaign to divert gigantic sums of public money into subsidising sources of energy which cannot function competitively without the assistance of stolen money.
Here is the list: Number one is GetUp!, leading the racist campaign against the Adani company, pushing the line that the poor of India have no right to the inexpensive energy which they crave because they are only Indians.
Number two is Greenpeace, infamous for many reasons including its campaign against DDT, which according to Robert Gwadz of the US National Institutes of Health “may have killed 20 million children” who died unnecessarily from malaria.
Number three is the Australian Conservation Foundation, which confers demigod status on the totally discredited fraudster Al Gore, and persists in its wholly false claim that governments give massive subsidies to the coal industry.
Number four is Seed, a relatively new arrival on the anti-civilisation block. Seed asserts on its Website: Climate Change is the biggest threat to Black Australia, which is a big call. Seed also proclaims: “Opening up our lands to mining is not a solution to black poverty.” Wise Australians such as Warren Mundine keep repeating that the solutions include jobs and training. Seed seems to be on the wrong team.
Number five is the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, which specialises in recycling. That is recycling propaganda from all the other anti-civilisation groups without contributing anything original or imaginative. And of course the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, like its allies, has an expert fundraising pitch to part the unwary from their dollars.

Number six is 350.org. On 21 May this year I had something to say about this bunch of economic saboteurs who were illegally occupying offices of the Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne. One clown fell off the roof and injured his ankle, poor chap. The same mob staged protests earlier in the same week in Auckland and in Ho Chi Minh City.
Number seven is Doctors for the Environment Australia which has three identifiable members one of whom is a doctor. Doctors for the Environment Australia hates coal and seems to have missed out on the information that without coal, medical science could not have progressed beyond the eighteenth century.
Number eight is Friends of the Earth, founded in 1969 and now with four and a half decades of expertise in posturing as some kind of charitable institution while pushing hardline anti-enterprise, anti-energy politics.
Number nine is Market Forces, a daughter organisation of Friends of the Earth. Market Forces specialises in bullying financial institutions into divestment campaigns. In other words they have chosen a name exactly the opposite of their beliefs and aspirations.
Number ten is the Wilderness Society, spawned as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society around 1976 to provide a spiritual home for lonely Lake Pedder Activists. For practical purposes the Wilderness Society is an extension of the Greens.
All ten of these anti-civilisation organisations have sponsored a letter signed by sixty-one self-appointed prominent Australians asking world leaders to consider a ban on new coal mines. I will have more to say about this in coming days, but II should mention some of the useful idiots – to use Lenin’s term – who have signed this fool letter. Professor Fiona Stanley, author Richard Flanagan, Bernie Fraser, Bishop George Browning and Wallaby David Pocock, who endorses the example of Peter Fitzsimons that skill and courage on the Rugby field do not necessarily bestow common sense.
I remind these sixty-one easily misled busybodies that their war on coal is a major threat to the poor and disadvantaged of the world. How dare you campaign to entrench their poverty and intensify their misery!
If you agree with me, back me up. If you disagree, prove me wrong.
More about the War on Coal
Grant Goldman Editorial, Super Radio Network Thursday 29 October 2015 Yesterday I listed ten organisations which are expert at extracting money from the public to purse their war against civilisation. These internationalist thugs skilfully portray themselves as motivated by humanitarian or conservationist ideas and love to illustrate their websites with furry animals which of course will all become extinct unless one immediately sends money. I explained that these are the people who fraudulently claim tax deductibility for their actions in attacking every kind of genuine human progress. They want the poor to stay impoverished and the hungry to remain starving. These ten organisations campaign to divert gigantic sums of public money into subsidising sources of energy which cannot function competitively without the assistance of stolen money.
And those ten organisations have again proved the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin dictum that there will always be plenty of useful idiots willing to help destroy society. They have found sixty- one useful idiots who have signed a letter asking world leaders to consider a ban on new coal mines. This foolishness has had wall-to-wall coverage on the ABC. In promoting hour after hour the self-styled sixty-one prominent Australians, to the best of my knowledge the National Broadcaster has scrupulously failed to mention the ten malign organisations who have been calling the shots. They are GetUp!, Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Seed, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, 350.org, Doctors for the Environment Australia, Friends of the Earth, Market Forces, and the Wilderness Society.
An interesting coincidence appears too good to be true for the enemies of civilisation. The war on coal letter just happened to appear concurrently with the appointment of Australia’s new chief scientist, who also wants to abolish coal. This chap also wants to abolish oil and gas. In fairness to Alan Finkel, his professed enthusiasm for nuclear energy sets him apart from most of the enemies of coal and saves him from being a total fool.
All nine of these anti-civilisation organisations have sponsored a letter signed by sixty-one self-appointed prominent Australians asking world leaders to consider a ban on new coal mines. I will have more to say about this in coming days, but II should mention some of the useful idiots – to use Lenin’s term – who have signed this fool letter. Professor Fiona Stanley, author Richard Flanagan, Bernie Fraser, Bishop George Browning and Wallaby David Pocock, who endorses the example of Peter Fitzsimons that skill and courage on the Rugby field do not necessarily bestow common sense.
Here are five facts about Australia Coal, quoting from Australasian Science Magazine of June 2012:
1. Coal was Australia’s first known export. It was first exported from Newcastle in 1799, and destined for Bengal in India.
2. The coal industry directly employs over 40,000 people and a further 100,000 indirectly.
3. Total production of raw black coal in Australia was 405 million tonnes in 2010-11. After processing, 326 million tonnes of black coal was available for both domestic use and for export.
4. Coal is the fuel for around 77% of Australia’s electricity.
5. Every year, the coal industry pays billions of dollars to Commonwealth and state governments in the form of corporate taxes, natural resource royalties, and payment of freight charges. Coal mines will pay an estimated $4.5 billion in royalties to state governments in 2011-12. This provides funding for hospitals, schools and roads.
There we are, just five of the important facts about coal.
Coal is part of Australia.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who was a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that. He is s frequent contributor to Friends of Science Society.Changes in Traditional Application of Environmental PolicyYears ago, environmental policy in Canada was concerned primarily with protection or enhancement of nature through the regulation of activities that polluted air, land and water, especially where this had a significant impact on human health. This included requiring environmental assessment and review of major projects to ensure, before government permits were issued, that the agencies issuing the permits had taken fully into account the potential effects on local environmental quality and human health. That changed when governments began to focus on the claim that human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), central to the operation of modern economies, could have catastrophic future effects on the global climate. The adoption of aspirational international greenhouse gas emission targets as national policy moved the avoidance of global environmental effects to the centre of the national environmental policy agenda.Today, there are dozens of environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) that operate on both the traditional program activities related to protecting nature and avoiding local pollution and the more recent promotion of GHG emission reduction. To reduce GHG emissions, they seek a fundamental transformation of the Canadian economy away from reliance on fossil fuels. Most of these organizations have charity status under the Income Tax Act, and are regulated as such by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). ENGOs must submit annual reports on their activities and finances. These reports are made public, and thus offer very useful, although not comprehensive, information to the Canadian public about how ENGOs with charity status operate.The purpose of this article is to summarize the results of a survey of the information contained in the annual reports to the CRA by the 40 largest ENGOs, and to compare this with other organizations that also seek to influence environmental policies in Canada.Revenues of the largest ENGOs in CanadaTable 1 is a list of the largest ENGOs in Canada, ranked according to the revenues that they have received over the period 2000 to 2018. They include a wide variety of organizations ranging from some that are quasi-governmental in nature, such as the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), to relatively small, one-issue activist groups like the Climate Reality Project. They include both organizations that carry on a diverse set of activities and programs, such as Ducks Unlimited, and those with a single-issue or more regional focus such as Wildsight.Table 1Note: There are 34 listings here that incorporate 40 organizations. Some organizations have an advocacy and foundation or charitable arm. These have been combined in the table under one name and notes.Revenues of Environmental Law OrganizationsTable 2 is a list of environmental law organizations, again ranked according to the revenues received over the period 2000 to 2018. These organizations are primarily engaged in legal activities that they perceive to further the environmental policy agenda. These can range from lobbying activities to inform and influence the development and passage of legislation to intervening before regulatory bodies and launching lawsuits and court challenges to stop specific projects from proceeding.Table 2Revenues of the Main Political Parties in CanadaTable 3 is a list of the main political parties at the federal government level in Canada as well as a selective list of political parties at provincial government level, also ranked in order of revenues.Table 3Revenues of Competitive Market Think TanksFinally, Table 4 is a list of the “think tanks”, or public policy institutes with policy perspectives emphasizing the use of competitive market forces rather than government action to achieve public policy objectives.  Their analyses often place them in competition with the more interventionist views of the ENGOs, and sometimes they are considered by ENGOs as adversaries.Table 4The Story Told by the NumbersThe top 40 ENGOs received about $11.2 billion over the period 2000 to 2018.The “EnviroLaw” organizations received about $167 million over that same period.The combined revenues of the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts was almost $11.4 billion over the period.The total revenues received by all four main federal political parties over the period was about $631 million.The total revenues received by the major political parties at the federal government level and the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta over the period were $1.5 billion.The total revenues received by the market oriented (“conservative”) institutes over the period was $412 million.The revenues received by the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts over the period was over 18 times the revenues received by all federal political parties, and over 27 times the revenues received by the market oriented institutes.Both Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Nature Conservancy Canada annually receive higher revenues than all the major federal political parties; a large portion of the funding to these organizations is from the federal government.The revenue received by the Tides organization alone is more than the combined revenues of Canada’s two largest federal political parties, the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada over the period.The David Suzuki Foundation’s average annual revenues exceed the annual revenues of the federal New Democratic Party.Eight ENGOs have annual revenues that exceed those of the governing Liberal Party of Canada.Some ImplicationsAcross Canada there has been a concern expressed at all levels of government about the intrusion of “Big Money” and foreign influences into domestic politics. The Trudeau government has claimed that it wishes to identify and reduce such influencesYet, simply by reviewing the funding documented in the CRA files, we are now aware of the surprising concentration of wealth in non-profit, charitable organizations and their ability to influence public-policy in much the same way that we worried about “Big Money”.No one should be under any doubt that, whatever their other purposes and activities, Canadian ENGOs are significant political organizations. They use their large funds to influence public opinion and to lobby federal and provincial governments in ways that support their views, even when those views are directly at odds with the economic interests of certain regions, industries or firms. Money alone gives them clout, and they are not ashamed to use it.They are able to use their funds and influence to shape environmental policy and regulation.This might be entirely acceptable in a democracy, except for a few things. One is that many of these organizations were created by and remain heavily funded by foreign foundations that may not have Canadian interests at heart. At a minimum, Canadians should be able to see which foreign sources are pulling the strings, especially when the competitiveness or market access of Canadian firms is at stake.Secondly, the ENGOs almost all enjoy charity status and are thusImage licensed from Shutterstock.free from having to pay income tax. The result is what Finance Canada would call a “tax expenditure”, or a draw on the federal treasury caused not by a direct expenditure of funds but by tax treatment that departs from the norm. As that expenditure must be paid for, it is a cross-subsidy from all the other taxpayers of Canada. Some of the ENGOs’ activities appear to conflict with the fundamental purposes of charitable, non-taxable status. For the industries harmed by current climate policies, and especially the hydrocarbons industry of western Canada, subsidizing the adversary must be an especially bitter pill to swallow.~~~Related: Friends of Science Oct. 12, 2018 letter to Finance Minister Morneau on the activities of environmental charities.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/12/an-open-letter-to-the-minister-of-finance-on-the-matter-of-changes-to-the-charities-act/ Sources:For Canadian-based non-profit, charitable organizations all revenues are taken from publicly available CRA T-3010s reported in $CDN as reported in the year of filing.For Canadian-based non-profit, charitable organizations that are independently operating of their parent American organizations all revenues are taken from publicly available CRA T-3010s reported in $CDN as reported in the year of filing.For organizations that are dual registered as non-profit, charitable organizations in Canada and the US, all revenues are taken from publicly available CRA T-3010s reported in $CDN  as reported in the year of filing.For Canadian-based non-profit organizations all revenues were extracted from publicly available Annual reports issued by the organizations reported in $CDN as reported in the year of filing.For Stand.earth – FNA FOrestEthics – an American based non-profit organization operating in Canada the revenues were taken from IRS 990s reported in $US as reported in the year of filing.For Canadian Federal Political Parties all revenues were obtained Annual Party Financial reports filed with Elections Canada.For Canadian provincial Political Parties all revenues were obtained from Annual Party Financial reports filed with the appropriate Provincial Elections organizations: Elections BC, Elections Alberta, Elections Ontario, and Élections Québec.Where an organization operates more than one registered non-profit, charitable organization, the revenues have been combined as reported in the year of filing.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"By Cliff Ollier
A new book has been produced on the coast of South Australia (1). It is essentially about coastal geomorphology and includes much that I shall not mention here such as tectonics, coastal processes, coastal management and human impacts on coasts. This brief note presents, mainly in their own words, what they have to say about aspects of carbonate production.
BACKGROUND
The South Australian coast originated with the separation of Antarctica and Australia about 43 million years ago, but the continental margin is well to the south of the present coast. During higher sea levels of the Late Eocene (37 to 34 Ma), the coast stood several hundred kilometres landward of its present location.

Some parts of the South Australian coast are exceptionally stable while other parts have moved up and down, to make a series of fault blocks. The Last Interglacial (130-118 ka ago) shoreline stood ~2 m higher than present sea level on the stable parts. Sediments deposited at that time are called the Glanville Formation. Fringing the coast of Eyre Peninsula on the stable Gawler Craton, the Glanville Formation lies at 2 m above present sea level but it has been tectonically depressed (-7 m at Port Adelaide), uplifted on Fleurieu Peninsula (+10 m at Normanville; +6 m at Victor Harbor), depressed at Goolwa (-0.8 m) in the Murray Estuary and progressively uplifted on the Coorong Coastal Plain to a maximum of +18 m near Mount Gambier.
The Glanville Formation contains inter-tidal, warm water fauna, including the mollusc Anadara trapezia (now locally extinct) which shows this higher than present shoreline was warmer than the present. At the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, some 22,000 years ago, sea level was about 125 m below the present level. Large areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, and wind blew sediments inland. After that sea level rose and reached present levels about 7,000 years ago.
THE CARBONATE SAND FACTORY
Apart from bedrock areas the coasts are dominated by carbonate sands in beaches and dunes. At many points in the book the authors refer to the ‘carbonate factory’ that produces it, and even claim it is “… part of the world’s largest temperate carbonate factory”.
“The sources of the sediment for these coastal successions were the Lacepede and Bonney Shelves, which represent a subtidal carbonate factory with the prolific growth of calcareous marine invertebrates such as molluscs, bryozoans, coralline algae, echinoids, and foraminifers. The post mortem attrition of these organisms leads to the formation of sand-sized sedimentary particles of calcium carbonate”.
“In Gulf St Vincent seagrasses thrive in the subtidal and intertidal shallow warm waters, with extremely productive calcareous algae, foraminifers and molluscan organisms manufacturing vast amounts of calcareous sediment. The accumulation of these … sediments has generated the resultant wide intertidal and supratidal flats visible today by causing the shoreline to aggrade (build up) and prograde (build seawards)”.
“The dominant processes of coastal development in the protected, tidally dominated waters of the northern Spencer Gulf are related to the massive production and accumulation of biogenic skeletal carbonate fragments derived from coralline algae, foraminifers, molluscs and bryozoans; the site is a ‘major carbonate factory’, sequestering much CO2.”
Furthermore aeolianite dunes also depend on the process. “The aeolianites are primarily composed of marine carbonate, reflecting the absence of streams delivering terrestrial, quartzose sediments to the coast”.
“The sand-sized particles of calcium carbonate derived from the mechanical abrasion of marine invertebrates were entrained landwards by inner-shelf currents, and subsequently brought on land by aeolian processes to form thick dune deposits, which are interbedded with relict soil profiles (paleosols) that formed during periods of lower sea levels. The presence of aeolianite reflects the prolonged history of aridity of the Australian continent and the paucity of terrigenous-clastic sediment delivered to much of the coastline of southern Australia”.
“The coastline of South Australia is part of the world’smobdro for ios largest aeolianite (dune limestone) temperate sedimentary carbonate province, which extends from western Victoria to north of Shark Bay, Western Australia. The aeolianite deposits attest to the high calcium carbonate bioproductivity of the surrounding continental shelf environments”.
And the carbonate sand is important even offshore:
“It has been demonstrated that the Murray Canyons Group [submarine canyons] is still being actively modified, with sediment transport to the oceanic deeps more than 100 km from the foot slope. Given the lack of river sediment supply, the marine carbonate ‘factories’ of the Lacepede Shelf provide the main supply of sediments for turbidity currents. Initially, canyon erosion involved mainly land-sourced sediment, with later cutting predominantly by biogenic carbonates produced on the continental shelf”.
In the debates about Global Warming, now usually referred to with the less specific title Climate Change, the alarmists place much emphasis on the role of carbon dioxide. First its role as a greenhouse gas was supposed to cause warming. Then to demonise it further it was supposed to cause ‘acidification’ of the oceans, despite the fact that the oceans have been alkaline throughout their existence on Earth. We are supposed to reduce the production of anthropogenic carbon dioxide to ‘protect’ the ocean.
The ‘carbonate factories’ described here show that carbon dioxide is vital for the production of carbonate sands and ultimately limestone, and of course for the formation of the past and presents coasts. It is part of the big geochemical picture: carbon dioxide originates from volcanic eruptions and is fixed by limestone formation. Trying to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the ocean by reducing emissions by human activities is not only futile, but if it could be done it would have harmful consequences on all the carbonate fixing animals and plants in the ocean, and ultimately on the shape of the continent.

In his speech today, President Obama laid out his plan—formulated around executive action—to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in hopes of mitigating future climate change.   
  
  
Funny thing is, absent his Climate Action Plan, the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have been on the decline for a decade, and now are at about the same level as our emissions in the early 1990s. In fact, the decline in emissions is taking place at a rate faster than the one sought by the president.   
  
  
So why mess with a good thing? There is no way that introducing a bunch of new government regulations is going to improve the situation. If the Great Recession is any indication, the outcome of government involvement in the energy industry will be a poor one.   
  
  
And to what end? As I have repeatedly shown, reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions has no significant impact on the future course of climate change.   
  
  
On top of that, new science is accumulating that indicates that the future course of climate change is likely to be less steep than our current climate model‐​based estimates.   
  
  
And despite the president’s long list of supposed climate wrongs that are consistent with human‐​caused climate change, there is an equally long list of climate wrongs that have been _averted_ for reasons “consistent with” climate change.   
  
  
Taken together, declining U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and declining estimates of climate change, should have been enough to convince the president that things were already on the proper track—no government intervention necessary.   
  
  
But this administration is characterized by intervening where it is not necessary. The president’s Climate Action Plan is more of the same.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019.Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here.Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg usually gets a pass from the media in terms of never challenging her claims about the effects of human activity on global warming. No one seems to confront her over the adverse effects of the “strikes” that organizers lead, with her as the symbolic Joan of Arc waging war against the capitalists. Maybe, however, they would take some advice about what would actually happen if the countries of the world were to heed her calls for an end to the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) within the next ten years, if not sooner.I have spent over 40 years studying, analyzing and advising on energy policy issues in Canada, so I think I can make a reasonable claim to knowing far more about the subject than a sixteen-year-old high school dropout. I acknowledge that I suffer from the bias of thinking that facts matter, and that hysteria about energy and environmental issues will ultimately not overcome common sense. So, let me present some facts that those listening to Greta might want to take into account.First, fossil fuels now supply 84 % of the world’s energy needs, with nuclear energy and hydroelectricity supplying most of the rest. Renewable energy, which Greta favours, supplies only 4%, despite several decades of massive subsidies by governments. The share of energy supplied by fossil fuels varies considerably by country. In the poorer countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, it typically supplies over 95% of people’s energy needs.The prominence of fossil fuels in the energy mix is not an accident or the work of evil energy companies. Coal, oil and natural gas are plentiful, reliable and relatively inexpensive. Because of this, consumers and industry have been increasing their use of fossil fuels for over 150 years, and the patterns of consumption are embedded in the infrastructure: the roads, buildings, bridges, transit systems and vehicles that we all use. Oil, in particular, has four major advantages that make people want to use it – high energy density (the amount of energy per unit of mass), ease of transport, low cost and safety of storage. Because of these advantages, oil provides 97 % of the energy needs of transportation. Natural gas, while less dense and more expensive to store and transport, is clean-burning and versatile. It is also an ideal fuel for power generation, residential and commercial heating, and crop drying. Coal is more expensive to transport and burn cleanly, but coal resources are present in large quantities in over 40 countries. Coal is also cheap to produce; it still dominates in the supply of fuel for power generation.It is, quite simply, impossible to end the use of these energy sources within ten years or even within 30 years. Nonetheless, let us for the sake of illustration examine what would happen if some world government were to decree that fossil fuel use must end immediately.Almost all motorized transport would stop. The cars, trucks, buses, trains, marine vessels and aircraft would stop moving. People would not be able to go from place to place without walking, cycling, or riding horses, and there would not be enough horses. It would take months, not hours, to move long distances. The movement of goods would decline dramatically. Consequently, companies would not be able to obtain the materials that they need to make things, and they would not be able to move the products they make to where people live. Most companies would have to close, putting millions of people out of work. Similarly, people would not be able to get to work if they lived more than a few miles away, so they would lose what jobs were left available.Farmers would not be able to obtain the supplies, fertilizers or pesticides they need to plant their crops and they would not have modern farm machinery and tractors to do the work. Food production would drop sharply in all parts of the world, as agricultural practices went back to what they were at the end of the 19th century. As those practices could only support about 1.5 billion people, six billion people would starve.Without natural gas and coal, there would be a shortage of electricity generation capacity and fuel for residential and commercial heating. Almost all parts of the world would experience blackouts and brownouts. This would make modern manufacturing impossible, so those industries would shut down. In the colder countries like Canada, the forest would be cut down to provide residential heating. But once the firewood supply is exhausted, millions of people would become sick and/or freeze in wintertime. There would no longer be any air-conditioning. The absence and/or unreliability of electricity would end the use of several modern conveniences like stoves, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, radios, televisions, computers and cellular telephones.The end of oil would also mean that the products made from oil would no longer be available, including petrochemical feedstocks. That would mean that no one could in future make things like rubber, plastic, roofing, paints, pens, synthetic clothing fibres, dyes, computers, CDs and DVDs, deodorants, eye glasses, telephones or detergents, to name only a few.Because of the shortages of so many things, prices would rise significantly, even as incomes fell. People would not be able to get most of the goods and services on which they now depend. Older people would be most vulnerable. Hospitals would not be able to get many of the medications that they need nor be able conduct operations with the anesthetics now available. Many people would die as a result.As these changes would take place overnight, or even within a year, they would pose enormous problems that governments would not be equipped to confront. The public in almost all countries would find these changes intolerable and would revolt against them. It is likely that in many areas there would be a breakdown of civil order, and chaos would result. If governments attempted to enforce the end of fossil fuels, they would have to do so by imposing dictatorships. It is unlikely that the countries of the world as now organized could survive such a transition. Fortunately, it is unlikely that I would live long enough tosee such a tragedy. Greta would, though.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

"**At least five people have died and dozens more have been rescued after a dinghy crowded with migrants capsized in the Mediterranean.**
Rescuers dived into the water to help when the boat, which had around 100 people on board, collapsed near Libya.
The charity that operates the humanitarian ship Open Arms said it had carried out the rescue on Wednesday.
The UN says more than 750 people have died in the Mediterranean this year trying to make the journey to Europe.
""The rescue operations are finished, everyone is onboard, but we have five dead,"" Veronica Alfonsi, a spokeswoman for Open Arms, told AFP news agency.
""Among the survivors, we have two infants and five children, and two pregnant women,"" she added.
Earlier, the Spanish charity said it had rescued those on board without help from the authorities. ""That's what happens when you leave people at sea for days,"" it wrote on Twitter.
The rubber dinghy sank off the coast of the Libyan town of Sabratha, which is near to the Italian island of Lampedusa.
Italian officials have reported an increase in migrant arrivals from North Africa this year. ""The sea conditions are fine right now, and this is the reason why there are so many boats out there,"" Ms Alfonsi said.
Those on board are reported to have been travelling for two days before the vessel sank. Open Arms said it would ask the Italian authorities to allow the rescued migrants to disembark on Lampedusa.
""We need the governments to set up a new joint sea rescue operation and humanitarian corridors to grant safe routes of movement and escape,"" Riccardo Gatti, the charity's president, said.
Some 30,800 people have landed on Italy's shores so far this year, compared to around 5,200 in the same period last year, according to official data cited by the Reuters news agency.
Meanwhile, the UN says more than 72,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea in 2020.
Earlier, the Spanish emergency services said more than 1,600 African migrants had reached the Canary Islands or been rescued at sea over the weekend.
The Spanish island chain is just 100km (60 miles) off the coast of North Africa."
"LONDON  —   In a deeply embarrassing episode revealed on Sunday, a senior employee of the Israeli Embassy in Britain was recorded plotting to “take down” senior British politicians critical of Israel and calling Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson “an idiot” who “has become minister of foreign affairs without any responsibilities. ” The Israeli ambassador, Mark Regev, offered a formal apology on Friday, according to a statement from the Israeli Embassy. The embassy also said that the employee, Shai Masot, who described himself as a former major in the Israeli Army now working as a political officer, would soon leave his job. Mr. Masot made the comment in October, in footage filmed in a London restaurant and obtained by the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. The recording was made by an Al Jazeera reporter acting undercover, who called himself Robin and who described himself as working for a political group called Labour Friends of Israel, which rejected any connection to him. The conversation involved Mr. Masot and Maria Strizzolo, an aide to Robert Halfon, an education minister and former political director of Conservative Friends of Israel. Mr. Masot was particularly eager to target Alan Duncan, a minister in the Foreign Office who has been critical of Israel and its settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, a sensitive issue in British politics. Mr. Duncan, he said, “is causing a lot of problems. ” In the footage, Mr. Masot asked Ms. Strizzolo, “Can I give you some M. P. s that I would suggest you would take down?” he asked. He went on to say that she knew which M. P. s  —   members of Parliament  —   he was referring to. She asked him to remind her. “The deputy foreign minister,” he said, referring to Mr. Duncan. She said, “You still want to go for it?” His reply was ambiguous, but he said that Mr. Duncan was still causing problems. Ms. Strizzolo then asked, “I thought we had, you know, neutralized him just a little bit, no?” Mr. Masot answered, “No. ” Mr. Masot also mocked the opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, whom he called “crazy,” and his “weirdo” supporters. Ms. Strizzolo told the newspaper that her conversation with Mr. Masot was “   and gossipy. ” But Crispin Blunt, a member of Parliament and the chairman of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, said the “apparent activity of a diplomat of a foreign state,” in reference to Mr. Masot, was “formally outrageous and deserving of investigation. ” (In the video, Mr. Masot was also very critical of Mr. Blunt.) Stuart Polak, a member of the House of Lords and the director of Conservative Friends of Israel, said, “We utterly condemn any attempt to undermine Sir Alan, or any minister, or any member of Parliament. ” In its statement, the Israeli Embassy said it “rejects the remarks concerning Minister Duncan, which are completely unacceptable” and described Mr. Masot as “a junior embassy employee who is not an Israeli diplomat, and who will be ending his term of employment with the embassy shortly. ” Mr. Regev, the statement said, spoke to Mr. Duncan on Friday to apologize “and made clear that the embassy considered the remarks to be completely unacceptable. ” Reached on Sunday, Yiftah Curiel, the embassy spokesman, said that Mr. Masot was “not a diplomat and not a   member of diplomatic corps  —   he’s an assistant to the deputy ambassador, who handles parliamentary affairs. ” Mr. Masot, sent from Israel, has been at the embassy for about a year, on a contract that is being terminated. Mr. Curiel emphasized that the Foreign Office judged the issue concluded. “The Israeli ambassador has apologized and is clear these comments do not reflect the views of the embassy or government of Israel,” a Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement. “The U. K. has a strong relationship with Israel, and we consider the matter closed. ”"

Stop the world. I really do want to get off.



Nelson and Environment Canterbury have declared ‘climate emergencies’, which means…



… that a bunch of placard waving idiots have had some kind of victory, but none of this is going to make the slightest difference to the climate.



It means that panic is being created which will result in stupid things happening, like killing off animals and agriculture unnecessarily to plant trees. There is nothing wrong with planting trees, but seedlings don’t absorb much CO2… not for 30 years or so anyway. According to warmists, we will all be dead by then.



Two ECan councillors showed a modicum of common sense, but they were drowned out by the rabble who clearly think they know best. quote.



[Claire] McKay said ECan had “already shown its leadership in its own mitigation efforts”. 



“I believe this organisation is fulfilling its obligations and what we are doing is clearly outlined in the background paper. But can we meet the wide and varied expectations of the public without funding? I’m concerned that this council hasn’t had that wider conversation to get a mandate. end quote.



Good point, Ms McKay. Placard-waving is one thing, but will the climate activists be so keen when they see a 50% hike in their rates? Of course not. They want someone else to clean up this issue for them. quote.



“If nothing can be, or is able to be, changed, then this is a very hollow gesture. This is not a political decision, but one based on values and ethics. As a governor of this council, symbolic gestures without the ability to make many of the changes called for is simply not good governance.” 



Can we vote Claire McKay for our next prime minister? Such logic and reason simply does not exist elsewhere in either local or national politics these days.



Not everyone agreed with her, though. quote.



Cr Lan Pham?, who moved the recommendation from chief executive Bill Bayfield to declare the climate emergency and also summed up the debate, said declarations of climate emergencies around the world could be described “largely as symbolic”. 



“Absolutely, at face value, they are. My hope for this declaration is that it acts as a snowball effect. 



[Stuff.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/112758855/environment-canterbury-declares-a-regionwide-climate-emergency)



A snowball effect… 



So even councillors in favour of this idiocy admit that it will achieve nothing, but they are doing it anyway. 



**There is no ‘climate emergency’.** Nelson had terrible fires this summer, it is true, but then again, it is an area prone to drought which in turn can often result in deadly fires. Instead of taking steps to mitigate the chances of these fires happening again, which is what a responsible council would do as a priority, the council has declared a ‘climate emergency’, meaning **all they have decided to do is to panic.**



As these fires have occurred regularly for hundreds of years, how can the fires in 2019 suddenly be a ‘climate emergency’ when all of the others were just bush fires? The stupidity is strong here.



The stupidity gets even stronger once central government gets involved. quote.



Climate Change Minister James Shaw agrees global warming has created an emergency, and applauded Environment Canterbury (ECan) and Nelson City councillors for taking the step.



And he revealed some MPs are in discussions about taking a similar stance on a national level.



That would require MPs to approve a motion in Parliament, as they have done in Britain and Ireland in the last few months. 



The state of emergency isn’t binding and has no legal standing. But Shaw says it does have practical significance. 



  
“It says to council offices you need to respond to this as an emergency.  
“And I have to say, my own experience of being in Government over the last 18 months, is it is hard to martial the resources across Government around this overall goal unless you get a political statement that says ‘look the elected members are saying this is so serious that we are actually declaring it as an emergency and therefore we have to organise around it’.” 



  
All this will do will be to create panic, which will result in a lot of stupid things being done. Most people who wave placards have no idea how their lives will be adversely affected if they actually get what they are clamouring for.



James Shaw, for example, might have to curb his little travel habit and attend climate change conferences via Skype. 



Dearie me.



Declaring a state of emergency when there really isn’t one is a grossly irresponsible thing to do. Emergency situations were previously reserved for major floods, fires, droughts or terrorist attacks, which can cause immediate harm and may require control over public services and possible use of the armed forces in unexpected ways. These ‘climate emergencies’ require no such things, and are a complete nonsense.



The thing that worries me is that those in governance, both local and central, are the ones we look to for leadership at times like this, but in this case they are fanning the flames of panic, encouraging people to do stupid things. The lengths some people will go to for votes is really horrifying. 



First there was peak oil, and we never actually got there. Now there is ‘peak stupid’, and we got there very fast.

On Monday, the EPA announced a set of ambitious, and potentially onerous new regulations aimed at reducing the carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants in the U.S. by 30% by the year 2030. The regulations are part of President Obama’s plan to “lead by example” when it comes to tackling climate change.



But there is an underlying scientific truth that the EPA and President Obama do not want to reveal. The effort, no matter how large, to restrict carbon dioxide emissions from the U.S. will have no scientifically detectable impact of the future course of the weather and climate at any scale, global, regional, or local.





The risk for negative outcomes from these regulations exceeds positive ones.



So it doesn’t matter whether the EPA proposes regulations to reduce power plant emissions by 30% by 2030, or by 50%, or even 100% by tomorrow. Aside from the varying degrees of economic and social chaos that will arise, the impact on the climate will be the same. None.



The same is true for the impact on the weather. The future will still hold all manner of extreme events like tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts floods, heat waves and blizzards. And nobody will be able to detect any change in their characteristics resulting from the EPA actions to restrict carbon dioxide emissions.



This is not because carbon dioxide emissions from human activities don’t add a pressure for the earth’s temperature to rise; they do. But it is because the level of natural noise in the climate system is high, and because the relative U.S. contribution to the global carbon dioxide emissions total is meager and in rapid decline.



The days of carbon dioxide emissions from the U.S. and other developed countries dominating the world’s total are behind us. Going forward, it is the developing nations like China and India and their efforts to bring improved energy access to their large populations that have the greatest impact on future climate change.



For example, mainstream projections of climate change between now and the end of the century are for the earth’s average surface temperature to increase by about 2.5°C. Of that rise, about 2.2°C is expected to come from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from the developing world. Of the remaining 0.3°C of projected temperature rise, the U.S. portion is expected to be about half of that, or about 0.15°C.



That’s it. That’s all the warming that the President and the EPA are able to thwart.



But they are not keen on telling you that.



They avoid talking about how much future climate change the new regulations will avert, and instead, throw out some impressive‐​sounding numbers about aspects other than the climate. For example, in introducing the new regulations, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said that by 2030, the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the regulations would be “like cancelling out annual carbon pollution from two‐​thirds of all cars and trucks in America.” What she didn’t tell you was that according to the EPA’s own models, two‐​thirds of all the cars and trucks in America contribute much less than one one‐​thousandth of a degree of global warming per year. This number is impressive as well—impressively tiny.



So much so, that you begin to wonder as to the overall net result of the EPA regulations.



With such an insignificant impact on the climate, they certainly will not lead to safeguarding the “health of our kids” through climate change mitigation, as President Obama likes to say. In fact, I am pretty sure that we’ll do this job whether or not the climate is changing.



They certainly will lead to higher energy prices—which drives the price of everything else up. Job losses will almost assuredly follow. And there is the potential for increasing the risk to the reliability of our energy supply—which would increase the risk for negative health consequences.



In fact, as far as most analysts can see (aside from those in the EPA), the risk for negative outcomes from these regulations exceeds positive ones.



There is a subtle distinction between setting an example and being made an example of.



By pursuing the former, the President and the EPA are liable to achieve the latter.

"**A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration by supplying small boats to people smugglers.**
It follows an arrest in October as part of a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation into a criminal network.
Officers believe the group was involved in buying at least six vessels, which were then moved to France or Belgium.
Three of those boats were found back in England, having carried migrants across the Channel.
One was found in St Margaret's Bay in Kent on 2 September, a day in which about 400 people reached the UK using small boats.
An 18-year-old Lithuanian national woman was detained at an address in The Cheviots, Hastings, by NCA officers.
A 20-year-old Syrian man was also arrested at an address in London Road, St Leonards-on-Sea.
They are both now being questioned.
A 30-year-old man in Battle Road, Hastings, was apprehended last month and released under investigation.
NCA Branch Commander Matt Rivers said: ""This operation demonstrates that not only are we going after the people smugglers themselves, but we are also targeting their business model by targeting their suppliers.
""These Channel crossings are incredibly dangerous, as shown by recent and historic mass fatalities, and the criminals who organise them are simply exploiting migrants by taking their money and then putting them in life-threatening situations.
""People who willingly make that possible, whether it be through providing social media advertising, financial services or supplying boats, can expect to be pursued by the NCA and held accountable."""

What happens to society when people who are presenting facts are bullied into silence? Canadian MP Lisa Raitt retweeted a Financial Post article written by Dr. Ross McKitrick. The article talked about what happens to people – like Roger Pielke, Jr. – who present climate facts that are counter to popular beliefs. They are usually attacked by the ‘climate mob’ and bullied into silence. That’s exactly what then happened to Lisa Raitt for her retweet! 



Dr. MckItrick then wrote Lisa an open letter, citing numerous climate facts that dispute popular beliefs of many parliamentarians and the public. It was such a great letter, our Communications Manager thought it was worth a public reading. 



The letter is full of wisdom, including an anecdote about one of McKitrick’s friends who lived in the former Soviet Union. That friend pointed out that people silenced themselves under the repressive regime. 



The take-away? Silence makes us victims, so speak up with your views on climate. Have courage and demand open, civil debate on these important issues. See the letter:

He was removed from his post as head of high-yield bond trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa last month, the Financial Times reported.
Citigroup has refused to make any comment on the allegations.
According to reports, Mr Shah, aged 31, was suspended following allegations that he helped himself to sandwiches from the canteen at the bank's London headquarters in Canary Wharf.
It is not clear how many times this happened or over what period of time the alleged behaviour occurred.
The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Shah on LinkedIn, but his profile was unavailable and appears to have been deleted.
Mr Shah is not the first leading City figure to have faced serious consequences because of alleged or proven petty dishonesty.
In 2014, BlackRock director Jonathan Paul Burrows was banned from working in the financial services industry after he was caught regularly avoiding buying a train ticket on his commute to London.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said he should have been a role model for others and his conduct had ""fallen short of the standard expected for someone in his position"".
Mr Shah's departure came weeks before the bank was due to pay annual bonuses to senior employees.
He joined Citigroup in 2017 after spending seven years at HSBC.
His job involved trading in junk bonds, which are issued by companies with low credit ratings or short track records as a means of raising cash.
Because there is a risk that the company that issued them will default and render them worthless, they have to offer a higher return on investment, which is why they are also known as high-yield bonds."

NOAA’s CFS v2 computer forecast model is predicting relatively strong La Nina conditions by later this summer (August/September/October); SST anomalies plot courtesy NOAA
*La Nina may form in the equatorial Pacific Ocean later this year and, if so, it could have wide-ranging ramifications*
Overview
It appears somewhat likely that the current weak El Nino in the equatorial part of the central Pacific Ocean will transition into La Nina conditions later this summer.  La Nina is a naturally occurring oceanic cycle that produces colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific Ocean whereas El Nino is associated with warmer-than-normal water. If indeed La Nina forms later this year, it could have ramifications on the upcoming Atlantic Basin tropical season, prospects for drought in California, and potentially on global temperatures in the lower atmosphere.

The plot shows forecasts made by dynamical and statistical models for sea surface temperatures (SST) anomalies in the “Nino 3.4” region for nine overlapping 3-month periods. Note that the expected skills of the models, based on historical performance, are not equal to one another. The skills also generally decrease as the lead time increases. Thirdly, forecasts made at some times of the year generally have higher skill than forecasts made at other times of the year–namely, they are better when made between June and December than when they are made between February and May. Differences among the forecasts of the models reflect both differences in model design, and actual uncertainty in the forecast of the possible future SST scenario.
Computer model forecasts generally support the formation of La Nina
Several independently-made computer forecast models support the idea of a change in the central part of the tropical Pacific Ocean from the current weak El Nino to La Nina conditions by the summer of 2020.  The plume of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) model forecasts from mid-February indicate a transition to La Nina conditions are likely to take hold by later this summer.  Indeed, some models (e.g., NOAA’s CFS v2) are predicting a fairly strong La Nina by the end of the summer season with sea surface temperatures as much as 1.5°C below-normal in the “Nino 3.4” region (i.e., central tropical Pacific Ocean).

Warm (red) and cold (blue) periods based on a threshold of +/- 0.5°C for the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) [3 month running mean of ERSST.v5 SST anomalies in the “Niño 3.4” region (50°N-50°S, 120°-170°W)], based on centered 30-year base periods updated every 5 years.
Possible impact on the 2020 Atlantic Basin tropical season
One of the surprising side benefits of an El Nino event in the tropical Pacific Ocean is that this type of sea surface temperature pattern (i.e., warmer-than-normal) tends to result in less tropical activity in the Atlantic Basin when compared to normal.  This tendency for reduced tropical activity in the Atlantic Basin is a result of higher-than-normal vertical wind shear in the breeding grounds region of the Atlantic Ocean during El Nino events. Higher-than-normal vertical wind shear tends to inhibit the formation or intensification of tropical systems.
On the contrary, La Nina is often associated with a more active Atlantic Basin tropical season as overall vertical wind shear is usually on the low side in the breeding grounds region. The last time there was a relatively strong La Nina event during the tropical season in the Atlantic Basin was in the year 2010. This particular year saw La Nina-induced sea surface temperature anomalies as low as -1.7°C in the central part of the equatorial Pacific and there was anomalously low vertical wind shear in the tropical Atlantic. As it turned out, the 2010 Atlantic tropical season was the first in a group of three very active seasons. It is tied alongside 1887, 1995, 2011, and 2012 for the third-most active Atlantic tropical season on record, with 19 tropical storms, only behind the 1933 and the 2005 seasons.

Potential impact on global temperatures
What goes on in the Pacific Ocean in terms of sea surface temperatures can indeed have an impact around the world with respect to global temperatures in the lower part of the atmosphere.  If indeed a La Nina does form later this year in the tropical Pacific Ocean and it is relatively strong and long-lasting, it can result in a drop of global temperatures after it becomes well-established. In recent years, the number of El Nino episodes have surpassed the number of La Nina events and global temperatures have often reacted with noticeable spikes (see UAH data temperature plot).  For example, the strong El Nino events that centered on the years of 1997/1998, 2009/2010 and 2015/2016 were associated with sharp upticks in lower atmosphere global temperatures. In times of La Nina such as during 2007/2008 and 2010/2011, there have been noticeable downturns in global temperatures of the lower atmosphere.

California drought
After a long period with severe drought conditions dominating the scene in California, the winter season of 2018-2019 brought significant rainfall to the state and incredible amounts of snow piled up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In fact, the drought was officially declared over by the time spring season began last year. In subsequent months, there have been spurts of dry weather across California, but drought conditions did not really become persistent until a few weeks ago. Contrary to the winter of 2018-2019, this winter season has been rather dry across California and the amount of snow that has fallen in the Sierra Mountain range of eastern California has been below-normal. This reduction of snowfall in the higher elevation locations could very well lead to some problems later this summer as a melting snow pack is an important contributor of water for the state.
In terms of what kind of an impact La Nina conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean could have on California’s weather, the results are rather mixed. La Nina tends to create a looping jet stream centered around high pressure in the Pacific Ocean. If the high pressure system anchors around the international dateline, La Nina tends to bring wetter weather to North America. However, if it centers itself in the eastern Pacific Ocean, it tends to bring drier weather. Finally, if the high pressure system meanders around, the results are often periods of wet and dry weather.
Stay tuned…we’ll continue to monitor the prospects for La Nina as we close in on the tropical season in the Atlantic Basin and certainly nothing is set in stone when it comes to long-range model forecasting of sea surface temperatures.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman©2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is here. Stand.earth recently published a report that allegedly offers the Canadian public information about what the construction of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project Will Look Like and its social and ecological impacts. Entitled, Seven Construction Hotspots: An Overview, the report claims to be the results of research into information “buried in the National Energy Board website”. While the report states that it will identify fundamental problems with the pipeline, it does nothing of the sort. Those who seek insights into the environmental aspects of the project will find no more insights than those who want to know more about the economic and social benefits of the projects, which are deliberately ignored. The report amounts to no more than a cherry-picking of a few environmental issues identified during the National Energy Board’s lengthy and exhaustive review of all aspects of the project in order to find a few that might be described as not fully resolved – that is, if one ignores the evidence or the process. Before examining the so-called hotspots, it would help to provide the background. What does this project entail? The project involves the expansion of an existing oil pipeline system that runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, at which point some of the crude oil would be loaded onto tankers at the Westridge Marine Terminal where it would be delivered to markets throughout the west coast of North America and the Pacific Rim. This pipeline system has operated for 65 years, since 1953. The project would result in the looping (or twinning) of the existing 1,147 km Trans Mountain Pipeline (TMPL) system with about 987 km of new buried pipeline. The older pipeline would be designated Line 1. The proposed new pipeline segments, along with two currently active segments, would become Line 2. The existing pipeline now transports both crude oil and refined petroleum products to British Columbia and export markets in the Puget Sound area as well as California. Today, British Columbia receives over half of its motor gasoline supplies from Alberta via TMPL; the dedication of Line 1 exclusively to refined oil products would increase the security and flexibility of refined oil product supply to British Columbia consumers. In total, the project would increase the capacity of the TMPL system from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined products. Currently, the Westridge Terminal loads about five oil tankers per month with crude oil delivered by TMPL; this has been occurring for decades. The proposed expanded system would increase the number of tanker loads to about 34 per month, or just over one per day. Which organizations reviewed the proposal? The project has been reviewed and approved by the National Energy Board (NEB) and the marine portion has been reviewed and approved by the Transport Canada-led TERMPOL Review Process. Based on the recommendation by the NEB, the federal Cabinet approved the project, and on May 19 2016 the NEB issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity, confirming the project is in Canada’s national interest and is authorized to proceed to construction. The NEB reasons for decision can be read here: https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p80061/114562E.pdf The British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office on January 11 2017 issued an Environmental Assessment Certificate for the project, subject to an additional 37 conditions. The B.C. announcement of this can be read here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2017ENV0001-000047 What did the National Energy Board do? The National Energy Board conducted an extensive review of every aspect of the project in accordance with its requirements under the National Energy Board Act, which requires it to conduct a review based on the Canadian public interest. These subjects included an evaluation of the potential benefits and burdens of the project throughout its entire life cycle, from pre-construction through construction and operation to eventual decommissioning. The topics covered included the need for the pipeline, the safety and engineering integrity of the facilities, the approach to be taken to land acquisition and construction, the economic and financial issues, the impacts on communities and on aboriginal people, and the effects of shipping, among others. The National Energy Board was also responsible to evaluate the project under the Canadian Environment Assessment Act and so it examined the effects of the pipeline on a host of environmental aspects, including air, land and water as well as wildlife; it also reviewed the TMPL plans to avoid accidents that might cause spills and to take rapid action to clean up and remediate any spills that do occur. In carrying out this almost four-and-a-half year review (three years longer that federal guidelines provide for), the NEB collected many thousands of pages of background documentation on all aspects of the project’s design, construction and operation, as well as on the efforts of the pipeline sponsor to consult with affected groups and communities. The NEB’s report alone runs to 553 pages and addresses hundreds of issues, almost all of which were pored over at length during hearings that involved many different intervenors representing dozens of different groups. The report provides an extremely high level of transparency, in that every issue raised by project opponents is addressed, and a reason given for the decision taken by the NEB panel in conducting the review. How was the public engaged in this process? Before applying to the National Energy Board, TMPL held many meetings with communities, landowners and aboriginal people who lived along the route and who might be affected by the project. After the application was filed, the NEB then took many steps to ensure that those who could be potentially affected by the project were aware of it and knew how they could get involved in the review. Over the course of its three and a half years of proceedings, the Board provided over $3 million in participant funding to eligible interveners; 79% of this funding was offered to Aboriginal groups. There were 400 interveners in the review process. In addition, over 1,600 people participated in hearings and 1,250 submitted comments. The Board held public hearing sessions in Edmonton, Calgary, Chilliwack, Kamloops and Victoria. From 2012 to the end of the review process, TMPL had tens of thousands of exchanges with stakeholders through face-to-face meetings, presentations, public forums, technical meetings, community meetings, social media and other means. It held 159 open houses along the pipeline and marine corridors, more than 1,700 meetings with stakeholder groups, and responded to 1,500 emails, 950 media inquiries and 430 media interviews. How many conditions did the NEB attach? The NEB approved the certificate subject to 157 conditions covering the environment, people and lands, engineering and safety, marine traffic, emergency preparedness and regulatory oversight. These conditions are intended to ensure that TMPL’s commitments, plans and programs discussed during the regulatory review are in place so that the Board can assure compliance in future. What Did Stand.earth Do? Stand-earth identified, from among the hundreds, if not thousands, of project details dealt with by the NEB and Transport Canada precisely ten issues that its “experts” felt were not adequately handled. These include: The risk of a tanker collision in Burrard InletThe potential effects of a fire at Burrard Tank FarmThe potential for “man-camps” to give rise to “sexual violence” against women in nearby communitiesThe need for study of geological fault lines near Burnaby Mountain TunnelThe risk of an oil spill at the Fraser River pipeline crossingThe use of floating roof tanks in an earthquake zoneThe alleged failure of the pipeline sponsor to consider “historical precedent”The adverse effects of an oil spill on human healthThe alleged failure of the pipeline sponsor to adequately consult with aboriginals. What Should We Make of This? When an environmental organization like Stand-earth raises technical issues about proposed pipeline projects, what is the Canadian public supposed to do? The issues involved are invariably ones that can only be well understood, debated and resolved by experts – engineers, biologists, geologists, hydrologists, and others, as well as by the lawyers, economists and many advisors to the project sponsor and the authorized government regulatory agencies whose job it is to get things right. The public, in other words, cannot properly judge whether Stand.earth’s complaints are justified. That is why, for sixty years, the Government of Canada has used the National Energy Board as the body to carry out such reviews on the public’s behalf. The NEB has operated as an independent, arms’-length, expert body that has a professional staff and uses quasi-judicial procedures to gather and test on the record all the evidence related to the application before it. The value of the NEB has resided not only in its independence and technical competence by in the fact that it is non-partisan, i.e. not influenced by the policies of the political party that happens to be in power at the time the case is heard. Organizations like Stand.earth have done everything they can to discredit the National Energy Board so that the public will not have an independent agency to decide where the public interest lies. They do not want independent, professional and non-partisan judgements about pipelines or other energy projects. Instead, they want to appeal to those who lack expertise and objectivity or are politically opposed to all energy development to substitute bias for professional judgement. People who want to know all about the Trans Mountain Expansion Project can read all about it and how the issues have been examined by reading the NEB’s decision. As for Stand.earth’s report, don’t waste your time. RELATED:Chatelaine Magazine Mar. 15, 2019How This B.C.

Guest interview by  Grégoire Canlorbe 
John Raymond Christy is a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) whose chief interests are satellite remote sensing of global climate and global climate change. In February 2019 he was named as a member of the EPA Science Advisory Board.In May 2019 he was interviewed by Grégoire Canlorbe for Association des climato-réalistes, the only climate-realist association in France. The conversation was first published in the French journal Valeurs Actuelles(in a French edited version), and on Friends of Science(in the original English version).

Grégoire Canlorbe: You have been at pains to show that climate models are over-predicting warming by roughly a factor of two. Could you come back to this alleged falsification?
John Christy: We should be applying the scientific method to claims scientists (and others) are making about the climate. In this case I downloaded the output from 102 climate model simulations used by the IPCC and compared the tropospheric temperature since 1979 between the models and several observational datasets, including the satellite dataset we generate. The models on average were warming the atmosphere at a rate significantly greater than the observations. This is a test result from which we can say the models failed, and thus one shouldn’t depend on model output to characterize the future climate.
Grégoire Canlorbe: You are notably known for your involvement—along with Roy Spencer—in devising the first successful satellite temperature record. It turns out that beforehand you had already built your “first climate datasets” at the age of twelve, “using a mechanical pencil, graph paper, and long-division (no calculators back then.)” Could you tell us more about this life of invention?
John Christy: I was fascinated with the weather conditions around my home in the San Joaquin Valley of California (a desert basically) and the contrast with the climate of the Sierra Nevada Mountains immediately to the East. I was curious as to why some years were wet, others dry… why the Sierras had more precipitation and why the snow levels varied so much. I was the first high school student in California to write a simple program to predict the weather and to calculate the snow level in the mountains. These were very crude, statistical models in 1968, written for computers that were far less sophisticated than today’s cell phone. But, they introduced me to computer coding and to the power that was required to study. That was over 50 years ago.

John Christy (on the left) in the company of Grégoire Canlorbe – Paris, May 2019
Grégoire Canlorbe: It is sometimes alleged that given the impossibility to obtain—from the study of averaged weather patterns over a given period—reliable predictions on the forthcoming atmospheric conditions, climatology is not a full-fledged science. At best, it would be an art mobilizing various scientific fields (such as physical geography, oceanography, and metrology); at worst, it would be a propaganda tool. Do you recognize some relevance to such criticisms?
John Christy: One of the fundamental characteristics of the scientific method is that if we understand a system, then we can predict the behavior of that system. Our work in which we compare “predictions” from climate models against the actual changes of the real world indicate the current understanding of climate change is rather poor. This understanding is certainly not mature enough for regulatory policy. That certain experts and elites refuse to see the level of immaturity of understanding regarding climate, is astonishing.
However, it is understandable since climate is such a complex system, it is easier and more comforting for these elites to simply ignore the complexity and declare they believe CO2 is dangerous and we should believe them because of some status of authority they have garnered for themselves. They claim the “Science is Settled” only because they have not performed the necessary scientific tests which I believe would lead them to the opposite conclusion.
Grégoire Canlorbe: Concerning the climate-realist argument that CO2 is the food for plants, it is commonly answered that any good thing in excess—including CO2—becomes a poison; and that CO2 levels continuing to rise would only be beneficial to those of plants sheltered in highly controlled greenhouses.
While the increase in temperature (following the increase in CO2) engenders an increase in the size of deserts, the larger growth—as well as the greater moisture evaporation—of CO2 enhanced plants heightens their need for water; as a general rule, too high a supply in CO2 leads to a reduced availability of other nutrients—and, in the case of certain plants, can also trigger a reduction of photosynthesis or a greater vulnerability to insects. How do you assess this analysis?
John Christy: The evidence from satellite observations is very clear that the Earth has experienced considerable “greening” over the past 20 years, so this indicates that the extra CO2 we have put back into the atmosphere is having a very positive impact on the biosphere. It should be noted that most of the living things around us developed in an atmosphere millions of years ago that contained four to ten times more CO2 than we have at the present.
So, deserts are not increasing, but contracting. This is where the scientific method is so important—when someone makes a claim about a change in the climate or Earth system, others should test that claim with real observations. Unfortunately today, the media often would rather announce the dramatic claim of a terrible change without checking the facts.
Grégoire Canlorbe: In response to showing that climate is barely sensitive to CO2, it is not uncommon to assert that it remains impossible for fossil fuel industry, mechanized agriculture, and mass urbanization not to have disturbed the natural course of climate in one way or another. To what extent do you reject this claim?
John Christy: I think the natural course of the climate has been changed, especially in urban areas where the natural surroundings have been drastically altered. Temperatures are warmer (especially at night) in these urban areas. Globally, the climate impact of the extra CO2, I believe, is actually smaller than the urban warming signal in our big cities. It should be noted that the people of the world are moving toward modernization and that is accomplished by affordable energy—which today comes from the burning of carbon-based fuels. In the future, other sources of energy that are affordable will be deployed and this alleged problem of “climate change” will fade away.
It is important to note that we did not leave the Stone Age because we ran out of stones. We left the Stone Age because something better was discovered by human ingenuity. We will leave the Carbon Age not because we run out of carbon, but because a different and more affordable source of energy will be developed. As of now, the traditional renewables aren’t the answer because they supply such little energy relative to the area they cover, and they are unable to supply energy “on-demand” as is required for a modern economy.
Grégoire Canlorbe: The recent Notre-Dame de Paris fire has been occasionally qualified as a consequence of global warming. In other existing interpretations, the burning is thought to be God’s punishment against the Roman Catholic Church—by reason of its alleged crypto-Paganism which would be culminating into the ecologism of Pope Francis and his endorsing the belief in anthropogenic warming. As a former missionary, how do you react to this demonization of the Catholic Church?
John Christy: I do not think such interpretations are useful. I would only say that, in general, the Christian faith upholds the value of human life so that actions that enhance the length and quality of human life is the moral imperative. At this point in time, the use of carbon-based energy provides exactly what is needed here—the energy needed to lengthen and enhance the quality of human life. Without energy, life is brutal and short as I learned while serving as a teacher/missionary in Africa.
Grégoire Canlorbe: The purported neoconservative turn of Donald Trump’s foreign policy does not fail to arouse controversy. When it comes to assessing retrospectively the neoconservative movement, its positive deeds and its mistakes, do you think figures like George W. Bush, Paul Wolfowitz, William Kristol, or John Bolton have been fighting against eco-fanaticism as vehemently as they have been combating the threat of Marxism or that of Islam?
John Christy: I do not think about this issue too much. I would say that one should look at the final piece of data—the world is increasing its carbon emissions as it works to eradicate poverty. So, while the world has been scolded for 25 years by elites from scientific, academic and liberal government entities, nothing has really changed. People will pursue what is in their own best interest—long, healthy and fulfilling lives—and affordable energy makes that happen.
Grégoire Canlorbe: It has been hypothesized that changes in incoming solar radiation—over several decades—are the main factor causing or, at least, modulating climatic variations. Could you share your thoughts on this alleged connection between the Sun and climate?
John Christy: I’ve looked at this issue and we do see the impact of solar variability on our stratospheric temperature data. However, in the troposphere (where we live) the evidence is very difficult to draw out because our dataset is only 40 years long and other major perturbations have confused the ability to detect an 11-year cycle (i.e. volcanic eruptions, El Niños etc.) There certainly must be a relationship between solar variability and climate, and I am watching with interest the work of those who study the cosmic-ray connection which is directly related to solar variations. Perhaps even greater evidence will be coming soon in this area.
Grégoire Canlorbe: It is not uncommon—in some Christian circles—to conceive of the Darwinian theory of evolution as a state-sponsored hoax comparable to man-caused global warming. Both would be pseudo-scientific perspectives denying the divine character of man and the presence of Providence in the universe—and leading to idolize the state. As a Protestant scientist, how do you assess this opinion?
John Christy: This is an interesting question. Please note that a scientist using the scientific method should generate a reproduceable result whether he/she is a Baptist (like me), a Buddhist or a Baha’i. The scientific issues about climate are based on measurements we make to test claims, not on an opinion one might have. When it comes to policy that directly affects people, especially the poor, we now must consider non-scientific issues such as: is it proper to inflict hardship on those who can least afford it by following policies that demonstrably will not impact the climate?
It is not in our best interest to appeal to religious feelings when dealing with issues that are available for scientific testing. As the average person knows, there are a multitude of religious opinions today, but a scientific test should have results to which all rational people, religious or not, should be able to acknowledge.
I also think the average person has considerable experience regarding the claims about a dangerous future from so-called experts which the average person knows are simply exaggerations. And, the average person knows that these experts want to pass rules that take away a part of life that the average person wants and needs. Recent elections around the world demonstrate that the average person recognizes these false claims of calamity and wants to get on with their lives without the burden of higher taxes and fees which, in fact, will not impact the climate anyway (as we have shown with scientific tests). The average person is smarter than the experts and elites suspect.
Grégoire Canlorbe: Thank you for your time. Is there something you would like to add?
John Christy: No. Thank you for interviewing me.

"Last month, about 50 new movies opened in New York and Los Angeles.

The cap‐​and‐​trade bill that the House passed last summer aims to force Americans to reduce those dreaded carbon emissions by 83 percent in less than four decades — to the same per‐​capita level as 1867. Yet, even under the Al Gore‐​approved climate‐​science models, the bill would do nothing to stop global warming.



The bill is 1,000-plus pages of rules, regulations, handouts, subsidies and whatever else House leaders deemed necessary. Not one of the 435 members read the whole monstrosity — because the leadership dropped 300 new pages on their desks the night before they voted.



Yet the central point is clear enough: The bill simply drives up the price of fossil‐​fuel based energy so high that the nation will have to somehow get along with only 17 percent of the gasoline and fossil‐​fuel‐​powered electricity that it uses today.



Don’t ask how much it will cost. No one really knows, since you can’t put a price on something that has yet to be defined.



Last Tuesday, President Obama cited the BP blowout as reason for the Senate to pass its version of the House bill. But senators know that expensive emission reductions are profoundly unpopular. Congress members found this out last summer when protests erupted nationwide within 24 hours of the bill’s passage. Polls also suggest that a vote for the warming bill (especially on top of a vote for the health‐​care bill) is not a good way to keep a job in Congress this November.



And, again, the bills (neither the House‐​like Kerry‐​Lieberman tome, nor the climate‐​change lite by Indiana’s Sen. Richard Lugar) would do nothing measurable about climate change.



The median guess from the United Nations is that, if we do nothing to change our ways, the average world surface temperature will rise about 5 degrees Fahrenheit this century. (In fact, the trends in recent decades strongly suggest that this is an overestimate — but let’s accept it for the sake of the argument.)



Now, if only the United States does change its ways, by adopting something like the House bill, we’d prevent about two‐​tenths of a degree of that warming, according to the UN’s climate calculator. That is, the temperature in 2100 gets reduced to what it would otherwise be in 2096. All pain, no gain.



Even if every nation that has “obligations” under the UN’s Kyoto Protocol on global warming also adopts and enforces it, it would cut warming a mere 7 percent below the “business as usual” level, an amount probably too small to measure with confidence.



Why would such drastic action on the part of America, Europe and Japan do so little to change the world? Because the older industrial nations are fast becoming bit players when it comes to global CO2 emissions. America’s been pretty stagnant in the last decade — while China’s have been staggering.



In eight years, China’s annual totals will be equal to what they emit now plus everything we emit. So if we stopped emitting completely, China completely counters our effort.



Add to that a simple fact which no cap‐​and‐​trade bill admits: That legislation would push even more of our industry into migrating to China, India and other nations that have no intention of reducing emissions by making energy more expensive.



Bottom line: This legislation won’t lower global temperatures — but merely make life more expensive. It’ll force you to buy things you don’t want, like much more expensive cars, and to use energy sources you’d normally bypass, like ethanol, solar and windmills. All have to be massively subsidized — with your tax dollars — to compete with today’s mix of coal, gasoline and natural gas.

"WASHINGTON  —   Eric Trump has helped raise $16. 3 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital of Tennessee over the past decade, a hospital official said in a letter sent to a charity run by Mr. Trump, the  ’s son. The letter comes as Mr. Trump is preparing to remove his name from the charity to avoid conflicts of interest that could emerge from future  . The letter confirms an account Mr. Trump gave to reporters that his organization has raised more than $15 million for the hospital, despite available tax records showing that the Eric Trump Foundation raised less than half that amount. Mr. Trump’s announcement that he will remove his name from the organization is one of a series of steps that members of the Trump family are taking to address potential conflicts before the inauguration. Other steps include terminating planned Trump Organization projects in countries like Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia and Georgia. In addition to removing his name from his charitable foundation, Mr. Trump will no longer personally solicit funds for it, he said in several interviews with The New York Times. To further avoid conflicts, Mr. Trump said in an email this week, his    and a Trump Organization executive will step down from the foundation’s executive committee. The Trump Organization will continue to raise money for St. Jude from patrons at its hotels and golf courses, Mr. Trump said. But it will ask them to make contributions directly to the hospital, he said, instead of first sending the money to the Trump Organization. The St. Jude letter said that since its establishment, the Eric Trump Foundation had raised  —   or helped raise through affiliated groups  —   $16. 3 million for the hospital, which offers free care to needy children. Tax documents filed by nonprofit foundations are often delayed by two years, so there is no public accounting of these totals yet available. The letter said that some of the money was raised via related efforts, such as an Eric Trump   team that participates in the New York City Marathon. “I am amazed by the many ways that you have personally embraced our cause and cared for our children and families,” Richard C. Shadyac Jr. president of the hospital’s   organization, wrote in the Dec. 30 letter, which Mr. Trump provided to The Times. “As you are aware, we are expanding our lifesaving work and are working to push cure rates even higher in this country and around the world, while improving the lives of survivors by developing and advancing treatments that reduce side effects. We are only able to do this because of the support provided by donors and supporters like you. ” In his email this week, Mr. Trump said he would “continue to be a vocal advocate for pediatric cancer and St. Jude’s mission. ”   Donald J. Trump has announced that he is shutting down his own personal foundation, although it is currently the target of an investigation by the New York State attorney general over accusations that it did not have the proper permit to solicit contributions, and that it may have used money to benefit Mr. Trump’s own interests. No such accusations have been made about Eric Trump’s foundation."

Ominous words are emanating again from the president on climate change and energy independence, this time as “a response” to the Gulf oil catastrophe. Somewhere between the war rhetoric and comparisons to the moon landing, President Obama last night (vaguely) told Congress to pass the energy legislation that’s been languishing there since last summer.



Add that to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel’s speculation on June 8 that the Senate can pass it “this year” and obvious election difficulties for conservative Democrats if they vote for it, and it would appear that we’re headed toward a lame duck session in Congress.



The leadership of the House of Representatives could very easily change hands in the next Congress, and it is likely that major changes — though probably not involving a switch in majority — are on the horizon in the Senate. So, if the Senate indeed does pass far‐​reaching climate legislation after the election but before the new Congress sits, a compromise House‐​Senate bill will likely be negotiated by the party that the people have just thrown out of power.



Whatever the Senate passes, and whatever the House agrees to do with it, the legislation will fail to effect any change on climate. The House’s radical Cap‐​and‐​Trade bill, rushed through last June 26 (before any one had read it) will have virtually no effect on global warming, even by the year 2100, even if every nation that agreed to emissions targets under the United Nations’ (also ineffectual) Kyoto Protocol did the same.



Richard Lugar’s (R‐​Ind.) current Senate proposal isn’t cap‐​and‐​trade. Instead, it’s a hodgepodge of subsidies for energy sources no one would normally buy, and an unrealistic fuel economy mandate for autos. It does even less for climate than the legislation the House passed last year.



There are other Senate bills out there, too, from John Kerry (D‐​Mass.) and Joe Lieberman (I‐​Conn.), which are pretty similar to the House bill; there is also a bill from Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) which mandates costly and inefficient “renewables” that can’t make it on their own economic merits, and various other bills that are variants upon either cap‐​and‐​trade or renewable mandates.



None are popular. No matter what people think about global warming, good or bad, indifferent, strong or weak, or nonexistent, they simply aren’t willing to pay thousands of dollars for fuel taxes, emissions permits, or energy subsidies.



The administration gets this. They knew that people didn’t want their health care program, either. They simply don’t care.



The serious question is whether the President and his chief of staff will indeed have the political muscle to push a climate bill through after the November elections. A smarter move for the White House might be to just punt and wait for the next Congress, which will be guaranteed to do nothing on climate change, pushing the issue into EPA’s regulatory lap. While letting the EPA control our energy economy through force of regulation is a really bad idea, it would be less suicidal for the next Senate class up for re‐​election in 2012.



I hope the White House does NOT take my advice.



Despite the pomp of an Oval Office address, nothing is really new here. The fact that the White House is now floating the notion of passing ineffectual, expensive, and unpopular climate change legislation through a lame duck Congress is merely consistent with its previous behavior.

How ironic that a rich, old, pale, stale, male, one-percenter (or more likely a 0.01%er) should be the one that has galvanised the oppressed comrades on the left to ‘strike’ for climate. Soros, ranked at 178 in the rich list, is reputedly worth $US8.3 billion.



A member of the left’s most hated demographic is the one that funds the strikes and manipulates all the ‘oh so woke’ who are actually the ‘oh so gullible.’ 



While 16-year-old Greta Thunberg has become the face of the climate strike movement, it’s no longer gatherings of children. A litany of well-funded, left-wing activist groups have partnered to generate a week of climate protests known as the “Global Climate Strike:” Sept 20, through 27, bookending the U.N. climate conference.



At least 22 of those partners have been funded by liberal billionaire George Soros who spends nearly $1 billion a year on groups pushing a variety of left-wing causes. Together, 22 organizations listed as international or North American partners of the Global Climate Strike received at least $24,854,592 from Soros’ Open Society Network between 2000-2017. […]



In recent years, Soros funding went to at least 22 of those partnering groups including 350.org, Amnesty International, Avaaz, Color of Change and People’s Action. Those groups had various climate-related agendas from reducing global carbon emissions to less than 350 parts per million, campaigning for 100 percent “clean energy,” banning new fossil fuel projects to a “green civil rights movement.” […]



Eco-doomsayer Bill Mckibben founded 350 in 2008. The name of the organization comes from its desired carbon emissions goal of less than 350 parts per million — current emissions levels are already at 415 ppm. McKibben’s past climate predictions were so extreme even _Scientific American_ called him out in 2011, for being “overheated” and”fear-mongering.” The group fought against coal power in India, tried to stop the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S. and has promoted fossil fuel divestment.



Known more for its pro-abortion, pro-gun control, LGBTQ rights advocacy and opposition to Israel, Amnesty International was another Soros-funded strike partner. Its website confirmed it “will be taking part in the climate strikes,” because “Human rights are intimately linked with climate change because of its devastating effect on not just the environment but our own wellbeing.” […]



Ah, yes, our ‘wellbeing’. So important that we really should have a budget for it.

"**A plant-based pork substitute has been launched in Las Vegas by one of the leading ""alternative meat"" producers.**
Impossible Foods, the firm behind the Impossible Burger, says it hopes to appeal to a global audience with its latest vegetarian-friendly meal, which it unveiled at the CES tech show.
Pork is currently the most widely consumed meat in the world.
The company hopes the product will help it break into China. But one expert said it might find that a challenge.
The first product to feature the foodstuff - the Impossible Sausage - will be available next week at 67 Burger King restaurants in the US, in a sandwich-based dish called the Croissan'wich.
Rival firm Beyond Meat has offered a lab-produced sausage product since 2018, but California-based Impossible Foods is also offering a ground pork substitute that it says can be used in a wide range of traditional recipes.
The new products are designed to comply with kosher and halal rules followed by some observers of the Jewish and Islamic faiths.
The firm's sausage and plant-based pork products, like its ground beef substitute, are made using heme (or ""haem"" in British English) - a molecule derived from plants that contains iron and that resembles blood.
Heme is found in real meat but can be produced without farming animals.
The new products also contain no gluten, animal hormones or antibiotics.
""Now we're accelerating the expansion of our product portfolio to more of the world's favourite foods,"" said Patrick Brown, Impossible Foods' founder and chief executive.
""We won't stop until we eliminate the need for animals in the food chain and make the global food system sustainable.""
There was certainly a great deal of excitement at the unveiling of Impossible Pork, in a trendy Las Vegas hotel restaurant.
Music pumped and beverages flowed while we were presented with a beautiful selection of bite-sized food samples - pork katsu, sweet and sour pork meatballs, pork dim sum and pork noodles. None of which contained a shred of actual pork, of course.
There were, however, mutterings that the strong sauces used cleverly disguised the taste of the plant-based ""meat"" itself - I could tell you how spicy the katsu was but I'd be pushed to describe the flavour of Impossible Pork on its own.
What I did notice is that it's got that lighter, dryer texture of traditional meat alternatives like Quorn - it lacks the heaviness, the richness of meat that meat lovers savour. In the interests of research I ate my way through a selection of the canapes, and felt pretty full - but not for very long.
This is perhaps the idea - apparently Impossible Pork contains around half the calories of sausage meat and is also considerably lower in fat.
Impossible Foods said its synthetic pork product would suit a variety of Asian dishes - from spring rolls to dumplings or wontons.
Pork is in huge demand in Asia. China alone produces and consumes more of the meat than any other country.
Until recently, China was also home to around half the world's farmed pigs - but millions of them have died or been culled due to the spread of African Swine Fever, a viral disease that infects pigs. There is no known cure.
That said, Chinese consumers are more likely to turn to chicken or fish if pork prices rise too high or when pork shortages occur, said Chenjun Pan, a senior analyst at Rabobank.
""The major substitution to pork remains poultry,"" she told the BBC.
But in the longer term, US companies that market highly realistic, lab-produced meat substitutes to Chinese consumers may find success, she added.
This is because the technology to make these products is dominated by Western firms.
""It's very likely that foreign companies will bring this product to China,"" said Ms Pan.

"WASHINGTON  —   A day after the release of a damning intelligence report on Russia’s   efforts to influence the American election,   Donald J. Trump called on Saturday for a closer relationship between the two nations, saying only “stupid” people or “fools” would think this was unwise. The United States, Mr. Trump wrote in a series of Twitter messages Saturday morning, has “enough problems around the world without yet another one. ” He pledged that Russia would “respect us far more than they do now” after he is sworn in as president, and said that the two nations could perhaps work together on the international stage. For years, Russia has been anything but a willing partner of the United States. Relations became strained well before the   cyberattacks began nearly a year and a half ago, despite the Obama administration’s early effort to reset relations. After Russia’s intrusion into Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States and its allies levied broad sanctions against the Russian economy and blacklisted dozens of its citizens, including some close to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. President Obama added to those measures last month in retaliation for the hacking, expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on two Russian intelligence services. Russia and the United States have also often been at odds over Moscow’s involvement in the war in Syria. Senior intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump on their findings on Russian election interference on Friday, before releasing a declassified report that concluded that Mr. Putin had “ordered” a sprawling campaign intended to denigrate Hillary Clinton and aid Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agencies’ conclusions as politically motivated, but he appeared to soften that stance in a statement his transition team released after the briefing. He also seemingly conceded Russian involvement in the election, but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered, apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that it is time to “move on” from the focus on Russian meddling in the election, arguing that it has received such attention only because Democrats are embarrassed about their loss  —   an assertion he repeated on Twitter on Saturday. Late on Friday, he blamed the Democratic National Committee for the hacking of its computer systems, saying that “gross negligence” had allowed it to happen. Many Democrats said on Twitter that Mr. Trump was essentially engaging in  ."
"Weather Ripples and Climate Tides.
Every time a north wind blows hot air over Adelaide, some Chicken Little cries “Global Warming”. And when an El Nino predictably causes a hot year like 1998 or 2015/16, some sensation-seeking celebrity will trumpet “hottest year eevah”.
They are watching short-term weather ripples and waves and ignoring the underlying climate tide. Daily, monthly and yearly temperature records will always be equalled or broken. That is what weather does – it fluctuates.
In the medium term, Earth temperature trends are influenced by variations in solar activities as evidenced by sun-spot cycles. These variations affect solar intensity, cosmic rays, clouds and Earth temperature, causing medium-term climatic events like the Little Ice Age and the Modern Warming. There are persuasive signs that recent solar activity has peaked. So maybe we can expect cooler weather soon.
See:  http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images/Cycle22Cycle23Cycle24big.gif
But to see what the climate is doing we must look longer-term and study the glacial cycles. The Milankovitch cycles of Earth in the solar system control these.
See: http://www.indiana.edu/~geol105/images/gaia_chapter_4/milankovitch.htm
Is it warming or cooling now?
See this very informative video by the late Professor Bob Carter:

There are many signs that Earth’s climate is gradually cooling (as Prof Carter shows in the video above).
For example, snow and ice is accumulating.
In the Antarctic, Mawson’s Hut and the Colbeck Hut are being progressively buried in ice.
In Greenland, “The Lost Squadron”, which was forced to land on the Greenland Ice sheet in 1942, was rediscovered 50 years later buried under 268 feet of ice.

Introduction
Figure 1. Cenozoic Era geologic time scale. (ICS)
We are often told that the warmth of the Early Paleogene was driven by CO2; and that the cool-down from the Late Paleogene, into the Neogene and Quaternary Periods was driven by a draw-down of atmospheric CO2[1][2].  The notion of a CO2-driven climate has apparently become a paradigm. 
This paradigm didn’t exist in the 1970’s [3]. 
Suggestion that changing carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere could be a major factor in climate change dates from 1861, when it was proposed by British physicist John Tyndall.[…]Unfortunately we cannot estimate accurately changes of past CO2 content of either atmosphere or oceans, nor is there any firm quantitative basis for estimating the the magnitude of drop in carbon dioxide content necessary to trigger glaciation.  Moreover the entire concept of an atmospheric greenhouse effect is controversial, for the rate of ocean-atmosphere equalization is uncertain. [3] Dott, Robert H. & Roger L. Batten. Evolution of the Earth. McGraw-Hill, Inc. Second Edition 1976. p. 441. 
Why geology is supposed to avoid paradigms
When I was studying geology, way back when The Ice Age Cometh in the 1970’s, we were taught to avoid getting hooked on paradigms or “ruling theories”.  Geology, as a science, has very few unique solutions.  This is why we were were taught to embrace Chamberlin’s Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses.  I have to assume that either this is no longer the case or that homage must be paid to the current paradigm in order to get published.
Hat tip to Brian Pratt for sending me this paper…
Moderate levels of Eocene pCO2 indicated by Southern Hemisphere fossil plant stomata Margret Steinthorsdottir, Vivi Vajda, Mike Pole, and Guy HoldgateABSTRACTReducing the uncertainty in predictions of future climate change is one of today’s greatest scientific challenges, with many significant problems unsolved, including the relationship between pCO2 and global temperature. To better constrain these forecasts, it is meaningful to study past time intervals of global warmth, such as the Eocene (56.0–33.9 Ma), serving as climatic analogues for the future. Here we reconstructed pCO2 using the stomatal densities of a large fossil Lauraceae (laurel) leaf database from ten sites across the Eocene of Australia and New Zealand. We show that mostly moderate pCO2 levels of ∼450–600 ppm prevailed throughout the Eocene, levels that are considerably lower than the pCO2 forcing currently needed to recreate Eocene temperatures in climate models. Our data record significantly lower pCO2 than inferred from marine isotopes, but concur with previously published Northern Hemisphere Eocene stomatal proxy pCO2. We argue that the now globally consistent stomatal proxy pCO2 record for the Eocene is robust and that climate sensitivity was elevated and/or that additional climate forcings operated more powerfully than previously assumed. INTRODUCTIONThe anthropogenic rise in CO2 concentrations (pCO2) is predicted to result in a global average temperature increase of up to 4 °C by the year 2100 (IPCC, 2014), with severe socioeconomic and ecosystem impacts predicted. However, the exact relationship between pCO2 and temperature—or climate sensitivity (the equilibrium response in mean global surface temperatures to a doubling of pCO2, generally reported as ∼3 °C)—is still not well understood…[…]The Eocene epoch was such a time interval, with average global temperatures 4–15 °C higher than at present (Zachos et al., 2001; Huber and Caballero, 2011; Anagnostou et al., 2016; Cramwinckel et al., 2018). In the earliest Eocene (ca. 55.5 Ma), there was a transient episode of extremely elevated temperatures—the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM (McInerney and Wing, 2011). Later, after the peak warmth of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, ca. 52–50 Ma), a gradual cooling began, briefly interrupted by a major warming reversal at ca. 40 Ma, called the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) (Zachos et al., 2001; Cramwinckel et al., 2018). The Eocene climate still constitutes one of the greatest unsolved problems in paleoclimate research. Temperatures were globally much higher than today, with a significantly weaker equator-to-pole temperature gradient and a muted seasonal cycle compared to today, referred to as the “Eocene equable climate problem” (Sloan and Barron, 1990; Greenwood and Wing, 1995; Greenwood et al., 2003a). Climate modeling has been able to reconstruct this pattern with very high pCO2 levels (up to ∼4500 ppm: Huber and Caballero, 2011), but such extremely elevated pCO2 is not documented by proxy records. It is therefore assumed that Eocene climate sensitivity—often defined as Earth system sensitivity for longer time scales, including both “fast” and “slow” feedbacks (Lunt et al., 2010)—was elevated compared to present, and/or that other mechanisms, in addition to the dominant forcing of pCO2, were in operation (Caballero and Huber, 2013; Anagnostou et al., 2016; Zeebe et al., 2016; Carlson and Caballero, 2016; Cramwinckel et al., 2018; Keery et al., 2018). […]Comparison to Existing pCO2 Records and Implications  […]The most striking feature of the Eocene stomatal proxy record is that some of the highest pCO2 is indicated in the early middle Eocene (until ca. 46–44 Ma), well beyond the end of the EECO…[…]Although it is premature to make strong statements, this would imply that Earth system sensitivity was likely in the range of ∼4–8 °C during the Eocene, significantly elevated compared to the “modern” climate sensitivity of ∼3 °C (Lunt et al., 2010; Royer et al., 2012; Maxbauer et al., 2014; Wolfe et al., 2017; Keery et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2019). However, the various feedback mechanisms affecting Earth system sensitivity in an ice-free world are still poorly understood.In summary, we find pCO2 of ∼450–600 ppm recorded by Southern Hemisphere fossil plants throughout the Eocene—significantly less than the forcing required by modeling, suggesting that climate sensitivity was elevated and/or that other climate forcings were stronger than previously assumed. [4] Steinthorsdottir, M., Vajda, V., Pole, M., and Holdgate, G., 2019, Moderate levels of Eocene pCO2 indicated by Southern Hemisphere fossil plant stomata: Geology, v. 47, p. 914–918, https://doi.org/10.1130/G46274.1 
Key points
The Eocene was, on average, 4–15 °C warmer than today.Atmospheric CO2 was very likely in the 450-600 ppm range.Modern climate models would require 4,500 ppm CO2 to simulate the Eocene temperature range;And/or a climate sensitivity of 4-8  °C per doubling;And/or “that other climate forcings were stronger than previously assumed”. 
They totally missed the most obvious reason why just about every effort to gin up a paleo example of CO2-driven climate change falls apart: Atmospheric CO2 is not a primary driver of climate change over geologic time.  This wouldn’t mean that it isn’t a greenhouse gas or that it has no effect on temperature.  It would simply mean that it was a relatively minor climate driver, like volcanic eruptions.
At some point over the past 30 years or so, the assumption that CO2 drives modern climate change has become a paradigm.  And I think we have seen a rare failure in the application of the geologic principle of Uniformitarianism.  
Uniformitarianism is often incorrectly cited as the reason geologists were slow to accept plate tectonics, the impact theory of the K-Pg extinction and why the hypotheses for a Younger Dryas impact and abiotic oil are generally unaccepted.   However, Uniformitarianism may be why a CO2-driven climate paradigm appears to have come into wide acceptance, at least in academia.   
The past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now. No powers are to be employed that are not natural to the globe, no action to be admitted except those of which we know the principle. James Hutton, 1785 
 Geologists are taught that the processes we observe today are the same processes that formed the ancient rock formations that comprise the geologic history of the Earth.  An example would be oolitic limestone.  By observing where and how modern oolitic carbonate sediments are formed and deposited, we can deduce the past depositional environments of oolitic limestone formations.
“The present is the key to the past” is valid axiom… Unless the present is fundamentally misunderstood.
Here is figure 2 from Steinthorsdottir et al., 2019 (S19):
Figure 2.  Eocene CO2 and temperature (older is toward the right). ” Eocene climate reconstructions. (A) Green diamonds show previously published stomatal proxy–derived pCO2 estimates for the Eocene (McElwain, 1998; Kürschner et al., 2001; Royer et al., 2001; Greenwood et al., 2003b; Retallack, 2009; Smith et al., 2010; Doria et al., 2011; Grein et al., 2011; Roth-Nebelsick et al., 2012; Franks et al., 2014; Maxbauer et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016; Steinthorsdottir et al., 2016; Wolfe et al., 2017). Pink circles are average pCO2 values calibrated in the present study. Marine pCO2 estimates based on alkenone δ13C data are shown with black squares (Zhang et al., 2013), while white squares are based on boron δ11B data (Pearson et al., 2009; Anagnostou et al., 2016). All previously published data points are plotted without errors for visual clarity; see Foster et al. (2017) for error estimates.

PETM—Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum; EECO—Early Eocene Climatic Optimum; MECO—Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum; Pal.—Paleocene.” 
Did you notice something odd?  The moderate CO2 concentrations actually increase from the warmer Early Eocene into the cooler Middle to Late Eocene.
I added S19’s Eocene stomata CO2 estimates to my compilation of Cenozoic Era estimates and temperatures (note that my plot has older toward the left).
Figure 3a.  Marine pCO2 (foram boron δ11B, alkenone δ13C), atmospheric CO2 from plant stomata (green and yellow diamonds with red outlines), Mauna Loa instrumental CO2 (thick red line) and Cenozoic temperature change from benthic foram  δ18O (light gray line).
Figure 3b.  Legend for Figure 3a.
A note regarding the δ18O temperature reconstruction:  The conversion of δ18O to temperature is based on an ice-free model, more suited to the Paleocene and Eocene, than later epochs.  However the relative changes in temperature would be in the same direction.
It is evident in Figure 3a that only the foram δ11B reconstruction yields exceptionally high pCO2 concentrations during the Paleogene.   δ11B is a proxy for pH, which is related to pCO2, although not necessarily a good proxy for pCO2 itself.  The alkenone δ13C and stomata reconstructions all indicate moderate pCO2 concentrations during the Paleogene and Neogene.  Clearly, there was no significant coupling of temperature and CO2 over first 65,999,850 years of the Cenozoic Era.
Added Bonus
It is very tempting to assume that past CO2 concentrations can be used to directly calculate pre-industrial seawater pH and vice-versa.  The following graph is a skeptic favorite:
Figure 4. Phanerozoic temperature (Scotese) and CO2 (Berner). Geocraft. Older is toward the left.
This graph didn’t sit well with the CO2-Driven Climate Paradigm crowd, so they [5] decided to “fix” the temperatures by adjusting them to pH values calculated from CO2.  We can see that this yields a much better correlation between CO2 and temperature.
Figure 5. Phanerozoic pH-corrected temperature (Royer & Berner) and CO2 (Berner). Older it toward the left.
 One slight problem…
Figure 6. Equilibrium climate sensitivity from Royer and Berner. Older is toward the right.
This fairly decent correlation yields an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), inclusive of all feedback, of only 1.28 °C per doubling of atmospheric CO2 over the past ~540 million years.   This would mean that the transient climate response (TCR), the one that actually affects us, is only about 0.85 °C per doubling of atmospheric CO2, very much inline with the low end of recent low sensitivities calculated from satellite-era instrumental observations.

"At the Golden Globes afterparties, hoi polloi who aren’t invited to the ceremony descend by the thousands on the Beverly Hilton to whoop it up and stalk celebrities. Hosts of this year’s Hilton parties  —   held in ballrooms and massive tents around its compound  —   included HBO, the Weinstein Company, Fox, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Amazon, Warner Bros. and InStyle. The biggest stars often skipped those parties altogether, and instead beelined to the exclusive talent agency fests, held at the Sunset Tower Hotel and the Chateau Marmont. Confined to the Hilton, the Bagger joined the star stalkers herself, seeking answers to the burning question: What did celebrities think of Meryl Streep’s speech? (For a general idea, click here). The Bagger first cornered the preternaturally glamorous Joan Collins, as the British actress was carefully ascending a small flight of stairs at the Fox party. “I think she is one of the greatest actresses of a generation,” Ms. Collins said of Ms. Streep. “She has the right to say whatever she wants. And I think if you look at people’s faces in the audience, people went along with her. ” At the HBO party, Eddie Redmayne said he found Ms. Streep’s speech “incredibly emotional,” but was so distracted by her presence in the audience while presenting the award for best musical or comedy that he almost forgot to read the nominees. He wouldn’t say whether he thought Hollywood should take a page from Ms. Streep and speak out politically. The Bagger nabbed Bryan Cranston at the HBO party, too. Mr. Cranston, who has spoofed a Donald J. Trump presidency on “Saturday Night Live,” got a little misty just speaking about Ms. Streep’s words. “She was able to deliver an important message that resonated with all of us, with grace and dignity and no vitriol or hyperbole,” he said, “It was just beautifully delivered, to convey the anxiety that we are feeling, and the concern. ” Vince Vaughn, who has supported Republican presidential candidates in the past, was chatting a few feet away, so the Bagger asked him, too. Did he think Ms. Streep’s speech was an example of how Hollywood should respond to the politics of our time? “I think people should say what they want to say, and what she said was beautiful,” Mr. Vaughn said. The Bagger’s eyes then fell on John Corbett, a. k. a. Aidan from “Sex and the City. ” Was Hollywood the platform to address politics? “A whole lot of ‘Apprentice’ watchers just elected the president of the United States,” Mr. Corbett said, breaking into a dazzler of a grin, “so I guess it is!” The night ended on a high note, with Kerry Washington, who was at the party with her husband, Nnamdi Asomugha, agreeing to weigh in. (“One question!” her manager told the Bagger.) Ms. Washington said she found Ms. Streep’s speech beautiful too, adding that in a democracy, there’s never a time when citizens, whatever their stripe, shouldn’t speak out. “I don’t think that people of Hollywood should be silenced because of what we do for a living,” Ms. Washington said. “I don’t think it’s important that she said what she said because she’s an actress. I think it’s important she said what she said because she’s a citizen. We all have a First Amendment right of free speech. ”"
" On 22 September, the winter maximum ice sheet extent across the Antarctic reached its greatest area since satellite measurement of the ice extent began in 1979 [1].
This is consistent with satellite lower tropospheric temperature data for the South Polar region at Dr Roy Spencer’s Web site [2] which reveals a slight but not statistically significant rate of cooling for the region for the 36 years of satellite measurement.
Coinciding with this, measurements of the atmospheric CO2 have been collected by NOAA at the South Pole and the data is available on the World Meteorological Organisation Web site [3]. It shows that the CO2 concentration has increased by 17.7% in the same period.
Confirmation of this disparity is available on the WMO Web site where measurements by CSIRO are provided for the CO2 concentration at the Antarctic stations of Casey [4] and Mawson [5]. Comparison of the CO2 concentration with the station’s average temperature data, available at the Bureau of Meteorology Web site [6], showed that both stations have experienced slight, -0.78 deg C per century at Casey and -1.43 deg C per century at Mawson, but not statistically significant cooling over the terms of the measurement. However the CO2 concentration has increased at Casey by 9% in 16.5 years and at Mawson 11.4% in 23 years.
These results are clear evidence that the IPCC proposition that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration causes warming of the Earth’s surface is invalid. As the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 has been much the same across the whole of the globe, the above puts paid to the CO2 – global warming fraud.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor CO2 to be considered a driver of Earth’s temperatures, changes in CO2 that uni-directionally correlate with temperatures should not be an exceptional occurrence. Yet a causal link from CO2 radiative forcing to temperature changes could hypothetically be inferred for just 2.6% of the last 425 million years.
A detailed analysis (Davis, 2017) of temperature and CO2 proxies over the Phanerozoic Eon by environmenalist Dr. W. Jackson Davis  finds that for 77.9% of the record there was a non-discernible correlation between CO2 and temperature.
On the occasion there was a correlation between CO2 and temperature, most (60%) of the correlation instances were negative. In other words, when a correlation could be discerned, temperatures fell as CO2 rose or CO2 fell as temperatures rose more often than CO2 and temperature rose and fell with a semblence of synchronicity.
If we assume temperature changes are radiatively forced or amplified by CO2, this cause-effect link could be correlationally established for just 2.6% of the 4.25 million-year record.
As Dr. Davis concludes, “changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration did not cause temperature change in the ancient climate.”

Image Source: Davis, 2017
No discernible correlation between CO2 and temperature for the last 80,000 years either
Some newly published papers also contradict the claim CO2 is a driver of Earth’s temperature changes.
Li and Born (2019) document 8-16°C climate warmings (D-O events) in Greenland that extended to both hemispheres between about 80 and 15 thousand years ago. (Though global in scope, temperature changes were less pronounced outside Greenland.)
These abrupt warmings occurred within decades (or less), and they occurred without any CO2 fluctuation before or after the change.
CO2 hovered around 190 ppm to 200 ppm throughout each warming and cooling event.

Even more fascinating, it’s been suggested that these warm-ups may have required no external forcing, as they’re considered an “unforced oscillation”.
The climate system can warm by 8-16°C within decades via internal variability.

Image Source: Li and Born (2019)
Throughout the last glacial, when CO2 remained effectively unchanged at about 200 ppm, there were warming periods that exceeded the Holocene’s thermal maximum by 2-6°C in locations ranging from Southern Europe to Russia to California.
Of course, none of these warming and cooling climate transitions could be associated with changes in CO2 either.

"**Free Christmas dinners are being given to homeless, elderly and lonely people thanks to an army of volunteers.**
Venues providing the goodwill on Christmas Day include a takeaway, and hotels and restaurants in Cardiff, Powys, Gwynedd and Rhondda Cynon Taff.
Community groups are also hosting events in Pembrokeshire and Wrexham.
Viridian restaurant in Bangor said it had invited families or single people who ""might be unable to afford a traditional Christmas feast"".
In **Pembrokeshire** , about 25 guests will enjoy a Christmas Day lunch courtesy of 30 volunteers at St Johns Community Hall in Pembroke Dock.
Revd Alexandra Grace said she has been ""surprised and delighted"" by the number of people who wanted to help.
Gifts have been donated with people also volunteering time to decorate the room and prepare the food.
""Our church and town are answering the need,"" she said.
In **Wrexham** , the Salvation Army is hosting a free two course lunch for 80 guests with the help of 20 volunteers.
And presents will also be provided to guests who are homeless, living in temporary accommodation or who live alone.
The organisation has also given out more than 500 presents to local children, according to centre manager Karen Edwards.
In **Bangor** , volunteers have helped staff to provide food, gifts and entertainment at the vegan restaurant, Viridian.
Bangor University students added their support by providing about 160 boxes of ""goodies"" to be given out to people in need.
Chef Danny Baker said he did not know how many people to expect but that local food banks and a homeless help group had handed out flyers in advance.
The plan is to run the restaurant like a normal day with table service provided by about 50 volunteers offering to take food orders and wash pots.
Seven volunteers prepared the fresh ingredients on Christmas Eve and entertainers are playing music throughout the day.
""There are people out there not really having a good time in what is a family holiday,"" said Mr Baker.
""We want it to be a special day for everyone.""
Mohammed Nazakat, from Victoria Fish Bar in Whitchurch, **Cardiff** , said it was providing meals for anyone who needed help, although he was not sure how many people may turn up.
And about 400 Christmas dinners with all the trimmings having been delivered for free to people in need across Rhondda Cynon Taff and Cardiff.
They were made by staff at the Ivor Hael Hotel in **Tonypandy** and distributed by helpers on Christmas Eve, according to local councillor Wendy Lewis.
A number of venues are open on Christmas Day at **Brecon, Llandrindod Wells, Presteigne** , and **Newtown** , according to Powys Association of Voluntary Organisation's (Pavo) Mental Health Information Service.
Places like Oti Kalo Greek Restaurant in Brecon are providing snacks and a place to meet while the town's Castle Hotel is hosting a Christmas Day dinner for older people.
Loneliness expert Dr Deborah Morgan, from Swansea University, said Christmas was a ""difficult time"" for some people because it was often portrayed as a time for family and friends.
""If you're on your own, it exacerbates that loneliness and amplifies that feeling of loneliness because you are not fitting in that norm,"" she said."

The draconian measures implemented to cub the so-called COVID-19 “pandemic” are having a profound impact on the German economy as millions of self-employed have seen business wiped out, and even large industries such as Mercedes, VW and BMW are halting production.
Even worse is the unprecedented (postwar) degree of uncertainty that now looms. How long are the strict measures going to stay in place?
Will the economy be able to rebound? Where’s the money to pay for it all going to come from? How do we get relief to the citizens? Not since WWII has Germany been confronted with such monumental challenges.
Suspend green energy feed-in tariffs
One place to start for providing relief, says Bavaria Minister President Markus Söder, is a suspension of the punishing EEG levy and electricity tax, which have made electricity rates in Germany among the world’s highest. reports pv magazine.

Minister President Söder is calling for rapid and extensive aid from the Federal Government to keep the economy crashing.

In a speech in the State Parliament in Munich yesterday, Söder called on the Federal Government to come up with a rapid and comprehensive federal aid package for industry, saying 100 to 150 billion euros were needed.
“Among other things, he called for the suspension of the electricity tax and EEG levy. This would help many companies and private households,” reported the online German pv magazine.
23.9 billion euros just for feed-in levies
Currently German consumers and industry are paying over €20 billion annually in mandatory feed-in tariffs for renewable energies such as wind and solar.
“For 2020 they expect to pay a total levy of 23.9 billion euros,”German business daily Handelsblatt reported here recently. “For an average household with an annual consumption of 3,500 kilowatt hours, the burden of the EEG levy will amount to 280 euros including VAT next year.
“The EEG levy is currently 6.756 cents per kilowatt hour and the electricity tax is 2.05 cents per kilowatt hour,” reports py magazines. “Given average electricity prices of currently more than 30 cents per kilowatt hour for private households. Commercial and industrial customers currently pay an average electricity price of around 18.55 cents per kilowatt hour.”

Compared to the USA, German electricity rates for industry (2016) are nearly double. Source: Clean Energy Wire
Suspending the green energy feed-in tariffs would be one step in the right direction, among many, to unbureaucratically and effectively provide quick relief to consumers – and the industries that employ them.

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



Who is old enough to remember the acid rain that was going to get us all?



From _Noblesville Ledger_ April 9, 1980 



_Associated Press_ , September 6, 1990



So what happened to the acid rain? A massively expensive National Acid Precipitation Assessment Programme (NAPAP) was initiated to examine the damage caused by acid rain and recommended solutions. 



The situation turned out to be much more complex than had been predicted. The acidity of a lake is determined as much by the acidity of the local soil and vegetation as it is by acid rain. Many lakes in north-eastern America, dead in the 1980s, had plenty of fish in 1900. It was surmised by environmentalists that 20th-century sulphur dioxide emissions had choked these lakes to death with acid rain. But the NAPAP showed many of these lakes were acidic and fishless even before European settlement in America. Fish survived better in these lakes around 1900 because of extensive slash and burn logging in the area. The soil became more alkaline as the acid vegetation was removed, reducing the acid flowing into the lakes and making the water hospitable to fish. Logging stopped in 1915, acid soils and vegetation returned and the lakes became acidic again. The study also found that in many cases forests were suffering debilitation due to insects or drought and not acid rain.



The NAPAP reported in 1990. The findings were explosive: first, acid rain had not injured forests or crops in US or Canada; second, acid rain had no observable effect on human health; third, only a small number of lakes had been acidified by acid rain and these could be rehabilitated by adding lime to the water. In summary, **acid rain was a nuisance, not a catastrophe.**

"The Labor/Green coalition in Australia has declared war on coal, oil and gas and industries that use them. So why is Big Mining not fighting back?
BHP Billiton is a big producer of coal, oil, gas, iron ore, copper, nickel and uranium. Rio Tinto is a big producer of uranium, coal, iron ore, copper and aluminium. Glencore is a big producer of coal, copper, zinc and nickel. And Shell is big in oil, gas and bitumen, manufactures biofuels, and generates peak power with natural gas.
These companies employ competent geologists, physicists and chemists who could tell them that CO2 is not a pollutant, that it is not the primary driver of climate and that climate has been changing since time began. They must know there is no scientific justification for the green war on hydro-carbon fuels – but none of these big miners speak out against this baseless war on their products. UC Browser for Windows Some even waste shareholder funds producing glossy brochures promoting the green agenda – the BHP Billiton document “Climate Change: Portfolio Analysis” reads like it was produced by the Greens.
Big Mining is not that dumb. Their climate “concern” is more motivated by self-interest – they see long-term profits flowing from the silly green agenda. They are also political cowards wanting be loved by guilt-stricken billionaires, business haters from Hollywood and the green mob controlling the ABC/BBC.
Wind and solar power are indeed “free”, but to extract electricity from them is not free – it needs turbines and solar panels, generators and transformers, transmission towers and power lines – all of which boosts demand for metals like steel, copper, zinc, nickel and rare earths.
Moreover, wind and solar are very diffuse power sources and need large areas of land together with webs of access roads and power lines in order to collect significant power. The heavy machinery needed for construction, maintenance and replacements in these green power networks provide ongoing demands for petroleum and mining products. Before one watt of green electricity is generated for consumers, green power has boosted demand for most products of Big Mining.

Green power also needs back-up power ready to swing into action immediately the wind drops (or blows a gale) or clouds, fog, snow, rain, dust or night-time obscure the sun. This is great news for reliable energy suppliers capable of rapid backup, which usually means gas. Happy New Year 2018 Quotes So Big Gas loves Big Green – it is secretly delighted by the war on coal and the force-feeding of Green energy, as this will cause a boom in gas demand. Lead, nickel, cadmium and lithium miners are also delighted with the soaring demand for energy-storing batteries.

Intermittent energy producers like wind and solar also cause destructive fluctuations in electricity supply and prices – prices can fall to zero on a sunny, windy afternoon, but soar during still, sunless periods. Coal power stations cannot adjust quickly to this destructive variability in electricity demand and prices and will be sent broke, thus providing even more markets for gas.
Big Gas is thus delighted to secretly support the war on coal as it will do wonders for the demand for gas; but they fail to understand that once Greens have destroyed coal power, they will then turn their green guns onto gas.
Uranium producers love the greens. They know that if coal and gas are banned from power generation, and all hydro-power sites are “world-heritage protected”, all that is left to stabilise the electricity grids of modern society is nuclear power.
Even coal producers see short-term benefits in supporting inane green ideas like carbon capture and burial. This would greatly increase the amount of coal needed to generate the electricity consumed to collect, separate, compress, transport and bury exhaust gases as well as to refine and fabricate all the metals needed for gas collectors, compressors and pipelines. Even more silly is the academic dream to burn coal using oxygen, not air, for combustion to reduce the huge quantity of exhaust gases to be handled (mainly by removing nitrogen). This will consume even more energy and metals. Long term, the main beneficiaries of this industrial silliness will be nuclear power and uranium miners like Rio and BHP.
So Big Mining can extract benefits from green energy while earning political credits. And their PC executives can polish their green credentials in their posh suburban circles by supporting the silliness.
On the debit side are the usual victims – taxpayers and consumers of coal, oil, gas, electricity and metals; and employees and shareholders of industries being forced to close or emigrate because of expensive and unreliable electricity.

"**Several well-known brands of maize flour have been taken off supermarket shelves in Kenya, after a warning about unsafe levels of a poisonous substance known as aflatoxin.**
This has led to widespread concern, as maize is the country's main staple. The flour is used to prepare ugali, a cooked starchy paste the key ingredients of which are just the flour and water. Maize is also used to prepare another traditional dish of the region, githeri, which is a mixture of maize and beans, cooked whole.
Maize is not only a common dish in most households in Kenya but it is also a familiar food across east, central and southern Africa, going by different names such as nshima, sima, sadza, mealie meal or posho. In fact Africa consumes 30% of maize produced in the world, research shows.
But it is not just maize that is often contaminated with the poisonous substance. In East Africa, maize, milk and groundnuts are the main sources of aflatoxin exposure. These are commonly mixed together to make a porridge for infants and children, putting them at particular risk of aflatoxin poisoning.
For Kenya, aflatoxin contamination is a long-standing problem. The country is considered a world hotspot, with incidents of acute toxicity recorded in 2004 and 2010.
It is likely that a problem with food in one country could have an effect in its neighbours, as farm produce is often traded across borders. Already, Uganda and Rwanda have banned peanut brands imported from Kenya after the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) blacklisted them because of unsafe levels of aflatoxin.
Kebs, which is responsible for ensuring the overall quality of standards in industry, has suspended the licences of five brands of maize flour and ordered that they be removed from the market.
These are Dola, manufactured by Kitui Flour Mills, Starehe made by Pan African Grain and Kifaru by Alpha Grain Limited.
The other banned brands are 210 (Kenblest Limited) and Jembe by Kensalrise Limited. All these brands are widely sold across the country.
Kebs has said that the suspension followed market surveillance and tests that established that these brands had more than acceptable levels of aflatoxins.
But an association representing cereal millers in the country protested against the ban, questioning the validity of methods used to test aflatoxin levels. They say other independent tests came up with different results.
Indeed tests commissioned by a local TV station for a investigative report had a different outcome. The report by NTV indicated that three different brands, Jogoo, Jimbi and Heri, had unsafe levels of aflatoxin - at 13.8, 16.2 and 16.19 parts per billion (microgram per kilogram) respectively. Kebs considers amounts of more than 10 per billion in maize and other grains to be unsafe.
However the TV report said its tests on the Kifaru brand of maize flour, which Kebs has suspended, found it to be aflatoxin-free.
For consumers, this is all confusing and it is difficult to be sure that all the dozens of maize products that remain on sale are safe.
""Can someone tell me the reason as to only the five milling companies have been recalled from the market? All millers buy maize from Kenya National Cereals and Produce Board, which is government owned,"" Morphat Gold said on Twitter.
A person going by the name Potentash tweeted: ""Scary. We need to hold the government to account. They have a responsibility to make sure the food we eat is safe for consumption.""
Many Kenyans also take grain harvested from their farms to centres for milling. The NTV investigation pointed out that this maize doesn't fall under the auspices of the standards regulator and so it is difficult to know whether or not it is safe.
It has not helped that Kebs has not responded to these queries, though it has indicated to the BBC that it will be doing so at a press conference at an unspecified date.
So even with the suspension of the maize brands, there is still cause for the consumer to be cautious and vigilant.
Aflatoxin is one of a group of naturally occurring poisonous substances, known as mycotoxins, produced by certain types of mould or fungi.
Aflatoxin is one of the most poisonous of the mycotoxins and has gained the most attention because of its occurrence in food and its severe effects on human health, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).
The toxic fungi that produce it thrive in warm and moist environments, growing in soil, decaying vegetation, hay and grains.
WHO estimates that about 25% of food produced globally is destroyed every year because of aflatoxin contamination \- and there have been reports of Kenya destroying tonnes of maize for this reason.
Other than maize, crops that are frequently affected are cereals such as rice, sorghum, millet and wheat. Cassava, nuts and oilseeds, including groundnuts, cotton seeds, sunflower and coconut, are also regularly contaminated.
Spices and herbs such as coriander, turmeric, ginger could also be affected. Some fruits, vegetable oils and fats, as well as milk and eggs from animals fed with contaminated feeds, could also be ways human beings can get aflatoxin poisoning.
Globally, deaths resulting from aflatoxin contamination are rare. But yes, aflatoxin consumption could be fatal.
In 2004, more than 80 Kenyans died from consuming maize that had been contaminated with a toxin-producing fungus. Another 180 were admitted to hospitals.
At the time a doctor at Makindu hospital told the BBC that patients had symptoms of liver failure with yellow eyes, swollen legs, vomiting and bleeding from the nose.
Eating food with unsafe levels of aflatoxin could have long-term adverse effects on health and could be life-threatening, the WHO cautions.
Aflatoxin is considered a carcinogen - something that is capable of causing cancer. The WHO indicates the long-term effects of the toxin trigger cancer and cause immune deficiency. David Osogo, a nutrition and health researcher at Africa Population Health Research Center (APHRC), says aflatoxin contamination in the human body is linked to high risk of liver and kidney cancer.
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) notes that the principal target for aflatoxins is the liver, with large doses of the substance leading to acute illness and death though liver cirrhosis, an irreversible scarring of the organ.
Consistent small doses can affect nutrition and the immune system. Children are considered particularly vulnerable and exposure can lead to stunted and delayed growth.
Some studies also suggest that aflatoxin could impair the development of an unborn baby in the womb, as toxins pass from mother to the foetus through the placenta, according to the US National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI). Toxins can also be passed through breast milk.
Inadequate drying and storage in damp conditions provides the right condition for mould to grow and contaminate food produce. So it would be best to avoid food that has mould on it.
However, aflatoxin is colourless, odourless and invisible, and there is often no sign of contamination.
It also tasteless, though a large amount of fungus could make the grain or other food taste bitter. It would be better to avoid any food that has an unnatural or bitter taste.
The only way to test aflatoxin is to do it scientifically, so there is not much that you can do to physically detect the poison.
WHO advises consumers to do a number of things to prevent exposure to the harmful substance:
In September, Zambia's vice-president urged Zambians to consider ditching maize meal for a more varied diet.
There are other grains that have higher energy and nutrient levels and are less susceptible to aflatoxin infestation. Switching to other foods may then also be an effective way of addressing the problem of dietary balance and malnutrition.
The FAO considers the development of fungal-resistant varieties of plants as one way to manage or control aflatoxin contamination.
Other ways to prevent aflatoxin exposure include lowering moisture content of plant seeds after harvesting and during storage, and storing commodities at low temperatures. Using fungicides and preservatives against fungal growth are other options.

For over 40 years (1961-2002), the Greenland ice sheet cooled, thickened, and gained mass just as anthropogenic CO2 emissions were sharply rising.

Image Source: Mikkelsen et al., 2018

According to Greenland ice sheet instrumental records, there was a dramatic cooling trend during summer months from the late 1980s to early 2000s (Chylek et al., 2004).
“The average temperature of the warmest month and the summer average (June, July and August) temperature show a decreasing trend of 3.0 and 2.2°C/decade between 1987 and 2001.”

Greenland had been gaining +40 Gt of ice per year during 1961-1990 (Fettweis et al., 2017).
Coincident with the cooling, the ice sheet was still thickening and gaining mass – +11 Gt (gigatons) per year – as recently as 1992-2002 (Zwally et al., 2005).
Annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions rates tripled during this 41-year period, and atmospheric CO2 rose by nearly 60 parts per million (317 ppm to 375 ppm).

After 2002, the Greenland ice sheet began losing mass as the ice sheet temperatures warmed.
This warming and mass loss trend have often been attributed to the rise in CO2 emissions by those promoting anthropogenically-driven global warming (AGW).
But if rising CO2 emissions are the causal mechanism for the post-2002 warming and mass loss, why did the Greenland ice sheet cool and gain about 1.35 trillion metric tons of ice for the duration of 41 years as CO2 emissions rates tripled from ~2.5 GtC/yr (gigatons of carbon per year) to ~7.5 GtC/yr?
Succinctly, why would an ice sheet both lose and gain mass as CO2 rises?

 _USA Today_ has run yet another dire climate change feature, this time riffing off a federal compendium on climate change that hasn’t even been published—it is in draft form and is being severely criticized at this very minute.



Judging from what people really think about global warming, the paper should have saved its talent for something they are actually interested in.



Hardly a day goes by without some climate scare, and earlier this week we found a terrific example of how biased the reporting on this issue has become. This particular threat, coming from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Eastern Germany, is that increasingly persisting jet stream patterns “almost freeze” weather anomalies in one place. This would create longer heat waves and persistent rainfall anomalies (high or low), which, they say, “can result in a high death toll, forest fires, and dramatic harvest losses”. The cause, of course is dreaded global warming caused by pernicious economic activity.



Needless to say, that generated a lot of news traffic.



At precisely the same time, two University of Melbourne scientists published a paper in Geophysical Research letters, studying virtually the same data and finding little significant change. Further, they found that any changes in these patterns, known as atmospheric “blocking”, under which weather tends to stagnate, were small compared to natural year‐​to‐​year variability. In what is always a bad sign for solid science, they found that any connections between blocking frequency and global warming are highly dependent upon the methodology they used. Bottom line: they couldn’t find much of a signal, and even if they did, they weren’t sure what it all meant.



News traffic? Zilch.



The difference is that death and destruction sell ad copy, while, as the story goes, “plane lands on time” doesn’t. But, in climate change, there’s a remarkable disconnect between what people read and what they think.



A large number of people will be exposed to the story that scientists are reporting that global warming is leading to more severe weather. Meanwhile, no one will hear about the negative results in Geophysical Research Letters.





In climate change, there’s a remarkable disconnect between what people read and what they think.



The type of global warming science reported to the public grows asymmetrically, with alarming evidence receiving far more exposure than evidence for more modest changes and impacts, or, climate‐​as‐​usual.



And what’s the bottom line? People still don’t give a darn.



The prestigious National Opinion Research Center (NORC), located at the University of Chicago, just released a report on what it calls “priority worries”.



Given a list of 8 “problems”, only 3.6 per cent of Americans rank “Environment” as their highest priority. Within a sub‐​list of seven environmental “problems”, 19.6% rate climate change as “extremely dangerous”, where it ranks fourth out of the seven.



My greener friends are convinced that this is all because of the mean old Koch brothers. But if that’s true, they must have huge propaganda operations in Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Flanders, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia and France, where even lower percents rate climate change as “extremely dangerous”. And they must be really active in Argentina (despite its nationalized oil companies), where environment ties for dead last among the eight issues, and only 5.9 per cent of the respondents ranked it as the most important environmental problem. (Weirdly enough, it ranks absolute lowest in Israel).



Nor have the numbers really budged much. This is the third iteration of NORC’s environment and climate survey. The first was in 1993. Since then and this survey (which is actually 2010 data), the percent calling it “extremely dangerous” has gone up in eight countries and down in seven, about as even a split as is possible.



So, despite a wonderful recent example of the asymmetric coverage of climate science in the news, people just aren’t buying the end of the world. Around the world, there’s about five times as much concern for the economy than there is for climate change.



The causes for this disconnect are mysterious. The adage that if you repeat something enough it becomes a fact just doesn’t seem to hold with climate change. The increasing cumulation of science horror stories seems to be ignored.



On can only conclude that either the public just doesn’t trust the press on environmental stories, or they don’t trust the scientists whose work is preferentially reported. That’s too bad, because absent trust in science, what’s left to guide people with regard to environmental policy? And further, how did the press—once the most cherished of American institutions—lose so much of its authority?



Finally, despite all the one‐​sided blather, people just aren’t all that concerned, which makes one wonder what President Obama was doing when he devoted more words to climate change than to any other issue in his second Inaugural Address.

In these times of COVID-19, you’ll forgive me for deviating from climate and energy from time to time.
Lately nothing has been more annoying to me than the misuse of the graphic (see below) that claims to tell us why it’s important to prolong (flatten) the pandemic: in order to keep our (woefully inadequate) healthcare system from becoming overloaded.

This is why it’s important to stay healthy, keep others healthy and wash your hands. The red is what Trump and his team are trying to prevent. God bless 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/uIbBzJx6zm

The flatter the pandemic, the longer the shutdowns
This flattening (prolonging) of the pandemic of course now involves instituting lock downs, curfews and devastating widespread business shutdowns. No one wants to hear it, but the consequences risk being catastrophic: mass unemployment, depression, civil and political unrest. This is now a very real possibility in Europe and North America.
Not only are the shutdown measures having a profound impact on our liberties, they soon will be needlessly testing the very outer limits of our society’s ability to cohere. The longer the lock downs and business shutdowns drag on, the greater the already massive economic damage will become. Meltdown becomes a real possibility.
Most economies cannot survive protracted shutdowns
Yes, of course, people have to keep distance and practice commonsense things like hand-washing, disinfection and absorbing their coughs and sneezes. Yes, local hot-spot lock downs may be warranted. But these should never morph into country-wide blanket-curfews that end up smothering everything.

Increase hospital capacity, isolate the vulnerable
The strategy should not be to flatten (extend) the pandemic (B), like may countries have been misled into doing, rather it should be to shorten its duration (C), keep the peak hospitalization number down (blue curve) while increasing health care capacity (blue dashed line).

The two fundamental ways to do this:

Raise the health care system’s capacity. Ideally that should have been done long ago, like after the earlier warnings that health care systems were not at all up to par. Had governments heeded these warnings, the dotted line denoting healthcare system capacity would have been raised substantially. Now authorities are scrambling madly.
Reduce the peak number of hospital cases. That could have been, and still can be, done by strictly isolating the elderly and vulnerable from those who aren’t. The many who aren’t elderly and vulnerable would get infected and do just fine. Soon, we’d have the desired herd immunity.

Unfortunately there has been woefully inadequate effort on both of these two approaches. Political correctness to some extent prevented that. The result: the pandemic will continue, more curfews, lock downs and potentially catastrophic closures of large parts of the economy.
Few economies can survive
The way things are now, countries with the most rickety health care systems (low capacity) have no choice but to impose – indefinitely – the most stringent and protracted lock downs if they wish to keep the number of hospital cases manageable (and thus look politically correct). These lock downs of course will only prolong the pandemic, which in turn will mean even longer shutdowns.
Few economies will be able to survive that.
Virologists alone cannot decide policy
This is why policy decisions cannot be left up to virologists alone, but must involve experts from multiple disciplines. This is the only way to achieve an optimum outcome.
Those of us who are fit should go back to work and not worry about getting infected. The rest should be protected in isolation until the whole thing blows over.

" The following is a Google translated version of this original post in French – published with permission of the author:LA VRT ET LA PROPAGANDE CLIMATIQUE Recently I relayed on my Facebook page the response of RTBF (French-speaking Belgian TV) to a listener who questioned him on the opportunity to reserve a space for so-called “climate-skeptical” theses:“At the risk of disappointing you, we do not consider that exposing climate-skeptical theses is evidence of courage or daring. We do not feel that we should dare to speak on this subject. There are enough scientific studies going in the direction of global warming so that we can consider, without being accused of partiality, that global warming is a fact. Have a nice week end “.That the RTBF drastically reduces the climate debate to the mere existence or not of a global warming, any “climate-skeptic” can only be a retrograde fossil that denies this obviousness and must therefore be ignored if not fought, is an example striking of the submission of the whole of the world press, and more particularly of the Belgian audio-visual media, to the only thesis of the human origin of the climatic fluctuations. They tolerate virtually one speaker on the subject: the catastrophist Jean-Pascal Van Ypersele of Strihou, ex-vice president of the IPCC. (1)But all this is not new, and on several occasions already I have treated the subject of a press reduced to the rank of mere propagandist (2), and more particularly of the editorial line of the RTBF and the VRT, which remember that public service organizations.The imperious instructions and invitations given to journalists are scrupulously respected. Among many others, note:– “Not only do journalists not have to report what skeptical scientists say, they have a responsibility not to report on it” . GELBSPAN ROSS- publisher of the Boston Globe – 07/2000.– “We have the duty not to be impartial. It is our duty to take the scientists’ point of view and not waste time wondering if they are right or not . ” Alan Rusbridger – Director of the Oxford LMH College – Member of The Scott Trust, owner of the Guardian and the Observer – former editor of the Guardian. (3)– The instructions given to BBC journalists. (4)The Dutch site “climategate.nl” (5) relays the complaint lodged in Belgium before the Council of Journalism, after the remarks concerning the partiality which the VRT (Dutch-speaking Belgian television) shows in its relation of the climatic problematic, were rejected by the mediator of that body. A position that will not surprise anyone! Below are some of the arguments presented following the responses received from the mediator.One of them particularly appealed to me: the actual existence of a cordon sanitaire around so-called “climate-skeptical” personalities, much more rigorous than the one supposed to preserve us from extremist ideas. In the Middle Ages, heretics were burned. Today, we must preserve the population from the pernicious contagion of “climate-skeptical” scientists!Jo Moreau Complaint to the Belgian Council of Journalism regarding climate information (VRT)In response to my recent correspondence with the VRT mediator, he clearly acknowledges that there is only one credible source for VRT’s climate information service, the IPCC.The Ombudsman also said that journalists can not replace scientists because they do not have the knowledge to judge whether scientific opinions are correct or not? And yet, that’s what they do by promoting only one (political) vision.Moreover, to our knowledge, in its TV programs of the past six months, VRT has not invited any climate-skeptical scientist to defend its point of view. And if there had been, it would have been an exception drowned in the almost daily broadcast of the IPCC’s alarming news on the climate.The VRT attaches great importance to the code of ethics and claims to be seeking the truth, but not with regard to global warming . For example, it pays no attention to the many sources criticizing IPCC positions.This selective blindness of the VRT editorial team has consequences.– The unilateral nature of VRT’s broadcasts is a form of deception that does not respect ethical rules.– This contributes to a bias without a scientific basis.– This puts pressure on politicians with the obvious consequence that some political parties are thus favored. In this case, it is the Flemish party GROEN and its Walloon equivalent ECOLO. Their unilateral views confirm the suspicion that VRT publishers follow a left-wing ideology directed against anyone who departs from it.– The great attention paid without any criticism to young schoolchildren also contributes to the manipulation of the population. After all, if children are not scientists, they are very interesting and easy to manipulate media players.Regardless of these ethical concerns , it remains of course to be determined whether VRT has the right to lay a cordon sanitaire around scientists who have not manifested themselves as right-wing activists. We note that party chairman Vlaams Belang (6) is invited, but not climate-skeptics.It is not acceptable that during debates, the TRV authorizes the guests to denigrate unfettered climate-skeptics unrepresented.Today, everything is different: everything is now a question of consensus. If there is consensus, no need for discussion or research. Consensus is the new magic word. Not surprisingly, postmodern philosophy has elevated consensus to the rank of supreme arbiter of truth and falsehood, good and evil.Our VRT apparently thinks so too. From the answer to our question, ” Why does the TRV provide exclusive coverage representing the position of the IPCC, ” we extract the following sentence: “The editors can only declare that the UN panel on climate benefits always of a consensus for the academic debate. It is therefore not illogical that the publishers pay the greatest attention to the work of the panel  “.“They say it all and it’s true,” CQFD ! I must admit that it is much simpler to apply than previously accepted methods of proof. If we want to know if something is true or false, we must focus today on the existence of a consensus.I address this complaint to VRT editors at the Council for Journalism because recent correspondence with the ombudsman shows that VRT writers are clearly not ready to change their unilateral information on climate change. (1) https://belgotopia.com/2019/01/28/jean-pascal-van-ypersele-climatologist-exclusive-of-our-medias/(2) https://belgotopia.com/2017/03/13/journalism-information-or-propaganda/(3) https://belgotopia.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/the-journalist-and-the-climate-change-information-and-activism/(4) https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/07/bbc-we-get-climate-change-coverage-wrong-too-often(5) https://www.climategate.nl/2019/05/brief-aan-de-belgische-raad-voor-de-journalistiek/ ?(6)

Europeans are eating too many imports from tropical countries, which are cutting down the rainforest and thus fueling climate change, says Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg:
EU consumption linked to tropical deforestation
A sixth of all emissions resulting from the typical diet of an EU citizen can be directly linked to deforestation of tropical forests. Two new studies, from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shed new light on this impact, by combining satellite imagery of the rainforest, global land use statistics and data of international trade patterns. “In effect, you could say that the EU imports large amounts of deforestation every year. If the EU really wants to achieve its climate goals, it must set harder environmental demands on those who export food to the EU,” says Martin Persson from Chalmers, one of the researchers behind the studies.
The link between production of certain foods and deforestation has been known before. But what Martin Persson and Chalmers colleague Florence Pendrill have now investigated is the extent to which deforestation in the tropics is linked to food production, and then where those foods are eventually consumed. In the first study, they focused on how the expansion of cropland, pastures, and forestry plantations has taken place at the expense of the rainforest. “We can see that more than half of deforestation is due to production of food and animal feed, such as beef, soy beans and palm oil. There is big variation between different countries and goods, but overall, exports account for about a fourth of that deforestation which is connected to food production. And these figures have also increased during the period we looked at,” says Florence Pendrill.
Using this information, the researchers investigated, in the second study, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from this production (see the picture below), and where the produce is then consumed. The figures for the EU are particularly interesting, since the EU is a large food importer. Furthermore, the EU shall soon present a plan for how to reduce its contribution to deforestation. The EU already has strict requirements in place connected to deforestation which producers of timber and wood products must adhere to in order to export their goods to the EU. This demonstrates their ability to influence other countries’ work in protecting the rainforest.
“Now, as the connection between food production and deforestation is made clearer, we should start to discuss possibilities for the EU to adopt similar regulations for food imports. Quite simply, deforestation should end up costing the producer more. If you give tropical countries support in their work to protect the rainforest, as well as giving farmers alternatives to deforestation to increase production, it can have a big impact,” says Florence Pendrill. The current studies were done in collaboration with researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute in Sweden, Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre in Germany, and NTNU, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. They are a continuation of research which was done through the Prince project (Policy Relevant Indicators for National Consumption and Environment), where the connections between Swedish consumption and emissions from deforestation were presented in the autumn.

The studies indicate that, although there is a big variation between different EU countries, on average a sixth of the emissions from a typical EU diet can be directly traced back to deforestation in the tropics. Emissions from imports are also high when compared with domestic agricultural emissions. For several EU countries, import emissions connected to deforestation are equivalent to more than half of the emissions from their own, national agricultural production. “If the EU really wants to do something about its impact on the climate, this is an important emissions source. There are big possibilities here to influence production so that it avoids expanding into tropical forests,” says Martin Persson.
Above all, Martin Persson believes the responsibility for achieving these changes lies with bigger actors, such as countries and large international organisations. But he also sees a role for the consumer to get involved and have an influence. “Public opinion is vital for the climate question — not least in influencing politicians, but also commercially. We can see already that several companies have made commitments to protecting tropical forests, through voluntarily pledging to avoid products which are farmed on deforested land. And in large part, that results from the fact that popular opinion is so strong on this issue,” he concludes.
More information on: Carbon dioxide emissions due to tropical deforestation:
For the period 2010-2014, the researchers estimate net emissions of 2.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide due to deforestation associated to the expansion of croplands, pastures and forestry plantations in the tropics. The main commodity groups associated with these emissions were cattle meat (0.9 gigatonnes of CO2) and oilseed products (including both palm oil and soybeans; 0.6 gigatonnes of CO2).
There are large geographic variations in what commodities are associated with deforestation-related emissions. In Latin America, cattle meat is the dominant contributor (0.8 gigatonnes of CO2), mainly attributed to Brazilian production. In Indonesia almost half of the emissions (0.3 gigatonnes of CO2) come from oilseeds (mainly oil palm). In the rest of Asia-Pacific and Africa, a more diverse mix of commodities drives emissions from deforestation.

"A group of leading climate researchers has identified a fatal flaw in the climate models that leads them to produce triple the global warming predicted from doubling the CO2 in the air.
CO2 in the atmosphere has some warming effect on Earth’s climate, but undisputed science shows that each additional CO2 molecule we emit has less warming effect than all its predecessors already in the air.
The direct warming effect of doubling the CO2 in the air is generally agreed to be little more than 1 C°. However climate models produce exaggerated warming forecasts by assuming that strongly positive or amplifying temperature feedbacks, such as the increased capacity of warmer air to carry water vapour, a greenhouse gas. They assume that these positive feedbacks will turn 1 C° of direct warming into 3 C° of imagined catastrophe.
They model this assumed feedback with a feedback system-gain equation which is at the heart of every climate model. The equation, however, is borrowed from electronic circuitry. It is not applicable to dynamical systems such as the Earth’s atmosphere.
However, a growing body of learned papers in the climate-science journals (e.g. Lindzen & Choi, 2009, 2011; Spencer & Braswell, 2010, 2011) consider that climate feedbacks are net-negative, moderating rather than intensifying the 1 C° direct warming from a CO2 doubling.

Global temperature has fluctuated by little more than 3.5 C° either side of the long-run average over the past 810,000 years. That range is little more than the range of settings on your home thermostat. If the rogue equation applied to the climate, it could not have been this stable for so long.

"On Earth Day we should Celebrate The True Green Fuels – Hydrocarbons and Nuclear.
The Carbon Sense Coalition today urged people to celebrate the true green fuels – oil, coal, gas, nuclear and, in places, geothermal and hydro.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that these fuels have reduced man’s pressure on the environment to such an extent that they should be celebrated on “Earth Day”.

Quotes:
It was petroleum that provided the kerosene that replaced whale oil in lamps and greatly reduced the slaughter of whales.
Coal saved the forests that were being cut down for smelters, forges, charcoal, heaters and stoves. Steel made with coke then replaced wood for mine props, bridges and tall buildings. As steam engines and iron ships replaced wooden wind-jammers in world navies and merchant fleets, the forests expanded.
Coal gas and clean coal cured the smogs of London and Pittsburgh. Piped gas for home heating and street lighting and the even better “clean-coal-by-wire” (coal powered electricity) worked wonders to reduce air pollution in “The Big Smoke”.
Petrol driven cars and trucks removed horse manure from the big cities, and tractors reduced the amount of land required to grow food for those cities.
Nuclear power is the ultimate “green energy” – enormous amounts of clean energy generated on a tiny footprint, by minute quantities of fuel, with little effect on air or water quality. Its only disadvantage is that, unlike coal and gas, it does not recycle the gases of life to the atmosphere.
Naturally there are risks in every human endeavour but modern energy sources kill far fewer people and wildlife than were once lost in timber getting, horse breaking, wind-jammers, sulky capsize, air pollution and city wildfires. And to believe that man can tweak the climate with carbon taxes is non-sense.
In contrast, the so called “green energy” sources usually lauded on Earth Day have a heavy toll on the environment to produce piddling amounts of unreliable and costly energy.
Both wind and solar energy are so dilute that large areas of land must be sterilised by roads, transmission lines and construction sites to collect significant energy. Already many wind towers have been abandoned and others are being de-commissioned because of high maintenance costs or poor energy production.
Roof-top solar is a joke as a reliable supplier of energy for most of humanity. In most installations of wind and solar power, the facilities would not be built without subsidies and other political props, and it is doubtful that the green-power turbines and panels will generate enough useful energy over their limited life to recover the energy needed for their raw materials, manufacture, construction, roads, power lines, earth works, maintenance and decommissioning.
Green energy is not environmentally friendly.
Where big wind/solar facilities are constructed, many native birds and bats are sliced by whirling swords, or singed and fried by concentrated solar heat rays. Blinded by their obsession with blaming fossil fuels for everything, greens pretend that this unnecessary slaughter of wildlife is not occurring.
Without carbon and nuclear fuels, Earth would be raped for fuel and food by destitute people trying to eke out a living without the greatest boon to modern living – cheap reliable energy. As Alex Epstein, from the Centre for Industrial Progress says eloquently, “fossil fuels are the greenest energy”.
Fossil Fuels: The Greenest Energy
“Despite what most environmentalists would have us believe, fossil fuels have made our lives more livable, not less. Thanks to coal, oil, and natural gas, the developed world has routine access to clean water, better sanitation, and yes, cleaner air. Watch the video below and find out how, rather than destroying the planet, this miracle energy source is actually saving lives.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
The bottom line from the new report from the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) is that the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) knew, but didn’t highlight, the fact that the best available scientific evidence suggests that the earth’s climate is much less sensitive to atmospheric carbon dioxide input than the climate models they relied upon to forecast future global warming portray.   
  
We covered the GWPF report and its implications in this post. But one implication is worth mentioning again, from the report’s conclusions:   




The [climate models] overestimate future warming by 1.7–2 times relative to an estimate based on the best observational evidence.



While the report's authors, Nicolas Lewis and Marcel Crok, are talking about the future, the same thing should apply to the past. In fact, a strong test of Lewis and Crok’s prediction is whether or not the same climate models predict too much warming to have already taken place than observations indicate.   
  
There is perhaps a no better general assessment of past model behavior than the analysis that we developed for a post back in the fall.   
  
The figure below is our primary finding. It shows how the observed rate of global warming compares with the rate of global warming projected to have occurred by the collection of climate models used by the IPCC. We performed this comparison over all time scales ranging from from 10 to 63 years. Our analysis ended in 2013 and included an analysis of the global temperature trend beginning in each year from 1950 through 2004.   
  
As can be clearly seen in our figure, climate models have consistently overestimated the amount of warming that has taken place. In fact, they are so bad, that over the course of the past 25 years (and even at some lengths as long as 35 years) the observed trend falls outside of the range which includes 95 percent of all model runs. In statistical parlance, this situation means that the observed trend cannot be reliably considered to be part of the collection of modeled trends. In other words, the real world is not accurately captured by the climate models—the models predict that the world should warm up much faster than it actually does.   






That the models don’t work when simulating the past is strong indication that they won’t work when projecting the future.   
  
And judging from past performance, the conclusions of Lewis and Crok, that “[t]he [climate models] overestimate future warming by 1.7–2 times relative to an estimate based on the best observational evidence” seem right on the money.   
  
Global climate disaster averted! Too bad the IPCC didn’t see fit to pass this important bit of information along to policymakers, but instead, attempted to sweep it under the rug.   
  
Maybe there ought to be a congressional investigation. Staffers, start your engines!

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



From _The Canberra Times_ , September 26, 1988 



On [September 7, 2018](https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=215193), which is close enough to 30 years after the above article, an aircraft landed on a runway that was still under construction at the Maldives International Airport. Why would one build a new runway when the island was soon to be completely underwater?



I guess since the tourists keep visiting, the drinking water did not run out in 1992 either. Should we score this as two fails?

From Polar Bear Science
Posted on October 28, 2019
Tomorrow I will be giving a public lecture in Paris on polar bear conservation success and the spectacular failure of the polar bear survival models used to scare children senseless.
However, while I was in London a few days ago I spoke with James Delingpole, author and columnist at Breitbart who has recently taken to producing podcast and video interviews.

Yesterday, he posted a column summarizing our discussion, with a link to the entire podcast: “WATCH: Canadian Professor Lost Her Job for Telling the Truth About ‘Endangered’ Polar Bears.” Read it here.
Also, here is the video of my London lecture:

Celebrities, activists, environmentalist organizations, the UN, government entities and sadly, even the Vatican support the theory that humans cause climate change. However, in this exclusive interview, “global warming” expert and author Marc Morano gives you hard-hitting arguments and facts that dispel the artificial fear propagated by “climate emergency” alarmists.

Guest “sports commentary” by David Middleton
RISING RISKSClimate change is threatening sports stadiums and arenas, and teams like the Yankees and Dolphins are battling backPUBLISHED MON, JAN 27 2020Diana OlickMiami’s Hard Rock Stadium will host about 65,000 fans on Super Bowl Sunday. While the biggest battle in football will last just one evening, the fight that stadium faces from the effects of climate change will go on indefinitely.It is not alone. Teams and stadiums across country are dealing with flooding, extreme storms, excessive heat and smoke from wildfires.“The last three years in September, we’ve had climate issues, whether they’re hurricane threats. We had to actually move a game,” said Tom Garfinkel, CEO of the Miami Dolphins football team. “We’ve had lightning strikes that we’ve never had in 30 years here, where we had to delay a game. It was the longest game in the history of the NFL.”[…]CNBC
Hurricane season is not a “climate issue”.
“Global Hurricane Frequency (all & major) — 12-month running sums. The top time series is the number of global tropical cyclones that reached at least hurricane-force (maximum lifetime wind speed exceeds 64-knots). The bottom time series is the number of global tropical cyclones that reached major hurricane strength (96-knots+). Adapted from Maue (2011) GRL.”  Dr. Ryan N. Maue
And the  “longest game in the history of the NFL” wasn’t a “climate issue.”  Lightning isn’t climate.  Oddly enough, that game was in September 2018.  2018 will come up again later in this post.
Back to the CNBC article prattling on about climate change…
[…]American Airlines Arena, where the Miami Heat basketball franchise plays, sits right on the edge of Miami’s Biscayne Bay.“The Arena will begin to flood with only two feet of sea level rise. I’m talking 20 years or less,” said Henry Briceno, a professor at Florida International University who studies the impact of climate change on water. He expects a similar fate for the Hard Rock Stadium at a three feet rise, and said he was appalled to hear that a Major League Soccer expansion team, backed by soccer icon David Beckham, is proposing a new stadium be built near the Miami airport.“I don’t know if those guys know that they are building in the future Atlantis,” said Briceno.[…]CNBC
“The Arena will begin to flood with only two feet of sea level rise. I’m talking 20 years or less,” said Henry Briceno…
According to Dr. Briceno’s LinkedIn page, he spent 10 years at the Colorado School of Mines… He beat Bluto Blutarsky by 3 full years.



American Airlines Arena, FLAmerican Airlines Arena is a Building in Miami-Dade County, Florida. It has an elevation of 1 meters, or 3 feet.Lat-Lon.com
Sea level in the Miami area is rising at a rate of less than 3 mm/yr.
Miami Beach (NOAA)
Virginia Key (NOAA)
At 2.84 mm/yr, it will take 215 years for sea level to rise by 2 feet.  For sea level to rise 2 feet in 20 years, it would have to rise at a rate of 30.5 mm/yr.  
Short of Doctor Evil using a space “LASER” to instantly melt the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, it is physically impossible for sea level to rise that quickly.  Just a couple of years ago, they were prattling about Miami Beach sea level rising by 2 feet in 40 years.  
Miami Beach spends millions to hold back the seaThe city is installing powerful storm water pumps and raising some public streets by an average of two feet.Sea levels in South Florida could rise up to two feet over the next four decades. That puts Miami Beach – an island three miles off the Florida coast – at risk.The city is already experiencing sunny day flooding – days when there’s no rain, but high tides push water up through storm drains and flood city streets.[…]Yale Climate Connections
And that wasn’t even physically possible.
 Projected sea level rise through 2100 AD. Two feet of sea level rise over the next four decades would require a pace even faster than that required for 1 meter (~3 feet) of sea level rise by the end of this century. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/12/21/oh-say-can-you-see-modern-sea-level-rise-from-a-geological-perspective/ 
Sea level rise in the Miami area is not accelerating and it is rising at a rate of about 1 foot per century.   Even at 3.5 mm/yr, sea level would only rise by 14 cm (5.5 in) over the next 40 years.

[…]“Every community that hosts a professional sports venue, a sports stadium or arena, is going to be affected by global climate disruption, by climate change, whether through storm surges, more precipitation, stronger hurricanes, wildfires, droughts,” said Allen Hershkowitz, environmental science advisor to the New York Yankees, the first and only such known position in professional sports.[…]CNBC 
Can you believe that the New York Yankees are the only professional sports franchise to employ an environmental science advisor adviser?



Yogi Berra must be rolling over in his grave.  Although, Yogi was not only a catcher and outfielder, he was also a meteorologist…
“It gets late out there early.” IZQuotes
Why don’t the New York Mets, New York Jets and New York Giants employ  environmental science advisers?  They play in the same climate change as the Yankees do.  Is there something special about the Bronx Bombers?
“I mean, no one looks at the New York Yankees and thinks that they’re some kind of a left-wing radical organization,” added Hershkowitz.  CNBC 
I certainly did… I’m a life-long New York Mets fan!
“It ain’t over till it’s over.” New York Mets manager Yogi Berra, July 1973 (Centerfieldmaz)
Fortunately, this CNBC article ain’t over…
[…]The initiative is especially imperative to the Dolphins’ owner, Stephen Ross, who is also chairman of The Related Cos., the developer behind Manhattan’s massive new Hudson Yards project, a retail, office and residential complex which sits on the edge of the Hudson River.“There’s risk for everything. It’s not just sports,” said Ross. “That’s why I’m very active now in dealing with the climate, being upfront and doing things. You can’t wait to say, ‘Oh my God,’ and do it too late. If we don’t do something now, we are looking at extinction.”[…] CNBC 
Was that the mother-of-all non sequitur fallacies or what?  He’s building the most expensive real estate development in the history of human civilization about 10 feet above sea level and he’s worried about human extinction if we don’t fix the weather right now.

A Little “Inside Baseball”
As I previously mentioned, I am a life-long New York Mets fan.  I grew up in western Connecticut, about 90 minutes from New York City.  As often as I could, I would make the trip to Shea Stadium to watch my beloved Mets and there were seasons when I would try to watch every game on TV… Even during the seasons when the Mets sucked (which were more seasons than when they were good).  Two of the things that I really hated were:
RainoutsRain delays
If climate change is threatening baseball, we should see the effects of it in the number of rain outs and rain delays.  But, baseball, the most statistically intensive sport on Earth doesn’t seen to have stats for this.  Supposedly, the Commissioner’s Office has been keep records of rainouts and rain delays since 1986… But I haven’t been able to find them.
Mets-Braves rainout sets record for early season weather-related PPDsApr 22, 2018ESPN News ServicesThe Braves announced that their game against the New York Mets in Atlanta has been postponed because of inclement weather, setting a record.There have been 26 weather-related postponements this season, and according to The Associated Press, that’s the most through April since Major League Baseball began keeping records in 1986.There were 26 postponements through April in 2007, but one was in response to the death of St. Louis pitcher Josh Hancock.[…]ESPN
2018 must have been a bad year for sports weather.
MLB Must Consider Shortened Season as It Loses Attendance, Weather WarJACOB SHAFERAPRIL 19, 2018The MLB season is too dang long.That’s not a universal truism, but it’s definitely the opinion of Chicago Cubs first baseman and three-time All-Star Anthony Rizzo. He has a point.Here’s what Rizzo had to say Tuesday on Chicago’s ESPN 1000 (via ESPN.com’s Jesse Rogers):“I think we play too much baseball. Yes, guys are going to take pay cuts. But are we playing this game for the money or do we love this game? I know it’s both, but in the long run it will make everything better. … In a perfect world, we’d start the season later and play a few scheduled doubleheaders going into an off day. As a fan you’re going to a baseball game in April, and it’s raining, snowing and [with] freezing rain. Is it really that much fun? That’s my question.”Thus far, Mother Nature has bolstered Rizzo’s complaint. MLB initiated its season on March 29, the earliest Opening Day ever. On Sunday alone, there were six rainouts, bringing the season total to a whopping 21. Partly, that’s an unavoidable act of God. Short of requiring all clubs to install retractable roofs, baseball’s powers that be can’t control the weather. And even domes haven’t been able to escape the wrath, as freezing temperatures sent ice falling through a hole in the Blue Jays’ roof on Monday.[…]Bleacher Report
I somehow doubt that “raining, snowing and [with] freezing rain” and “freezing temperatures” sending chunks of ice through holes in the roofs of covered stadiums is the type of climate change the CNBC article was prattling on about.
Maybe the problem isn’t the weather…
MLB can’t change the weather, but starting the season earlier than ever makes no sense at allBy PAUL SULLIVANCHICAGO TRIBUNEMAR 26, 2019Excluding the two-game series between the A’s and Mariners in Japan last week, baseball season starts in earnest on Thursday with 15 games, including the White Sox at the Royals and the Cubs at the Rangers.The March 28 opening date is the earliest ever to kick off a baseball season in North America, one day earlier than last year’s slate of openers.In its infinite wisdom, Major League Baseball decided in the last collective bargaining agreement to add an additional weekend at the start of the season, giving teams three or four additional off days in the 162-game schedule. This gives the players more time to rest over the course of the six-month schedule, and theoretically gives clubs more scheduling options.But that also means many teams, including the Sox and Cubs, likely will be playing several games in cold and rainy weather, if they’re fortunate enough to get the games in at all. And with teams doing everything they can to play, even in inclement weather, fans will have to endure some miserable days at the ballpark.[…]Chicago Tribune
Major League Baseball would be better, and less vulnerable to weather, with 142-game seasonNancy Armour USA TODAY SportsApril 16, 2018The rash of postponements due to snow and cold in the Midwest and on the East Coast – 24 and counting, and the season is just 19 days old! – ought to accelerate consideration for shortening the season. Baseball isn’t meant to be played in balaclavas and parkas, and the only time fans should need a blanket at the ballpark is when there’s a movie night under the stars. By doing away with interleague play, baseball could go to a 142-game season – and the schedule wouldn’t look all that different. The season could start April 15 and end Sept. 15, with the World Series ending by Oct. 15. There would even be room for additional off days.[…]USA Today
2018 again… “Workers at Wrigley Field clear snow before a Chicago Cubs Game this month. Nam Y. Huh, AP” USA Today 
Definitely not the sort of climate that the CNBC article was prattling on about.
After doing some digging, I did find some data on the number of rainouts from 2001-2018.  
“Baseball Season, 2018: It’s a Washout” WNYC News
 I also found a list of April rainouts for 2000-2011.  Putting these two list together yields this…

By John Rofe  




It is easy for someone with a balanced perspective to see why it is impossible for carbon dioxide (CO2) to have any measurable effect on climate. Further, from 100 years ago, starting with the superstars of science like Anders Angstrom and Niels Bohr onwards, the scientific community has understood why the Beer-Lambert law **(note a ‘law’ of science, not just an unsubstantiated and already disproven theory),** makes it impossible for any extra human CO2 emissions to materially change the climate. Only wads of money and a lust for power could and did change that.



It has long been known that with increased solar insolation comes extra heat and consequently extra evaporation. In this manner, water vapour picks up the role for the earth that sweat performs for the human body. 



With its sheer volume and ability to phase-change between gas, liquid and solid, it is hugely superior to the three human-generated emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O that we are taught to vilify. Water vapour, together with clouds govern almost the full extent of infra-red re-radiation from the earth’s surface into outer space. 



**Mankind has no role in this**. It is the solar cycles.



 **The time has come for reality to displace the elaborate fiction created under the auspices of the United Nations directed climate change fraud.**  
  
It has long been known that CO2 is colourless, odourless, non-toxic at atmospheric concentrations and essential for the survival of all life on earth. Further, more atmospheric CO2 means more plant food to help the greening of the planet. 



Less atmospheric CO2 means all plant life suffers because it is so essential to support photosynthesis. The charade of any political party that refers to itself as “green” attempting to tax CO2 and thereby reduce its concentration is bizarre in the extreme. **James Shaw should be ashamed of his role in this fraud.**



I will therefore not make a submission to the “zero carbon bill” because although elaborate, it is just a fraud – and a heavily promoted mania for subversive political purposes.



The news media needs to take the time to talk to its NZCSC members to gain a more thorough understanding of these truths. NIWA and the current advisers to the government are not part of the solution, but their role must be investigated by the proper authorities because they are clearly an integral part of the fraud and surely must be well paid for that role.



I suggest the time is now ripe for the leader of the opposition to change science advisers and demand the resignation of both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Climate Change. The summary details on the first link below should be enough to explain why.



There are a number of members of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition who understand every one of the reasons why this government has become a fraudulent enterprise but those experts have been denied access to the news media.



I am now prepared to release a copy of my complaint to the NZ Serious Fraud Office, which explains the drama, for anyone with a stomach to see the fraud in all its gory glory. The SFO assistance will likely no longer be required if politicians take the required action.



 **So what is new and so dramatic?**



Because the peer-reviewed report by the team at the University of Northumbria was to be published this week on [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/), the people at NASA last week cynically front-ran some similar if superficial findings based on the (now outdated) solar dynamo studies of one researcher. 



**This showed on the NASA web site that solar cycle 25, due to commence in several months, would introduce a cooling climate**. 



The report showed an equivalence in solar activity to the early stage of the Maunder Minimum (so cold then that the seas froze, in what became known as the “Little Ice Age” which ran from 1280- 1850AD). NASA then “damned their contractor’s report with faint praise”. 



This treatment is not unexpected. Many are now aware that the two huge US environmental agencies NASA and NOAA, have been corrupted by the UN politics of “climate change” and have been guilty of data tampering with historical terrestrial temperature data since the year 2000. 



The evidence of this malfeasance is known to the present US administration, and all lies in plain sight. NASA’s actions are just a few of the dozens of decentralised supporting conspiracies to make “a lion look like a pig” (in the case of CO2) or make “a sow’s ear look like a silk purse” (in terms of their carbon vilification fraud).



 **The report, the URL for which is shown below, by Professor Valentina Zharkova and her team, has not come out of the blue. Her team’s dedicated work has been validated by similar projects at the major Russian scientific institutes.** Her team was recently augmented by the addition of Dr Popova from Moscow to utilise all available international knowledge.  




There are numerous books and peer-reviewed papers about the role of solar cycles in dominating the changes to the earth’s climate. Readers of this article can get some of those from the public library if they want. These reports are deliberately suppressed in mainstream media as part of the UN’s global “climate change” conspiracy which has been run under protest from genuine sceptics within the OECD from 1988 to the present. 



A string of experiments and observations leading to earlier reports by her team over the last 4-5 years have already marked Professor Zharkova as the leader in this field – at least in the West. The Russians have always adopted solar cycles as the primary reason for climate change…that is why they build so many nuclear-powered icebreakers in anticipation of what is to come. To the tightly controlled Western media, that penny has yet to drop!  




When the general public realises the true significance of this press release, Professor Zharkova and her team will become more famous than any other climate scientists, and likely on par with all-time greats in other fields from her own astrophysics specialisation.  
 **The learned paper is a work which can either be accepted as the pin to burst our Minister of Climate Change’s bubble or denied for a few more months until the world awakens to the enormity of the fraud being perpetrated on the average citizen.**



Comprehension of the paper as published suffers from the complexity of the issue for laypeople, and from shortcomings in Professor Zharkova’s English language skills, so please view the video below which has a summary from the GSM channel which has been studying this avenue of science for some years. 



It provides a comparison between the NASA and Zharkova papers. Please note that the GSM channel has scheduled an interview with Professor Zharkova next week. Here is [Professor Zharkova’s paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45584-3#Fig2), which summarises her team’s years of research:  
  
This is the final part of the climate puzzle that, together with existing evidence of the primacy of solar cycles on earth’s climate, effectively busts the global fraud.



Surely, no one ever believed that King Canute could turn back the tide, or that mankind could change the climate? Those two delusions are just so, so similar.



Yet with the help of biddable scientists and media barons, this UN-sponsored fraud has endured for 30 years, to the present day. 



Shame on us all!

Complex computer models are continually being used to generate incessant alarms about the future for our environment and resources – climate, weather, minerals, oil, food, water, pollution and the oceans.
Every year the computers get more expensive, and the models more complex, but their doomsday forecasts still fail.

Models are simple in principle. They have a formula linking two or more variables, such as rainfall in a catchment area and the water level in a dam. The model can tell us that 200mm of rain will fill the dam. But a few failed forecasts will result in a more complex model that tries to take account of obvious complicating factors such as ground cover in the catchment area and the rate of precipitation. Then more rainfall recording stations will be needed, and more complicating factors will be identified… needing a bigger computer.
Imagine the complexity of a mathematical model designed to forecast something as simple as next Wednesday’s weather in Brisbane, Birmingham or Boston.
The British Met Office owns Britain’s most powerful super computer. It can make 1,000 billion calculations every second while consuming more electricity than a small town. The Met claimed that it “will enable the Met Office to deliver more accurate forecasts, from hours to a century ahead”. Some 400 climate high priests attend this electronic monster. But it has totally failed to forecast several frigid European winters because the model makers believe their own story and have programmed the models with a global warming bias. They assume without proof or evidence that carbon dioxide controls global temperature.
The global models of IPCC climateers also have a warming bias and have failed spectacularly to date – their global temperature predictions have been wrong for 17 years straight.
When do they give up?
In 2000, the UK Met Office told us that snow was a thing of the past; in 2007, Australian Climate Commissioner Tim Flannery predicted cities such as Brisbane would never again have dam-filling rains; in 2008, Al Gore predicted “The entire north polar ice cap will be gone in five years”.
Are the people who work on the climate models smarter, wiser, more ethical and more experienced than the people who worked on financial models for governments, central banks, commercial banks, hedge funds, brokers and investors and who failed to predict the global financial crisis?
The atmosphere and the oceans are far more complex than the currency markets.
And yet there are still “experts” claiming that if they had bigger computers they could forecast global climate for a century ahead!
If the assumptions in the models remain wrong, then more powerful computers will just produce wrong answers faster.
Doing the same thing, and expecting a different result, is proof of climate modelling madness.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   




Tol said the IPCC emphasised the risks of climate change far more than the opportunities to adapt. A Reuters count shows the final draft has 139 mentions of “risk” and 8 of “opportunity”.   
  
  
Tol said farmers, for example, could grow new crops if the climate in their region became hotter, wetter or drier. “They will adapt. Farmers are not stupid,” he said.   
  
  
He said the report played down possible economic benefits of low levels of warming. Less cold winters may mean fewer deaths among the elderly, and crops may grow better in some regions.   
  
  
“It is pretty damn obvious that there are positive impacts of climate change, even though we are not always allowed to talk about them,” he said. But he said temperatures were set to rise to levels this century that would be damaging overall.



Tol has developed an economic model that finds that modest climate change will prove economically positive. However, towards that latter part of this century, temperatures in his model are projected to rise to such a degree that that resulting negative consequences eventually overwhelm the positive one. Thus the final sentence in the passage above.   
  
  
However, the climate projections that are incorporated in Tol’s economic model are likely wrong—they predict too much warming from future carbon dioxide emissions. When those climate model projections are brought more in line with the current best science, the positive economic benefits from Tol’s model likely extend far beyond the end of the 21st century.   
  
  
The bottom line is that people adapt to climate change and so long as it is relatively modest—and there is growing evidence that it will be—the human condition will almost certainly be no worse off and probably even better.   
  
  
Enough with the pessimistic outlook! It is high time to celebrate the progress we are making, in the face of, or even in part because of, the earth’s changing climate.

Many on the alarmist side of the climate debate seem to struggle to find rational arguments or evidence to support their cause so they usually resort to character assassination or defamation. A common attack on me is “Viv Forbes is just a coal industry stooge.”
This was put to the test recently at the year’s biggest Mining Industry function – the Queensland Resources Council Annual Forum and Lunch. The delegates on stage at the forum included very senior managers from BHP Billiton, Shell, Anglo-American, Peabody and Glencore. The audience was invited to ask questions.
I asked why people who employed many competent geologists, physicists and chemists never questioned the science behind the global warming scare.
NOT ONE INDUSTRY FIGURE ANSWERED, and the compère quickly moved on.
This is how the Courier Mail reported it:
“YOU might say mining industry figure Viv Forbes was the proverbial fly in the ointment at the Queensland Resources Council “state of the sector” forum in Brisbane on Wednesday.
The climate change denier got a cold response from a panel of industry high flyers when he asked why none of them questioned the science behind global warming “hysteria”.
Indeed, there was an awkward silence before the group, including top guns from Glencore and Shell, quickly moved on.
Forbes, who serves on the board of Brisbane-based Stanmore Coal, chairs a group known as the “Carbon Sense Coalition” and backs “Clexit,” an exit from climate treaties.xposed modules 2017
Just this week he reiterated his call “to defund all CSIRO global warming activities” and slammed “research puppets on the UN man-made global warming agenda”.”
Just for the record, I am no longer a director of Stanmore Coal, and receive zero income from the coal industry. I still hold shares in Stanmore coal, a coking coal producer and exporter.

"As it happens, Donald J. Trump is not the only person to announce plans to shut down a personal philanthropy, just the best known. This is the story of a man who made and kept that same promise. Nearly five years ago, Charles F. Feeney sat in a cushy armchair in an apartment on the east side of Manhattan, grandchildren’s artwork taped to the walls, and said that by the end of 2016, he was going to hand out the last of a great fortune that he had made. It was a race: Mr. Feeney was then 81, and Atlantic Philanthropies, a collection of private foundations he had started and funded, still had about $1. 5 billion left. Flinging money out the window or writing checks   was not Mr. Feeney’s way. Last month, Mr. Feeney and Atlantic completed the sprint and made a final grant, $7 million to Cornell University, to support students doing community service work. He had officially emptied his pockets, meeting his aspiration of “giving while living. ” Altogether, he had contributed $8 billion to his philanthropies, which have supported higher education, public health, human rights and scientific research. “You’re always nervous handling so much money, but we seem to have worked it pretty well,” Mr. Feeney, now 85, said last week in a phone interview. His remaining personal net worth is slightly more than $2 million. That’s not quite broke, by any standard, but it is a modest amount for a man who controlled thousands of times as much wealth. He and his wife, Helga, now live in a rented apartment in San Francisco. “You can only wear one pair of pants at a time,” Mr. Feeney has said. Until he was 75, he traveled only in coach, and carried reading materials in a plastic bag. For many years, when in New York, he had lunch not at the city’s luxury restaurants, but in the homey confines of Tommy Makem’s Irish Pavilion on East 57th Street, where he ate the burgers. None of the major American philanthropists have given away a greater proportion of their wealth, and starting in 1982, Mr. Feeney did most of this in complete secrecy, leading Forbes magazine to call him the “James Bond of philanthropy. ” His name does not appear in gilded letters, chiseled marble or other forms of writing anywhere on the 1, 000 buildings across five continents that $2. 7 billion of his money paid for. For years, Atlantic’s support came with a requirement that the beneficiaries not publicize its involvement. Beyond Mr. Feeney’s reticence about blowing his own horn, “it was also a way to leverage more donations  —   some other individual might contribute to get the naming rights,” said Christopher G. Oechsli, the president and chief executive officer of Atlantic. During the early 1990s, Mr. Feeney met secretly with paramilitary forces in Belfast, Northern Ireland, urging them to drop armed guerrilla conflict and promising financial support if they embraced electoral politics. Atlantic grants paid to create a public health system in Vietnam, and to provide access to antiretroviral treatment for AIDS in southern Africa. The last rounds of grants, about $600 million, included support for Atlantic Fellows, described as young emerging leaders working in their countries for healthier, more equitable societies. Raised in Elizabeth, N. J. Mr. Feeney served as a radio operator in the Air Force and attended Cornell University on the G. I. Bill. In 1960, he and a partner set up a company that sold items like brandy and cigars to travelers in   shops at airports. It became a booming success. Mr. Feeney has also been a shrewd investor in technology  . In 1984, he secretly transferred all of his assets, including his 38. 75 percent ownership of the   business, to Atlantic Philanthropies. He grew the Atlantic pot with early investments in companies like Facebook, Priceline,   Alibaba and Legent. A business dispute in 1997 forced disclosure of Mr. Feeney’s funding for Atlantic. As for Mr. Trump, if he really does shut down his foundation  —   stung by inquiries about the use of foundation money to pay Mr. Trump’s personal liabilities, or purchase football helmet memorabilia, or oil paintings of himself  —   he is not likely to follow the Feeney model. The two men are mirror images. For years, Mr. Trump lobbied hard to get onto lists of the wealthy, like the Forbes 400 Mr. Feeney has tried to stay off them. The Atlantic endowment came entirely from Mr. Feeney’s money much of the money that went into the Trump foundation in recent years was from others. One of Atlantic’s projects was to propose reforms to the American health care system, which helped lay groundwork for the Affordable Care Act another was advocacy for the end of the death penalty for juveniles. Mr. Trump has been on the other side of both of those issues, vowing to “dismantle Obamacare on Day 1,” and calling, in 1989, for the restoration of the death penalty after five teenagers were arrested in the rape of a jogger in Central Park. (They were convicted but later cleared of the charges.) Just as Mr. Trump was opening Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in the early 1980s, Mr. Feeney was a few blocks away in Makem’s pub, thinking about the first big checks he would write for charity, on the condition that his identity not be disclosed. “I don’t recall ever meeting Trump,” Mr. Feeney said last week. No wonder. The thought crossed my mind 20 years ago that Chuck Feeney is what Donald Trump would be, if he lived his entire existence backward."
"**Seven years ago, a group of Greek farmers stopped growing tobacco and switched to a trendy alternative to sugar - stevia.**
They made the change after being persuaded by a mechanical engineer called Christos Stamatis, who wanted to emulate the success of six California tobacco growers who had also started to cultivate the stevia plant.
An extract of the plant's leaves makes a natural, calorie-free sugar substitute. It has been around for centuries, but has only started to enter the mainstream in the past 10 years.
Mr Stamatis sought out farmers in his native region of Fthiotida - in their fields or during their breaks in the local cafÃ©s - to convince them to plant stevia instead of their less profitable tobacco crop.
His power of persuasion worked, as 150 farmers each contributed â¬500 ($557; Â£422) towards setting up the Stevia Hellas Co-operative.
""We discovered crowdsourcing long before it became mainstream in my village,"" Mr Stamatis says. ""People have power and we took advantage of it.""
It was the first business in Europe to produce stevia and it now employs around 300 people.
Created in 2012 and located a few hours' drive north of Athens, the co-operative broke even at the end of 2018 and is on track to make a profit this year. It sells liquid stevia extracts and stevia powders under its own brand name, La Mia Stevia, and also exports in bulk to western Europe, Canada, the US and the United Arab Emirates.
It is tapping into an industry that has enormous potential for growth. Global sales of stevia are forecast to almost double to $818m (Â£620m) by 2024, according to a study by the consultancy Research and Markets.
However, this still puts stevia's size well below that of artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, which are expected to be worth $2.7bn per year by then. And for context, the global sugar market is predicted to reach annual sales of $89bn over the same period - albeit growing at a slower pace.
Andrew Ohmes, president of trade body International Stevia Council, admits that stevia is still the ""new kid on the block"" but that consumption will increase as consumers limit the amount of sugar in their diets.
""Other sweeteners like aspartame or sucralose have been around far longer but stevia's consumption will be growing 19-21% over the next five to 10 years.""
At first glance stevia looks expensive. Stevia powder on the supermarket shelves costs around â¬120 per kilo compared with a kilo of sugar for â¬0.83 euros.
But Mr Stamatis says that stevia is actually more cost effective, because a little goes a long way - it is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
Stevia's proponents also say it is more ecologically friendly. It is said to have a water footprint that is 96% lower than cane sugar, and 92% lower than beet sugar. And it requires about 20% of the land to provide the same amount of sweetness.
More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:
Native to Paraguay and Brazil in South America, the full name of the stevia plant is stevia rebaudiana. Its properties have been known to indigenous groups for centuries. In the Guarani language it is known as ""kaa he-he"", which translates as ""sweet herb"".
It was the Japanese who first started producing stevia on a commercial scale, beginning in 1971. It was much slower to take off in the US and Europe, as regulators were unsure if it was safe. For example, in 1987 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the marketing of stevia.
Things changed in 2008 when the FDA gave its approval to purified stevia extract. In 2011, the EU, Australia and New Zealand followed suit.
Even so, there is a still a debate about its use. ""Stevia extract, unlike its chemical counterparts such as aspartame, does not form acid in the body,"" says certified nutritionist Kimberly Snyder. ""Nor does it promote heart disease and tooth decay, and it has no impact on blood sugar levels.""
""But the powder or liquid drops at grocery stores are processed with additives that may cause bloating, diarrhoea or headaches.""
Because it is sweeter than sugar, she adds, it ""might perpetuate your flavour preference toward sweet things, doing more harm than good if your sweet cravings are kicked into overdrive"".
Mr Ohmes says that using stevia instead of sugar ""allows for significant calorie reduction"".
However, registered dietician Rachel Fine encourages her clients to stick to simple cane sugar, and use less of it overall, with the exception of those struggling with diabetes, who may find stevia as a viable alternative without the impact on blood sugar.
Back in Greece, the Stevia Hellas Cooperative is now aiming for further growth. ""Our next plan is to form a stevia supply chain with Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain, France or Portugal,"" Mr Stamatis says.
The stevia plants the co-operative grows are currently sent to France for processing, and a second processing plant is to be opened in the Balkans in the next two years.
""We have a unique climate for cultivating stevia,"" Mr Stamatis adds,
Other countries may also develop a suitable climate for growing stevia as they become more ""tropical"", says Michael Budziszek, an expert on global warming and associate professor at the Johnson and Wales University College of Arts and Sciences.
But securing the industry's growth will not be straightforward. Coca-Cola introduced a version of its signature drink to the UK market in 2014 that had been partially made with stevia. But after weak sales, the product - Coca-Cola Life - was discontinued three years later."
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.   Read his recent publication: “Transition to Reality: The Propsects for Rapid Global Decarbonization.”A group of economists known as the Ecofiscal Commission has recently published a report that claims to debunk 10 myths about carbon pricing in Canada.  Robert Lyman reviews their claims in this post, stating their ‘myths’ first, then his rebuttal.Myth #1: Carbon Pricing is a new, untested idea.Fact:Carbon pricing is another version of an old, frequently-failed idea. Economists have been advocating the use of market-based mechanisms as theoretically more efficient ways to achieve public policy objectives since the early part of the twentieth century. The basic idea is that governments should attempt to calculate the difference between the social and private costs of people’s buying decisions, and impose a “social premium” in the form of an extra cost, on consumers not otherwise reflected in competitive market prices. The idea has rarely been successful in practice because of difficulties in calculating accurately the value of the “social premium”, and because the public has long been deeply skeptical that governments were not going to use the taxes as a way to scoop funds for other political purposes. Carbon taxes were analyzed and rejected by Natural Resources Canada in the early 1990’s. Actual experience in jurisdictions around the world with the use of revenues raised by carbon taxes justifies the public’s skepticism. Myth #2: Only very high carbon taxes are effectiveFACT:The effectiveness of any tax used as a price premium depends on the price elasticity of demand for the product being taxed. In the case of carbon taxes, the primary targets are oil products, natural gas and coal. Oil products used in transportation are notoriously inelastic (i.e. unresponsive to price increases) and coal used for electricity generation is essentially insulated from market pressures by the system of electricity regulation in Canada. This, however, misses the real point. The announced goal of Canadian climate policy is to reduce national emissions by 30% from 2010 levels by 2030 and then to go on reducing them to perhaps 50% from 2010 levels by 2050. That would mean a massive and costly transformation of the Canadian economy, the sharp reduction in transportation use and in resource industry activity, with devastating consequences for consumers and for provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador. Emissions reductions of that magnitude will not be achieved at low or moderate carbon tax levels. The taxes would need to be high enough to shut down entire industries. Myth #3: Carbon pricing will cost Canadian familiesFACT:It will cost families, so a carbon rebate or ‘dividend’ is offered to ease the financial pain. This is a case of bait and switch. By including a consumer rebate to a carbon tax measure, the government is trying to argue that it is achieving a social justice objective. If this were such a great idea, why has it not used the same approach with sales taxes or corporate income taxes i.e. raises the tax and then rebate the money to consumers, or better yet, just lower everyone’s income taxes? Anyone who thinks that this approach will catch on had better not hold their breath waiting for it. The provinces are taking different approaches to how they will tax and how they will rebate, if at all, which makes this subject very complicated. In some cases, only 70% or less of the emission sources will be taxed. In others, special exemptions, often politically motivated, will be given. There will be plenty of room for game playing as to who qualifies for a rebate and by how much. Finally, governments can be sure to keep ever high percentages of the revenues as the carbon tax rates go into the stratosphere. What cannot be denied is that the target groups – oil, natural gas, and coal producers and consumers – will be worse off by far; that is the whole point of the tax. Myth #4: Carbon Pricing Hurts JobsFACT:It does. All taxes impose what economists call a “deadweight loss” on the economy, as they take revenues from those that would have received them under free market conditions and reallocate them elsewhere. In the case of carbon taxes, they will disproportionately affect all fossil-fuel intensive parts of the Canadian economy  (like petroleum and mining, petrochemicals, metals fabrication, cement, aluminum and steel production) and transportation costs in the economy, which of course are incurred by all. These are costs that will not be incurred by firms in competing jurisdictions and especially in the United States. Given the high degree of economic integration between Canada and the United States, it is abundantly clear that the competitiveness of Canadian firms, and their ability to attract investment in future, will suffer. Some international context would be useful here. The rates used in carbon tax regimes vary widely from a low equivalent to US $1 per ton in Mexico and Poland to a high of US $139 per ton in Sweden. Within western Europe, the rates range widely as well, with one group using rates of US $9 per ton or less, and most others with rates in the range of US $16 to $29 per ton. In Canada, there is a combination of emissions trading and carbon dioxide taxes within a federal government policy framework that requires prices to be at least Cdn $20 (US $15) per ton in 2019 rising to Cdn $50 (US $38) per ton by 2022. In China, the average rate is about US $2 per ton. Imagine Canadian firms, with a carbon tax on their backs, trying to compete with Chinese firms. Myth #5: Big polluters are getting a breakFACT: Many do get breaks. This is the rhetorical equivalent of “sucking and blowing at the same time”. The Ecofiscal Commission claims that large emitters will pay dearly, but then says they will be subsidized to reduce emissions. Does this mean that punishing large emitters with high taxes is not enough or that these companies are not smart enough to figure out how to make efficiency improvements without applying to a government program for subsidies so that they choose the right one? Again, the magnitude of the emissions reductions sought by 2030 and beyond are much, much higher than can be accomplished by efficiency improvements. The effect will be to shut down whole segments of the economy, especially in resource-intensive regions. Myth #6: Carbon Pricing is a Cash GrabFACT: It is. The experience of British Columbia has already borne this out, as have studies of carbon pricing regimes around the world. In other jurisdictions, initial statements of intention to fully or partially recycle such revenues often have not borne out in practice. The Institute of Climate Economics (14CE) is a think tank based in Paris, France funded by the French Development Agency and Morocco’s Caisse de Depot et Gestion. In October, 2017, it published the results of a study of the use of carbon dioxide pricing in the 40 countries in the world in which they then existed. The Institute found that, on a global scale, only 29% of the revenues raised were recycled into the economy in the form of tax exemptions. Thirty-four per cent were used to subsidize programs that would reduce GHG emissions. The largest share, 37%, were allocated to the general budget. In other words, of course it’s a cash grab. The only question is how high a percentage of the revenues raised will be used to serve a wide range of politicians’ favourite projects. Myth #7: People cannot change their behaviours in response to carbon pricingFACT: If hundreds of similar measures aren’t working yet, why will this one work? The real issue is why, if carbon taxes are such a great idea and so effective in reducing emissions, federal and provincial governments are continuing to use every other program, subsidy, and regulation in the book and a dozen more every year in addition to carbon taxes. In Canada’s most recent reports to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, Environment and Climate Change Canada listed over 300 existing federal programs and other measures designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Natural Resources Canada’s website recently listed an addition 280 more programs and measures implemented by provincial and territorial governments. No one is keeping track of all the programs and measures being taken by municipal governments anxious to get into the game. Myth #8: There is no point to carbon pricing if governments rebate the revenues.FACT: Rebates are a distraction intended to fool Canadians by putting back into their left pocket a portion of the money removed from the right pocket and surreptitiously harming Canadian businesses in order to appear generous to the “middle class”. The statement would have been accurate if it had ended after the word “pricing”. Myth #9: We can use other, better policies to reduce our emissions.FACT: Governments are already throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this issue. The record of government action to date speaks for itself. Since 1992, when Canadian governments first began setting emission reduction targets, not one has been met. We are clearly on track to miss the 2020 target as well. It would take a miracle, or the worst recessions since the Great Depression, for Canada to make the 2030 target, and it gets worse after that. It is long past time to recast our objectives. Myth #10: There is no need to reduce Canada’s emissionsFACT: Canada is not the problem. The ‘myth’ statement is premised on the view that what Canada does or does not do to reduce emissions will affect global emissions trends. There is not one shred of evidence to support this contention. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2018, global GHG emissions from fuel combustion in 2017 totaled 33.4 billion tons. Canada accounted for 1.6% of this total. The IPCC has developed a mathematical model with which it attempts to measure the impact on average global temperatures by 2100 of emissions reductions made before that time. If one accepts the premises and methodology that underlies this model, the full implementation of commitments made prior to the Paris Agreement, including the sustained implementation of those commitments to 2100, would reduce average global temperatures by about 0.017 degrees from their present path, according to analysis done by Bjorn Lomborg.[1] The IPCC has estimated, however, that avoiding the 1.5 degree increase in temperatures would require that global emissions decline by at least 40 to 50% by 2030 and reach “net zero” by 2050. The actual emissions trends currently are dominated by the continued growth in emissions from developing (non-OECD) countries that now represent 63% of global emissions. In practical terms, there is a near zero likelihood that the goals suggested by the IPCC will be met. Any action taken by Canada to reduce emissions will thus have either a negligible or nil effect on average global temperatures. The “bottom line” is that there is no need for Canada to reduce its emissions to the point at which it severely harms Canadians’ economy and standard of living. Indeed, present climate policies, with their dire implications for western Canada, pose a threat to national unity far more serious than anything that has occurred since the debates over Quebec secession in the 1980’s and 1990’s. Those considerations surely outweigh the benefits of making symbolic gestures that will have no real effect on global emissions or climate trends. READ: The Alarming Scope of Future Carbon Taxes in Canada~~~~Related:Our rebuttal to Ecofiscal’s previous work “Let Them Eat Carbon” Video: READ:85 peer-reviewed papers show that carbon dioxide has little to nominal effect on climate change.[1] Lomborg, Bjorn.

" Copyright © 2019The David Suzuki Foundation’s report “Zeroing in on Emissions: Canada’s clean power pathways – A Review” presents a review of a set of theoretical possibilities for reducing emissions from fossil fuels based primarily on the notion that everything powered by fossil fuels today can be electrified using a connected power grid of hydro, wind, solar, tidal, batteries, and geothermal. It is concerning that much of the content of Canada’s Expert Panel on Sustainable Finance echoes many of the unrealistic proposals of the Suzuki report.  There is a deeply concerning disconnect between concept, cost-benefit analysis and implementation of proposed technologies. Practically speaking, the world runs on oil, natural gas and coal – all ‘renewable’ forms of energy require these to exist and to function on the power grid. There is no magic replacement.LINK TO FULL REPORT  ‘SHOCKING REALITY: ELECTRIFICATION AND DECARBONIZATION’ Shocking Reality FINALThe scenarios set out in the Suzuki paper are just that – imagined possibilities crafted by people who would like to see technological and economic developments that have not happened to date. The report offers a list of ten simple slogans of three to five words, wrapping up with ‘bring everyone along’ – claiming “Together, these strategies are a litmus test for a credible climate plan.”  The technologies promoted like wind and solar can complement a conventional power grid, but not replace it.  They have long been dismissed as unable to address climate change, and in terms of energy return on energy invested, wind and solar are unable to support basic society. Due to their weather-dependent nature, wind and solar are especially unsuited to a cold, vast, snowy, often overcast country like Canada. Furthermore, the energy generation options that do show promise, such as Small Modular Reactors, are not yet market ready. Based on historical trends in energy transition, their introduction will take decades. Innovation is certainly worth pursuing, but that is not a sound basis for public policy or a major shift in investment. What is problematic is that all of the changes in Canada’s energy supply and demand system that the Suzuki report envisages and advocates for depend not upon the free choices of producers and consumers but upon massive intervention, subsidization and regulation by governments. Government central planning never has worked as well as free, competitive markets, and there is no reason to believe that will happen soon. Making dramatic changes to the electrical grid often has extremely dire, unexpected consequences.  Germany and the UK have experienced a huge rise in heat-or-eat poverty and premature deaths due to the introduction of expensive wind and solar and related transmission line/natural gas back-up costs. The Suzuki “Zeroing…” report excludes mention of the additional physical infrastructure costs and socio-economic implications.  Poverty is not a way to ‘bring everyone along.’ This report, “Shocking Reality: Electrification and Decarbonization” shows that “Net Zero” is a pathway to economic and energy catastrophe.  We provide some cautionary real-world examples to inform the public and policymakers.  The greatest risk is that, based on an incomplete assessment, certain parties may begin some of these major transitions, only to then find ourselves ‘stuck’ as the costs of additional, unaccounted for infrastructure bloom while the economy staggers under the burden; that grid reliability may be put at risk – or that industry, faced by rising costs and regulation, may abandon Canada for greener, free market pastures. “Do you guys on Wall Street have something in your desks that makes steel? Where is fertilizer, cement, plastic going to come from? Do planes fly through the sky because of some number you put in a spreadsheet?… The idea that we have the current tools and it’s just because these utility people are evil people and if we could just beat on them and put (solar panels) on our rooftop—that is more of a block than climate denial,” Gates said. “The ‘climate is easy to solve’ group is our biggest problem.” – Bill Gates https://youtu.be/d1EB1zsxW0k (11:42) Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"A Diesel in the Shed.
You can have your solar panels
and your turbines on the hills;
You can use the warmth of sunshine
to reduce your heating bills.
You can dream you’re self-sufficient
as you weed your vegie bed;
As long as you make sure to keep
A diesel in the shed.
When I was a kid on a dairy farm in Queensland, we relied on green energy – horses and human muscles provided motive power; fire-wood and beeswax candles supplied heat and light; windmills pumped water and the sun provided solar energy for growing crops, vegies and pastures.Railway Jobs 2017 There were no refrigerators – things were kept cool by evaporation of water in a Coolgardi safe. Cold water for drinks came from a water bag hanging in the shade near the back steps. We had no hot water systems – we bathed one after another in warm water heated in a kettle on the wood stove. The only “non-green” energy used was a bit of kerosene for the kitchen lamp, and petrol for a small Ford utility. We were almost “sustainable” but there was little surplus for others. Labour was cheap and food was expensive.bluestacks for windows 10
Our life changed dramatically when we put a thumping diesel in the dairy shed. This single-cylinder engine drove the milking machines and an electricity generator which charged 16 lead-acid 2 volt batteries sitting on the veranda. This 32 volt DC system powered a modern marvel – bright light, at any time, in every room, at the touch of a switch. This system could also power Mum’s new electric clothes iron as long as someone started the engine for a bit more power.
There were no electric self-starters for diesels in those days – just a heavy crank handle. Here is the exact model which saved us from a life of dairy drudgery, kerosene lights and Mother Potts irons:
See and listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itxY98A8wHQ
But all that effort, noise and fumes were superseded when every house and dairy got connected to clean silent “coal power by wire”, and coal was used to produce coke for the new slow-combustion stoves. Suddenly the trusty “Southern Cross” diesel engines disappeared from Australian sheds and dairies, AGA coke-burning cookers displaced the old smoky wood-burning stoves in the kitchen, and clean-burning coal gas replaced wood stoves and dirty open fires in the cities.

In just one life-time, human muscles, draft horses, wood, candles and kerosene were replaced by diesel, which was then replaced by coal via coal-gas, coke, and clean silent ever-ready electricity.
Today, after Aussies have enjoyed decades of abundant reliable cheap electricity from black coal, brown coal and hydro, green energy gambling has taken Australia back to the era which had to keep a diesel in the shed.
Tasmania is the greenest state in Australia. It once had a vibrant economy that created mines, saw-mills, farms, orchards, oil and metal refineries, dams, hydro-power and railways. It is now a green no-go land. Greens have stopped new hydro developments, opposed mining, crippled the timber industry, prevented new wood-chip developments and will probably celebrate when their last refinery closes.
Tasmanians get their electricity mainly from hydro assets created long ago by their more productive ancestors. But recently, a long drought caused a shortage of Tasmanian hydro-energy – they became reliant for up to 40% of their electricity needs on the Bass-Link undersea cable bringing electricity from reliable coal-fired stations in Victoria and NSW. However the overloaded Bass-Link cable failed, and an old gas-powered station was brought back into service (importing gas from Victoria) to keep the lights on. Subsequently their politicians hurriedly put 150 diesel generators in their shed (costing A$11 million per month).
See: Tasmania’s Bass Link cable fails. Gas imports boom:

South Australia is the next greenest state in Australia, hosting about 35% of Australia’s wind turbines. These were force-fed into existence by mandatory green energy targets and tax benefits. In a burst of green destruction they also closed their gas-fired power stations and demolished their coal-fired station. However wind power failed recently and a storm tore down their life-line bringing reliable coal power from Victoria. Now Premier Weatherill is planning to install up to 200 megawatts of diesel generators in his shed. Many residents are following his lead.
As some wag said:
Question: “What did South Australians have before candles?”
Answer: “Electricity”.

The UK has been badly infected by the green energy virus. Engineers warned that this intermittent and unpredictable supply had increased the risk of blackouts, so the UK government offered subsidies for emergency backup power. This subsidy, plus consumer concerns, put so many diesels in British sheds that they now provide a major backup capacity for UK electricity.
See: UK offers subsidies to put some diesels in the shed:

Many Spaniards found a diesel in the shed was very profitable. Their government had been drinking green-ale and offered attractive subsidies for solar power produced.
The subsidy was very successful – so successful that someone eventually noticed that some suppliers were even producing “solar” power at night. It was coming from diesels in their sheds.

Finally, our green media likes to feature some green energy enthusiast who is “off the grid”. But it usually emerges later in the show that there is a diesel in their shed too.
Those who remember the days of relying on a noisy smelly diesel in the shed and a smoky wood stove in the kitchen have no wish to be dragged back there by green zealots.

Yesterday, leftwing protestors promised to “disrupt the entire Melbourne CBD” in a protest against climate change. But it was a major flop.  
Football-goers attending a big game at the MCG were being warned of mass delays due to the climate activist group, Extinction Rebellion, taking over the city.  
It turned out to be less than 100 people in a mall, shouting things no one cared about.

"Malcolm Turnbull signed Australia onto the Paris Climate Agreement. This appalling document should be forever draped around his neck like a dead albatross.

Now we learn he has engineered an Emissions Trading Scheme as part of our green tributes to Paris.
The ALP and the Greens would have gone even further than Turnbull into the European climate swamp. They should also be awarded the ODA – the Order of the Dead Albatross.
Australia must withdraw from the dreadful Paris agreement before it can be ratified.
We need our own CLEXIT – climate exit from the energy vandals of Europe.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Although global warming might have been implicated in harsh weather in the Rockies, Forbes author Dr. Marshall Shepard definitely wants to make it very clear he is not trying to link this snow event to climate change, even though there is a growing body of evidence that global warming will make extreme cold and snow more likely.
The Blizzard In The Rockies Doesn’t Disprove Climate Change But People Will Say It AnyhowMarshall Shepherd Senior Contributor Sep 29, 2019, 04:52pmI predicted several days ago that some people would be tweeting that this early season snowstorm in parts of the Rocky Mountain region somehow refutes anthropogenic climate change. Rob Bailey, a computer engineer in Ohio, brought the Tweet at this link to my attention. I am sure there are many more just like it.…So why is the region experiencing such record cold and snow conditions in terms of magnitude of the event? To answer this question, we have to look to the jet stream. According to the NWS Glossary, the jet stream is a region of “relatively strong winds concentrated in a narrow stream in the atmosphere, normally referring to horizontal, high-altitude winds….The position and orientation of jet streams vary from day to day.” The wavy pattern of the jet stream is a very strong determinant of general weather patterns, particularly in terms of temperature and wetness. With this storm, the jet stream plunged southward bringing extremely cold air into the region. An upper-level low approaching from the Pacific region supplied the moisture.To be clear, this is a weather event. I am not attributing it to climate change at all. However, I do want to conclude with something that is very counterintuitive to many people. There is a growing body of evidence (and a few counter-narratives) in the peer review literature that suggests that because the Arctic region is warming, there is less of a difference in temperature between the polar and tropic regions. That difference, called a gradient, is what determines the strength of the jet stream. If the difference is smaller due to so-called Arctic Amplification (warming in the Arctic), the jet stream would be wavier. The “so what” is that a jet stream with greater wave amplitude means more extreme troughs or “dips” with cold air and more extreme ridges or “humps” with warm air. In other words, the extremes on both sides of the temperature range are amplified.…Read more: https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/09/29/the-blizzard-in-the-rockies-doesnt-disprove-climate-change-but-people-will-say-it-anyhow/
The following image seems to have upset Dr. Shepherd, because some cruel contrarians are using this image to mock the urgency of our global warming emergency.



Now don’t any of you go upsetting Dr. Shepherd even further by suggesting what he wrote doesn’t make sense.
Update (EW): h/t Right-Handed Shark points out Dr. Shepherd was not nearly so coy a few months ago when he linked the record heatwave in Europe to global warming.

"Family members say that Esteban Santiago, the suspect in the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting in which five people were killed, seemed troubled when he came back from military service in Iraq. His brother described him as “more furious” after his deployment in 2010 with a Puerto Rico National Guard unit. His aunt said that after coming home, Mr. Santiago “lost his mind. ” After Mr. Santiago’s arrest in the shooting, emerging details of his military service led some to blame the rampage on the   mind of a veteran haunted by   stress disorder, a common pattern when veterans are arrested in violent crimes. But experts not connected to Mr. Santiago’s mental health treatment say it may be a mistake to blame PTSD. Mr. Santiago, who served for eight years in the National Guard and Army Reserve and saw combat in Iraq in 2010, exhibited symptoms that do not appear to fit the disorder, they say, and more closely resemble schizophrenia, a condition unrelated to military service. Mr. Santiago’s family said he reported hearing voices and had other hallucinations, but said he was never given a diagnosis of PTSD. In November, he walked into an F. B. I. office in Alaska and told agents that his mind was being controlled by a United States intelligence agency. “The delusions, the hallucinations are far more consistent with psychosis than PTSD,” said Dr. Donald C. Goff, a psychiatrist at New York University and a leading expert on schizophrenia. “So is the timing of the onset. ” Mr. Santiago deployed to Iraq when he was 20 years old, which is the age when many males with schizophrenia begin to exhibit symptoms, Dr. Goff said, cautioning that he could not comment on Mr. Santiago specifically without reviewing his medical records. “Generally, it’s in the first year of college or military service, or some other stressful event, that we see schizophrenia,” he said. “It’s not that deployment is the cause of the psychosis, but the stress may contribute to the symptoms coming out. ” The level of stress Mr. Santiago experienced on deployment is unclear. He went to Iraq with the Puerto Rico National Guard’s 1013th Engineering Company, and was charged with keeping highways clear of roadside bombs. Violence had dropped drastically in the country by 2010 nonetheless, two soldiers in his company were killed by a roadside bomb. After his tour, Mr. Santiago was awarded the Combat Action Badge, which is given only to service members who are actively engaged with the enemy. “There is nothing to say that a person can’t have psychosis and PTSD,” said Claude M. Chemtob, a professor of psychology at New York University who has studied the link between PTSD and aggression. But, he said, the two disorders are characterized by different symptoms. PTSD sufferers can struggle with anxiety, sleeplessness, flashbacks and anger. In rare cases, the disorder results in increased violence and aggressiveness. But paranoid delusions are not typical. “That is a cardinal symptom of psychosis,” Dr. Chemtob said. “But inevitably people’s prejudice toward veterans is going to lead them to emphasize PTSD. ” Veterans have complained that too often they are labeled with the disorder, and that ascribing all violent acts among veterans to the psychological scars of war perpetuates damaging stereotypes. Many have argued that is what happened with Eddie Ray Routh, the    former Marine corporal who killed Chris Kyle, a member of the Navy SEALs and the author of “American Sniper,” in 2013. Mr. Routh’s medical records revealed he had persistent delusions that he was being devoured from the inside by parasites, and that his   were pig people who wanted to eat him, but a doctor at a veterans hospital gave him a diagnosis of PTSD. Veterans have struggled with the reputation for being dangerously unstable since at least the Vietnam War. The stigma was stoked in part by Hollywood narratives like “Rambo,” and is still pervasive today, said Bill Rausch, the executive director of Got Your 6, a nonprofit group that tracks the public image of veterans. According to a survey by the group in 2016, 83 percent of respondents said they believed veterans were more likely to have mental health problems. Respondents also said they thought veterans were more likely to be unemployed and abuse drugs. In fact, in terms of employment and drug use, the opposite is true. “The public sees veterans as broken, and they often shape the narrative to fit their perceptions,” Mr. Rausch said. When the news of the Fort Lauderdale shooting broke, he said: “My first thought was that I hoped no one was hurt. My second was that I hoped it wasn’t a veteran because I knew if they were, it would spark a simplified explanation that would never happen with a civilian, tying everything back to war. ” After telling the F. B. I. in November that his mind was being controlled, Mr. Santiago was taken to a civilian psychiatric hospital. The law prevents patients from being held involuntarily if they are not an imminent threat to themselves or others. Mr. Santiago was released after four days. “Anyone who has ever known someone with mental illness knows it’s extremely complicated and hard to deal with,” Mr. Rausch said. “Blaming on military experience keeps us from having a real conversation about how to fix things. This isn’t a veteran problem, it’s an American problem. ”"

" New Rebuttal Report – Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science(Calgary) “Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” is a new report by Friends of Science Society rebutting the Sept. 24, 2019, public statement by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) entitled “Time to Act: Facing the Risks of a Changing Climate“. The institute portrays actuaries as “…risk management experts who use data modelling and statistical methods to measure and manage the financial impacts of uncertain events and scenarios”. However, their climate change statement is studded with assumptions that rely on mathematical climate models that are known to forecast temperature increases in the atmosphere at three to six times the observed rates. Actuaries have a special responsibility in society, according to their professional code of conduct: “It is the professional responsibility of the member not to be associated with anything which the member knows or should know is false or misleading” and that actuaries shall hold “the duty of the profession to the public above the needs of the profession and its members“.The CIA statement claims that global warming is linked to human industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and proposes more data collection, more data collection on extreme weather events, and corporate carbon footprint reporting as a means of reaching Paris Targets. “Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” demonstrates that Paris greenhouse gas reduction targets are arbitrary and fraught with conflicts of interest. The report also shows that even if all signatory countries met the non-legally binding Paris targets, it would not make any difference to global warming.  In addition, an attempt by Canada meet the Paris targets would result in economic catastrophe.In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that despite a significant rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, there had been no statistically significant warming for some 15 years, since before the Kyoto Accord was ratified. The lack of warming over more than 15 years was not predicted by any climate model.Dr. Judith Curry testified to the US Senate on January 16, 2014, that “carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can fine tune climate“.  Since that time, dozens of peer-reviewed papers show that carbon dioxide (CO2) has a nominal effect on warming; hundreds of research papers indicate that human impacts on climate are small. [1] [2] The CIA statement “Time to Act…” conflates short-term, unique extreme weather events and related financial losses with climate change and warming. The IPCC’s Special Report on Extreme Weather specifically states there is little evidence that human effects on climate or greenhouse gas increases have any impact on extreme weather. [3] Extreme weather events are integral to climate. Furthermore, Roger Pielke, Jr., author of “The Rightful Place of Science: Disasters and Climate Change” has extensively assessed the impacts of disasters and climate change and has “found convincing evidence that climate change was not leading to higher rates of weather-related damages worldwide, once you correct for increasing population and wealth“. [4]“Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” details the inaccuracies of climate models, upon which public policy is based, and discusses flagrant conflicts of interest within the climate science and related investment communities.“Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” suggests carbon dioxide from human industrial emissions is not significantly driving climate change, so the three measures advocated by the CIA are unnecessary, null and void.  There should be no risk of stranded fossil fuel assets, no need to collect data on extreme weather events, and no necessity for corporations to account for climate related factors in investment decisions and corporate risk planning. Friends of Science Society says the greatest risk to the Canadian economy is making climate policy decisions based on misguided math and misinterpreted science by people who are not aware of the complexities of climate science nor the vast uncertainties and failings of climate models.

"**""This is not a good way to travel here, for my brother or for anyone,"" complains Mohamed Zitouni, a Moroccan man who has lived in Spain for 20 years.**
He was looking for his younger brother Rahali - who is one of more than 19,000 migrants who have made the perilous journey across the Atlantic to the Canary Islands in boats from North and West Africa so far this year. From Morocco, the journey takes five days, but from countries further down the coastline it can take twice as long.
The number of arrivals in 2020 is more than 10 times the total number for 2019. ""I wouldn't want this for anyone because it's not good, but if it's the only way to make a proper living, what can we do?""
Mohamed Zitouni had gone to find his brother at a wharf on the southern tip of the island of Gran Canaria where at one point some 2,600 migrants had been staying in tents or sleeping rough.
ArguineguÃ­n wharf had been used as a makeshift migrant camp ever since the surge in numbers of people arriving or being picked up at sea by rescue services.
They had spoken by phone the previous day, before Rahali's battery ran out. Days after they were reunited, the camp was dismantled.
The emergency caused by undocumented arrivals to the archipelago shows little sign of easing.
In November alone, about 7,000 migrants reached the archipelago, which has seen the highest number of migrant arrivals since 2006.
Conditions on the quayside were cramped and lacked many basic services. In theory, the authorities are allowed to keep them there for 72 hours in order to carry out coronavirus PCR tests and legal procedures, although many migrants reportedly stayed much longer.
An increase in controls on other routes from Africa to Europe - across the Mediterranean to Greece, Italy and mainland Spain - has helped make this more perilous journey across the Atlantic more popular.
Relatively good weather conditions have also been a factor.
However, more than 600 migrants have drowned making the crossing this year, according to UN figures.
SahÃ© Sephore was 13 months old when she and her mother fell in the water as the boat carrying them and some 30 other people hit rocks near the coast of Gran Canaria in May 2019.
She was the first undocumented migrant to be buried formally with their name and surname on a tombstone in the Canaries, reports say.
Sea arrivals in Spain in 2020: **35,862**
Arrivals in Canary Islands: **19,493**
Deaths on Canary Islands route: **650**
_Source: UNHCR_
The Spanish government has been paying for around 6,000 migrants to stay in 17 hotels which had been empty or closed because of the impact of Covid-19 on the local tourism industry. Others are staying in makeshift camps.
A Senegalese man, also called Mohamed, is staying in the Vista Oasis hotel. He made the crossing in September but says he found out that his two younger brothers both drowned while making the same journey since then.
""We have sacrificed a lot to come here, to work, to get a better life,"" Mohamed told the BBC. ""Because in Africa, if you're not from a family linked to the state, or from a rich family, you're not going to live well. That's what Africa is like.""
Having arrived on the islands, Mohamed is now confused about his legal status and whether he will be able to travel on to mainland Spain or another European country, as he would like.
""We've already heard certain rumours, that the Senegalese will have to return home but I don't know if it's true or false,"" he said. ""Right now, many Senegalese are very frightened, because if we return to Senegal, we don't get anything, no work or anything.""
Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has said that the Socialist-led Spanish government prefers not to transfer migrants to the mainland, in order to ""prevent irregular entry routes into Europe"".
The administration has started engaging with some African countries, including Senegal, in order to ease the repatriation of migrants, a process that can be legally complex.
Critics have accused the Spanish government of failing to prepare for this crisis, which they say led to chaos on ArguineguÃ­n wharf and has put local services under pressure. Ana Oramas, a congresswoman from the Canary Coalition (CC) party, described the situation on the archipelago as ""a powder keg"".
In recent weeks there have been demonstrations both in favour of and against the immigrants, reflecting the varying reactions of locals to their arrival.
""This is an invasion,"" said Antonio Santana Hidalgo, who works in the tourism industry. ""I respect that everyone has to make a living and survive, but they have to understand you can't just put them up in a hotel with everything included and have them lazing about.""
Ailedis UnsuÃ©, who works in a bar, has a different perspective.
Hairdresser JosÃ© MarÃ­a RodrÃ­guez pointed out that Spaniards also had a history of emigration. ""People from the Canaries, Galicians and Basques, we all emigrated,"" he said. ""The difference with this type of migration is that they are coming from countries that are at war, where there's no work and things are really bad.""
The Spanish government says new facilities currently being prepared will house 7,000 migrants, meaning the hotels will be able to be evacuated.
""I think that, despite the difficulties, we have handled this in an agile way,"" said Hana Jalloul, Spain's secretary of state for migration.
""We're not going to make a Moria out of the Canaries,"" she added, referring to the Greek island of Lesbos where fires destroyed an overcrowded migrant camp in September.
""It's not our style of migration policy."""
"**The UK is facing a shortage of fruit and vegetable pickers this year.**
By the end of April, 29,000 will be needed and one farmer, Mark Bowyer, told Farming Today he had only managed to get 13 of his regular staff so far.
""We've had inquiries from about 80 people including the local circus, who have been parked up with nothing else to do and want to have a go,"" he said.
""I don't know if it's the jugglers and the clowns, but they've said they have got staff who can help us.""
Mr Bowyer said his farm normally directly recruits between 70 and 100 staff all from Eastern Europe, who work for 10 weeks harvesting asparagus.
One reason overseas workers are recruited for these picking roles is that farmers require temporary, flexible workers who will move around the country following the crops.
It is often difficult for local people to fill these roles as they are extremely busy for a short space of time - for example, two months to pick apples - with no work for the rest of the year.
However, the closing of borders and grounding of aeroplanes because of the coronavirus outbreak has made it hard for overseas workers to reach the UK.
Mr Bowyer added: ""We've had a lot of local inquiries and a lot of national inquiries from people who are prepared to travel for work.""
""Of those, I would think 70% is parents offering their sons and daughters who are home from college and university to come and work.""
Travel problems are not only affecting overseas workers - there are also issues in getting hold of imported fruit and vegetables.
""We grow across the world,"" Mr Bowyer said. ""We have quite a lot of vegetable crop in The Gambia. Traditionally everything that needs to come here on air freight would sit at the bottom of a passenger aeroplane.
""But with no passenger flights we're having to resort to ships, which are too slow, or chartered aircraft and chartered freighters to go and collect this product, which is a dramatic increase in the normal cost of operation.""
He added that imports from Spain were taking twice as long to transport because restrictions meant trucks can only have one driver instead of the usual two.
Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it was vital that the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) got behind a UK recruitment campaign.
""We have to make sure we recruit these absolutely critical workers to enable us to put this fresh fruit and vegetables on the plate,"" he said.
""We've seen them back other campaigns for other vital sectors and [Environment Secretary] George Eustice has said a lot how valued the food supply chain is at the moment.
""We've got to make sure those words really turn into action and we have this joint campaign where we try and recruit from the UK workforce.
""Many of them are unemployed. There are a lot of students who are not able to be at university any more and we really need these people to step up and pick for Britain.""
The charity Concordia, which usually helps young people gain experiences abroad, has already signed up 14,000 people to its Feed the Nation scheme to help with picking. About 70% of them have never worked on a farm before.
They are mainly students but also carpenters, chefs and former service personnel. As new people arrive, they will have to go into self-isolation for seven days before they are allowed to start work.
A scheme is also being put together with industry bodies British Summer Fruit and British Apples and Pears for fruit pickers.
Between 5,000 and 6,000 people are needed from mid-April to pick asparagus and 6-7,000 to pick lettuce. From the end of April that number rises to 29,000 to pick strawberries and later in the year, tens of thousands are needed to harvest apples, pears, cauliflowers and cucumbers."

With Britain getting set to leave the climate-hysterical European Union, it probably may not have to participate in the nutty EU idea to go carbon free by 2050.
Not only would going carbon-free threaten the economy and security in a profound way, but CO2 just doesn’t seem to be having the impact on Britain’s climate that the alarmists say it is.
Looking at the November data available for close to 20 stations across the UK (except for Ireland), many stations show a cooling trend.


Data source: JMA
All the plots were made using data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Overall 12 of the 20 stations plotted show a cooling trend. Taken as a whole, the UK shows no statistically significant warming since 1998 in November, meaning winters aren’t getting shorter and not much is happening climate-wise in November.
Following Europe on climate policy would bring no result and end up costing a fortune.
No Christmas Day warming trend in US
On another note, the US East coast is set to warm up just in time for the Christmas holidays this year. And already the media are getting set scream bloody climate murder.

It’s “inevitable” that China’s electric cars have little resale value and some are inherently worth little, according to one of China’s top auto industry bodies.
In its latest weekly update on China’s ailing auto market, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) listed several reasons why value retention is “too low” for new-energy vehicles (NEVs), including fully electric, fuel-cell and hybrid cars.
The list includes a shortage of purchase statistics that could be analyzed to help manage risks. The discrepancy of technologies used in Chinese electric cars is also large, meaning certain models are not reliable and are “simply worthless,” the association said.
“As startups release more products, standards will rise incrementally,” the association said, adding the lifespan of electric car components and batteries are still inferior to that of similar components for traditional vehicles. “It’s not very feasible to simply wait for electric vehicles to raise their value retention,” it said.
CPCA’s remarks come as Chinese electric vehicle sales start to contract alongside traditional vehicle sales that have been falling for more than a year. The nation is the world’s largest NEV market, after building up huge capacity on the back of generous government incentives. But the huge buildup, often using older technologies, has led to observations that much of the nation’s output is far from cutting-edge.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
_\-----------------_   
  
With its 2007 ruling in _Massachusetts vs. EPA_ , the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. But to meet the Supremes' criteria for regulation, EPA first had to find that the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were an “endangerment” to public health and welfare. While the sitting Bush administration was reluctant to do this, President Obama’s EPA made the “preliminary” finding of endangerment a mere 94 days after his inauguration.   
  
The “final” Endangerment Finding came on December 7, 2009, just in time to provide the United States credibility at the then-starting Copenhagen Conference, a United Nations affair at which a replacement to the failed Kyoto Protocol was to be enshrined. The meeting was the most disastrous yet for global warming hawks, but President Obama quickly declared victory and rushed off on Air Force-1, in order to beat what was to be the first of three bona fide blizzards in Washington that winter. He lost that race, too.   
  
A torrent of regulations followed, “culminating” in EPA’s recent proposal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric power plants. That controversial proposal, announced in early June, followed on the heels of EPA’s January proposal of regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants.   
  
If adopted (and they will be), these proposed regulations will be the biggest diktats yet originating from Obama’s Climate Action Plan. Administration officials are already celebrating the salvation of mankind, even before the regulations are finalized.   
  
The administration is holding “hearings” around the country so it can take _your_ input to improve these already near-perfect rules. To help guide us, the White House just released a new report describing how the costs of climate change will skyrocket the longer we delay taking action to stop it.   
  
According to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, the collection of administration actions on climate change is “changing the tone” in talks with foreign nations. No doubt encouraged by this “changing tone,” President Obama is scheduled to attend a UN climate “summit” in New York this September.   
  
To what end? What benefit will “taking the lead” on climate change actually provide the United States?   




It turns out to be very little. In fact, it will probably cost us.   
  
The United States is not at great risk from climate change. The Obama administration’s Interagency Working Group tasked with establishing the social cost of carbon (SCC) determined that the SCC for the United States was only a few dollars per ton of carbon dioxide emitted—and that was calculated using overheated climate models. Taking into account new research that finds that the earth’s climate is less sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions, and the humongous body of literature demonstrating that enhanced carbon dioxide levels raise crop yields, the “social cost of carbon” in the United States becomes close to zero (or perhaps even negative, i.e., carbon emissions may actually provide a net benefit to the economy).   
  
But that information is carefully concealed in Obama administration reports, such as the one that the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) issued this week. Instead of focusing on the _domestic_ cost of climate change—those affecting the United States—the reports discuss the _global_ cost for carbon emissions (using a rather squirrely technique that is readily manipulated to provide any answer you want—so it’s ironic that EPA’s model to estimate temperature impacts is acronymed MAGICC).   
  
It is a head scratcher as why U.S. policy to restrict carbon emissions (i.e., fossil fuel use)—which the administration’s own Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) says will result in higher energy costs to U.S. consumers—is justified by benefits that it says will largely accrue outside our borders.   
  
The new CEA report clarifies:   
  
Climate change is a global problem, and it will require strong international leadership to secure cooperation among both developed and developing countries to solve it. America must help forge a truly global solution to this global challenge by galvanizing international action to significantly reduce emissions.   
  
Hence McCarthy’s enthusiasm.   
  
If McCarthy is to be believed and administration actions have led to a change in the “tone” of communications, then it probably sounds a lot like lip service.   
  
Two big reasons for this stand out:   
  
The first is that, in the _developed_ world, putting in mandatory emissions caps and carbon taxes are good ways to lose your next election.   
  
Analyses show that Congress's 2009 vote for cap-and-trade cost the Democrats control of the House of Representatives in the succeeding 2010 election. Less than two months after it passed, the Liberal Party in Australia voted out its leader, Malcolm Turnbull, for his support of a similar scheme. The next year, Australian Labour Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd resigned his portfolio over the scheme. Then, _exactly_ four years after our House passed cap-and trade, Rudd's successor, Julia Gillard, was voted out over her carbon tax. (The Australian Parliament repealed the tax on July 17 of this year.)   
  
The second reason is that current-generation renewable energy technologies are simply incapable of meeting the enormous energy needs of _developing_ countries like China and India. If “climate change” ranks low among priorities in the United States, imagine how popular carbon reduction policies will be in countries with large populations with little to no access to electricity at all.   
  
So, even if there is sincerity behind the changed “tone” in international discourse, any resulting agreements to mitigate climate will undoubtedly be unsuccessful, both politically and technologically.   
  
That leaves us “leading” on an issue that science says is overblown, and one that the big, developing nations surely will not adopt (or, at least, achieve).   
  
To this, we say “no thanks.”

"DUBLIN  —   An assembly of Irish citizens convened by Parliament is considering changes to one of the most divisive policies in the country: the   ban on abortions, which has been enshrined in Ireland’s Constitution since 1983. The group, a   Citizens’ Assembly led by Mary Laffoy, a Supreme Court judge, does not have the power to change the law. But its mandate from Parliament  —   to examine the full range of medical, legal and ethical issues surrounding abortion  —   suggests a willingness to revisit the ban, one of the most stringent in the Western world. Over the last three months, the assembly has received more than 13, 500 comments from the public  —   more than 1, 000 of which have been published online so far. It pored over these submissions at the Grand Hotel Malahide over the weekend, along with testimony from experts, and is scheduled to issue a report later this year. Abortion was already illegal in Ireland before 1983, but the Eighth Amendment gave “the right to life of the unborn” equal status to “the right to life of the mother” under the Constitution. The amendment was enacted through a voter referendum, and can be altered  —   or abandoned  —   only via another referendum. Several highly publicized cases since then have contributed to and reflected a shift in the public’s mood, however. In 2012, a    woman, Savita Halappanavar, died from septic shock while having a miscarriage, after a hospital denied her an abortion that might have saved her life. And last year, a United Nations committee ruled that Ireland had violated a woman’s rights by forcing her to travel abroad for an abortion even though severe congenital defects had been diagnosed in the fetus. Legal uncertainty over how to define “the unborn” has long dogged the amendment, and the assembly was seen as one response to the panel’s criticisms. It is common for women in Ireland to travel to countries such as Britain and the Netherlands for abortions. Figures from Britain’s National Health Service showed that more than 3, 400 women gave Irish addresses to British abortions clinics in 2015. That said, Ireland remains a conservative society, and the Roman Catholic Church opposes any change in the law. “We believe that every unborn child, irrespective of his or her medical condition or the circumstances of his or her birth, has the right to be treated equally before the law,” the bishops’ conference said in a statement. Submissions posted online expressed a wide range of views, with many of them offering deeply personal perspectives. Leslie Spillane, a woman in her 20s from Cork, in southwestern Ireland, wrote that several of her friends had traveled abroad to terminate their pregnancies. “These friends of mine are also the lucky ones, they have been able to borrow the money for the travel, and they have had friends they could tell,” she wrote. “Abortions happen, everyday. Making them illegal doesn’t stop woman needing, or wanting them, or inflicting them on themselves  —   there will always be coat hangers, broken bottles, painkillers, stairs to fall down, fists to hit, medicines to swallow. ” In a phone interview, she said that “even if you don’t agree with abortion, it’s not morally acceptable to force your views onto others. ” Defenders of the law were equally adamant. “Abortion, in our firm belief, is the taking of human life irrespective of the stage of pregnancy,” wrote Kathleen Gleeson and her husband, Raymond Gleeson, from County Kerry, in southwestern Ireland. Valerie Marjoram, a woman in her 30s in County Kildare, just west of Dublin, described herself as a feminist who opposed abortion on religious grounds. “I find it appalling that a certain brand of feminism would put more effort into obtaining the legal sanction of murdering one’s own child than fighting for the right to carry a child to term without losing one’s pay, career path, promotion, college place,” she said in a phone interview. “The fact that abortion is legal in any country has led to a culture of selfishness where even life can be rescheduled if it happens at the ‘wrong time. ’” The Eighth Amendment has been subject to legal and political challenges over the years. In 1992, Ireland’s highest court upheld the right to an abortion if the mother’s life is at risk, including from suicide, but how to interpret that right remains in dispute. In 1992, voters approved an amendment to the Constitution to allow women to travel abroad for abortions and to receive information about abortion services abroad. And in that year, and again in 2002, voters rejected amendments that would have removed the threat of suicide as grounds for a legal abortion. Conor O’Mahony, a lecturer in law at University College Cork, says the continued contentiousness reveals problems with the wording of the ban. “The Eighth Amendment doesn’t work as a means of regulating abortion, whether you are coming from the   or abortion rights perspective,” he said in a phone interview. “And the evidence I would give you is that neither side has ever been happy with how that amendment has been interpreted and applied over the years. ” He said that public opinion had been gradually shifting in favor of legalizing abortion  —   particularly in cases involving severe fetal abnormalities or rape  —   but predicted that the debate would continue for years even if a referendum was to take place in the near future. Gerard Whyte, a professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, said in a phone interview that it would be unwise to simply repeal the amendment, as some   advocates seek. “If there is no constitutional protection for the unborn, then there is a problem and we’re into uncharted territory,” he said. “I’m simply warning about a situation whereby people decide to repeal the Eighth but don’t add anything else. ”"
"Not since the rule of Emperor Constantine, during the Roman Warm Era, have pagan gods been tolerated in Rome.

Before Constantine, Romans worshipped 12 main gods including Apollo (the Sun), Diana (the Moon), Flora (the plants), Uranus (the sky), Ceres (the crops), Gaia (the Earth) and of course Bacchus (wine), Venus (love) and Mars (war). Some of these gods demanded tribute and sacrifice.
Christianity, the worship of one forgiving God, slowly absorbed or eliminated its pagan rivals. The Popes in Rome came to lead a Catholic empire of Christians. In modern times, the old Greek/Roman goddess, Gaia, has been resurrected by the world green movement.

Pope Francis seems to seek an alliance with these nature worshippers. Unfortunately the Green wolf will never lie down with the Christian lambs. Christians promote care for humanity especially the weak and the poor. The Gaia worshippers have subordinated humans to “nature” and their attitude to other humans ranges from contempt to deep hatred. Under their extremist Agenda 21, the priests of Gaia would sacrifice humans by restricting their access to land, oceans, food, minerals and energy, and then concentrate the survivors in soul-destroying dormitory cities and food factories. Greens want all descendants of Adam and Eve expelled from our Gardens of Eden.
Christians generally value individual freedom and private property. The Green priesthood will not rest until there is a world government in which there is no private property and all humans are numbered, controlled and planned. They are using climate alarmism to achieve these goals.

"The morning rush at the Jewish community center in Columbia, S. C. had subsided when the phone rang on Monday. The caller, an   woman, “in a loud screaming voice kept saying there’s a bomb,” said Barry A. Abels, the center’s executive director. At roughly the same time, a woman dialed the Jewish community center in Rockville, Md. nearly 500 miles away, and said there was a bomb. Not long after, a man called a Jewish organization in Wilmington, Del. He, too, warned of a bomb. Similar threats, which turned out to be unfounded, were reported all over the Eastern United States on Monday, at as many as 16 Jewish community facilities, one advocacy group estimated. Time and time again, the police responded, buildings were evacuated and, after tense waits, the centers and schools reopened. Federal law enforcement officials did not definitively link the threats, but the episodes rattled nerves, and raised deep concern and little doubt that the phone calls had been orchestrated. “My personal take is it’s a statement of where we are in this country,” said Michael Feinstein, the chief executive of the Bender Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington, in Rockville. “There’s some thought amongst some people that hate speech and hate crimes are O. K. and   is O. K. and I think that is reflective of sort of the political discourse that we’ve had in this country. ” Mr. Feinstein said about 300 people had been in the Rockville center when the threat was made, including about 200 preschoolers. After the threat in Delaware, parents were called to pick up preschool and day school students. In South Carolina, Mr. Abels said staff members and patrons attending exercise classes had to leave. About three hours later, he said, the authorities said it was safe to return, leaving many to wonder what had happened. “It could be anything from hate groups to a terrorist situation,” Mr. Abels said. “I think it’s probably more on the hate group side, because it was just a scare. ” He said he believed it was “designed to be psychologically disorienting and scary and just disruptive. ” Jerry Silverman, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America, said the threats were part of a disturbing trend toward normalizing hate speech. It was less than three years ago that a former Ku Klux Klan leader killed three people outside Jewish facilities in Overland Park, Kan. And in November, after the presidential election, the   League posted a warning about a reported uptick in hate speech and  . Some members of the   a   fringe movement that embraces elements of   racist and   positions, perceived the victory of   Donald J. Trump as validation for their cause and have become increasingly visible in recent months. Mr. Trump, who has a Jewish daughter and    has disavowed the  . Mr. Silverman said Monday’s cases were part of a broader “coordinated effort” to intimidate Jews. He said that Jewish organizations nationwide had instituted emergency protocols, and that leaders were communicating with one another on Monday as the threats were reported. “We’ve seen this at Jewish community centers over the last year,” Mr. Silverman said. “We’ve seen it at Jewish day schools. We’ve seen it at synagogues. ” “It’s all about training and preparedness,” he added. Law enforcement agencies in Nashville Jacksonville, Fla. and Tenafly, N. J. were among those confirming on Monday that they had responded to and cleared bomb threats at Jewish centers. An F. B. I. spokeswoman said the bureau was “aware of bomb threats” and had been in touch with the local police. “We understand there were similar threats around the country,” said Tzipora Cohen, of the Jewish Community Center in Tenafly. “I guess these are the times we live in. ”"

The Obama Administration’s just‐​released National Climate Assessment report leaves the impression that if we don’t quickly launch into action to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases (primarily by shifting away from using fossil fuels), we will be inundated by an endless flow of misfortune unleashed by the ensuing climate change. The flood has already begun.



Nothing could be further from the truth.



First, the assessment report frequently confuses climate with climate change. The natural climate of the United States is constantly overflowing with extreme weather hazards of all sorts — hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, blizzards, heat waves, hard freezes and on and on. It’s the norm. The assessment would have you think that every time one of these types of events happens, now or in the future, it is because we are emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Such a conclusion is a stretch and has never been proven. A thorough review of climate science would demonstrate that the impact of human‐​caused climate change on the behavior of most types of extreme weather is poorly understood. Instead, the vagaries of climate dominate our experiences.





The National Climate Assessment is a political call to action document meant for the president’s left‐​leaning constituency.



Second, greenhouse gas emissions from the United States have a truly minimal and diminishing effect on the future course of the Earth’s climate. Rather, that course is being set by developing nations such as China and, soon, India. Research has shown that eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions from the United States now and forever only mitigates less than two‐​tenths of a one degree of warming by the end of the century — but the cost to do so would hurt our economy dearly. Few folks are willing to pay such a price for no measureable return.



Third, a growing body of scientific evidence — which is based in observations rather than climate models — strongly suggests that future climate change is going to be smaller than we are commonly told in reports such as this National Climate Assessment or those from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This means that reducing carbon‐​dioxide emissions from the United States will have even less of an impact than the tiny number mentioned above.



Finally, suggesting that we will be overwhelmed by negative impacts from climate change ignores our demonstrated human ability to respond to environmental challenges. A changing climate is only filled with negatives if we sit unresponsive and let it sweep over us. However, such an outcome is completely at odds with human civilization. The National Climate Assessment seems to sparingly recognize this fact, but then is quick to dismiss it as a way forward.



A glaring example concerns the death toll from heat waves. The assessment tells us that incidents of extreme heat have become more common and longer‐​lasting, and that we should expect the trend to continue into the future (until presumably that we stop emitting greenhouse gases). The report recognizes that “[s]ome of the risks of heat‐​related sickness and death have diminished in recent decades, possibly due to better forecasting, heat‐​health early warning systems, and/​or increased access to air conditioning for the U.S. population.” It ignores those findings, though, to conclude “increasingly frequent and intense heat events lead to more heat‐​related illnesses and deaths.” This is not only a non sequitur but it is also completely wrong.



Scientific literature is chock full of studies that demonstrate that the population’s sensitivity to extreme heat is decreasing, resulting in lower rates of people dying during heat waves. This is true across the United States and in major cities around the world. A new paper by researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health examined trends in heat‐​related mortality across the United States and concluded “[t]his study provides strong evidence that acute (e.g., same‐​day) heat‐​related mortality risk has declined over time in the U.S., even in more recent years.” Another recent look into heat‐​related mortality published in the prominent science journal Nature Climate Change concluded that “climate change itself leads to adaptation” a finding that “highlights one of the many often overlooked intricacies of the human response to climate change.” Such an observation applies directly to the National Climate Assessment.



Let’s get one thing clear: The National Climate Assessment is a political call to action document meant for the president’s left‐​leaning constituency. What pretense of scientific support that decorates it quickly falls away under a close and critical inspection.



Perhaps most telling is the letter to the members of Congress that introduces the just‐​released report, co‐​signed by White House Science Adviser John Holdren and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration head Kathryn Sullivan. The letter concludes, “When President Obama launched his Climate Action Plan last year, he made clear that the essential information contained in this report would be used by the Executive Branch to underpin future policies and decisions to better understand and manage the risks of climate change.”



When the president launched his Climate Action Plan last year, the National Climate Assessment was still being revised and reviewed. Yet somehow, the president already knew that it would help his environmental agenda and imminent executive actions on the issue. It seems the message was preordained — the mark of politics trumping science.

The last time USA led in the nuclear space race. 1 December 1967: The first ground experimental nuclear rocket engine (XE) assembly is shown here in “cold flow” configuration, as it makes a late evening arrival at Engine Test Stand No. 1 at the Nuclear Rocket Development Station in Jackass Flats, Nevada. The US nuclear programme was shelved in the 1970s.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Following Russia’s announcement of their successful ten year programme to build a civilian nuclear powered launch vehicle, President Trump’s administration has directed NASA to restart US research into nuclear powered launch technology.
Momentum Grows for Nuclear Thermal Space PropulsionBy Jeff Foust a day agoPASADENA, Calif. — With congressional funding and industry support, nuclear thermal propulsion technology is making progress for potential use on future NASA deep space missions, although how it fits into the agency’s exploration architectures remains uncertain.The House Appropriations Committee approved May 22 a commerce, justice and science (CJS) appropriations bill that offers $22.3 billion for NASA. That funding includes $125 million for nuclear thermal propulsion development within the agency’s space technology program, compared to an administration request for no funding.“The bill’s investment in nuclear thermal propulsion is critical as NASA works towards the design of a flight demonstration by 2024,” said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), ranking member of the CJS appropriations subcommittee, during that subcommittee’s markup of the bill May 17. He offered similar comments in support of that project at the full committee markup.…Read more: https://www.space.com/nuclear-thermal-space-propulsion-momentum-grows.html
The USA was once the unquestioned leader of nuclear space technology. 
In addition to a successful nuclear thermal rocket programme (see the picture at the top of the page), the USA spent the best part of a decade exploring Project Orion, a 1950s technology space drive which was so powerful it could have affordably lifted entire cities to other worlds, or could even have been used to launch a manned mission to Alpha Centauri. 
But all these US technology programmes were shelved and left to wither in the 1970s, thanks to political fear created by green anti-nuclear campaigns. 
Now Russia has stepped in and taken the lead. 
If the USA fails to catch up, if commercial and military Russian and Chinese space technology dominates the future, US green groups will have a lot to answer for.

_Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
In the vast majority of laboratory and field experiments, the benefits of higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations for plants (including food crops) generally outweigh the negative impacts from climate change. And this is even assuming the “dumb farmer scenario” that we recently blogged, in which farmers and agronomists don’t develop new production techniques, technologies, crop varietals, etc., to adapt to change, turning expected losses into gains. There is overwhelming evidence such as the remarkably robust increase that has occurred in the yield of most of the world’s major crops when grown in developing or developed nations. In other words, adding CO2 to the atmosphere may be a win‐​win situation for the world’s vegetation, but we digress…   
  
  
Here, we’ll highlight a new study showing that including the fertilization effect of higher CO2 concentrations in a crop model of wheat grown in China turns projections of future climate change‐​driven reductions in crop yields into CO2‐​driven yield increases.   
  
  
The study was conducted by researchers Yujie Liu and Fulu Tao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and will soon be published in the _Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology_. Liu and Tao used a complex crop model to evaluate the changes in wheat production (which accounts from 22% China’s primary food production), in the main wheat cultivation areas in China under three climate change scenarios—global temperature increases of 1°, 2°, and 3°C. They modeled the crop response both with and without considering the fertilization impacts of additional atmospheric CO2 concentrations (which presumably produced the warming) and compared the results. Here is their summary:   




There is a high probability of decreasing (increasing) changes in yield and water use efficiency under higher temperature scenarios without (with) consideration of CO2 fertilization effects. Elevated CO2 concentration generally compensates for the negative effects of warming temperatures on production. Moreover, positive effects of elevated CO2 concentration on grain yield increase with warming temperatures. The findings could be critical for climate change‐​driven agricultural production that ensures global food security.



Findings and conclusions like these are a breath of carbon dioxide‐​enhanced fresh air in a world of climate gloomsaying.

While we hate to beat a dead horse, despite our best efforts, it’s apparently still alive and kicking.   
  
It is a horse called “Global Warmed Causes Cold Winters and Therefore We Should Regulate Carbon Dioxide Emissions” and proudly jockeyed by White House science adviser John Holdren. (It is rumored that the horse was sired by “Comply or Die,” the winner of the 2008 Grand National Steeplechase and a favorite among the global warming alarmist crowd.)   
  
Previously, on several occasions, we have pointed out that Holdren’s view that greenhouse gas-induced climate changes lead to more frequent cold outbreaks (as espoused in this YouTube video produced by the White House during last winter’s frigid cold) is a (dwindling) minority viewpoint. Leading researchers on the topic have made a special point of declaring that the hypothesis is rather unlikely.   
  
In recent months, new research, in part inspired by last winter’s “polar vortex” excursion southward into the eastern United States, and the White House-spurred speculation that it was caused by anthropogenic climate change, has hit the scientific press. In each case, new research has found little evidence in support of Holdren’s contention and a rather _lot_ of evidence to the contrary.   
  
In fact, so much evidence has built up against Holdren that the good folks over at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) filed a formal request for correction with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under what’s known as the federal Data Quality Act.   




The CEI petition was, predictably, denied, with the claim that the information in the video did not violate the Data Quality Act because the video only reflected Holdren’s “personal opinion,” not a “comprehensive review of the scientific literature.”   
  
Amen to the latter! But the problem—and a troubling problem at that—is that Holdren’s “personal opinion” carries a lot of weight in the White House and influences federal policy.   
  
For example, in announcing proposed regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said “I’m tired of people pointing to the Polar Vortex as a reason not to act on climate. It’s exactly the opposite. Climate change heightens risks from extreme cold that freezes power grids.”   
  
More evidence of Holdren’s influence is found in this _New York Times_ ’ article from last week “Obama Adviser on Front Lines of Climate Fight: John Holdren’s Influence Seen in Obama’s Policies.” According to the _Times_ ’ article:   




But it also acknowledged a truth: Mr. Holdren has this president’s ear, perhaps more than any White House science adviser in recent memory, at a time when climate change has been thrust to the forefront of national politics and could help shape Mr. Obama’s legacy.



Mr. Holdren’s influence can be seen in many of the administration’s policies, including its biggest on climate change—the plan to cut power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, the main contributor to global warming.



“John was right at the heart” of the deliberations, said the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough.





The topic of Holdren’s views on global warming, cold outbreaks, and the CEI petition was briefly raised in the article, with little concession by the White House.   
  
In fact, among climate scientists the issue of a link between Arctic warming and cold spells is still far from resolved. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which Holdren leads, said it stood by the accuracy of the video, but added, “there will be continuing debate about exactly what is happening.”   
  
The ""debate about exactly what is happening"" is becoming decidedly more one-sided (and not in Holdren’s favor).   
  
A prominent study on the topic appeared in the journal _Nature Climate Change_ last month. The paper was written ny the University of Exeter’s James Screen, who found that cold winter days were actually warming more than not-so cold winter days—with the net result that climate change was leading to less variability in winter temperatures, not more, as would occur under Holdren’s scenario.   
  
[What was left out of Screen’s paper was acknowledgement that we—Knappenberger and Michaels—published nearly the same result 13 years ago! See here for details.]   
  
Accompanying the Screen article was a piece by Eric Fischer and Reto Knutti that explained how the picture relating climate change to winter cold outbreaks was increasingly coming into focus—and showing that climate change should moderate winter weather, not make it more severe.   
  
The Fischer and Knutti article contains gems like these:   




A number of studies proposed that strong Arctic warming and declining sea ice extent caused the jet stream to meander more, thereby making temperatures more volatile and causing more intense cold spells in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. As he reports in _Nature Climate Change_ , James Screen challenges this hypothesis and provides observational evidence for the opposite effect.



and,   




In the end, the most powerful argument is the observational evidence and our quantitative physical understanding. Screen demonstrates that despite recent cold winters, cold days have become less, rather than more, extreme.



and our favorite:   




What is robust, however, is that the popular picture of a general ""global weirding""—of all kinds of weather becoming more extreme and volatile across the globe—is simplistic and misleading.



It’s long is past time for the White House to come clean on all of this and admit that the global warming/polar vortex horse is lame. Hiding this fact unfairly lowers its odds and risks the placement of misguided bets—for example, President Obama’s Climate Action Plan.   
  
P.S.: Weather forecast models for next week—normally the second-hottest week of the year in the eastern United States—are predicting a jet stream orientation that looks a lot like what dominated last winter (i.e., a return of the dreaded ""polar vortex""), and far, far below-normal temperatures, especially in the Midwest. We doubt people will mind as much as they did in January and therefore doubt that the White House will declare that the cool (and welcomed) summer weather is ""consistent with"" anthropogenic global warming.

"For years, antinuclear activists, concerned parents, local officials and others have worried about Indian Point, a   nuclear plant on the Hudson River in northern Westchester County that provides cheap energy and robust tax revenue, but also carries the risk of disaster. The news on Friday that the state had negotiated a deal that could shut down the plant within five years sent shock waves of jubilation, relief and anxiety through the suburbs north of New York City. On one side was an almost gleeful disbelief that what had seemed an insurmountable goal  —   ridding the county of nuclear power  —   would come to pass. Nada Khader, executive director of the Wespac Foundation, a nonprofit group in White Plains that advocates social justice, was told about the development by a reporter. “This is really amazing for Wespac, an organization whose many, many members have been working for decades to shut Indian Point,” she said. “All of us want to shift to safe energy. We absolutely welcome this news. ” But there were also misgivings about what the closing would mean for utility customers, Indian Point employees and the nearby schools that rely on the plant’s tax dollars. Officials in Westchester County said they were blindsided by the deal and were upset that they were not consulted. Robert P. Astorino, the county executive and a vocal supporter of Indian Point, which is in the village of Buchanan, said more than $4 million enters the county’s coffers every year from the plant, representing nearly 1 percent of the tax base. “No one from the governor’s office had the common courtesy to call the county affected by this,” Mr. Astorino, a Republican, said. “So we’re all trying to figure out what will happen in the future and the costs of this potential closure. There are enormous economic consequences to something like this. ” Perhaps no single entity will suffer the financial effects of the shutdown more than Hendrick Hudson schools, a district with 2, 400 students that draws from parts of a   towns and villages near the plant. The superintendent, Joseph E. Hochreiter, said taxes from the company that owns Indian Point, Entergy, made up   of the district’s $75. 8 million operating budget annually. “We’ve enjoyed some of the lowest property tax increases of any school district in Westchester County and that has made this a very appealing community to move to and stay in,” he said. “Entergy plays a major, major role in keeping taxes down. If they are not operating at the capacity that we’re accustomed to, we are going to have budget deficits. ” Converting Indian Point’s property to another use  —   whether residential or commercial  —   may not be possible, given the environmental history of the   site. Still, after years of   over the potential for a catastrophe, many residents said they would be happy to have a   county. Opponents of the plant had seized on the Sept. 11 terror attacks and, later, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan to galvanize support for shutting Indian Point. More recently, critics had focused on fighting a natural gas pipeline that was constructed on the plant’s land. Elected officials, residents and environmental activists have criticized the project, saying that a rupture could unleash a nuclear catastrophe. While Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has long called for the plant’s closing, few thought a decision to shut it down was imminent. Nancy Vann, a retired Wall Street lawyer who lives in Peekskill, has fought against Indian Point for years. She is president of Safe Energy Rights Group, which was formed in response to the natural gas pipeline. “I’m very, very happy about this,” she said, referring to news of the agreement. But like others, she was concerned about the plant’s spent fuel rods. Under the deal, they will be moved off site eventually. “Indian Point won’t be completely safe until the spent fuel rods are all put into hardened dry cask storage,” she said. “I just want people to realize that the fact that Indian Point is closing  —   and not immediately  —   doesn’t mean it will be safe right away. ” Michael B. Kaplowitz, chairman of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, listed other concerns  —   from the plant’s decommissioning costs and the fate of its 1, 000 employees, to the effects on the local area. While he is eager to see details of the deal, he said that on balance, shutting it made sense. “It’s a net societal gain because of the specter of terrorism,” he said. “The better the details are for the company, the worse it is for the rate payers and taxpayers. I’m hoping that given the leverage the state has that the tax payers and rate payers do better than the Entergy shareholders. ” “I can say,” he added, “that I’m encouraged that it looks like we are turning the page on a nuclear power plant that doesn’t belong 25 miles from New York City. ”"

Re: Withdrawal from the 2015 UN Climate Change Agreement.
I write to you as an LNP Member. The announcement that President Trump will withdraw from the 2015 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is wonderful news because it shows that in the face of huge vested interests he has had the courage to challenge the hoax that the minute traces of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are causing disastrous Climate Change.
Australia should also withdraw.
The objectives of the UN’s Climate Change Policies have never been about Climate.

Destroy Industrialisation. The first objective was to destroy the world’s industrialisation as advocated by Maurice Strong, Chairman of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. The Greens are well on the way to achieving this in South Australia and Victoria.
Follow the Money Trail. The second objective was a means for a Global Transfer of Wealth. Ottman Edenhofer, a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in 2010, “But one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy … One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy.” Under the terms of the Climate Change Policy, the UN is seeking US$100 billion per year from Developed Countries for a Green Climate Fund to “help developing countries fight climate change”. In 2015, there were some 136 Developing Countries listed and only 51 Developed Countries so the affirmative vote for the UN’s Climate Policy was a foregone conclusion.

Many advocates of the Climate Policies have been wilfully opportunistic and avaricious,Skin problems but many have believed in it because they have not understood the essential and benign role of CO2 in Nature.
President Trump, a major figure on the world political stage, has now had the courage to call the bluff of the Leftist Green Warmists who claim that CO2 is harmful.
I would suggest that you join with other Conservative Politicians to strongly urge the Prime Minister to cancel all Renewable Energy Targets and Subsidies.
If our Government fails to do this, we will not only be politically out of step with the USA, we will be condemned to a future of expensive and unreliable electricity, higher costs of living, diminished living standards and an exodus of industries to countries with cheaper power.

Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne
At the online German news weekly Der Spiegel here, we find an interview with philosopher Alexander Grau.
Grau has been studying the language and symbols in the climate debate and also works as a freelance cultural and business journalist. He writes the column “Grauzone” for political magazine “Cicero”.
When asked by Spiegel what he thought when he saw Greta Thunberg’s outburst at the UN in New York and her emotional accusation of “how dare you!”, Grau responded:

Greta Thunberg’s performance was aggressive and fanatical. That was repulsive and clumsy. “Fridays for Future” on the other hand has to make Thunberg’s message suitable for events. This is about mass communication: the result is political kitsch: simple solutions, sub-complex problem consideration, strong collective emotionalization, transfiguration of nature and a denial of reality that claims to be realism.”

He tells Spiegel: “Greta Thunberg’s appearance had something fanatical about it.”
When Spiegel asks if Greta Thunberg and “Fridays for Future” call on us to finally acknowledge the reality of climate change and draw conclusions from it, Grau says that there’s a series of conflicting goals at play:
But the whole story also includes the fact that we are dealing with a series of conflicting goals. Climate protection is just one of many political goals. Without poverty reduction, for example, we will not get a grip on overpopulation. But for that we need economic growth and a great deal of cheap energy. A complete phase-out of humanity from fossil fuels could lead to even greater catastrophes.
Grau also told Spiegel in the interview:
In view of human intervention in the ecosystem, many people think that the world would be more peaceful, ecological and harmonious without humans. But that is nonsense. Man, also the man of modernity, is part of nature, not an external foreign body. Here a cynical misanthropy is barely veiled.”

Leonardo Di Caprio and his superyachts. James Cameron and Harrison Ford and their respective fleets of cars, planes and boats. The private jets, mansions and endless, long-haul Business Class flights of celebrities, activists and politicians. It’s a given by now that the louder the screeching of climate activists, the greater their hypocrisy.



Lest you think that staggering hypocrisy of the climate alarmists is the sole preserve of the elite, even bog-standard grubby politicians are among the biggest climate charlatans on the planet.



Independent MP Zali Steggall says she has not yet fulfilled her promise of changing to an electric vehicle, and says she would “appreciate” if the government made EVs cheaper.



Ms Steggall came under pressure during her ultimately successful campaign to unseat Tony Abbott for having a gas-guzzling car while advocating for climate action.



Steggall, it must be remembered, ran against Abbott **specifically** on the issue of climate change. Dodgy, bullying activists like GetUp threw their shady weight behind her and relentlessly, grubbily, attacked Abbott solely because of his resistance to climate alarmism. Her hypocrisy is bigger than Al Gore’s chins.



 **Note also the blatant, grasping, entitlement of this middle-class socialist.** Steggall lives in one of the richest suburbs of Australia. Yet, she wants taxpayers to subsidise EVs that cost more than a luxury car.



As she prepared to push for parliament to declare a “climate emergency”, Ms Steggall said she could still not afford an EV, but committed to ultimately getting one.



“I like every other Australian have budget pressures, mortgage pressures,” she told Sky News.



 **Nothing sticks in voters’ craws more than a trougher politician whinging about how tough they have it.** Barnaby Joyce was rightly pilloried for complaining that $280 grand was barely enough to scrape together (although, to be fair, the Beetrooter probably has some crippling child support bills to pay), and Tasmanian Speaker Sue Hickey is currently copping it hard for whinging that being paid as much as Boris Johnson isn’t enough to keep her in the manner to which she is entitled.



Ms Steggall ran almost solely on climate change at the election but was spotted driving a Nissan Pathfinder — which is one of the highest carbon-emitting cars.



The now-independent MP said during a debate with Mr Abbott that she wanted to change to an EV, but needed government assistance.



Zali Steggall’s personal worth is estimated at around half a million dollars. She is married to a company director and lives in an suburb where the median house prices hover around a million dollars. Her current salary (not counting allowances) is a lazy $200 000.



And she wants taxpayers to fund her smug-mobile.



Wealthy green humbugs seem to be Warringah’s biggest resource.



Ms Steggall will join with former Liberal leader John Hewson, the Greens and other House crossbenchers on Wednesday to push a “climate emergency” motion.



I wonder if Hewson has sold his Ferrari or quit his job as a director of an oil and gas company in Papua New Guinea? I mean, **if rich climate activists can’t live up to their own standards, who can we trust?**

Okay, here’s how much of what calls itself science works today:   
  
1) Find a change in something   
  
2) Say it could be caused by global warming   
  
3) Get more funding   
  
4) Let people ask critical questions   
  
5) Get tenure to protect you from that criticism   
  
Today’s textbook example comes from the Washington Post, in an article, “Large ‘dead zones’, oxygen depeleted water, likely because of climate change”.   
  
This is _bad_. According to The Post, the authors of newly minted article in _Global Change Biology_ , say,   




As global temperatures warm, they will create conditions such as rain [!], wind and sea-level rise that will cause dead zones throughout the world to intensify and grow…



Dead zones are (sometimes) large regions of hypoxic seawater that appear every summer. Because of their seasonality, obviously global warming is making them worse, right? (see 2) above) Or is it due to the fact that, on the average, humans are flushing more agricultural nitrates into the ocean as we produce ever more food? So the nitrates fertilize the ocean, algae bloom and die, bacteria decompose them and in the process, water becomes hypoxic, and fish die.   




The authors, Andrew Altieri and Keryn Gedan, both with Smithsonian Institution affiliations, state there’s been quite the change in the number of dead zones (see 1) above). There’s a whole lot of stinking water, as according to Fears, they show that “Dead zone events have doubled each decade since the 1950s”.   
  
But, according to Gedan, “we just don’t know how much of this doubling is due to climate change or nutrient runoff”. According to her, we need more studies and “more sophisticated modelling” (see 3) above).   
  
Math time. That means they doubled from the 50s to the 60s, increased fourfold in the 70s, etc…to the first decade of the 21st century in which they have purportedly gone up from 16-fold in the 1990s to 32-fold over the 1950s.   
  
Speaking of decadal scales, according to Cato’s Ross McKitrick, the “pause” in warming is now 19 years in length. So how do you get a doubling in the dead zones (and a 32-fold increase over the 1950s) without warming? Perhaps there’s not much of an effect from warming, and a much bigger one from nutrient runoff.   
  
Evidence? The doubling of dead zones in the absence of warming not unique. From the 1960s to the 1970s, global surface temperature actually declined.   
  
Gedan is certainly correct that you really would need “more sophisticated modelling” to pin the huge increase on the tiny amount of warming since 1950, and a doubling per decade even when two decades don’t warm. And wouldn’t the three _millennia_ after the end of the ice age, when it was warmer (at least in our hemisphere) have been a very stinky time?   
  
Given that dead zones maximize during the summer's hottest temperatures, there is surely _some_ component from warming. But the more obvious answer is that the massive flushing of nitrates into the world's nearshore regions is changing a minor (and possibly undetectable) amplification into a stinking roar.   
  
Or, given the fact that the earth has been warmer than it is today for about 95% of the last 100 million years, is it possible that the world’s biota really don’t care?   
  
If the dead zone increase is real and caused by human activity, then there actually is some hope. There's a real ecological problem here—the massive dumping of nitrates into our onshore ecosystems—that can actually be significantly reduced with relatively simple measures. On the other hand, there is simply no way that any conceivable climate policy will have a meaningful effect on global surface temperature.

" John Raymond Christy is a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) whose chief interests are satellite remote sensing of global climate and global climate change. In February 2019 he was named as a member of the EPA Science Advisory Board. An interview with Grégoire Canlorbe. Grégoire Canlorbe: You have been at pains to show that climate models are over-predicting warming by roughly a factor of two. Could you come back to this alleged falsification? John Christy: We should be applying the scientific method to claims scientists (and others) are making about the climate. In this case I downloaded the output from 102 climate model simulations used by the IPCC and compared the tropospheric temperature since 1979 between the models and several observational datasets, including the satellite dataset we generate. The models on average were warming the atmosphere at a rate significantly greater than the observations. This is a test result from which we can say the models failed, and thus one shouldn’t depend on model output to characterize the future climate. Grégoire Canlorbe: You are notably known for your involvement—along with Roy Spencer—in devising the first successful satellite temperature record. It turns out that beforehand you had already built your “first climate datasets” at the age of twelve, “using a mechanical pencil, graph paper, and long-division (no calculators back then.)” Could you tell us more about this life of invention? John Christy: I was fascinated with the weather conditions around my home in the San Joaquin Valley of California (a desert basically) and the contrast with the climate of the Sierra Nevada Mountains immediately to the East. I was curious as to why some years were wet, others dry… why the Sierras had more precipitation and why the snow levels varied so much.  I was the first high school student in California to write a simple program to predict the weather and to calculate the snow level in the mountains. These were very crude, statistical models in 1968, written for computers that were far less sophisticated than today’s cell phone. But, they introduced me to computer coding and to the power that was required to study. That was over 50 years ago.John Christy (on the left) in the company of Grégoire Canlorbe – Paris, May 2019   Grégoire Canlorbe: It is sometimes alleged that given the impossibility to obtain—from the study of averaged weather patterns over a given period—reliable predictions on the forthcoming atmospheric conditions, climatology is not a full-fledged science. At best, it would be an art mobilizing various scientific fields (such as physical geography, oceanography, and metrology); at worst, it would be a propaganda tool. Do you recognize some relevance to such criticisms? John Christy: One of the fundamental characteristics of the scientific method is that if we understand a system, then we can predict the behavior of that system. Our work in which we compare “predictions” from climate models against the actual changes of the real world indicate the current understanding of climate change is rather poor. This understanding is certainly not mature enough for regulatory policy. That certain experts and elites refuse to see the level of immaturity of understanding regarding climate, is astonishing. However, it is understandable since climate is such a complex system, it is easier and more comforting for these elites to simply ignore the complexity and declare they believe CO2 is dangerous and we should believe them because of some status of authority they have garnered for themselves. They claim the “Science is Settled” only because they have not performed the necessary scientific tests which I believe would lead them to the opposite conclusion. Grégoire Canlorbe: Concerning the climate-realist argument that CO2 is the food for plants, it is commonly answered that any good thing in excess—including CO2—becomes a poison; and that CO2 levels continuing to rise would only be beneficial to those of plants sheltered in highly controlled greenhouses.While the increase in temperature (following the increase in CO2) engenders an increase in the size of deserts, the larger growth—as well as the greater moisture evaporation—of CO2 enhanced plants heightens their need for water; as a general rule, too high a supply in CO2 leads to a reduced availability of other nutrients—and, in the case of certain plants, can also trigger a reduction of photosynthesis or a greater vulnerability to insects. How do you assess this analysis? John Christy: The evidence from satellite observations is very clear that the Earth has experienced considerable “greening” over the past 20 years, so this indicates that the extra CO2 we have put back into the atmosphere is having a very positive impact on the biosphere.  It should be noted that most of the living things around us developed in an atmosphere millions of years ago that contained four to ten times more CO2 than we have at the present. So, deserts are not increasing, but contracting. This is where the scientific method is so important—when someone makes a claim about a change in the climate or Earth system, others should test that claim with real observations. Unfortunately today, the media often would rather announce the dramatic claim of a terrible change without checking the facts.   Grégoire Canlorbe: In response to showing that climate is barely sensitive to CO2, it is not uncommon to assert that it remains impossible for fossil fuel industry, mechanized agriculture, and mass urbanization not to have disturbed the natural course of climate in one way or another. To what extent do you reject this claim? John Christy: I think the natural course of the climate has been changed, especially in urban areas where the natural surroundings have been drastically altered. Temperatures are warmer (especially at night) in these urban areas. Globally, the climate impact of the extra CO2, I believe, is actually smaller than the urban warming signal in our big cities. It should be noted that the people of the world are moving toward modernization and that is accomplished by affordable energy—which today comes from the burning of carbon-based fuels. In the future, other sources of energy that are affordable will be deployed and this alleged problem of “climate change” will fade away. It is important to note that we did not leave the Stone Age because we ran out of stones. We left the Stone Age because something better was discovered by human ingenuity. We will leave the Carbon Age not because we run out of carbon, but because a different and more affordable source of energy will be developed. As of now, the traditional renewables aren’t the answer because they supply such little energy relative to the area they cover, and they are unable to supply energy “on-demand” as is required for a modern economy.   Grégoire Canlorbe: The recent Notre-Dame de Paris fire has been occasionally qualified as a consequence of global warming. In other existing interpretations, the burning is thought to be God’s punishment against the Roman Catholic Church—by reason of its alleged crypto-Paganism which would be culminating into the ecologism of Pope Francis and his endorsing the belief in anthropogenic warming. As a former missionary, how do you react to this demonization of the Catholic Church? John Christy: I do not think such interpretations are useful. I would only say that, in general, the Christian faith upholds the value of human life so that actions that enhance the length and quality of human life is the moral imperative. At this point in time, the use of carbon-based energy provides exactly what is needed here—the energy needed to lengthen and enhance the quality of human life. Without energy, life is brutal and short as I learned while serving as a teacher/missionary in Africa. Grégoire Canlorbe: The purported neoconservative turn of Donald Trump’s foreign policy does not fail to arouse controversy. When it comes to assessing retrospectively the neoconservative movement, its positive deeds and its mistakes, do you think figures like George W. Bush, Paul Wolfowitz, William Kristol, or John Bolton have been fighting against eco-fanaticism as vehemently as they have been combating the threat of Marxism or that of Islam? John Christy: I do not think about this issue too much. I would say that one should look at the final piece of data—the world is increasing its carbon emissions as it works to eradicate poverty. So, while the world has been scolded for 25 years by elites from scientific, academic and liberal government entities, nothing has really changed. People will pursue what is in their own best interest—long, healthy and fulfilling lives—and affordable energy makes that happen.   Grégoire Canlorbe: It has been hypothesized that changes in incoming solar radiation—over several decades—are the main factor causing or, at least, modulating climatic variations. Could you share your thoughts on this alleged connection between the Sun and climate? John Christy: I’ve looked at this issue and we do see the impact of solar variability on our stratospheric temperature data. However, in the troposphere (where we live) the evidence is very difficult to draw out because our dataset is only 40 years long and other major perturbations have confused the ability to detect an 11-year cycle (i.e. volcanic eruptions, El Niños etc.) There certainly must be a relationship between solar variability and climate, and I am watching with interest the work of those who study the cosmic-ray connection which is directly related to solar variations. Perhaps even greater evidence will be coming soon in this area.   Grégoire Canlorbe: It is not uncommon—in some Christian circles—to conceive of the Darwinian theory of evolution as a state-sponsored hoax comparable to man-caused global warming. Both would be pseudo-scientific perspectives denying the divine character of man and the presence of Providence in the universe—and leading to idolize the state. As a Protestant scientist, how do you assess this opinion? John Christy: This is an interesting question. Please note that a scientist using the scientific method should generate a reproduceable result whether he/she is a Baptist (like me), a Buddhist or a Baha’i. The scientific issues about climate are based on measurements we make to test claims, not on an opinion one might have. When it comes to policy that directly affects people, especially the poor, we now must consider non-scientific issues such as: is it proper to inflict hardship on those who can least afford it by following policies that demonstrably will not impact the climate? It is not in our best interest to appeal to religious feelings when dealing with issues that are available for scientific testing. As the average person knows, there are a multitude of religious opinions today, but a scientific test should have results to which all rational people, religious or not, should be able to acknowledge. I also think the average person has considerable experience regarding the claims about a dangerous future from so-called experts which the average person knows are simply exaggerations. And, the average person knows that these experts want to pass rules that take away a part of life that the average person wants and needs. Recent elections around the world demonstrate that the average person recognizes these false claims of calamity and wants to get on with their lives without the burden of higher taxes and fees which, in fact, will not impact the climate anyway (as we have shown with scientific tests). The average person is smarter than the experts and elites suspect. Grégoire Canlorbe: Thank you for your time. Is there something you would like to add? John Christy: No. Thank you for interviewing me.——Confronter au réel les affirmations sur le climat (en) (the opening is in French; Dr. Christy’s presentation is in English) Dr. Christy was Friends of Science Society’s guest speaker on May 17, 2010 at our Seventh Annual Luncheon in Calgary.

In Japan, like many other places around the world, the media like to tell audiences how sea surface temperatures around Japan are rising due to man-made global warming.
But, as is often the case, the data and facts tell the opposite story.
What follows is a chart depicting sea surface temperatures around Japan.

Data source: JMA.

As we can plainly see above, the sea surfce temperatures around Japan rapidly cooled since the start of the new century, before spiking briefly around 2016. The overall trend for the past 21 years has been steady.
Japanese media also like claiming that the number of typhoons is on the rise as well. But here too the data from the JMA show how the opposite is the reality.

Data source: JMA.
The number of typhoons has been trending down modestly for many decades, even though atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased.
So the next time you hear some doomsday climate claim from the media, you’ll be well informed in most cases if you simply assume the opposite to be true!
Especially when it ocmes to climate trends and predictions. the media just cannot be trusted. Often they are living in a fantasy world.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
ABC reporter Rebecca Turner claims Carnegie have not published the results of their wave energy experiment.

Carnegie Clean Energy undertakes capital raising in a last-ditch bid to avoid liquidation
By Rebecca TurnerUpdated Thu at 3:42pm
As it makes what could be a final roll of the dice for its survival, collapsed wave energy hopeful Carnegie Clean Energy is still not disclosing the performance of its most valuable asset — its CETO wave technology.
Key points:

Carnegie is facing liquidation unless it raises $5.5 million in capital by next week
The firm’s CEO cannot say how much energy its CETO 5 technology produces
One analyst says investors “would have to be a bit of a masochist” to reinvest

Carnegie is in the process of trying to raise up to $11.5 million in capital to pay creditors, including board member and former AFL commissioner Mike Fitzpatrick.
If it does not raise the minimum amount of $5.5 million by next Wednesday, the former renewable energy darling is facing the likely outcome of liquidation.
Its thousands of shareholders, predominantly small investors, are being encouraged to invest in the capital raising, which offers them four shares at a price of $0.001 for each share they hold.
Carnegie has been developing its prized CETO wave energy technology for more than 15 years and has attracted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars from both federal and state governments to commercialise the technology.

Cynics amongst you might be tempted to believe the reason the Carnegie CEO was so sketchy about the results of their CETO wave energy trial is because their technology doesn’t work. 
But this surely cannot be the case; After all, Carnegie received millions of dollars of government funding, and we all know how rigorous public sector oversight of taxpayer’s money is, especially when it comes to funding renewable energy projects.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately we’ve been hearing lots from desperate politicians suggesting that the US response to the spread of the COVID-19 virus has not been adequate.
Far worse in Europe
Here in Europe we’ve been hearing a lot about new cases arising on a daily basis, and when I compare the number of U.S.cases (February 29, 2020) to those reported here and in other countries, it’s hard to understand what all the commotion in the US is about. Things are far worse in Europe.
So far the US has reported 66 cases among a population of over 330 million. That translates to about 0.2 cases per million, despite the huge volume of travel between the US and Asia. In France and Germany the rate is 5 times higher (though they are doing a pretty good job fighting the spread). In Italy it’s 75 times greater!
Early travel restriction from China paying precious dividends
What follows is a table showing the top 20 countries reporting COVID-19 cases. They are listed according to the number of cases per one million inhabitants. The list starts with the countries with the lowest rates:

The U.S. and the U.K. lead the pack. The high success rate likely is in large part due to President Trump’s early decision to restrict air travel from China – a move for which he was loudly criticized not long ago. Now that decision has turned to to have been wise and has paid off.

South Korea, Bahrain and Singapore have a real problem along with China, where the virus is said to have originated.
Of course lots of factors are at play, and so the statistics above should be viewed merely as indicators. One local outbreak can change the stats fast.
The next challenge for the U.S. remains containing the pockets of infections that have been arising, some in not very well run places – like California. In these places it would be a wise idea to rapidly cancel public events, close schools and force workplaces to implement strict hygiene practices. I would even consider restricting interstate air travel from California for awhile under they get their house in order.
There’s no reason to panic as the death rate from COVID-19 is nothing like Ebola, SARS, or H5N1.
For those with a greater interest in pandemics, etc, I highly recommend the following book:

Climate change is making horses fat as it’s causing an abundance of grass to grow, top vet warns
Brendan McFadden
29 November 2019 • 4:39pm
Gillies Moffat, director of a veterinary centre in Hythe, Hampshire, said the wetter and warmer climate has meant the animal’s staple food has grown more rapidly than in the past.
Horses should be moved into bare paddocks, vets have said, because an abundance of grass caused by climate change is making them fat.
The vet warned a “significant” percentage of horses he treats are overweight because of a range of modern “socioeconomic pressures” including climate change.
It comes after the British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) found in a study of 792 horses last year that 31 per cent were overweight, with vets citing a lack of facilities such as stables and bare paddocks (48 per cent) as reasons.
Their report’s top recommendation to reducing their animal’s weight was keeping horses in bare paddocks and giving them a weighted food diet.
Mr Moffat believes as a result of the pressures horse owners are struggling to control their animals’ weight, leading to a number of painful physical conditions.
He said: “A significant percentage of the horses we see are overweight. It is partly a reflection on socioeconomic pressures.
“Owners are working longer hours so find regularly exercising their horses hard to do.
“Also, the term ‘good show condition’ has historically and subconsciously implied a more ’rounded’ horse rather than a fit well muscled horse.
“Warmer and wetter climates also mean greater grass availability.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn an interview with the Hamburg daily Abendblatt here, retired German climate researcher Prof. Hans von Storch commented on the global climate debate, saying “Greta’s message is ridiculous” and that “Greta Thunberg’s demand that we panic has something of an end of world sect.”

Dismisses “world doom” climate scenarios
According to the Abendblatt, Hans von Storch, the former director of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Centre for Materials and Coastal Research, warns in the interview of the consequences of global warming but at the same time “urges an objective debate and thinks little of the scenarios of world doom that are often drawn at present.”

Playing into the hands of the hard right
The retired professor also warns that “an increasing polarization on this topic could also harm democracy, and so benefit the right wing AfD party.
According to the Abendblatt, “von Storch criticizes Greta Thunberg and hersupporting  entourage harshly” and believes that her calls for people to get used to going without modern conveniences “to be of little use because it would hardly have any effects, but would have major disadvantages for the personal development of people.”
Doesn’t share doomsday views
When asked by the Abendblatt whether he shares the doomsday views of a “climate crisis” and that there needs to be an “uprising, or extinction”, von Storch says he does not share that outlook and reminded that today’s modern technology has made it possible for people to live by the millions in areas that would otherwise be inhospitable, like Phoenix, Arizona. “That was impossible in the past; today there are air conditioning systems.”
Selective listening
On Greta Thunberg’s demand that we “listen to the science!”, the award-winning German scientist slaps it down, hinting at a non-consensus among scientists: “She demands listening to scientists who should reinforce what she believes and says anyway.”

Dear Climate



So, how are you feeling? 



I thought it was time someone asked, given the constant abuse you receive these days.



Remember when all this started, decades ago now? When we humans first started questioning your ability to do your job, at least we blamed ourselves. We had the decency to call our concerns Anthropogenic Global Warming. In other words, we were blaming ourselves for upsetting you and throwing you off your game.



A while ago the scientists and various other concerned citizens realised that all their doomsday predictions about you weren’t coming to fruition, so they rebranded. (It’s a human thing we do when we want to raise money). We now call our lack of faith in you Climate Change. That must really burn your undies. 



I mean, has anyone asked you about how you feel about changing? How do you identify? Do you even want to change? 



Now, I have read a little bit of history. Not to “scientist” level of course, I’m just a bog-standard ignorant citizen, but from what I have read, you seem to like this whole ‘change’ thing, as you have been up and down and all over the place since, well, forever. 



You like it hot, you like it cold. You seem to be a well rounded individual capable of balancing your activities. You seem to know what the Earth needs from you and you go about making it happen. Of course, you have to balance your activities, giving the Earth a good old clean up when it’s necessary. 



The mere existence of us pesky humans, especially now that we have all this new-fangled technology, as well as your usual protagonists like earthquake, volcano and those occasional visitors from space, probably mean you have to work a bit harder at the moment, but history (that cool stuff I read about), shows you always come right, in your own time. 



So Climate, carry on. I trust you. I’m sorry about the accusatory name calling and for possibly making you feel like you just don’t know yourself anymore. Keep up the hard work. Thanks for not making the sea levels rise 20 metres over the past two decades like they said you would and for not melting all that pretty ice.



All the best, your biggest fan,



(name redacted for protection from the nutjobs)



Dear name redacted for protection from nutjobs,



I don’t know who you are but I really appreciate you reaching out and asking how I am feeling. I was starting to think that no one cared.



In all honesty, I am sick and tired of it. For millennia I have been working my butt off to keep the Earth in some kind of balance. Just when I had it under control, He goes and sends a bloody big rock flying through space to collide with Earth. Sometimes I think he does it just to screw things up and make me work harder. Do you have any idea how long it takes to get the balance right after being hit by a space rock? I didn’t think so.



Then there are all the design flaws (don’t tell him I said that); the earthquakes, the volcanoes. Some days I just want a lie in, but no, I must be on call to start the clean up after his planet has its little hissy fits. I mean, do you know how long it takes to clean up after a massive volcanic explosion? I didn’t think so.



Then along came those humans you refer to. Man, what a disaster. Not only do they pollute the hell out of their own home, they expect me to clean it up! Like, now. Then they have the audacity to think that they can control me, or worse, that I can’t do my job! Less of this, more of that, give climate a break, he can’t cope…. Give me a break? I have been cleaning this place up since day 1 and you lot think I choke up on some minor gas irritation? The cheek. I mean, OK, so it took me a while to clean up after that really big space rock hit a few million years ago and some animals died out, but I work at my own pace and it’s not my fault they were unable to adapt. 



Do you know how long it takes and how hard it is to bring balance back after a space rock hits you at 20, 000 km per hour? I didn’t think so.



And as for the identity crisis I am meant to be having, forget about it. I know what I am and I know my purpose. Like I was ever going to drown you lot, although it is really tempting sometimes. No, I will continue to do my job and it may not happen in your puny measurements of years, but I will keep the balance or if I have a bad day (centuries in your time), I will clean up afterwards, as I have always done.



I am Climate, and I love change. You humans might not and if that’s the case, naff off. 



Regards



Climate.



PS: Thanks for asking though, I really do appreciate it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChild abuse by German WDR 2 public broadcasting? Young schoolgirls taught to hate, made to sing “My grandma is an old environmental scumbag” because she drives an SUV, eats meat and takes cruises

WDR 2 broadcasting children’s song: “My grandma is an environmental scumbag!” Image: WDR 2
We all recall how at the UN, green wunderkind Greta Thunberg lambasted the older generations for allegedly ruining the planet, climate and even her future. She also threateningly warned that her generation “will be watching” us.
Greta’s generation would like to have everyone believe that all of today’s social ills have been caused by the an irresponsible generation which now needs to step aside.
Today’s young generational hostility in Europe has hit unprecedented levels, thanks to environmental radicalism and zealots in and out of the media.
Taught to hate
Note that these kids did not just become naturally hostile to its older generations on their own. They got plenty of help being taught to be so by hateful by extreme activists who have an environmental and tyrannical agenda.
The latest example of indoctrinated intolerance and hatred is brought to us by WDR 2 German public broadcasting, which on December 27th choreographed and proudly broadcast a children’s song with lyrics dehumanizing senior citizens – grandmothers in particular – as “old environmental scumbags”!

WDR 2 video. The new German generation of supremacists? Indoctrinated German schoolgirls singing about how their grandmothers are scumbags.
Featured is a chorus of smiling, young German schoolgirls singing: “Meine Oma ist ne alte Umweltsau” (My grandma is an old environmental scumbag) lambasting grandmas and the older generation supposedly because they use SUVs and fly to go on their holidays, and so are creating a global mess.
Loud backlash
The song, meant to environmentally indoctrinate kids, didn’t go down well with the usually patient German public, especially with the older generations, which demographically have become the country’s largest voting sector.

The song triggered harsh and controversial reactions, as among others recipients felt (and others) hurt and even looked down on,” reports bedeutungonline.de.
“Gee, it was just a little humor”
Needless to say, after some hesitation and weak attempts to defend or to play it all down, the song was taken offline in the night of December 28. Now the WDR 2 and green activists are falling all over themselves insisting it was just an innocent parody and they didn’t mean anything bad with it, and implied how it’s unfortunate some people can’t take a little joke.
Well, teaching kids to hate is no laughing matter – especially in a country with a very problem history.
What follows are the song’s text in English, so you can judge for yourself.
Meine Oma ist ne alte Umweltsau
My grandma rides a motorbike, a motorbike, a motorbike in the chicken coop.
That’s a thousand liters of super every month. My grandma is an old environmental scumbag.
My grandma says riding a motorcycle is cool…
She uses it as a wheelchair at the retirement home. My grandma is an old environmental scumbag.
My grandma drives to the doctor in an SUV.
She runs over two old ladies with a rollator, my grandma is an old environmental scumbag.
My grandma makes a cutlet, a cutlet, a cutlet every day.
Because discount meat costs next to nothing, my grandma is an old environmental scumbag.
My grandma doesn’t fly anymore, she’s purified, purified, purified. Instead, she now goes on a cruise ten times a year, my grandma is not an environmental scumbag. My grandma’s not an environmental scumbag.”
The song ends with the audio quote by Greta Thunberg: “We will not let you get away with this!”
The WDR 2, of course, was funded to produce this political rubbish and to commit this child abuse – through mandatory fees levied on every citizen in Germany.

Observational uncertainty, errors, biases, and estimation discrepancies in longwave radiation may be 100 times larger than the entire accumulated influence of CO2 increases over 10 years. This effectively rules out clear detection of a potential human influence on climate.
The anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis rides on the fundamental assumption that perturbations in the Earth’s energy budget – driven by changes in downward longwave radiation from CO2 — are what cause climate change.
According to one of the most frequently referenced papers advancing the position that CO2 concentration changes (and downward longwave radiation perturbations) drive surface temperature changes, Feldman et al. (2015) concluded there was a modest 0.2 W/m² forcing associated with CO2 rising by 22 ppm per decade.

Again, that’s a total CO2 influence of 0.2 W/m² over ten years.
In contrast, analyses from several new papers indicate the uncertainty and error values in downwelling (and outgoing) longwave radiation in cloudless environments are more than 100 times larger than 0.2 W/m².
In other words, it is effectively impossible to clearly discern a human influence on climate.

1.  Kim and Lee, 2019   Measurement errors of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) reach 11 W/m², more than 50 times larger than total CO2 forcing over 10 years. Cloud optical thickness (COT) and water vapor have “the greatest effect” on OLR – an influence of 2.7 W/m². CO2 must rise to 800 ppm to impute an influence of 1 W/m².

Image Source: Kim and Lee, 2019
2. Kato et al., 2018   Downward longwave radiation (DLR) responds to variability in water vapor and cloud. (CO2 isn’t mentioned in the paper as a factor influencing DLR.) CO2 rose by 20 ppm during 2005-2014, but total DLR was negative (-0.2 W/m²) during this decade, insinuating rising CO2 had no net warming climate impact. Uncertainty in DLR is 6 W/m² per year, whereas CO2 forcing is just 0.02 W/m² per year – 300 times smaller.

Image Source: Kato et al., 2018
3. Wild et al., 2019   Observations vs. model bias/discrepancy ranges in downward longwave radiation span between 22 W/m² to 26 W/m², which is 120 times larger than CO2’s total influence over 10 years.

4. Stephens et al., 2019   “Gross assumptions” must be made about cloud physics due to a lack of observations. Sources of error in models yield an uncertainty of ~80%. Models of cloud processes are 3-5 times discrepant from observations.

5. Frank, 2019    “An AGW signal … will never emerge from climate noise.” Cloud forcing “error is ±114 times larger than the annual average increase in GHG [greenhouse gas] forcing.” “A temperature signal from anthropogenic CO2 emissions (if any) cannot … be evidenced in climate observables.”

"**Driving through deserted streets past shuttered shops and restaurants, it seems, on the face of it, that normal life is on hold.**
To help in the war against an invisible foe, most of us are observing the guidelines, staying at home and battling boredom.
But, at FareShare Greater Manchester, there can be no let-up in the fight against food poverty.
""We're busier than ever,"" said Glynis Platt, one of the charity's long-standing volunteers.
""Demand is increasing, supply is increasing, yet half our staff have had to self-isolate.
""We'd normally have five or six people in this office. Now it's just me and Tony.""
Glynis, 68, has been helping out for eight years since retiring as a university librarian.
Instead of stepping back to protect herself during the virus crisis, she's just upped her hours.
""They tried to suggest that I'd be safer at home,"" she said.
""But how can I when there are people who can't get out or don't have the money to get food?""
**Ready Steady Cook**
FareShare operates by taking food waste to help those in need - the homeless, the vulnerable and those struggling to make ends meet. And now, people shielding from the virus.
Donations from food suppliers or supermarkets arrive at its base in New Smithfield Market, Openshaw. What comes in can change by the hour.
Five pallets of gammon steaks were delivered when it was announced the pubs would close. Today there's a surplus of mushrooms, melons and mayonnaise.
Like an industrial version of Ready Steady Cook, Glynis' job is match up the stock with the needs of 200 partners on the food poverty front line - charities, faith groups and food banks.
At the Church of the Apostles, the Revd Ellie Trimble is leading the fight to feed those in need in Miles Platting.
As FareShare drivers Duncan and Frank unload boxes of eggs, sausages and fruit juice, she explains how they have had to adapt since the restrictions.
""Normally, we run night shelters for the homeless, but we've had to close them now. With the virus, it's just not the best option for our guests.
""They've all been moved into hostels and hotels. But who's going to feed them?"" she said.
Sunday dinners at The Apostles have stopped too but, for Ellie and her team, the work goes on.
They're making 300 hot meals a day and 200 food packages a week sent out as part of the Manchester Community Response - a hub set up to support the city's most vulnerable.
The Mustard Tree in Ancoats, another battle-hardened charity, has been helping Manchester's rough sleepers for 25 years.
But, because of Covid-19, they have had to scrap free Friday hot meals for the homeless, said food manager Chris Davies.
""Before this, we were serving 2,000 meals a month, or 500 a week.
""Now we have had to go to making 90 food parcels a day. It's completely changed.""
Down the road in Audenshaw, St Anne's RC Primary School may be closed for lessons. But the need to feed hungry kids on free school meals has not gone away.
Teaching assistants Lisa Hutchinson and Lindsey Delahunt rely on food from FareShare to run a breakfast club and make up lunch boxes.
""They are a lifeline, an absolute lifeline. We couldn't do what we do, giving children the food and the fresh fruit they need, without them,"" said Lisa.
On the plus side, FareShare nationally has seen a surge in offers of help, thanks in part to a recent appeal on Sport Relief.
But just when they need the help most, the threat posed by coronavirus has tied their hands.
The number of people who can be inducted is limited, said volunteer manager Liz Lauder.
""We have to strike a balance between getting food deliveries in and keeping people safe,"" she explained.
""The warehouse is quite cramped so, keeping two metres apart.. it's difficult.""
Inside, a select group of pickers and packers are busy making up orders ready to go out the next day.
Among them, are final year Geography students Andrew Fowler and Emma Price, both
They both felt that, while they were fit and healthy, volunteering was something they could do.
""I just felt a bit useless [during the outbreak]. Like it was out of my control,"" said Emma.
""We've got a lot of free time since university shut down so, why not?""
Like many students, Andrew could have gone home to his parents but chose not to.
""I feel that Manchester's my home now,"" he said.
""And if you know people are going hungry, I think it's right that we stay and do what we can."""

In its new report on the risks from human‐​caused climate change, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) sets climate science back rather than “advancing” it. The report, counterfactuallytitled “What We Know,” is more an account of what the scientific community thought it knew about a decade ago than an up‐​to‐​date telling of current understanding.





Climate science moves in one direction, the AAAS moves in the other.



Not surprisingly, the group ignores the fact that climate science is moving in a direction that increasingly suggests that the risk of extreme climate change is lower than has been previously assessed. Instead, the AAAS continues to play up the chance of extreme outcomes with the intent of scaring us into taking action — action that would have little impact on either future climate change or the risks therefrom.



The AAAS largely appeals to its own authority in trying to persuade us to believe its conclusions and yet informs its authority with old and obsolete science.



Nowhere is this more true than in its justification for highlighting the risks of “abrupt climate change” and in its faith in the ability of climate models to provide reliable and informed guidance regarding the probability of extreme climate changes’ occurring in the future.



The new report asserts:



Below are some of the high‐​side projections and tail risks we incur by following the current path for CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Most of these projections derive from computer simulations of Earth and its climate system. These models apply the best understanding science has to offer about how our climate works and how it will change in the future. There are many such models and all of them have been validated, to varying degrees, by their ability to replicate past climate changes.



However, the best and most recent science shows the AAAS assessment to be outdated and badly misplaced. In fact, climate models have done remarkably _poorly_ in replicating the evolution of global temperature during the past several decades, and high‐​end climate‐​change scenarios from the models are largely unsupported by observations.



For example, in January, researchers John Fyfe and Nathan Gillett published an article in the prominent journal _Nature Climate Change_ that found that “global warming over the past 20 years is significantly less than that calculated from 117 simulations of the climate by 37 models.” And last year, scientists Peter Stott and colleagues published a paper in the journal _Environmental Research Letters_ that concluded that “the upper end of climate model temperature projections is inconsistent with past warming.”



A host of other prominent papers that have examined the sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse‐​gas emissions collectively suggest that not only is future global warming likely to be less than previously expected, but, and perhaps more important, the outside chance that it will be extremely large has shrunk dramatically. This position is further supported by new research that downplays the threat of abrupt climate change from Arctic methane release, a shutdown of the Gulf Stream, and rapid sea‐​level rise.



Instead of an informed report by the esteemed group focused on presenting what today’s best science tells us regarding the risks from extreme climate change and our ability to mitigate them, what we got from the AAAS was a textbook example of climate alarmism: link human‐​caused greenhouse‐​gas emissions to climate change, raise the possibility that climate change will be disastrous, and then tell us we have to act now to save ourselves.



The first part of the AAAS guide to climate alarm is certainly true: Human‐​caused greenhouse‐​gas emissions do put pressure on the climate to warm. But the most important details — to what degree and of what character — are still uncertain and are being intensely studied and debated.



The second part has been relegated to the realm of climate fantasy. Today’s leading science suggests that coming human‐​caused climate change is going to be less than expected, with a much‐​diminished associated risk of abrupt changes with catastrophic outcomes.



Which means that the third part — that immediate action is required to reduce the risk of extreme change — is largely inapplicable (and such action is likely to be ineffective to boot).



The new AAAS report runs up climate alarm but runs down climate science. The result is a misleading document that is aimed at influencing public policy. This is the situation that should be raising alarm.

A violent, active sun, as seen in ultraviolet light in October 2014—near solar maximum in its 11-year solar cycle. As the sun approaches solar minimum, scientists are trying to predict the timing and strength of the next solar maximum.
NASA/SDO/LMSAL
By Sarah ScolesMay. 30, 2019 , 2:00 PM
BOULDER, COLORADO—For all of February the sun is nearly spotless, a smooth circle filled in with a goldenrod crayon. It has been more than a decade since it was so lacking in sunspots—dark magnetic knots as big as Earth that are a barometer of the sun’s temperament. Below the surface, however, a radical transition is afoot. In 5 years or so, the sun will be awash in sunspots and more prone to violent bursts of magnetic activity. Then, about 11 years from now, the solar cycle will conclude: Sunspots will fade away and the sun will again grow quiet.
In early March, a dozen scientists descend on the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) here to predict when the sun will reach its peak, and how unruly it will become. As light reflects off snow caught in the trees and streams through the tall windows of a conference room, the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel comes to order. NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have sponsored these panels since 1989, aiming to understand what drives the sun’s 11-year cycles and assess methods for predicting them. But the exercise is not just academic: The military, satellite operators, and electric utilities all want to know what the sun has in store, because the flares and bursts of charged particles that mark solar maximum can damage their technologies.
Sunspots can be seen with the naked eye, but it wasn’t until the mid-1800s that astronomers realized they come and go on a rough schedule. They first appear at midlatitudes and then proliferate, migrating toward the equator over about 11 years. In 1848, Swiss astronomer Johann Rudolf Wolf published an account of the sunspot record, identifying 1755–66 as “Cycle 1,” the first period when counts were reliable. He then created a formula for counting the number of daily sunspots—a somewhat subjective technique that has evolved into a counting method used today to marry data sets across the centuries.
The cycles are capricious, however. Sometimes, the sun goes quiet for decades, with anemic sunspot counts across several cycles—as occurred during the 19th century’s so-called Dalton minimum. Such variations are what the scientists at NCAR have gathered to forecast. The problem is that no one—in this room or elsewhere—really knows how the sun works.
Most models snatch at reality, but none pieces together the whole puzzle. The last time the panel convened, in 2007, its scientists evaluated dozens of models and came up with a prediction that was far from perfect. It missed the timing of the maximum, April 2014, by almost a year, and also the overall weakness of the past cycle. This panel, a who’s who list of solar scientists, doesn’t know whether it will do better.
As the NCAR clock ticks toward the start time, the panelists sit in awkward silence, clutching their compostable coffee cups. They know what the next 4 days hold: fights over physics and intuition, belief and data, correlation and causation. Tensions shadow the gathering: Scott McIntosh, director of NCAR’s High Altitude Observatory (HAO) here, has an office above the meeting room and his own unorthodox view of what drives the solar cycle and how to predict it. But McIntosh, outspoken and provocative, has not been invited to be on the panel, although a collaborator will present the HAO’s research.
At 8:30 a.m., the panel’s earnest leader, Doug Biesecker—who works at NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center here and commutes by bike regardless of the weather—welcomes everyone to the task: sorting through the many models and coming to a consensus about the next cycle. “The mess that you get from the community needs to be synthesized into something that is ideally correct,” Biesecker says. “But you know, how can we know what’s going to be correct?”
They can’t.
As if to prove the point, 14 surprise sunspots appear, seething on the surface that had been so featureless for so long.
Even on its calmest days, the sun is roiling. Fueled by fusion in its core, the sun is a ball of hot, charged particles, or plasma, that churns constantly, generating electric currents that in turn induce magnetic fields. Deep inside the sun is a dense radiative zone, where photons slowly fight their way outward. At a certain point—in the outer third of the sun—the plasma cools enough to allow convection, a boiling motion that carries energy toward the surface. In this zone, the sun rotates differentially: faster at the equator than the poles. The shearing motions that result stretch and twist the magnetic fields, strengthening them—a process that somehow affects the 11-year cycle. The tangled field lines sometimes burst through the convective zone and jut out from the surface, forming sunspots.
The sun’s ebb and flow affects Earth. Its upper atmosphere absorbs the sun’s ultraviolet rays, which dim slightly at solar minimum. That causes the atmosphere to cool and shrink, reducing friction for low-flying satellites. In calm solar cycles, operators assume their satellites will remain in orbit for longer—and because the same goes for space junk, the risk of a collision goes up. The sun’s magnetic field also weakens at solar minimum, which poses another threat to satellites. The weakened field rebuffs fewer galactic cosmic rays, high energy particles that can flip bits in satellite electronics.
At solar maximum, in contrast, the sun heats and inflates Earth’s upper atmosphere, and it often flares up and unleashes its own particles. They are not as energetic as the galactic cosmic rays, but they come in a flash flood. At solar max, Biesecker says, these “coronal mass ejections” of charged particles are 10 times as frequent as at minimum. Hours or days after the sun spits them out, particles rush into Earth’s magnetic field, provoking geomagnetic storms that can last for days. The storms can disrupt communications, interrupt spacecraft and missile tracking, and skew GPS measurements. They can also induce powerful currents in electric grids, which can destroy transformers and other equipment. Air crews at high altitudes, particularly near the poles, can be showered with the sun’s energetic particles—a cancer risk.
All of which adds to the practical importance of the panel’s forecasts. “If you design a satellite for a 10- or 12-year life, you need to consider the cycle,” says Michael Martinez, vice president of mission operations at DigitalGlobe in Westminster, Colorado, which makes high-resolution imaging orbiters. Designers need to be sure a satellite has enough propellant to combat the friction of an expanding atmosphere as the sun approaches maximum, and they need to shield its electronics from solar particles.
Most worrisome is the prospect of a major solar storm, such as the Carrington Event of 1859. During that storm, the sun ejected billions of tons of charged particles, causing aurorae as far south as the Caribbean and generating currents in telegraph lines powerful enough to shock operators. Today, the effect of such an event on computers and communications would be dire. Financial transaction systems could collapse. Power and water could easily go out. “It probably would be The Hunger Games pretty soon,” McIntosh says.
If you design a satellite for a 10- or 12-year life, you need to consider the cycle.

McIntosh doesn’t question the need to prepare, but he is skeptical of the panel’s approach. In fact, he believes its very premise—predicting the rise and fall of sunspots—is off-base. Sunspots, and the cycle itself, are just symptoms of a still-mysterious story playing out inside the sun.
Lika Guhathakurta, a panel observer from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California, agrees. “Sunspot is not a physical index of anything,” she says, after the morning’s introductory talks. “So the fact that we have used it as a proxy in itself kind of presents a problem.” Using sunspots—a side effect, not a cause—to predict the sun’s future behavior is like trying to divine the germ theory of disease by looking at a runny nose, she and McIntosh think.
But because the panelists have convened specifically to predict sunspot numbers, they soldier on, reviewing about 60 models over the next 4 days. Each predicts the number of sunspots at solar maximum, as well as the timing of minimum and maximum.

"**Businesses are not given a zero food hygiene rating for ""bad paperwork"" and ""filthy"" premises can be shut down immediately, a food safety officer has said.**
Peter Cole, lead environmental health officer in food safety at Pembrokeshire council, said myths circulate about the ""scores on the doors"" system.
The Food Standards Agency, and Mr Cole, say the system has improved standards.
But, Mr Cole added, a zero rating reflects failures across the board.
""To get a zero, there would be things like cross-contamination between raw meat and ready-to-eat products, pest infestations, it really is the worst level of compliance and they are very few and far between,"" he said.
In November 2013, Wales became the first UK nation to require food outlets to display their inspection ratings \- and following its success, the FSA says it should extend to England, with plans to be submitted for ministerial consideration in 2020.
The proportion of businesses with a rating of five has increased by 24 percentage points since the first ratings were issued in 2013, compared to 17 percentage points in England over the same period.
According to the FSA's website, 34 premises in Wales have a food hygiene score of zero.
It said it should be possible for all food businesses, no matter on their size or nature, to get a rating of five and 94% of respondents to a survey in Wales reported having seen a ratings sticker - meaning customers are noticing.
Mr Cole, who has worked in environmental health for 27 years, said the ratings system has ""drastically"" improved standards.
He is also a member of the Wales Food Safety Expert Panel and the Wales Steering Group for Food Hygiene Ratings, both of which ""are involved in ensuring that food safety enforcement and food hygiene ratings are carried out effectively and consistently in Wales"".
They give a snapshot of an establishment's standards at the time of an inspection - with the FSA saying it is businesses' responsibility to comply with those standards at all times.
If hygiene is very good and the business fully complies with the law, five is the top of the scale and the highest score they can achieve. They must do well in three areas:
A zero indicates failures across all three areas.
If businesses are awarded a score lower than five, the local authority officer will explain what action they can take to improve.
""It's another myth that somewhere with a low score is filthy and we issue a rating and walk away, when we should close it down,"" Mr Cole said.
""We always will go back and ensure issues are remedied.""
Businesses have to apply to be rated again prior to the next scheduled inspection, so even if the improvements are made, this may not be immediately reflected in their score, Mr Cole said.
But if somewhere poses a risk to public health, part or all of the business can be shut down until it is made safe.
""In a long career you come across all sorts of things,"" Mr Cole said.
""Rat infestations, mice infestations, cockroach infestations which are very rare, but it does still happen, and we have to take immediate action.
""In others, it's just lack of knowledge and awareness of cross-contamination which can be alarming sometimes.""
The frequency of inspections depends on the potential risk to health - so a small retailer selling pre-packed food may only be seen once every two years, while hospitals serving food to vulnerable patients may be visited as often as every six months.
If a council receives a complaint from a customer or organisation about a business which suggests standards are not being maintained, it may pay an unscheduled visit and issue a new rating.
Businesses can appeal their ratings - though Mr Cole said few do, preferring to ""knuckle down"" and address the issues.
Very rarely, Mr Cole said.
""We turn up, we don't make appointments. We try and get a picture of what's going on and it does throw some people, but there are good reasons for it.
""But if people are only working very occasionally for example in a domestic kitchen where cake-making happens very rarely, if we've not got too many concerns and we don't think they're trying to pull the wool over our eyes, there are occasions we would have to make an appointment.""
Inspectors do not look at the quality of the food and service, culinary skill, presentation or comfort.
""We look at hygiene practices: Are they washing their hands regularly? Is food stored at the right temperature?"" Mr Cole said.
They will check whether vegetables, fruit and salads are washed thoroughly, frozen foods defrosted safely, and ensure staff are aware of allergy hazards.
""We look at structure, the condition of the premises, the walls, floors and ceilings. Can the equipment be effectively cleaned? Is there the right amount of sinks?
""You hear 'I got a one, but it's just because of paperwork' like it's an excuse, but that's quite deliberately a slant on the scheme.""
But Mr Cole says businesses need to be able to demonstrate things like ""cooking temperatures, how quickly things are getting into fridges, the temperatures of the fridges"".
In Wales and Northern Ireland, displaying the score a business is awarded on the premises is mandatory.
If a business does not display the score, or misleads the public into thinking its score is higher than it is, it can be issued with a fine, and if problems continue it may be taken to court - and several owners have been prosecuted.
While prosecuting is not done lightly, Mr Cole said it will be done when necessary.
In general, however, he says most businesses have embraced the inspection system, and even use visits as an opportunity to ask advice.
""We do get a whole range of responses, some people are welcoming, some look forward to us coming and other people are a bit more 'oh not them again'.
""Generally people are used to it now.""
An owner can also end up banned from running a food business, with the FSA keeping a list which is shared with all local authorities in Wales, England and Northern Ireland."

" Op-ed by Michelle Stirling © 2019Chatelaine’s Apr/May 2019  “Green” edition is filled with tips, like “How to Convert a Climate Skeptic.”  That’s an article by the edition’s guest editor/curator Dr. Katharine Hayhoe.  She’s married to an evangelical pastor, so conversion therapy appears to be her scientific method of choice for talking climate. That, and feelings.  Dr. Hayhoe was in Calgary on March 6, 2018 as part of last year’s IPCC Cities Conference.  She tried to scare us all with the thought of a warmer winter.  She told the assembled crowd at Telus SPARK that we should rely on feelings about climate change, not facts and evidence. In her Chatelaine article, Dr. Hayhoe claims weather extremes are more frequent, but this claim is not supported by the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) Special Report on Extreme Weather.  In that report, as confirmed by climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry in her 2014  US Senate testimony, extreme weather is not ascribed to human-causation, and such events are not increasing.Though Dr. Hayhoe claims ‘the reality is that climate change is affecting us today’ – that’s a silly comment. Climate changes all the time.  Climate change is measured in 30, 50, 100 and millennial timescales, so most of us don’t live long enough to experience climate change. As Dr. John Harper FGSA,FGAC, PGeol., former director of the Geological Survey of Canada, explains in this video clip, most politicians can’t define climate change; they certainly can’t stop it. Neither can you.https://youtu.be/e6UHTa5hzq0Dr. Hayhoe’s curated magazine gives a page to Tzeporah Berman, who spouts off about stopping pipelines to save the planet, but meanwhile her bio says she lives in Vancouver and likes to take trips to Cortes Island to kayak. How green!However, the only way you can get there is by fossil fueled transport. BC Ferries runs one of the largest ferry systems in the world – all on fossil fuels.But the real prize is Chris Turner’s article about Bornholm, a tiny Danish island with some ~40,000 residents and 600,000 annual visitors.  Based on his 2013 experience visiting this island, Turner tells us “The Future is Greener than you Think.”   He talks about his visit to Bornholm, an island dotted with wind farms, solar panels and EVs, saying: “Imagine an enviable quality of life, all without a single molecule of carbon dioxide sent skyward to compound the global catastrophe of climate change.”A closer look at Bornholm shows that it has the world’s longest submarine (underwater) 60 kV cable of ~ 46 kilometers, connecting the island to Swedish nuclear and hydro power.  That can supply all the power for the island. Laying such a cable involves fossil fuels, and cash. Lots of it.I could not find the original cost of the undersea cable but estimates of the present cost of such lines are about £100 Sterling per metre or about $6,000,000 USD for 46 000 metres. The cost of installation can be between £2-£5 million per kilometer (46 km), or $156,896,646.82 to $392,241,617.05 Cdn.[1] Typically, the cost of such a line is borne by the consumer on top of the cost of the electricity, though since the island is being used as a kind of renewables laboratory, the cable was funded 50% by the EU and 50% by corporations involved in testing related renewables energy systems. Imagine that tab if spread over the ~40,000 residents alone!There is even a LEGO video clip of life on Bornholm in the new Utopia.https://youtu.be/60fRJAaMpLcIn 2010, Bornholm was still powered largely by diesel generators, coal, incineration, and biomass. [2]  Wind turbines were added between 1992 and up until 2008.  They provide about 30% of their nameplate capacity.However, more recently additional wind turbines were voted down as residents felt it was infringing on the quaint, historic nature of the island.Temps can get to minus 17C there in winter, and no surprise that this 2007 report shows there is a spike in power demand in winter, the authors suspecting this is due to electric space heaters.[3]No matter what, Bornholm is an interesting experiment, but not representative of the real world.Chris Turner writes: “Imagine driving to work, plugging the car’s battery pack back into the grid and brokering the sale of any power you don’t need at a profit, as demand rises during the day.”This is highly unlikely.  Most electric vehicles have severely limited range because of battery power limitations, something that is exacerbated by extremely cold temperatures such as those in Canada.  Far more likely you would have to plug in to recharge or to ‘precondition’ your car before leaving work (i.e. warm up the passenger cabin).[4]  Furthermore, Canada does not have enough hydro power to support the goal of a Zero Emissions transportation sector.  We’d need to build many more power dams, as Kent Zehr, P. Eng. points out in this power point. Such projects take about 20 years from inception to completion (barring activists blocking development), cost billions of dollars each, and we have no such plans on the table in Canada. [5] (Does not include cost of transmission and distribution upgrades).Yes, going further down this EV path might leave us broke and in the dark.Aside from Turner exaggerating the likelihood of living a Bornholm Utopian life any time soon, he also continues the climate catastrophe refrain of many activists.  He states that “Millions will lose their homes and livelihoods and even lives before anything like a stable climate re-emerges.” What ‘stable climate’ is he talking about?During the Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 AD) civilization flourished in Europe, but there were still extreme weather events.Anno 1134: Extreme drought in the North of France. In June, a hot wind dries Normandy. Everywhere thirsty people flow into streams and rivers and many drown. In September in Normandy and elsewhere, many towns and villages were completely destroyed by fire, like Le Mans, Chartres, Alençon, Nogent and Verneuil. The Sambre dries up in Namur. Tsunami on the coasts of the North Sea in September or October. One night, the sea invades the land to a depth of 7 miles, stunning villages and homes. The disaster affects Flanders and neighboring countries. In December, major floods in Normandy. Floods reach the roofs of houses. Anno 1135: Great heat and widespread drought in France and England. “It was so great that the land was burning hot at various locations in France.” Pastures and fields are grilled and there followed a great famine. Rivers and lakes are dry. Heather in the mountains and forests spontaneously ignited by sunlight. In Germany, the Rhine is almost entirely dry and can be crossed on foot. The forests are on fire. December 1st – England was swept away by a hurricane. Originally sourced from Belgotopia “Evenments” https://belgotopia.com/2015/02/27/sur-les-evenements-climatiques-extremes-1/  Here you can see a live webcam of the Rhine River. Things look fine and stable today.https://www.bafg.de/EN/06_Info_Service/03_Webcam_en/webcam_en.htmlAt the same time that Europe basked in mostly stable, balmy warmth of the Medieval Warm Period (which was about as warm or warmer than today’s temperatures), the south western United States of today, in the region of California, experienced 100- and 200-year droughts!In fact, regarding the Current Warm Period, according to climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry, climate and weather conditions have been pretty stable since the Great Depression, with some more extreme periods in the ‘50s and ‘70s, but people suffer from ‘weather amnesia’ and they forget.Following the Medieval Warm Period, there was a plunge into the erratic climate of the Little Ice Age, when women were accused of ‘weather cooking with the help of Satan’ and burned at the stake.  Astrophysicist Dr. Sallie Baliunas was Friends of Science Society’s first scientific adviser and speaker at our Second Annual Event in 2002.[6]  She recounts what happened to heretics then in this video.https://youtu.be/wcAy4sOcS5MChillingly, a similar thing happened to her career in contemporary times because she holds the view that the sun drives climate change.[7] Being a female scientist and having a mind of your own (and evidence) on climate science is verboten.How do Chatelaine feminists feel about that?Robert Lyman takes a look at the “Climate Hysteria – The Elusive Search for a Simple Response” – of the kind Turner is serving up. But when it comes to energy issues, there is no easy solution, no matter how much people may try to scare taxpayers into opening their wallets.[8]One of those solutions Turner mentions is the ‘simple, unsexy climate-saving tools’ claiming Canada could achieve a third of its emissions targets by simply implementing efficiency measures.[9]  One element of that is housing retrofits, but as Robert Lyman points out, that’s not so cheap or simple either, not to mention all this work requires new materials and lots of energy to implement. [10]It may be that as a Roger’s Media outlet, Chatelaine is just trying to please NEI Investments which, in 2015, directed the corporation to toe the party line on Paris Agreement and climate.“We met with Rogers in June 2015 to follow-up on our climate change dialogue. In light of theupcoming Paris Climate Conference and negotiations on global climate policy, we encouragedRogers to take a leadership position by expressing public support for climate policy and carbonpricing in Canada. We highlighted several initiatives, including the work of the EcofiscalCommission and CDP’s Road to Paris commitments, and the company indicated it would considersuch opportunities. We discussed the progress industry and provincial governments are making onadvancing climate policy.”– NEI Investments [bold emphasis added]NEI Investments has also “engaged” with the major banks of Canada. And it may be that, as one of the people involved in writing Smart Prosperity’s pitch for ‘green’ that Turner is just continuing a train of thought, as Smart Prosperity is keen to push climate bonds, and these rely on climate catastrophe for their viability.[11]But the female demographic who are the largest readers of Chatelaine, are being led astray by this ‘green’ edition, in my opinion, for all the reasons stated above.Feel free to disagree with me.

"**Greek authorities have charged an asylum-seeker after his six-year-old son drowned when the boat they were using to cross from Turkey capsized.**
The Afghan man is accused of having endangered his son's life - reportedly the first such case in the country.
The dinghy sank off Samos Island on 8 November. The man made it to shore and sought help, but his son's lifeless body was found the next morning.
Thousands of migrants have arrived in Greece from Turkey so far this year.
More than 1,400 have landed on Samos island alone, the UN says.
The 25-year-old Afghan father could face a six-year prison sentence if found guilty of putting his son's life at risk.
His lawyer told the BBC that although a distress call went out to the coastguard at midnight, they only sent a vehicle to look for the body six hours later.
The lawyer argues that police should investigate that delay - not the actions of the father, who went into the town to seek help after making it to land.
A coastguard spokesman said the initial search did not find the vessel - and that darkness had hindered their work.
In 2015, hundreds of thousands of migrants - mainly fleeing conflict in Afghanistan and Syria - tried to reach Europe via Turkey. Hundreds downed in attempted crossings to Greek islands.
A year later, Turkey agreed to stop allowing migrants to reach the EU, in return for funds from the bloc to help it manage the huge numbers of refugees it hosts.
But since then, tensions between the EU and Turkey have flared on various issues. Although the EU promised more aid, Turkey was unimpressed and earlier this year briefly opened its borders with Greece.
A new surge in arrivals exacerbated tensions on Aegean islands, where asylum seekers have been living in overcrowded camps and many residents resent their presence.
In September more than 12,000 people were left homeless by a fire that destroyed a camp on Lesbos island. Four Afghan migrants have been charged with starting it.
The government is determined not to allow the country to be seen as a gateway to Europe and is actively deterring new arrivals."

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019.Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here.After recently giving presentations on the economic effects of Canadian governmental policies on climate change, I have been asked to provide a single number that captures the cost for the average person or family. I understand, from a communications perspective, the advantage of offering a single, simple answer that will stick in the minds of an audience. However, there are important pitfalls in offering a simplistic and potentially misleading response. Indeed, the question itself reveals a lack of understanding of the magnitude and pervasiveness of the actions now being taken by the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, and a lack of information upon which to base such a calculation. Perhaps examining why such a calculation is so difficult will offer insights into the answer.The Range of CostsGovernmental measures to “mitigate” climate change by reducing present and future greenhouse gas emissions include the following.Taxes on energy consumption (e.g. carbon dioxide taxes).Tax exemptions for favoured industries (e.g. tax breaks for solar, wind, ethanol and electric vehicle producers and purchasers).Regulations that require companies to change what they produce (e.g. regulation of vehicle emissions and appliances).Regulations that restrict what companies and consumers can produce and purchase (e.g. regulations forcing utilities to cease using coal-fired power plants or to pay above-market rates to renewable energy producers).Regulations that shift costs from favoured industries to the general taxpayer or electricity ratepayer (e.g. rate changes caused by policy directives or legislated restrictions on local government’s ability to impose property taxes on industrial wind power).Subsidies to favoured producers (e.g. grants to renewable energy producers).Subsidies to favoured consumers (e.g. EV purchasers, aboriginal communities).Electricity policies that require utilities to build uneconomic transmission lines and “smart” transmission and distribution systems.Biased procurement policies that require government departments to exclusively buy “green” energy and to pay above-market prices to favoured producers.Research and development, technology demonstration, and assistance in commercialization that benefit only renewable energy producers.Funding for communications programs to promote climate hysteria.Funding to environmental non-governmental organizations to fund pro-mitigation policies and to disparage the fossil fuel industry.Zoning and other regulations to promote densification of urban areas.Others.Recall that there are at least 600 of these different measures so well known that the Government of Canada reports on them bi-annually to the United Nations.The federal government might be expected to publish a comprehensive list of its own programs and related expenditures on climate change, but it does not. An analyst seeking information on federal expenditures must hunt through a large number of search terms including “climate change”, “sustainable development”, “green initiatives”, “clean energy” and others, and the inventories are not complete.In a May, 2018 collaborative report by the federal and provincial governments’ Auditor Generals (AGs), the AGs observed that no one has a complete record of all the programs in place, that the number of programs at the municipal level appear to be growing quickly, and that there is very poor coordination among governments in administering these programs. The AGs also observed that there is no way to measure these programs’ total cost and cost-effectiveness, nor their extent of overlap and duplication. See the report here:http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_otp_201803_e_42883.htmlThis is not the whole of it. A major component of current climate change mitigation in Canada is the efforts of various interest groups and governments to block the construction of essential pipeline infrastructure. This infrastructure would allow Canadian oil and natural gas to reach export markets. Further, these groups seek to impair the access of Canadian oil producers to investment capital. These efforts, as assisted by the federal government’s changes in the regulation of energy infrastructure, have directly cost oil producers $20 billion in forgone income in 2018 alone. This dollar value is according to the Royal Bank of Canada and the Fraser Institute. There are no authoritative estimates of the loss of capital and the flight of Canadian oil industry capital to the United states; one rough estimate is $60 billion to date.The Difficulties in Measuring Costs to the EconomyWhen one measures costs, the first question is “to whom?” The present climate policy measures entail costs to taxpayers, electricity ratepayers, consumers, industries, firms, and the economy as a whole.Someone’s costs may be another’s revenues, so economists try to measure the changes in income at the national level. To do this, however, one must have available a general equilibrium model of the Canadian economy and be able to use the right assumptions and the right inputs to calculate the effects on Gross Domestic Product over time. Further, one must have a way to isolate the effects of climate policies from all other influences on the economy. No authoritative source has yet published such an analysis.General equilibrium analysis, moreover, is not without its faults and limitations. The underlying assumption is that economies always trend towards an equilibrium. It follows that a disruption (e.g. loss of an industry or firm) in one region will quickly and smoothly be accounted for, through the efficient adjustment of market forces, by increases in other parts of the economy. In reality, such adjustments are often long and painful.How Does One Value the Political Consequences?Approximately half of Canada’s GHG emissions occur in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The GHG emissions that are associated with emissions-intensive resource industries in the rural and small-town areas of the rest of Canada account for about one-sixth of Canada’s GHG emissions. Therefore about two-thirds of Canada’s regions are directly threatened by policies that seek to sharply increase the cost of fossil fuels and to “phase out” the industries that operate there. Canada’s resource industries just happen to be the sectors with the highest productivity and highest contributions to Canada’s balance of trade.The systematic undercutting of the Alberta and Saskatchewan economies will not be accepted by the people of these provinces. These provinces’ governments will use every available policy and legal instrument to oppose the “decarbonization” of the Canadian economy, which is the ultimate goal of federal climate policy. The threat of secession is now generally underestimated and discounted in central Canada. How would one estimate the value to Canada of losing two provinces along with their resource revenues that currently go to Ottawa?Averages MisleadThe costs of Canada’s climate policies are borne in very different ways by individuals, families and firms. These differences are based on many factors including location, energy consumption, available energy choices, and incomes. A small family that receives a substantial rebate on carbon dioxide taxes may not be much affected, unless the family is located in Alberta and the breadwinner loses his/her job as a result of climate policies. A company that sells insulation services may do well, while one that operates in an energy-intensive industry with low margins may be forced out of business. Generally, those who live in Alberta and Saskatchewan suffer very adverse effects, while those who live in Quebec may suffer less so, at least until the emissions reductions targets move high enough to affect them as well. A major manufacturer may be forced to raise its costs above those of its foreign competitors, and thus decide to relocate its operations and emissions to a different country.Bottom LineWhether we consider financial costs or economic costs, no one knows the total costs of current and future climate policies. These costs are pervasive, immense, and growing. One can cite individual anecdotes concerning very large figures, such as the fact that carbon dioxide taxes will impose on consumers an additional cost of at least $24 billion per year by 2020. This number may grow to $80 billion per year by 2030. However, any attempt to condense all costs of current and future climate policies into a single value is fraught with uncertainty and error. Any number that one might produce would lack an authoritative foundation and could be easily challenged, and thus lack credibility.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

UN 30 years fake warnings
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Global warming was not reversed by the year 2000 – yet we are still here.
U.N. Predicts Disaster if Global Warming Not CheckedPETER JAMES SPIELMANN June 30, 1989UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000. Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ″eco- refugees,′ ′ threatening political chaos, said Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, or UNEP. He said governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control. As the warming melts polar icecaps, ocean levels will rise by up to three feet, enough to cover the Maldives and other flat island nations, Brown told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday. Coastal regions will be inundated; one-sixth of Bangladesh could be flooded, displacing a fourth of its 90 million people. A fifth of Egypt’s arable land in the Nile Delta would be flooded, cutting off its food supply, according to a joint UNEP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study. ″Ecological refugees will become a major concern, and what’s worse is you may find that people can move to drier ground, but the soils and the natural resources may not support life. Africa doesn’t have to worry about land, but would you want to live in the Sahara?″ he said. …Read more: https://www.apnews.com/bd45c372caf118ec99964ea547880cd0

This extremely powerful eruption occurred in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster, which is located about 390 million light-years from Earth. Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravity, containing thousands of individual galaxies, dark matter, and hot gas.

Scientists studying a distant galaxy cluster have discovered the biggest explosion seen in the Universe since the Big Bang.
The blast came from a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy hundreds of millions of light-years away.
It released five times more energy than the previous record holder.
Professor Melanie Johnston-Hollitt, from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said the event was extraordinarily energetic.
“We’ve seen outbursts in the centres of galaxies before but this one is really, really massive,” she said.
“And we don’t know why it’s so big.
“But it happened very slowly–like an explosion in slow motion that took place over hundreds of millions of years.”
The explosion occurred in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster, about 390 million light-years from Earth.
It was so powerful it punched a cavity in the cluster plasma–the super-hot gas surrounding the black hole.
Lead author of the study Dr Simona Giacintucci, from the Naval Research Laboratory in the United States, said the blast was similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which ripped the top off the mountain.
“The difference is that you could fit 15 Milky Way galaxies in a row into the crater this eruption punched into the cluster’s hot gas,” she said.
Professor Johnston-Hollitt said the cavity in the cluster plasma had been seen previously with X-ray telescopes.
But scientists initially dismissed the idea that it could have been caused by an energetic outburst, because it would have been too big.
“People were sceptical because the size of outburst,” she said. “But it really is that. The Universe is a weird place.”
The researchers only realised what they had discovered when they looked at the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster with radio telescopes.
“The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove,” said co-author Dr Maxim Markevitch, from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.
“This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here.”
The discovery was made using four telescopes; NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, ESA’s XMM-Newton, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Western Australia and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India.
Professor Johnston-Hollitt, who is the director of the MWA and an expert in galaxy clusters, likened the finding to discovering the first dinosaur bones.
“It’s a bit like archaeology,” she said.
“We’ve been given the tools to dig deeper with low frequency radio telescopes so we should be able to find more outbursts like this now.”
The finding underscores the importance of studying the Universe at different wavelengths, Professor Johnston-Hollitt said.
“Going back and doing a multi-wavelength study has really made the difference here,” she said.
Professor Johnston-Hollitt said the finding is likely to be the first of many.
“We made this discovery with Phase 1 of the MWA, when the telescope had 2048 antennas pointed towards the sky,” she said.
“We’re soon going to be gathering observations with 4096 antennas, which should be ten times more sensitive.”
“I think that’s pretty exciting.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is an example of how German decisionmakers go about protecting the environment: chop down hundreds of acres of forests and pour thousands of tons on concrete reinforced with hundreds of tons of steel on huge beds of gravel, all hauled in by hundreds of truck loads. Then install skyscraper tall industrial bird-killing monstrosities.
Result: an idyllic forest gets turned into an industrial complex that can be seen and felt from miles away – in order to protect the climate.
It would be a gruesome task to calculate the environmental and CO2 budget for the following described wind park project in the Münsterwald forest near the western Germany city of Aachen.
When finished it will consist of seven 200-meter tall turbines in what once was a natural, forested area and undisturbed biotope.
To get to the site, a “gigantic” swatch of forest had to be cut through the heart of the forest. According to the ZDF public television report (see below), “alone here 1000 trees had to be cut down.

Largescale deforestation
And according top Rainer Hülsheger of the state association for natural landscape protection: “At least 12,000 square meters of forest needed to be cleared in order to build one wind turbine alone.”

Angry environmentalists say that the forest simply was never even suitable for a wind park to begin with. Yet, the ZDF reports how the forest belongs to the city, and so the revenue-generating project got the green light.
Threat to endangered species
The ZDF report shows the sheer insanity that it takes to install wind turbines in the middle of forests, and how they endanger rare bird species such as the black storch and red kite.
Entire biotope severely damaged
For the wind project in Euskirchen, according to the ZDF (2:35), “The planned 24 wind turbines in the co called Kammerwald cut through an entire biotope system from Rheinland towards Belgium.”
Forest is the best place, says Aachen city offical
Why are the turbines being installed in the forests? According to Aachen city official Elmar Wiezorek, placing the turbines in fields posed an even greater environmental hazard: “The forest had the least problems.”
But Herbert Klinkenberg of a citizens initiative protecting the wind projects calls it all “a catastrophe”. ZDF sums it up: “Climate protection at the expense of nature.”

The Cato Institute’s Center for the Study of Science has released the author’s proof version of its major report examining the potential impacts of climate change in the United States. It’s called _Addendum: Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States_ (the final copy will be available shortly).   
  
Our document grew from our desire to show how the government report upon which ours is based could have/should have looked if the original scientists involved had included a more thorough (less narrow) review of the scientific literature, and had not been obviously predisposed towards climate change doom and gloom.   
  
Our report refers to itself as an “Addendum” to draw attention to the fact that the original 2009 report from the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program (USGCRP) was incomplete, insufficient and badly in need of an update to include both scientific results published since its release and to include scientific research that was overlooked or ignored in that original document.   
  
In general, our report, while pointing out that the earth’s temperature is rising and that human activities play a role, paints a more modest picture of climate change and its effects in the U.S. and emphasizes our adaptive capacity to handle a large amount of change in virtually all aspects of society. The overall tone of the Cato report is an optimistic one—a stark contrast to the pessimism that pervades the USGCRP report.   




**USGCRP Authors React**   
  
Our report has drawn ire from climate change alarmists, as well as from a subset of the group of scientists which authored the original USGCRP report. We note that those who signed the group note make up barely a third of the 31 scientists who authored the USGCRP report. Eleven USGCRP co-authors released a statement airing their discontent in which they said: 



As authors of [the USGCRP] report, we are dismayed that the report of the Cato Institute, _ADDENDUM: Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States_ , expropriates the title and style of our report in such a deceptive and misleading way. The Cato report is in no way an addendum to our 2009 report. It is not an update, explanation, or supplement by the authors of the original report. Rather, it is a completely separate document lacking rigorous scientific analysis and review.



In fact, one of the primary ways that our report _intended_ to make its point was by mimicking the style of the USGCRP report (in this case, imitation is _not_ a form of flattery). It is what the government report would have looked like had the authors been more open-minded and inclusive of the scientific literature. In places where it was determined the original authors had done an adequate job, those sections were included verbatim, which we were certainly explicit about! This was all clearly explained in the “About this Report” section of our report (p. 8; analogous to their p. 7): 



This _Addendum_ is similar in format to the 2009 USGCRP report, allowing a facile reference for science that was omitted. In some places, we have moved text verbatim from the 2009 report to this _Addendum_.



 _That’s “deceptive or misleading_?” The front cover of our report, smack in the middle of the page it says “Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute.” _That’s deceptive or misleading_? The back cover is completely blank except for the prominent Cato Institute logo. There is a letter of introduction (p. 3 in both documents) written and signed by (then) Cato President Edward Crane. And “The Cato Institute” is included in the running header of every left-hand page in the document.   
  
_Deceptive or misleading_? All of this led the world’s most prominent and popular climate blogger Anthony Watts to state “How anyone with even limited intelligence could get the idea that the report is from the US Government/NOAA is truly laughable, because if they can’t read “Cato Institute” clearly printed on the front and back cover, then they probably aren’t capable of reading and interpreting the original report either.”   
  
As to the USGCRP co-authors statement that the Cato report is not “an addendum...an update, explanation, or supplement by the authors of the original report” this is certainly true. The original authors had nothing whatsoever to do with our report. In fact, the original authors substantively ignored virtually every comment in a 77-page single-spaced (24,958 word) review of their draft document that we submitted in August, 2008—which is why they are now seething over our _Addendum_ , which is partially based on that review. It is their very poor job, which is so misleading in spots that it appears intentional, that required a subsequent addendum, update, explanation, and supplement, or whatever you chose to call it.   
  
And as to their claim that our report is “lacking rigorous scientific analysis and review,” any reader of our report will find the text to be well documented and derived primarily from the well-accepted material. Our report describes its source material this way: 



This _Addendum_ is primarily based upon the peer-reviewed scientific literature, peer-screened professional presentations, and publicly-available climate data. We include literature through the beginning of 2012, which of course could not be in the 2009 [original USGCRP] report. But there are also a plethora of citations from 2008 or earlier that were not included in the US­GCRP document. Why that is the case is for others to determine.



These sources are no less rigorous (and certainly more inclusive) than those assessed/included by the original USGCRP authors.   
  
The co-authors of the group letter go on to note four other points that they wish to emphasize.   
  
**Quality References**   
  
The first has to do with the number/quality of references included in the USGRCP report vs. our report. Both reports draw primarily from the peer-reviewed scientific literature. That our report includes a large number of peer-reviewed studies directly relevant to climate change impacts in the United States that were not included in the USGCRP report, and which support a more modest impact, in and of itself speaks volumes. Instead of quibbling over the number of references, the USGCRP co-authors ought to be apologizing profusely for producing such an incomplete and one-sided report on the taxpayers’ dime.   
  
**Effectiveness of Public Comment**   
  
Another bone of contention is that the USGCRP report was open to public comment while our report was not. But, as Ed Crane described in his introductory remarks in the report, the public comment process for the USGCRP report left a lot to be desired: 



This effort grew out of the recognition that the original [USGCRP] document was lacking in scope and relevant scientific detail. A Cato review of a draft noted that it was among the worst summary documents on climate change ever written, and that literally every paragraph was missing critical information from the refereed scientific literature. While that review was extensive, the restricted timeframe for commentary necessarily limited any effort. The following document completes that effort.



And, of course, our _Addendum_ is a public comment. As is the letter signed by 11 of the USGCRP report’s original authors.   
  
**Modest Climate Change**   
  
Here is the third point made by the USGCRP author team: 



The authors of the Cato Institute report agree with our Committee’s conclusions that global warming is unequivocal and consistent with a change in greenhouse gas effects attributable to human activities. They also conclude that climate change will continue to occur as greenhouse gas concentrations increase. However, their conclusions that future climate change will be benign, if not beneficial, and easily adapted to, diverge markedly from our Committee’s view regarding the seriousness of the risks. This is because the Cato Institute authors assume—based on their own analysis and contrary to peer-reviewed, contemporary science—that warming, intensification of weather extremes, polar ice cap melting, and sea-level rise will all be at the lowest end of the ranges projected in the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change.



I largely agree with all of this except the phrase “based on their own analysis and contrary to peer-reviewed, contemporary science”—in fact, our entire report is largely built upon the peer-reviewed, contemporary science. And our “conclusions that future climate change will be benign, if not beneficial, and easily adapted to” are well-supported by the literature (and, as we point out, common sense). That the USGCRP co-authors find otherwise, or at least fail to even consider this very strong possibility, is the primary fault in their report that we address.   
  
**NAS Reports**   
  
The fourth and last point made by the USGCRP author team is that the USGCRP findings are backed by recent National Academy of Sciences reports. To me this is a hollow claim, as the NAS reports are about as selective in their science as the USGCRP report. Most of the NAS reports mentioned by the USGCRP authors in support of their report have been taken apart by the Cato Center for the Study of Science staff (see here and here, for example).   
  
**Future Update**   
  
And finally, the USGCRP co-authors note: 



The next U.S. National Climate Assessment is underway under the auspices of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, with draft sections of its report to be released in December and completed in 2013. We are confident that this new assessment will reinforce and extend the findings of _Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States_.



Well that last line sure sounds like a bummer. My guess is that there will soon be another _Addendum_ report from the Center for the Study of Science in the making. In fact, the last substantive section of their document is titled “A vision for future U.S. assessments.” Ours is titled “Future federal science assessments,” and says: 



Future assessments of climate change are likely to be as poor in quality as _Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States_...However...each new federal assessment is likely to be answered like the USGCRP report was—with more science than our federal government chooses to recognize.

"**A food festival has been cancelled for being ""too popular"".**
Organisers of the annual Cardigan Bay Seafood Festival said it has caused parking problems, crowding and congestion on the Aberaeron harbour side and they were postponing it for a year.
Aberaeron town council said it caused ""total chaos"".
But a business owner said he was disappointed and it increases footfall to the town.
The festival has been held in Aberaeron for more than 20 years, but organisers said it ""needs to take a sabbatical"" and health and safety was the priority, with the challenges of staging the event ""increasing considerably in recent years"".
Organiser Menna Heulyn said: ""When we started, it was a small festival run by volunteers and quite easy to put on but as the years have gone by, regulations are increasing, there's more and more red tape, more and more work to prepare for the festival and more emphasis on public safety, food safety, parking restrictions, ensuring there's no congestion.
""And these are challenges for us as volunteers in Aberaeron and working within a very confined area around the harbour, I think the harbour is what makes the festival unique and with that brings responsibilities.
""We felt for a very small team of volunteers maybe it's the time for us to have a little break, it happened in Glastonbury once, they took a break and came back stronger, and maybe new people will come and put their names forward.""
Ms Heulyn said work on the festival begins in January, so the team - who all have other jobs and businesses - spend eight months preparing.
""But it's been an amazing event for Aberaeron, and really helped put Aberaeron on the food map,"" she added.
Martin Holland, who runs the Cadwgan Inn, said the event was ""fundamentally important"".
He said: ""It increases footfall to the town. It certainly was a shock.
""To postpone it would be not much short of catastrophic in its knock on effects. Once something does get postponed, it's difficult to get the resurrection.""
Councillor Elizabeth Evans said the announcement ""came as a bit of a shock because it's so successful"", and paid credit to the small team of volunteers who organise the event.
""They have to provide a festival that is safe,"" she said.
""There are thousands of people that descend on Aberaeron."""
"**Empty supermarket shelves have unnerved much of the nation and made consumers question the security of food supplies they had taken for granted. As people ponder how they might have to source their food during the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, will there be a growth in growing your own?**
National groups including the Royal Horticultural Society and National Vegetable Society have reported a substantial increase in people starting to grow their own veg for the first time.
So what are the merits of taking things into our own glove-clad hands?
Charlie Hoskin, 38, her partner Mouse Bragg, 40 and their three-year-old daughter are one of many families who have been inspired to get digging.
""Like many our wistful intentions have been catalysed recently by the recent COVID-19 outbreak,"" she said.
They have been isolating for about three weeks now at their home in Cornwall.
""We have more time to channel and hopefully once the patch is established we shall enjoy salad-saving sums and a more sustainable lifestyle whilst also hatching a new family habit together,"" she said.
Tamasin Pemberton, a green-fingered mother of three, said since the coronavirus pandemic began she had seen an influx in first-time growers at the Cornish garden centre she worked at - at least before the government closed ""all but essential stores"".
For years she had run her own social enterprise, Perennial Harvest, with a charity arm, trying to give families the skills to ""grow their own"" in workshops.
She admitted enthusiasm had been a little lacklustre - until now.
The pandemic seemed to have prompted an ""overdue revival,"" she said, and a chance to share her passion with an audience who were really listening.
""It's a lot of people in their 30s and 40s with young families,"" she said.
""People who are really keen but haven't got any experience whatsoever"".
""It has touched on people's fears about food security - they've seen how bare the shelves are.""
The UK government and supermarkets have said there would be more than enough food to go round, and action was being taken to meet the increased demand for deliveries to both stores and households.
But UK growers said this week they were facing a ""serious labour shortage"" that could risks millions of tonnes of fruit and veg failing to reach consumers.
""I don't want this to be frightening to people, I want them to think what can we practically do, and to give our kids the ability to be able to adapt, to persevere,"" Ms Pemberton said.
It has prompted the 43-year-old to start a Facebook blog, full of picture-guides for beginners.
Fiona Shenfield, general secretary of the National Vegetable Society, said it had seen a ""big increase"" in people waking up to the benefits of home growing during the current health crisis.
""In fact some of our members have been approached and have been helping by providing spare tomato plants, for example.""
Leaders at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) also reported a boost in interest.
Alistair Griffiths, director of science at the the RHS, said: ""There are very few, if any, other activities that can achieve all of the things that gardening can - in particular, the measurable impact on active lifestyles and mental wellbeing, such as reductions in depression, anxiety, and body mass index, as well as increases in life satisfaction and quality of life.
""Gardening is also a great way to top up your vitamin D... from direct sunlight on the skin."""

"While many of us weren’t paying attention, some credit card   bonuses became so   large that the analysts at Bernstein Research wondered in November if the industry was afflicted with temporary insanity. One particular bit of madness  —   a Chase offer that effectively puts $1, 500 in your pocket without a lot of effort, if you are a relatively big spender  —   is close to ending, and many people have just a few more days to take advantage of it. But the mere existence of   bonuses on top of the points and perks that come with everyday spending raises a number of questions for consumers. Even if you thought you had had enough of   to get the best deals, shouldn’t you at least grab those 15   bills if you have the means? Or might the offers actually get better? And is it time to bet against the stocks of the maniac bankers who are tossing around offers like this? CHASE, TODAY? First things first: That giant bonus comes from the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Here’s how it works (and don’t confuse it with the similarly named Preferred card): If the bank accepts your application, you have three months to spend $4, 000. Once you do, Chase hands over 100, 000 of its proprietary rewards points. Then you can trade them for $1, 500 worth of travel, as long as you book your flights or rooms through Chase. The card has a $450 annual fee, but it gives back $300 of it each year once you purchase at least that amount in travel. It also gives out a generous amount of points  —   three per dollar spent  —   on travel and dining. Plus, you can swap points for miles on many airlines if you want to take your chances with seat availability in those reward schemes. Other perks include access to some airport lounges and a rebate for fees you pay for TSA PreCheck, the expedited security screening, or Global Entry, which speeds international returns. In cardland, any offer this lucrative tends not to last. This week, Chase said it would cut the   bonus in half for anyone who applied online after Jan. 12 or in a branch (which isn’t possible for people in parts of the country where there are no Chase branches) after March 12. To be safe, the company suggests applying online by Jan. 11, before it flips the switch the next day. Why the change of heart on a product Chase introduced last summer? The company always said the bonus was an introductory offer, and the bank’s generosity led to a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings. So the window on a good thing is partly closing. So should you take advantage of it while you can? My wife and I both have done it and are glad we did. It has required some mental energy to channel the right amount of spending away from our current card and track the new bills so we don’t end up paying late. But there is nothing that focuses the mind quite like feeling that you are beating the system. This feeling of superiority may be delusional, given the amount of research that suggests that we pay more when we put things on plastic than when we pay with cash. But I consider myself above average in this regard, as we all probably do. Another big question: Does it make sense to stick with the Chase card, or ditch it after the bonuses clear? One useful exercise is to run your spending patterns (which your card company’s website ought to be able to divide into categories like dining, travel and groceries) through creditcardtuneup. com to compare the results with those of a number of leading rewards cards. It’s a great tool, but the site’s operator has its own opinions about how much a Chase point is worth versus the Starwood points that I collect on my primary American Express card. Your mileage may vary if you, say, swap Chase or Starwood points for   miles and then redeem them for $10, 000   plane tickets to a faraway country. Think about your goals for the next couple of years and evaluate accordingly. In our household, we are reserving judgment. That is (in part) because Starwood is in the middle of being acquired by Marriott, which faces the challenging task of combining two loyalty programs without driving away   frequent travelers. Sometime in the next year or so, we will find out what it is going to do. Standard disclaimers apply here, as always. Don’t carry a balance, since interest charges will generally eat up the value of the rewards and then some. Also, applying for too many cards in a short time could hurt your credit score a bit. IS THE MADNESS CATCHING? Gordon Smith, the chief executive of consumer and community banking at Chase, spent more than 25 years working at American Express, and it was plainly obvious that the bank was aiming Sapphire Reserve squarely at the Amex Platinum card. Indeed, less than two months after the Chase card appeared in August, Amex issued a news release announcing new benefits for Platinum card holders. Here is what it didn’t do, though: offer a   bribe to every new customer who wanted one of its cards. Its standard online offer is currently 40, 000 of its own proprietary points, which are 10, 000 fewer than what Chase’s new, lower bonus will be. (Yes, it’s hard to compare the value of different reward currencies, but these two aren’t that far apart, and many consumers never make the distinction and assume they are the same anyhow.) Some American Express customers have been luckier, though. Card industry bloggers report that the company has sometimes made targeted bonus offers of 100, 000 or even 150, 000 points. Leah Gerstner, an American Express spokeswoman, noted that the company had been in the premium card market for more than three decades, implying that it knew a thing or two about appropriate competitive responses to the latest shiny thing. “What’s worked for us is a mix of targeted   bonuses combined with a range of premium benefits and services,” Ms. Gerstner said. She added that the company had issued “record levels of new cards” while delivering “sustainable” economics to the company. In their report in November, the Bernstein Research analysts dangled the tantalizing possibility that American Express might begin some kind of price war, throwing its own   bonuses and privileges at customers. Now that Chase has lowered its   bonus, however, Kevin J. St. Pierre, a Bernstein managing director, thinks the chances of that are low. “They have inertia on their side, with a   customer base that is generally satisfied with their product and very satisfied with the service,” he said. “So how much do they need to tweak to defend that?” PITY NOT THE POOR BANKERS Shareholders (and consumers who are determined to be the least profitable customers of thriving, generous banks) probably shouldn’t panic about the ramifications of the banks’ largess at this point. Chase would not comment about the performance of Sapphire Reserve, owing to the requirement to stay silent before its coming earnings announcement. Still, it almost certainly modeled the possibility that some people would spend their   bonus and then stop using the card. The card’s   profitability will depend largely on what percentage of cardholders carry a balance  —   and how much and for how long. Mr. St. Pierre said he didn’t lose much sleep over a single,   card offering from a bank of this size. “They are so large that they can afford to experiment,” he said. “A few hundred million in any quarter is a cost of doing business, and they’ll use it, learn from it and improve the product from their perspective and move on. ” Citi’s own plastic pushers have already done a bit of this. Its competing Prestige card reduced some perks several months back, though it kept a    hotel benefit. “Our strategic focus is delivering products and experiences that create long, lasting relationships,” said Chris Fred, head of proprietary products for Citi’s cards unit. Bonus chasers and   card churners, it seems, are not particularly welcome. Still, the banks face an existential crisis of sorts. A generation of young adults grew up on debit cards, and banks are going to have to do something to get the millions of them who don’t need to carry a balance to switch to credit anyway. There aren’t a lot of great ways to do it other than throwing   bonuses and perks at them. The rest of us can keep an eye on the bonus offers via blogs like The Points Guy and View From the Wing or on forums like FlyerTalk and Reddit’s   pages. Then  —   when the going gets as good as it’s gotten in recent months and we want to go on a free vacation  —   we can sweep in and gleefully pick off the juiciest offers of all."
"**Many ""ready to drink"" pre-mixed spirits are packed with excessive sugar and hidden calories and should be subject to a sugar tax like fizzy drinks, health experts say.**
Action on Sugar is concerned people are consuming more than they should, without realising it.
The team based at Queen Mary University of London looked at hundreds of products sold in UK shops and online.
Some contained eight teaspoons of sugar in one small 250ml can.
The sweetest gin and mixer was Classic Combinations Pink Gin and Tonic, containing 27g of sugar (nearly seven teaspoons) in a 250ml can - the same sugar content as Coke.
An Archers Schnapps and Lemonade and a Malibu and Cola both contained 33g per 250ml can.
Nine out of 10 of the pre-mixed spirits and cocktails in the study did not have clear on-pack information about the sugar content within, the researchers found.
These products are not legally required to have a nutrition label on them.
Action on Sugar says sugary alcoholic drinks are contributing to:
Chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""It is a national scandal that because these drinks contain alcohol, they are not subject to the sugar tax or any form of coherent nutrition labelling.
""The new government needs to act now by taking control of the alcohol industry and stop them from exploiting vulnerable young adults.""
Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, who chairs the Alcohol Health Alliance, said: ""Consumers have the right to know exactly what they are drinking.
""This latest research demonstrates - once again - that the current system of the self-regulation of alcohol labelling isn't working and the industry is not taking its responsibilities seriously.
""Shoppers who buy alcohol get less information about what's in their drink than those who buy milk or orange juice. This is simply outrageous.""
John Timothy, of the Portman Group, which represents alcohol producers and brewers in the UK, said: ""The industry has signed up to a number of Europe-wide voluntary commitments on nutrition which will give consumers access to information both on labels and through websites within the next two years.
""Many drinks producers also already offer lower calorie alternatives to give consumers greater choice.""
A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Pre-mixed spirit drinks are taxed through alcohol duties, which are at a significantly higher rate than the childhood obesity focussed soft drinks industry levy. These raise over Â£12bn a year which helps pay for vital public services such as the NHS."""

"It has been a long time coming  —   eight years, in fact  —   but the economic recovery is finally showing up in the average American worker’s paycheck in a big way. There have been plenty of winners in the recovery, which began in  : companies, homeowners, investors and, especially, households at the apex of the economic pyramid. But the paucity of gains in   pay has stoked anxiety and frustration for many others, a factor in the wave of discontent that   Donald J. Trump rode to victory in November. But even as Mr. Trump prepares to succeed President Obama in two weeks, the Labor Department reported on Friday that average hourly earnings rose by 2. 9 percent last year, the best annual performance since the recovery began. And many economists expect the trend to gain momentum this year, as a tighter labor market forces employers to pay more to hire and retain workers. “This is a turning point for the overall economy,” said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago. While wage growth was robust last year, government data for December showed a more tepid increase in employment, with 156, 000 jobs added during the month, and a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 4. 7 percent. Until recently, a rise in salaries one month would peter out the next, but the upward trajectory in 2016 reflects wage gains even for Americans at the low end of the pay scale, Ms. Swonk said. Leisure and hospitality workers, for example, saw hourly earnings jump 4. 4 percent from a year earlier, equal to the increase enjoyed by employees in the surging technology sector. To be sure, a number of the economic problems cited by Mr. Trump during the campaign remain: millions of former workers not even looking for jobs, ebbing factory positions and fewer opportunities for the 55 percent of Americans without college degrees or other   school credentials. “Strong economic growth doesn’t really matter if it’s not widely distributed,” Ms. Swonk said. “You can have a better economy but still not good enough for people who aren’t participating at all. ” A more comprehensive government barometer of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take   jobs because   positions were not available, stood at 9. 2 percent in December, a much higher level than at this point in past recoveries. But rising wages should counter the economic undertow, especially if the gains remain  . And while a 2. 9 percent increase may not sound like much, it goes much further because inflation is about 1. 7 percent. Economists expect wages to rise by up to 3. 5 percent in 2017  —   still below the gains many workers saw in the recovery of the   and in the   boom of the late 1990s. Although not reflected in the December figures, many   workers are getting raises this year because of state increases in the local minimum wage. Some of the increases were substantial, with Arizona, Maine and Washington each raising the floor by $1. 50 or more an hour. Even in California, where, at 50 cents an hour, the wage gain is not as steep, one in 10 workers has gotten a raise. And   gains can have a spillover effect, pushing up pay for workers just above the bottom salary tier. For all his criticism during the campaign of Mr. Obama’s economic stewardship, Mr. Trump will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid. Consumer sentiment, corporate profits and the stock market are all at or near multiyear highs. On Friday, Wall Street embraced the       labor market figures, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average close to 20, 000 and a new nominal record. Investors and traders are watching the jobs data closely for clues about when the Federal Reserve Board may next raise interest rates. Last month, the Fed increased interest rates for only the second time in a decade, and policy makers signaled that three more increases could come this year. The wage gains are among the reasons the Fed is likely to stick to that plan, Ms. Swonk, the Chicago economist, said. Monthly job creation last year was well below the 236, 000 average for hiring in 2014 and 2015. But with the economy close to what Fed policy makers and other experts consider full employment, employers are increasing wages, to retain workers and to attract new ones. While the minimum wage increases provide a floor when it comes to pay, the ceiling continues to rise in fields like financial services, sales and technology, said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing company. “Across the board, I see more aggressive salaries being offered by corporations than at any time in the last 10 years,” Mr. Gimbel said. Seasoned sales representatives are drawing base salaries of $150, 000 a year, compared with $125, 000 two years ago, according to Mr. Gimbel.   software developers who once started at around $50, 000 a year can now command $70, 000. Other executives in the Midwest also report upward pressure on wages, including in grittier settings than the   fields where engineers and financial professionals cluster. At Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria, which has 46 restaurants in the Chicago area and one in Phoenix,   pay in hourly positions like server, cook and dishwasher is now about $11. 50 an hour, compared with $10 an hour three years ago. Mark Agnew, the chain’s president, said most of the increase was a result of the steady rise in Chicago’s minimum wage, which has gone from $8. 25 in 2014 to $10. 50 now. It is set to hit $13 by summer 2019. “We want to stay ahead of the minimum wage because we want to attract the best talent,” Mr. Agnew said. A substantial portion of the chain’s 3, 000 workers have been with the company for more than 10 years, a rarity in the   restaurant industry that is another benefit of the slightly higher wages. Economists and politicians have long debated whether raising the minimum wage ultimately hurts workers as companies cut positions or leave them unfilled in the face of rising labor costs. So far, that has not been the case at Lou Malnati’s, Mr. Agnew said. The chain has opened about a dozen new locations in the past three years, adding about 600 workers to its payroll over all. “It’s very tricky, and I know the minimum wage may erode job creation in some industries,” he said. “But in my own company, it hasn’t hurt hiring. ”"

"**Heavy discounting on winter coats and sturdy footwear lifted sales on Scotland's high streets last month, according to a closely-watched survey.**
The SRC-KPMG sales monitor found total sales were up by 1% year-on-year in October.
Food sales rose by 2.5%, while non-food sales fell by 0.2%.
Adjusted for the estimated effect of online sales, non-food was up by 1.7% - the best performance since January, excluding Easter ""distortions"".
The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) said the ""sprightly"" set of results showed ""a more broadly based pick-up in demand"" across retail sub-sectors.
Fashion led the way in the non-food category, followed by beds, home textiles, kitchenware, mobile phones and televisions.
SRC director David Lonsdale said retailers had used ""keen prices and promotions"" to drive footfall and demand, particularly on winter coats and heavier footwear.
However, he warned that if customers continued to hold out for steep discounts, it would put ""severe pressure on retailers' already-thin profit margins"".
Mr Lonsdale added: ""Overall these figures strike a more optimistic note at the start of the crucial 'golden quarter' trading period that leads up to Christmas.
""However, a big question remains over the future direction of consumer spending.
""The coming weeks and months will be dominated by the general election, Brexit and UK and Scottish budgets.
""Retailers will be hoping policy-makers keep consumer confidence and household disposable incomes uppermost in their minds.""
Paul Martin, UK head of retail for KPMG, said: ""After a particularly challenging and prolonged period of uncertainty, the latest figures provide some reassurance and confidence.
""The next few months will be crucial for Scotland's high streets, as shoppers prepare for the festive spending period.
""A concerted effort from retailers has laid the foundations for a positive quarter."""

The manufactured delirium of the “school’s climate strike” is not just nonsense, it’s wicked nonsense. Nonsense, because not a jot of its hysteria is founded in scientific fact; wicked, not just because it is being exploited by dangerous political ideologies, but because it is diverting desperately needed money and effort away from real environmental problems.



Once again showing the no-nonsense, practical political sense that won the last election, to the shock of the elites, Scott Morrison is ignoring the screeching hysteria of scowling Swedish children, and concentrating on genuinely pressing environmental problems.



Scott Morrison said Australia had “nothing to apologise for over climate change” as he told the United Nations General Assembly that his government would lead urgent action to combat plastic pollution choking the oceans.



In his first address to the UN general assembly in New York early on Thursday (AEST) the Prime Minister said Australia would particularly help Pacific island nations fight plastics pollution and illegal fishing which was damaging their environment and economies.



“To protect our oceans, Australia is committed to leading urgent action to combat plastic pollution choking our oceans; tackle over-exploitation of our fisheries, prevent ocean habitat destruction and take action on climate change,” Mr Morrison said.



On his visit to the United States and to the UN Mr Morrison has concentrated heavily on plastics pollution and waste recycling to protect the environment and said environmental challenges are “not just climate change”.



Naturally, the apparatchiks at the UN are sticking to their tired, alarmist script.



His comments coincided with the release of a special report on the ocean and cryosphere for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that said major ­uncertainties remained on how much melting ice, particularly in Antarctica, would lift sea levels over coming centuries.



“Major uncertainties” is putting it mildly. The actual fact is that they have no idea. All these scary “predictions” are based solely on climate models. Models, as climatologist Nakamura Mototaka says, are “useless junk” when it comes to making climate predictions.



But, unlike “climate change”, tackling plastic pollution isn’t nearly so useful for forcing a socialist agenda, and robbing trillions of dollars from the West to shovel into the greedy maws of mendicant “developing” nations. Worse, tackling pollution might force developing nations who are actually responsible for 95% of ocean plastic waste to actually pull their environmental weight for once.



Before addressing the UN Mr Morrison said: “Australia has a strong track record on delivery […] so Australia has nothing, nothing at all to apologise for and everything to commend the action we are taking”.



While the UN and its sleazy cabal of globalists and watermelon NGOs keep pushing their “climate change” barrow, hard-nosed businessmen are doing the heavy lifting of actually tackling pollution.



Stepping up his push to tackle ocean pollution, Mr Morrison sought to put greater responsibility on industry to address the problem. When it came to plastics and recycling “it needs to be commercially sustainable as a model”, he said. “We don’t want to see, you know, taxes and large levels of state intervention, and massive summits, and these sorts of things. What we want to see is industry leadership…



Mr Morrison said the ­Australian-owned Pratt Industries paper plant that the US President opened in Ohio on the weekend was an example of successful, commercially led cardboard recycling. “We want to see that same sort of model be successful in the plastics recycling industry, and Australia has an enormous amount to offer here,” he said. “It’s not only going to make our environment cleaner and the world’s oceans cleaner, but I think it’s going to be a real jobs opportunity for Australia.



Iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation on Wednesday committed $US300m ($442m) to a new ­industry-­focused effort to reduce worldwide plastic waste. Mr Forrest’s Sea for the Future program aims to raise $US20bn a year through a voluntary levy on plastics resin based on its carbon footprint.

The latest from the National Wildlife Federation has to rank among the most absurd global warming reports I have encountered. And, after 30 years of encountering all sorts of wacky warming hype, this is saying a lot.   
  
  
This NWF doozey is entitled “Mascot Madness: How Climate Change is Hurting School Spirit” and was timed so as to try to take advantage of the pre‐​coverage of the upcoming March Madness—the popular annual NCAA college basketball tournament. Apparently linking climate change to negative impacts on sports is a new green tactic.   
  
  
The NWF’s premise is that human‐​caused global warming is threatening the natural version of school mascots, and, in some cases, causing them to be dissociated from the region that includes the university that they represent, presumably dampening “school spirit.”   
  
  
The NWF offered up its solution to this vexing problem:   




• Passing effective laws that reduce carbon pollution and other air pollutants that drive climate change and endanger the health of our communities and wildlife.   
  
  
• Investing in clean, wildlife‐​friendly, renewable energy sources to replace our dangerous dependence on dirty fossil fuels.   
  
  
• Practicing “climate‐​smart conservation” by taking climate change into account in our wildlife and natural resource management efforts.



Of course.   
  
  
Even if it were true that anthropogenic climate change could be scientifically linked to changes in the location and/​or health of the various school mascot species—which it almost certainly can’t—how this impacts “school spirit” is completely beyond me.   
  
  
If the real‐​world situation that the mascots find themselves in is reflected in school spirit, can you imagine the level of dejection in the fan base of say the San Diego State Aztecs, the University of Southern California Trojans, the University of Calgary Dinos, or the Indiana University‐​Purdue University Fort Wayne Mastodons? It is a wonder that a single seat is filled for home games.   
  
  
And as to the relationship between the natural territory of the mascot and the degree of rah‐​rahness, consider what must be the struggle facing the booster clubs behind the UC Irvine Anteaters, the Pittsburg (Kansas) State Gorillas, the Youngstown State Penguins, or the University of Missouri‐​Kansas City Kangaroos. Global warming’s impact is small beans compared to this kind of territorial displacement!   
  
  
The NWF draws special attention to the worrisome case of the rivalry between the University of Michigan Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes, fretting that climate change is driving the wolverine out of the state of Michigan while simultaneously driving the buckeye tree into Michigan (and out of Ohio).   
  
  
But, according to this webpage from the University of Michigan athletic association, how the University’s mascot became the Wolverines is a matter of some debate. Interestingly, the page goes on to note that an actual wolverine has never been captured in the state of Michigan, and the first verified sighting of one didn’t occur until 2004!   
  
  
And a quick peak at the USDA Plant Guide indicates that distribution of the Ohio buckeye tree shows that while the tree may extend is natural boundary northward in a warming climate, there is still plenty of territory south of Ohio to keep the tree in the state for a long time to come. So, everyone (including the NWF) can rest assured that climate change will not serve to lessen the Michigan/​Ohio state rivalry.   
  
  
In keeping with the ringing the global warming alarm bells, I am a bit surprised that the NWF didn’t compile a companion report titled “Mascot Madness: How Climate Change is Boosting School Spirit to Unhealthy Levels.” In that report, they could have featured the Miami Hurricanes, the University of British Columbia‐​Okanagan Heat, the Geneva College Golden Tornadoes, the Southeastern Oklahoma Savage Storm, and, of course, the most obvious of all, the Dartmouth College Big Greens.

"WASHINGTON  —   As congressional Republicans on Friday discussed quickly moving ahead with plans for a southern border wall using money included in this year’s spending bills,   Donald J. Trump insisted that Mexico would ultimately pay for its construction. “We’re going to get reimbursed,” Mr. Trump said during a brief telephone interview. “But I don’t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed. ” The congressional Republicans’ talk led to speculation that Mr. Trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall. Mr. Trump insisted he is not. Republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the Obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars. Building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in Congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the United States is a welcoming country that embraces immigration. In the interview, Mr. Trump vowed that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States. He said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Mexican government. “It’s going to be part of everything,” Mr. Trump said of the cost of building the wall. “We are going to be making a much better deal. It’s a deal that never should have been signed. ” But he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall “in order to speed up the process. ” The full cost of a wall as described by Mr. Trump could be enormous. Attaching such a charged issue to annual, mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight. Those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government. The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $6. 5 million per mile to build a   fence, with an additional $4. 2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly   border with Mexico. “The chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,” said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee’s new chairman. If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed. Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump’s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border. “If and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,” she said in an email on Friday. At a rally in August in Phoenix, hours after meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, Mr. Trump vowed that America’s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border. “Mexico will pay for the wall, believe me  —   100 percent  —   they don’t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall. ” In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall. “The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!” he wrote early Friday. Vicente Fox, who was Mexico’s president from 2000 until 2006, responded to Mr. Trump’s Twitter message with a barrage of outraged posts that became an internet talking point on their own. In one of them, he made reference to the intelligence agency reports about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. “Sr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating,” Mr. Fox said. “Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?” Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump’s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it. In an appearance on the CNN program “New Day,” Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. “Of course, we have to pay the bills,” he said. “We’re building the wall. ” As a candidate, Mr. Trump’s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States. His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall  —   that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars. Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project. “If President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U. S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N. I. H. to find cures for cancer,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall. “I think that’s a heavy sell,” she said. “I think that’s a tough sell for them. ”"

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
For a long time Geothermal energy has been an expensive joke, even for people who claim solar and wind power is viable. History is littered with Geothermal projects which failed to live up to their early promise, such as the Tim Flannery inspired Cooper Basin project, which obliterated at least $90 million in government grant money before the project was abandoned.
But there are some hints that COP25 might include an attempt to breath new government money into this failed renewable energy technology.
From Chile, posted in April this year;
 Chile and the role of Geothermal – preparing for the COP25 climate talksAlexander Richter 30 Apr 2019Diego Morata, Director of the Center of Excellence in Geothermal Energy of the Andes of Chile (CEGA), highlights the potential role of geothermal in the goal of cleaning the energy matrix of fossil fuels and the opportunity presented in the COP 25 climate talks to be hosted in Santiago de Chile, December 2-13, 2019.In December 2019, Chile will be hosting the COP25 climate talks in Santiago. This provides a unique opportunity for the country and the geothermal sector to highlight the role it could play in the future energy mix of Chile.Diego Morata, Director of the Center of Excellence in Geothermal Energy of the Andes of Chile, presents an interesting analysis about the role of geothermal in the goal of cleaning the energy matrix of fossil fuels Chile and the opportunity presented in the Convention United Nations Framework on Climate Change No. 25, which will be held in Santiago de Chile from December 2 to 13, 2019 (see the government communication in this link)We share a copy of what was raised by Diego Morata in a column published in the newspaper El Mostrador, and was published by our sister publication, PiensaGeotermia.“There is a big difference between stopping a change and curbing a disaster. The first can afford long solution times, the second requires decisive actions. During the last session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP), the most powerful and mediatic statement warned us of the urgency: “You only talk about going ahead with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess , even when the only sensible thing they can do is put on the emergency brake “, the speech came from a teenage activist, the Swedish Greta Thumberg, and her photos and words are the memories that last the most today, not only because of the novelty of the interlocutor, but because their declarations shine an awkward truth: that the authorities still do not manage to take concrete agreements to reduce the increase of the temperature of the planet. What can Chile contribute to this scenario full of wilful declarations and little action now that we will host the next COP in December?During the next COP 25 we will be the focus of global attention on climate change. What are we going to tell Greta? It is postulated that an increase of 2ºC in the temperature of the planet could bring serious consequences (irreversible?) For humanity. Climate change is a scientifically proven reality, the temperature of the Earth has been increasing progressively, and a large part of the scientific community accepts that we have entered the Anthropocene, a new geological time where the effect of man in Earth’s climate These are the times in which Greta will grow up, who reminds us that “you say that you love your children, but they are robbing you of your future”.Given this pessimistic scenario, Chile has good news to contribute. Our country has been recognized internationally as an example in the promotion and development of renewable energies, the development of solar energy positions it as the third national energy source. We must applaud this fact and continue on that path, deeper, deeper, underground. As well as the Sun, we are fortunate to have another inexhaustible renewable energy under our feet, geothermal energy, which would allow us to free our matrix of fossil fuels. We have already demonstrated as a country that geothermal electricity can be generated. ”Source: statement sent via email by Diego Morata for publication via PiensaGeotermia – the Spanish language platform of ThinkGeoEnergyhttp://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/chile-and-the-role-of-geothermal-preparing-for-the-cop25-climate-talks/
The allure of Geothermal energy is a promise of relief from the fatal intermittency which plagues wind and solar. All it would take is a magical breakthrough to make geothermal economically viable – and a claimed breakthrough has miraculously appeared, just in time for COP25.
Tech Breakthrough Could Spark A Geothermal Energy BoomPUBLISHER Oilprice.com PUBLISHED NOV 20, 2019 8:39AM ESTGeothermal energy is often billed as one of “the cleanest energy sources” –and with good reason. It’s carbon-free, renewable, and efficient. Even those stoic anti-hyperbolists over at the United States Department of Energy sing its praises, saying, “this vital, clean energy resource supplies renewable power around the clock and emits little or no greenhouse gases — all while requiring a small environmental footprint to develop.”While geothermal is one of the superheroes of clean energy production, however, it still has a lot of room for improvement. First and foremost, it needs to be massively scaled up in order to have any real environmental impact or significant market share compared to where it stands now, a speck in the giant shadow of fossil fuels. What’s more, there are significant barriers and high costs to the initial phases of exploration and infrastructure. …Luckily, there has recently been an important breakthrough in the field of geothermal energy exploration and finding those geothermal hotspots (so to speak) thanks to a team of research scientists from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, based in Potsdam. The scientists’ findings, published this month in a Scientific Reports journal article titled “Geothermal sweetspots identified in a volcanic lake integrating bathymetry and fluid chemistry,” have solved the issue of finding underwater drilling sites by identifying a method that allows the mapping of submerged geological structures in order to determine inflow information essential for developing geothermal energy production.…Read more: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-breakthrough-could-spark-a-geothermal-energy-boom-2019-11-20
If entrepreneurs and their backers want to defy the odds, take risks, and reap rewards if their investments pay off, I don’t think any of us have a problem with that.
But if I am right, I have a funny feeling the COP25 organizers will be seeking lots of government support for their revolutionary idea. Green energy projects all seem to require large infusions of government money, not because they are economically unviable of course, but it is critically important to get things moving quickly because of the urgency of our global climate crisis. 
And if some of the projects don’t work out, well who cares about money? The future of the world is in the balance!

"JERUSALEM  —   One loved horse riding another was the oldest of four sisters a third had fought to enlist in the army despite medical problems that allowed him to defer the draft. The fourth was the 300th graduate of her Haifa high school to have died while serving as a soldier. Israel buried its latest terrorism victims on Monday, the day after they were run down by a Palestinian man in a truck, enveloping them in the country’s familiar outpouring of love for its service members. But this time, the usually unifying ritual was marred by discord. Israelis called it the “Azaria effect,” referring to Sgt. Elor Azaria, the soldier who was convicted last week of manslaughter for shooting a wounded and incapacitated Palestinian assailant in the head. Video from the scene of Sunday’s attack showed dozens of armed soldiers fleeing from the truck instead of trying to shoot the driver. Some Israelis who had complained that the army’s high command failed to back up Sergeant Azaria asserted that the soldiers had fallen short because they were afraid of being put on trial. The military, security experts and soldiers at the scene quickly rejected that notion. “Those who ran from the scene were not concerned about Azaria, but about their own ” said Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert in national security and public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. Still, the argument  —   unfolding in full volume on Israeli news sites, social media and broadcast channels  —   reflected the disruptive influence the Azaria affair has had on the army and its central place in Israeli society. In this small,   country where most Jewish    are drafted into years of service, the military has long been a rare reserve of respect and consensus. Yet the same sentiment that leads Israeli Jews to treat soldiers as “everybody’s children” has also led many to call for a pardon for Sergeant Azaria, creating tension between the people and the commanders of their army. “The motherly protection of soldiers sometimes overcomes your basic value system,” Mr. Ben Meir said, adding that the instinct to protect soldiers was not particular to Israel. The soldiers targeted by the Palestinian truck driver on Sunday were in officer training programs, and most were not preparing for combat roles. Many were in the educational corps or training for administrative jobs on the home front. On a routine educational tour of Jerusalem, they were caught   as they disembarked from buses at a popular observation spot with panoramic views of Old City. The truck driver plowed into one group, then reversed and came back to claim more victims. A tour guide who shot at the truck with his pistol complained on television that the soldiers were better equipped with   but had hesitated to shoot. Noam Kedar, one of the soldiers at the scene, denounced those who passed instant judgment. “Please stop your   psychoanalysis,” she wrote in an impassioned Facebook post. “It has nothing to do with Elor Azaria,” she added. “It’s unrelated. Let none of you dare compare a semitrailer going at 100 km per hour with a disarmed terrorist who is lying down, already neutralized. ” The military’s preliminary findings were that two soldiers had fired at the driver it remained unclear on Monday whether he had been killed by them or by civilians who opened fire. The defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said that any attempt to link Sunday’s events to the Azaria verdict had no basis. One squad commander at the scene said she had instructed her forces to run for cover after determining that enough soldiers were already running toward the truck. There were also concerns, according to officers in the field, that too many people shooting could cause a “friendly fire” accident. The four soldiers who were killed, all promoted posthumously, were identified as Lt. Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim, near Tel Aviv Second Lt. Erez Orbach, 20, from Alon Shvut, in the West Bank Lt. Shir Hajaj, 22, from Ma’ale Adumim in the West Bank and Second Lt. Shira Tzur, 20, from Haifa. “These are our children,” Herzl Hajaj, Shir Hajaj’s father, told the Israeli news media Sunday after hearing of his daughter’s death. “We send them to the army we know they might not return. ” The Azaria case, regarding a shooting in the West Bank city of Hebron last March that was caught on video, unleashed its own kind of friendly fire and fury. As a military judge read the verdict last week in a Tel Aviv military compound, hundreds of protesters demonstrated outside. Bolstered by some of the most extreme   elements of Israeli society, like La Familia fan club of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team and the   Lahava organization, the crowd scuffled with the police. Among their chants were threats against Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, the military chief of staff, a post normally among the most revered and popular among Israeli Jews. General Eisenkot had drawn criticism for saying in a speech a day before the Azaria verdict that an    in the army was not “everybody’s child,” but a soldier and a fighter with a mission. “Gadi, Gadi, beware, Rabin is looking for a friend,” the protesters sang, referring to Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel who was assassinated in 1995 by a   Jewish extremist. The three judges who formed the military tribunal were placed under guard. The backlash was not long in coming, and was equally charged. The popular Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper gathered half a dozen former chiefs of staff and photographed them for Sunday’s front page, with the headline: “Behind you, Gadi. ” Days earlier, an army reservist who is well known to Israelis  —   as are many war heroes  —   captured national attention with a plea for unity after the Azaria verdict. The reservist, Capt. Ziv Shilon, who lost one arm in an explosion along the Gaza border and was severely injured in the other arm, wrote in an emotional Facebook post: “Yes, I, who never cried in the hardest moments that I do not wish on anybody, sat today and simply cried. ” “I cried,” he wrote, “over the hands that I left in Gaza and I asked myself perhaps for the first time in my life, was it worth fighting for a nation that hates itself?” Mr. Shilon announced plans to sit in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square  —   named for the prime minister who was slain there in 1995  —   on Saturday night with a huge placard calling to bring back solidarity and mutual respect, even if he had to sit there alone. Instead, he was joined by thousands. Micah Goodman, an   Jewish philosopher, said that the Israelis’ “automatic identification” with soldiers sometimes led to “irrational” results. That was the common thread, he said, between the cries for a pardon for Sergeant Azaria and the contentious decision in 2011 to trade more than 1, 000 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom had been convicted of deadly terrorist acts against Israelis, for one Israeli soldier who was being held captive in Gaza. “Having that soft spot for soldiers is part of the Israeli solidarity, and it is part of what is really unique about Israel,” Mr. Goodman said. “The weakness of Israel is also part of the power of Israel. ”"

Groucho Marx was never more devastatingly accurate than when he observed that “politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies”. Groucho would have had a field day mocking the perilous nonsense of green politics, where the remedies are often not just wrong but even dangerous.



Not only does all the evidence suggest that green catastrophists are gravely misdiagnosing any possible threat from the mild warming period of the last century, but their favoured solution, green energy, is threatening to make things exponentially worse.



It’s the most powerful greenhouse gas known to humanity, and emissions have risen rapidly in recent years […] leaks of the little-known gas in the UK and the rest of the EU in 2017 were the equivalent of putting an extra 1.3 million cars on the road.



Levels are rising as an unintended consequence of the green energy boom.



The Beeb then does their best to gloss over that fact, by wittering that SF6 is “widely used in the electrical industry”. But the fact remains that renewable energy is placing unprecedented strain on power grids, necessitating the rollout of vast amounts of switchgear using SF6.



“As renewable projects are getting bigger and bigger, we have had to use it within wind turbines specifically,” said Costa Pirgousis, an engineer with Scottish Power Renewables on its new East Anglia wind farm, which doesn’t use SF6 in turbines.



“As we are putting in more and more turbines, we need more and more switchgear and, as a result, more SF6 is being introduced into big turbines off shore.”



This is disingenuous. The wind farm might not use SF6 in its turbines, but it uses it by the tank load in the switchgear used to protect the grid from the stop-and-start surges inherent in wind power.



South Australia’s catastrophic, state-wide blackout is a case in point of how renewables, wind, in particular, can crash whole systems. Although green advocates try to obscure the facts, by blaming collapsed pylons, which did happen, the fact is that the blackout was triggered **before** the pylons collapsed. The culprit was wind turbines fritzing out on an exceptionally windy day.



Concentrations [of SF6] in the atmosphere are very small right now, just a fraction of the amount of CO2 in the air.



However, the global installed base of SF6 is expected to grow by 75% by 2030.



Because of the demand for renewables in a market artificially distorted by government meddling.



Still, Greens refuse to admit their culpability, trying to shift the blame on to big, bad energy corporations.



“In the end, the electrical industry lobby was too strong and we had to give in to them,” said Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout […]



“The electric sector was very strong in arguing that if you want an energy transition, and you have to shift more to electricity, you will need more electric devices. And then you also will need more SF6.



“They used the argument that otherwise the energy transition would be slowed down […]”



Which was correct. The Greens just can’t admit that it’s their precious renewables which are causing soaring usage of this greenhouse gas on steroids.



“There is no real alternative that is proven,” said Prof Manu Haddad from the school of engineering at Cardiff University.



Greens love to bang on about a supposed “precautionary principle”. This is the idea that you should never, ever do anything, least of all roll out a new technology, unless you’re absolutely, 100% sure it will have no harmful consequences whatsoever.



 **Unless it’s their sacred eco-crucifixes – which are proving to be very harmful indeed.**

"Climate Research needs Re-direction
Governments are running huge deficits, but still spend billions on “climate research” especially trying to model the effect of the atmosphere and its trace of carbon dioxide on surface temperature. Benefits are hard to find. It may have improved weather forecasts by a day or so, but official long-term predictions have not improved in the last fifty years. This is because carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is not the main driver of weather or climate.

“What is referred to reverently as “climate research” is mainly just grubby advocacy supporting the political war on carbon. Why are we still funding scientists who believe that “the science is settled”? If they believe that they know the answers, what are they are doing with their research funds?”
Around the world there are five official weather data-bases, about 14 weather satellites (some say there are 88 of them!), 73 climate computer models, at least 30 research groups and thousands of academics receiving grants and attending never-ending climate conferences. Much of this torrent of public money is now focussed on trying to torture a climate confession out of one normally un-noticed and totally innocent trace gas in the atmosphere – carbon dioxide.
The major determinants of surface weather are latitude, earth’s rotation, the seasons, the sun with its variable radiations and orbital changes; and nearness to the oceans which maintain the water cycle, moderate temperatures and house massive volcanic chains.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany there have been rumors that the alleged Antarctic Seymour Island “all-time Antarctic record high” of 20.75°C set on February 9th is a hoax – originating by the AFP news agency and then spread by The Guardian.
The alleged 20.75°C was supposedly logged by Brazilian scientists and was supposedly almost a full degree higher than the previous record of 19.8C, taken on Signy Island in January 1982, The Guardian blared with much alarm, citing its own rush job chart.
Currently the WMO is seeking to obtain the actual temperature data for Seymour Island, part of a chain of islands off the Antarctic peninsula.
WMO cites media as source!
The WMO website itself is citing the media as its source, writing: “Media reports say that researchers logged a temperature of 20.75°C. Mr Cerveny cautioned that it is premature to say that Antarctica has exceeded 20°C for the first time.”
Thermometer data show only 16°C!
According to German Facebook site Klima.Wissen here and its readers, the “all-time record high reading” of 20.75°C appears to have its origins from the AFP news agency. It was then picked up by the always climate sensational The Guardian. But now the whole story is beginning to appear as just big sensational hoax.
First, WetterOnline.de here shows that the high temperature on February 9th at the Seymour Island station (Base Murambio) was merely 16°C!

 
There was much ado over the record set at the Antarctic station Esperanza, which was reported to have reached 18.4° on February 7. Here Wetteronline.de confirms it, as does the Argentine National Meteorological Service:


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





So what’s going on at the Seymour Island station? 16°C is not even close to the claimed 20.75°C record reading screamed out bloody-murder by the media across the globe. Maybe the Seymour station operators breathed on an unofficial thermometer outside, snapped a photo, and sent it out to the media. Who knows.
The chart The Guardian published is totally different from the one at the official wetteronline.de.
Looking at the Accuweather February temperatures, so far we see a high of only 7°C 0n February 9, 2020!

Depicted in tabular form:

We’ll keep an open mind, though, and see what comes out officially. But it would be awfully embarrassing if the record never really happened. Right now the media and alarmists can only hope that the WMO will play along with the hoax and just say it happened so that the global alarmist media complex can save its face.
But the thermometer is sure telling us a very different story.
Will take some time to confirm the reading
“We first need to analyse the very important station metadata, e.g., location, type of equipment, measurement practices, calibration of the instruments, etc.) from the researchers involved.  Once we have those data, we can begin a formal evaluation as to the observation’s validity.  Unfortunately, accomplishing those tasks does not happen quickly (particularly with remote polar weather stations) so it will likely be some time before we at the WMO Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes can even give a tentative evaluation of this observation,” WMO’s Weather and Climate Extremes rapporteur, Randall Cerveny said.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\-----   
  
Climate alarmism is like one of those pop-up Bozos. No matter how many times you bop it, up it springs. In fact, the only way to stop it, as most kids learn, is to deflate it. In this case, the air inside Bozo is your and my tax money.   
  
Two scientific papers released last week combine for a powerful 1-2 haymaker, but, rest assured, Bozo springs eternal. The first says that human aerosol emissions are not that responsible for offsetting the warming influence of greenhouse gas emissions, while the second finds that the observed warming from human greenhouse gases is less than a lot of people think.   
  
We aren’t at all surprised by the first result. The cooling effect of sulphate particulates, which go into the air along with carbon dioxide when fossil fuels (mainly coal) are combusted, was only invoked in the mid-1980s, when the lack of warming predicted by computer models was embarrassingly obvious.   
  
This is the kind of thing that the iconic historian of science, Thomas Kuhn, predicted in his classic book, _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_. When a scientific “paradigm” is assaulted by reality, increasingly ornate and bizarre explanations are put forth to keep it alive. Sulfates smelled like one of those to us back in the 1980s, and now it looks like the excuses are finally getting comeuppance.   
  
The second result also comes as little news to us, as we have been saying for years that the human carbon dioxide emissions are not the only player in the climate change game.   
  
The two new papers, in combination, mean that the human influence on the climate from the burning of fossil fuels is far less than what the IPCC’s ensemble of climate models says it is. This also goes for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the EPA ,and the White House.   
  
Rest assured, though, Bozo will rise again—despite a near-continuous barrage of blows supporting the idea that the climate’s sensitivity to human greenhouse gas emissions is far too low to justify any of the expensive and futile actions emanating from Washington and Brussels.



The aerosol paper describes research by a team of Israeli scientists led by Gerald Stanhill (from the ARO Volcani Center) who examined the causes of “solar dimming” and “solar brightening” that have taken place over the past half-century or so. Solar brightening (dimming) refers to multidecadal periods when more (less) solar radiation is reaching the surface of the earth. All else being equal (dangerous words in Science), the earth’s surface would warm during periods of brightening and cool during dimming. Solar dimming has been reported to have taken place from the 1950s through the 1980s and since then there has been a period of recovery (i.e., brightening). These patterns have been linked by many to human aerosol emissions caused by pernicious economic activity, with heavy emissions leading to global cooling from the 1950s (witness the opaque air of Pittsburgh and London) through the late 1970s and then, as air quality was cleaned up and aerosol emissions declined, an unmasking of the warming impact from greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
This is an essential storyline that might as well have been written by Kuhn. Without invoking the previously undiscovered masking impact of human aerosols, climate models predict that far more global warming should have happened as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions than has been observed, even by the 1980s. Behaving more predictably than the climate, federal climatologists, led by Tom Wigley of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (hey, we couldn’t make up the name of that exclusively taxpayer-funded monster), relied on the aerosol “knob” to try to keep climate models from overheating.   
  
Stanhill et al. have bad news for the feds. In their new paper, they examine the records of sunshine duration as recorded at five observation sites with long-term observations. When comparing these sunshine histories with fossil fuel use histories (a proxy for aerosol emissions) from nearby areas, they find very little correspondence. In other words, human aerosol emissions aren’t to blame for much of the solar dimming and brightening.   
  
What may be the cause? Variations in cloud cover.   
  
According to Stanhill and colleagues:   




It is concluded that at the sites studied changes in cloud cover rather than anthropogenic aerosols emissions played the major role in determining solar dimming and brightening during the last half century and that there are reasons to suppose that these findings may have wider relevance.



Admittedly, there are only a small number of stations that were being analyzed, but Stanhill et al. have this to say:   




This conclusion may be of wider significance than the very small number of sites examined in this study would suggest as the sites sampled Temperate - Maritime, Mediterranean, Continental and Tropical climates,… and covered a wide range of rates of anthropogenic aerosol emission.



The implications are that human aerosols have played a lot smaller role in the global temperature variability of the past 50 years than is generally taken to be the case. And if human aerosols are not responsible for muting the _expected_ temperature rise from greenhouse gas emissions, then it seems that the _expected_ rise is too much. That is, the earth’s temperature is less sensitive to rising greenhouse gas concentrations than forecasted by governmental climate models, and therefore we should expect less warming in the future.   
  
The second paper, published last week in _Science_ , is yet another study trying to explain the “pause” in the rise of global average surface temperatures. Using annual data from the University of East Anglia temperature history—the one that scientists consult the most, we are now in our 18th year without a warming trend.   
  
(For a revealing exposé on how even this data is being jimmied to fit the paradigm, see what just showed up in the most recent _Weekend Australian_.)   
  
University of Washington’s Xianyao Chen and Ka-Kit Tung found that a naturally occurring change in ocean circulation features in the Atlantic Ocean can act to enhance or suppress the magnitude of heat that is transferred from the surface into the ocean depths. The authors find that this natural cycling was responsible for burying additional heat since the late 1990s while maintaining surface heating during the previous three decades. Coupled with earlier research (Tung and Zhou, 2013), they figure that a substantial portion (~40%) of the rise in the global surface temperatures that has occurred since the mid-20th century was caused by natural variability in the circulation of the Atlantic Ocean.   
  
The implication here is pretty clear—the role that human greenhouse gas emissions play in the observed warming isn’t what it was cracked up to be. And, with a little nudge from other variables—like the sun—the quaint myth that “all scientists agree that the majority of warming since 1950 has been caused by human activity” does look more and more like another pop-up Bozo.   
  
Taken together, the two paper combination strikes a haymaker to the alarmist mantra—that dangerous climate change will result from greenhouse gas emissions. The Stanhill paper suggests that the projected warming wasn’t so masked by sulfate aerosols, and the Chen and Tung paper argues that less of the warming is due to a human influence anyway. This combination—greater warming pressure and less temperature change—means that the IPCC and federal climate models are just way off.   
  
_Going forward, we should expect much less human-induced global warming than government-fueled climate models project._   
  
If this refrain sounds familiar, it is because we find ourselves frequently reporting on the subject of the earth’s climate sensitivity (how much warming results for a given input of carbon dioxide). This issue is the biggest key to understanding anthropogenic climate change, and, because evidence continues to mount that the climate sensitivity is much less than advertised, there will be much more where this came from.   
  
But Bozo, inflated by public monies, will spring eternal.

" Stéphane PerraultChief Electoral Officer of CanadaElections Canada30 Victoria StreetGatineau, QuebecK1A 0M6August 27, 2019 Dear M. Stéphane Perrault,Re: ENGO charity spending during the election period and reference to climate change;Thank you to Elections Canada for recognizing that climate change has become a political issue. Since environmental non-governmental organizations/charities have disproportionate financial resources, media power, and social influence, they significantly sway public opinion on a highly contentious and partisan issue. As outlined below, the environmental charities’ claims are proving to be highly controversial. Canadian scientists, and those from around the world, have very strong evidence that human industrial activity is not the primary cause of global warming. Equally troubling is the political efforts by these charities to create a “climate change emergency” where one does not exist. Scientists have recently called for the authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SR15 report to calm public fears as there is no ‘climate deadline.’[1] Plenty of evidence refutes the claims of the Canadian Climate Change Report (CCR2019).[2] “Climate emergency” is a theme dreamt up by a clinical psychologist to re-brand the issue, not a scientist.[3]  Global media are making coordinated efforts on this faulty theme through “Covering Climate Now.”[4] [5] This press-propaganda campaign is contrary to all principles of Freedom of the Press and democracy. The much vaunted 2°Celsius target (to allegedly keep earth’s temperature stable) was arbitrarily set by an economist, long before any adequate scientific or satellite assessments of global climate.[6] More importantly, there is no consensus that human industrial activity is mainly responsible for global warming or climate change. Faulty premises lead to poor public policy on climate as outlined in our report.[7] Here are some key points in this highly political topic. The Science on Climate is Complex and UncertainAs the IPCC itself stated in the 3rd Assessment report: “In climate modelling and research, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled, non-linear, chaotic system and that therefore long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” The IPCC reported in 2013 there had been 15 years of hiatus in global warming; despite a significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. This led Dr. Judith Curry and other scientists to affirm that: “Carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can fine tune climate.”[8] There is no consensus about the cause of climate change.[9] Environmental Charities have more money than political parties combinedFew Canadians realize that ENGO, tax-subsidized charities have more financial power than political parties combined. From 2000-2018, the top 40 ENGOs and EnviroLaw counterparts received almost $11.4 billion in revenues. Total revenues received by all four main federal political parties over the period was about $631 million. Revenues received by the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts over the period were over 18 times the revenues received by all federal political parties. [10] Our four reports on the ENGO industry show that their political, social and financial power is overwhelming.[11] Environmental Charities have been funded by foreign interests that also fund and influence academics and the media. These ENGOs have claimed that climate change is a “crisis” for over a decade now, and many of them have been funded by, or are party to, the foreign “Tar Sands Campaign”[12] [13] or the ClimateWorks “Design to Win”[14] program. This is a global plan by foreign green billionaires to create a global cap and trade system, carbon pricing and to put $12 trillion in their vested interest renewables (wind and solar) on the power grid, largely by demarketing the use of coal, natural gas and oil/oilsands.[15] [16]  Everything in the modern world, including wind turbines and solar panels, requires fossil fuels in order to exist. Renewables cannot support even the most basic energy needs of society.[17] As Ottawa energy policy consultant, Robert Lyman explains, we need to ‘transition to reality.’[18] Prof. Emeritus Dr. Vaclav Smil, a world-renown energy expert, says: “Energy Revolution? More like a crawl.”[19] The push for renewables relies almost entirely on the claim that the use of fossil fuels will lead to a climate catastrophe, even though the scientific evidence does not support this claim. The IPCC, in correspondence to us, confirm that they have no peer-reviewed studies supporting the claim that renewables are a suitable replacement for conventional energy supply.[20] As noted in Dr. Matthew Nisbet’s paper on the ClimateWorks partners, the green billionaires also fund most academics and most non-profit journals.[21] ENGOs lead Canadians down a path to danger. Can Canada survive climate change policy? Climate change policies have negatively affected Canada. [22] The undue influence of ENGOs and their financial power and associated vested interests have driven this agenda. Are other nations meeting their Paris Agreement targets? No. Most have no intention of doing so. Thus, Canada – a vast, resource-rich nation – puts it natural wealth and domestic sovereignty at risk for ‘green’ ideology alone.[23] Will Canada’s contribution make a difference to global climate? No.  It is a case of Futile Folly – “…extraordinarily expensive and dangerous political grandstanding…. Canadians deserve better.” [24] Will Canadians get hundreds of dollars in rebates annually from carbon taxes? Not compared to the hundreds of dollars they will lose. The Parliamentary Budget Office notes that the carbon price will have to rise from the 2022 price of $50/tonne to $102/t by 2030 in order for Canada to reach its self-imposed target of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.[25] Competitor nations like China have a $2/t carbon tax, the world average is $8/t, and the US, our largest trading partner has a $0/t carbon tax.  Presently, Canadian fuel taxes alone equal a $192/t carbon tax. Yet, the ENGO charity Ecojustice wants the unattainable Paris GHG targets enshrined in law.[26] You have received an open letter from a large group of scientists[27] in support of ENGO advertising on climate change; claiming it is not a political issue and not debatableThis, in fact, is the crux of the matter before you.  Climate science is not settled. As shown, climate change has become a highly politicized issue. No matter the number of signatories, as Dr. Nir Shaviv has said: “Science is not a democracy. Science is about evidence.” [28] Natural causes have always had a major role in climate change. It is clear that the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change, not you, not CO2.[29] Canadian ENGOs have far too much financial and media power and are rife with single-minded ideology that is not representative of the robust evidence of natural influence on climate being greater than that of humankind. Climate change science must be debated. Powerful, foreign-or-vested interest-funded ENGOs must not take the spotlight. Friends of Science Society is an apolitical organization that advocates for open, civil debate on climate science and related energy policies.  Thank you for the review of our submission. Sincerely,Friends of Science SocietyP.O.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding in the difference between climate and climate _change_.   
  
This is on very public display in the president’s recently unveiled Climate Action Plan, which details a series of executive actions designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to control the future course of the climate.   
  
In justifying the need for these actions, and why he doesn’t have time to wait for Congress to act, the president points to numerous recent examples of extreme weather disasters while linking weather extremes to climate change brought about by anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions.   
  
In doing so, he goes awry of the best science.   
  
Here’s why.   




The natural climate of the U.S. includes all manner of extreme weather events—hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, heatwaves, cold outbreaks, derechos, and virtually every other type of bad weather you can dream up.   
  
This is true now, just as it was 100 years ago, before greenhouse gases were being emitted to the atmosphere in large quantities from human activities—primarily the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy.   
  
Human-caused climate _change_ is an incremental pressure to slightly alter the character of weather events, for example, their frequency and/or magnitude. This includes weather events both extreme and otherwise. The nature of this alteration, if it occurs at all, is scientifically uncertain for most types of weather.   
  
In other words, every time there is some sort of weather “disaster” you don’t need to invoke climate _change_ to explain it. A simple climate explanation will usually suffice. In fact, bringing climate change into the explanation usually runs afoul of our current scientific understanding. It is as easy to argue that climate change mitigates (or even averts) weather disasters as it is to argue that it augments them.   
  
But folks pushing for greenhouse gas regulations don’t often let the facts get in the way.   
  
This includes the president, as well as many of his federal advisors.   
  
For example, Roger Pielke Jr., a leader in the field of weather disaster trends, tweeted this about the president’s speech on Tuesday:   




@RogerPielkeJr “Will be interesting to see if anyone on the side of climate action will care that Obama's plan begins w/ false claims about disaster trends”



And in our recent review of the draft version of the government’s latest _National Assessment_ report, we point out the pervasive confusion between climate and climate change within the report. For example, regarding impacts on the transportation sector, we note:   




It is not climate _change_ , but the vagaries of the climate itself that have the greatest impact on U.S. transportation. Climate change, to the degree that it is detectable and identifiable, contributes a mix of impacts, some positive and some negative, and the net impact has never been reliably quantified or monetized.   
  
The impacts of climate and climate change are confused and thus used interchangeably, however, such usage is incorrect and misleading.



Perhaps the biggest reason why it is easy to confuse climate and climate change, is that it _appears_ that the weather is getting worse—that is, there are more, and more costly, extreme weather events. The climate must be changing to make this happen, right?   
  
Wrong.   
  
What is changing, besides increased media (both mainstream and social) coverage, is that there are more people, with more (valuable) stuff, in harm’s way.   
  
So, even in a constant climate, the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events—such as those included in the government’s annual list of “Billion Dollar Weather/Climate Disasters”—will increase.   
  
Yet the president points to this increase and links it to human-caused climate change.   
  
This is wrong, and this is what Roger Pielke Jr. was referring to in his tweet.   
  
And Roger should know. He has jus published a paper examining trends in tornado losses in the U.S. from 1950 through 2011. It shows that while raw damage has been on the rise, when adjusted for socioeconomic changes (like population, income, housing units, GDP), there has actually been a sharp decline. Further, the decline in damages may in fact be related with a _decline in strong tornado events_ , although the data are not robust enough to know for sure. Quoting from the conclusions of is paper:   




The analysis presented in this paper indicates that normalized tornado damage in the US from1950 to 2011 declined in all three normalization methods applied (two are statistically significant one is not). The degree to which this decrease is the result of an actual decrease in the incidence of strong tornadoes is difficult to assess due to inconsistencies in reporting practices over time. However, an examination of trends within sub-periods of the dataset is suggestive that some part of the long-term decrease in losses may have a component related to actual changes in tornado behaviour. Further research is clearly needed to assess this suggestion.



Roger has also studied losses from hurricanes and floods and in both cases found that once demographics changes are taken into account the upward trend in losses disappears.   
  
So the science shows that increasing losses from extreme weather events is caused by more people and more wealth, but the president tells us that it is a result of human-caused climate change and invokes executive action to try to stop it.   
  
His efforts are doomed to fail from the outset (assuming his Climate Action Plan doesn't drive down the population or the economy). ****

People don’t like being forced to purchase things they may not want, which is why over half of us are hoping that the Supreme Court throws out the individual insurance mandate in President Barack Obama’s health care plan.



There’s also a worldwide rebellion brewing against being forced to purchase expensive electricity produced by so‐​called “renewable” sources, now being exacerbated by the availability of very cheap natural gas from shale formations.



But, here in the U.S. there are some 30 different statewide “renewable portfolio standards” (RPSs) that also mandate pricey power, usually under the guise of fighting dreaded global warming.



RPSs command tha. a certain percentage of electricity has to come from wind, solar, geothermal, or biomass. Given that this power generally costs a lot more than what comes from a modern coal or gas plant, your local utility passes the cost on in the form of higher bills, which the various state utility commissions are only too happy to approve in the name of saving the planet.





When are governments going to learn that they ought to butt out of the energy business?



RPSs generally do not include hydroelectric power, which produces no carbon dioxide. It’s also much more predictable than solar or wind, and costs about the same as the average for gas and coal combined. It’s not in the portfolio standards because dams are soooo 20th century, and it isn’t a darling of the green lobby, like solar, wind and biomass. But hydro can deliver more juice than solar is ever likely to.



Nor do RPSs allow for natural gas. There are massive quantities in shale formations around the country, and new horizontal drilling techniques are releasing so much of it that it is now the cheapest source of electrical power. If our environmentalist friends were at all serious about climate change, they would enthuse over it becaus. it produces significantly less carbon dioxide than an equivalent quantity of coal when used for power generation. Instead, they are horrified that cheap gas will destroy solar and wind.



Their worries are quite well‐​founded. In November, NextEra Energy, the country’s largest wind‐​energy producer, said it would develop no new wind projects this year, as utilities sell cheaper gas power.



When are governments going to learn that they ought to butt out of the energy business? RPSs that specify certain technologies are essentially picking winners and losers based more upon political pull than market logic.



One needs to look no further than ethanol as a motor fuel, mandated by the feds. Sold as “renewable” and reducing pernicious carbon dioxide emissions, it actually produces more in its life cycle than simply burning an equivalent amount of gasoline. It also—unconscionably—consumes 40% of U.S. corn production, and we are the by far the world’s largest producer of this important basic food.



The popular revulsion against ethanol has succeeded in cutting its massive federal subsidy, of $0.54 per gallon, which ran out on Dec. 31. But that doesn’t stop the federal mandate. Last year it was for roughly 14 billion gallons from corn and it will be nearly 15 billion in 2012. By 2022, up to 20 billion gallons will be required — all from corn — unless there is a breakthrough in so‐​called “cellulosic” ethanol, which, no matter how much money the government throws at it, hasn’t happened. Indeed, the largest cellulosic plant, Range Fuels, in Camilla, Ga., just went bankrupt. The loss to American taxpayers appears to be about $120 million, or about 25% of a Solyndra.



Don’t expect Congress to zero the ethanol mandate anytime soon. Farm country tends to be conservative on pretty much everything except propping up corn prices, which is what ethanol mandates do.



Having seen the ethanol debacle, will the states put solar and wind in their rightful (small) niches by repealing the RPSs? Increasing utility bills with renewable mandates is politically dangerous, and there is less and less political will to subsidize and otherwise prop up energy sources and technologies that cost too much.



Look for a movement in the many state legislatures that approved the outrageous RPSs without asking people how they liked being forced to buy something they don’t want. Or will cheaper natural gas and hydro be allowed in the standards in the place of wind and solar? There is likely to be some legislation introduced this year and a lot more in the future, as the U.S. catches on to the great renewable energy scam.

"**Common estimates for global food waste are too low, according to Dutch researchers, who suggest every person in the world is wasting about 500 calories of food a day.**
Without waste, we could feed five people instead of four, they said.
The study found food waste goes up with the increase of money in our pockets, possibly reaching more than twice the levels we thought previously.
Reducing food waste is a key challenge in fighting climate change.
Wasted and lost food accounts for almost 10% of all our greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN.
Stopping food waste is a win for consumers and it's definitely a win for the planet, said Dr Monika van den Bos Verma of Wageningen University in The Netherlands.
""Throwing food out in your dustbin is like throwing a five euro note out - why would you do that?""
Previous estimates have put global food waste at 214 calories per day per person (214 kilocalories/day/capita - a kilocalorie is another word for what's commonly called a calorie).
The researchers looked in detail at the issue of food waste, using data from the FAO, World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO).
Food waste started to rise above a daily income of about seven dollars per day.
And while the FAO estimated food waste to be 214 calories per day per person in the world in 2015, their model for the same year gave a figure of 527 calories.
""What we estimate is that FAO's original estimate of 214 kilocalories per capita per day is actually a vast underestimate of the global food waste as we measure it, because we have a factor two larger estimate of 527 kilocalories per capita per day,"" said Dr Thom Achterbosch, also of Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
Food waste is more of a problem in richer countries than we think but it's also going to rise faster in poorer countries, he added.
""From what we currently have in our kitchens we could feed five persons instead of four if we don't waste,"" he said.
The researchers point to some simple solutions for reducing food waste, such as reducing food portion sizes.
They say behavioural change is important, such as encouraging shoppers to switch from buying in excess or hoarding to buying ""enough"", with the thought that you can always buy more. And food must be valued and appreciated more in society.
The research, published in the journal, Plos One, did not include food lost in the production process before it gets to the consumer. The widely quoted figure of one third of all food available for human consumption lost or wasted is made up of both food lost before it reaches the consumer, which the study did not look at, and food wasted once it arrives in the kitchen.
The figures are global and give a basis for measuring progress towards the international goal to reduce food waste by half between 2015 and 2030.
""It's essentially the most sustainable way to solve part the problem of how to feed the world in the future,"" said co-researcher, Dr Martine Rutten.

" Contributed by William Walter Kay BA LL B © 2019“I have not met one single climate activist who is fighting for the climate for the money. That idea is completely absurd.”https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/this-15-year-old-girl-breaks-swedish-law-for-the-climate-d1a48ab97e3a  Uppsala native Malena Ernman (b. 1970) received formal education from Stockholm’s Royal Music Academy; Orleans’ Musical Conservatory; and the Royal Swedish Opera. While opera is her mainstay Malena also sings jazz and pop. She’s cut 10 albums and two hit singles. While already a celebrity, representing Sweden in the 2009 Eurovision Contest made Malena a household name. In 2010 King Carl anointed her a “court singer.”Malena’s fame may be seconded by her father-in-law, Olaf Thunberg – a fixture in Swedish film and television. Olaf graced 39 films and 26 television programs. He also directed two television series.Olaf’s son (Malena’s husband), Svante, followed Olaf’s thespian footsteps but landed few significant gigs. He manages Malena’s singing career. Both are outspoken environmentalists.Malena co-authored a climate alarmist article for Sweden’s most-read newspaper in June 2017. At this time she forsook air travel for the sake of the climate. In October 2017 WWF-Sweden awarded Malena their Environmental Hero award. In December 2017 Greenpeace Sweden centered out Malena for praise.On May 4, 2018 Malena attended an exclusive climate confab in Stockholm whereat the Stockholm Resilience Centre presented: “Welcome to the Power of Capital.” The gathering allowed Malena to connect with Ingmar Rentzhog.Rentzhog rose to prominence after founding Laika Consulting AB, Sweden’s first crowdfunding site. In early 2018 Laika was purchased by the financial communications agency, FundByMe AB. Rentzhog joined FundByMe’s board; concentrating his skills on the affiliated firm: We Don’t Have Time (WDHT).WDHT is half climate campaigner, half tech start-up. Launched on Earth Day, 2018, WDHT soon attracted 435 investors who now own 75% of its stock. WDHT currently claims 718,000 member/followers.Rentzhog’s forte is utilizing all manner of social media to spread messages. Interviewed in a business zine he declared: “our goal is to be the biggest player on the internet.” WDHT sells carbon offsets; provides internet advertising services for sustainable development firms; and prepares climate ratings on businesses and politicians. WDHT’s board includes directors connected to Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.One WDHT director doubles as COO of Global Utmaning (GU, aka Global Challenge) – an environmentalist think tank with 90 advisers drawn from the highest echelons of Swedish civil society, government and business (including a Wallenberg family rep). GU was founded in 2005 by the uber-wealthy heiress, Kristina Persson. In May 2018 Rentzhog became GU President. Another GU official adorns WDHT’s Advisory Board.Also sitting on WDHT’s Advisory Board is Daniela Rogosic: Global Press Officer for IKEA Group. Rounding out WDHT’s boards are two prestigious behavioural scientists and three veterans of Al Gore’s Climate Reality leadership program. Rentzhog, another Climate Reality vet, confers regularly with Gore.GU advances the interests of Sweden’s climate industrial complex. Arguably more than any other country, Sweden is vested in the climate crusade. Sweden is a world leader in green R&D expenditures and clean tech capital investments.Swedish electricity is CO2 emissions-free. Swedes rely mainly on 2,057 small hydro-electric plants with the balance of their power coming from nuclear and from 3,600 wind turbines. They are also avid bio-fuel burners.Sweden’s economy is based on export-oriented manufacturing. In 2018 over 40% of Swedish exports ($166 billion) consisted of machinery, vehicles and electrical equipment. Examples abound of Swedish manufacturers moiling the climate-rescuing energy transition. Electrolux (55,000 employees) is gaming climate-based fuel efficiency regulations to capture larger shares of Europe’s kitchen and laundry appliance market. Volvo (90,000 employees), as of 2019, builds only fully electric or hybrid cars. Capitalizing on their hydropower experience four Swedish companies export turbines.More generally, carbon-free electricity makes Sweden an attractive venue for transnational manufacturers seeking entry into Europe’s climate puritanical market. A 2019 release from the Sweden Trade and Investment Council pitches:“As the EU sets binding targets for reducing emissions, businesses need to plan ahead for regulatory compliance. By locating in Sweden, energy intensive companies can go the extra mile to boost their green competitive advantage and save costs.”Sweden’s mammoth public pension funds are legendarily sunk into renewables. Pension fund managers inhabit the core of the compact network of ministries, businesses, philanthropies and NGOs (SIDA, IKEA Foundations, Wallenberg Foundations, Stockholm Environmental Institute, Tallberg Foundation, CSR Sweden etc.) propelling Sweden toward hyper-ambitious climate goals.Sweden’s vehicle fleet will be fossil fuel free by 2030. Sweden should hit net zero emissions by 2045. This transformation presumes climate alarmists will maintain hegemony over Sweden. It further requires compelling Europe, in deed the world, to accept climate crisis diktat. While not alone in this racket, Swedes play an outsized role in disseminating climate alarmism. Greta is their most recent offering.The Greta Project foreshadowed itself on April 21, 2018 with the release of promotional excerpts from Scenes from the Heart written by Malena Ernman and Svante Thunberg. The book revisits problems the couple faced raising their two daughters amidst surging familial resolve to protect Earth’s climate.On May 30 (three weeks after Rentzhog’s and Malena’s co-attendance at the climate confab) a Swedish newspaper awarded a laureate to Malena’s 15-year-old daughter, Greta, for her climate crisis essay. In June, Twitter and Instagram accounts were set up for Greta.On August 20 Greta held her homemade “Student Strike for Climate” sign on the sidewalk outside Sweden’s parliament. WDHT’s marketing director took the now ubiquitous “lonely Swedish girl” photos. On August 20, WDHT tweeted their best shot above a text pining: “…imagine how lonely she feels.”The first tweet tagged several accounts including: This Is Zero Hour (a US-based youth climate org); Gore’s Climate Reality Project; and a 350.org front group. Within 24 hours the “lonely Swedish girl” tweet attracted 20,000 likes, shares and comments.On August 23 a Swedish daily printed an article under the “lonely girl” photo. By then 20 students had joined Greta’s strike. On August 24 Scenes from the Heart appeared in seven languages. By August 27 six Swedish newspapers, and Swedish and Danish national television, had interviewed Greta. Leaders from Sweden’s two largest political parties paid respects.On September 1 Sweden’s top newspaper ran the op-ed: The Acute Climate Crisis Requires a Broad Political Gathering – thetakeaway message:“Although much of the change required is both possible and profitable, vigorous political campaigns are essential to adjust prices, taxes and regulations so that the transition to a sustainable society becomes attractive, profitable and fast.”The op-ed was co-signed by: Malena Ernman, Ingmar Rentzhog, Kristina Persson, Mats Andersson (former pension fund supremo, current Vice Chair of GU Foundation) and Anders Wijkman (President of the Tallberg Foundation, co-President of the Club of Rome).By mid-September WDHT reached 18 million social media accounts. They had seven times more followers than all the world’s climate organizations combined; and were adding 10,000 per day.In December Greta attended COP 24 in Katowice, Poland where she met the UN Secretary General, took in a UNFCCC meeting, and was guest panelist at the World Bank’s “Youth Unstoppable” forum. She did photo-shoots and interviews for Time and Teen Vogue. At Katowice, Greta gave her famous accusatory speech (albeit to an empty hall).On December 30 Greta finally met Gore, whom she graciously praised. Then it was off to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos where Greta gilded a panel alongside: Bono, will.i.am, Jane Goodard, Gary Cohn, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.At Davos, Greta gave her: “I want you to panic… and act as if the house is on fire” speech. Excerpts were immediately tweeted by WEF, WWF-UK and Greenpeace International. The Guardian printed the entire speech. CNN and France-24 broadcast long selections. (The ‘house on fire’ meme has been systematically circulated by behavioural scientists within the climate complex since 2016.)While much was made of Greta’s speech being impromptu, she gave the same monologue for the e-commercial “Whatever it takes” two days earlier. (Responding to “haters” Greta recently admitted to having “help” with speech-writing.)On the 32-hour train ride back to Sweden from Davos (like her mom, Greta doesn’t fly) Greta was accompanied by her coach/chaperone, Jennifer Morgan. Jennifer has been a climate commissar for decades. She studied Political Science and German before getting her MA from American U’s School of International Studies. She ran climate programs for WWF and World Resources Institute. She advised Chancellor Merkel and PM Blair. She co-founded Global Call for Climate Action (which churned-out many youth activists). Jennifer is currently Greenpeace International’s Executive Director.In February 2019, Rentzhog decided Greta’s presence on WDHT’s board made for bad optics. She was discretely dropped. Jamie Margolin, Greta’s American equivalent, is WDHT’s “youth adviser.”Greta opened an EC session on February 21. With President Juncker beaming down Greta implored the assembled to: “stop sweeping your mess under the carpet for our generation to clean up.”In March Greta was nominated for a Nobel Prize. In April she toured Rome, addressed the Italian Senate, and met the Pope (who blessed her climate strike). In the UK she addressed parliamentarians and was fawned over by politicians of all stripes. She then walked outside and endorsed Extinction Rebellion’s call for a general strike.Greta’s student strike’s most impressive manifestation (March 15) saw 1.5 million students from 2,000 locales skip class to protest government inaction on the “climate catastrophe.”(While mobilizing youth is hardly new to environmentalism, or to the climate campaign specifically, there is ample evidence of a re-doubled effort on this front dating back several years. A plethora of puppet groups have popped up: Sunrise Movement, Fridays 4 Future, This is Zero Hour, Rise Up, Power Shift, US Youth Climate Movement, and Fossil Free Europe etc.)An authoritarian theme runs beneath innocent little Greta’s blunt statements:“…change is coming whether you like it or not.”“…start focussing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible.”The public politely puts up with such pronouncements from an angelic child in a way they never would from the likes of Gore.When asked how she dealt with “climate deniers.” Greta responded: “I don’t.”Greta’s naivety and “Asperger Syndrome” are spun into virtuous inclinations toward frank truth-telling. Asperger’s patients – high-functioning/low-functioning kids with a tendency to act up – sound a bit like indirect sufferers of “Monster Mom Syndrome.” Greta’s naivety, however, seems real.

The sun has left its signature in data from numerous weather stations, thus challenging meteorologists and climate researchers who falsely claim the sun plays only a minor role.

Image: NASA Earth Observatory (public domain). 
In the 11-year sunspot cycle (Schwabe cycle), the sun generates a start impulse in the sunspot maximum year. Triggered by this start impulse, recurring weather patterns are found in each cycle for about 10 years beginning with the sunspot maximum. 
There is a detection of the solar signal if the beginning of the solar cycle is set a5t the year of the sunspot maximum.
I reported on this at Die kalte Sonne blog here. Using climate data from numerous German weather stations, I have verified a solar imprint. An example is the monthly precipitation amount in Feldberg in the Black Forest, see Figure 1.

Figure 1: Feldberg/Black Forest. Plot of August to October precipitation amount vs sunspot cycle. Image: Laurenz
The precipitation curves run in a saw tooth pattern. They change annually between an upper and lower level. In phases, all curves run parallel. This parallelism is obviously due to a solar impetus in the year of the sunspot maximum. At times, the curves run in opposite directions, maintaining the up and down trend.  This curve could also be influenced by the sun, with delay times varying from year to year and from cycle to cycle. The solar pattern of Feldberg vs rainfall amount in late summer/autumn is detectable at most weather stations along the Rhine River up to the North Sea Islands and Great Britain.
According to previous evaluations, globally solar signals are more likely to appear in the mid-latitudes and less so in the tropics. The signals are by no means always as clear as in the Black Forest. Often they are only detectable in one to three years of the solar cycle, and during one, two or three months of the year. Solar signals are also found in temperature and sunshine duration data, but not as clearly and frequently as in precipitation data.
In the future, a trend forecast going out several years will be possible, but only for periods that have parallel curves. This will be explained using the precipitation data from Des Moines, Iowa, as an example, see Figure 2:

Figure 2: May to August precipitation amount vs sunspot cycle. Des Moines, Iowa. Chart: Laurenz
In Des Moines, the solar signal only becomes visible in cycle years 8 and 9. A trend forecast for 2020 is very uncertain and not possible. In the summer of 2021 (cycle year 8) above-average rainfall is expected, in summer 2022 below average. This “precipitation swing” is directly related to the ENSO dynamics in the Pacific, see Figure 5.
The Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) generates saw tooth curves in many weather trends

//-->




The QBO is a “wind stream” located 20 to 40 kilometres above the equator. In it, the wind direction changes about every 2 years, from west-east to east-west. The time of the wind direction change in the QBO is driven by the sun, see Figure 3. During the sunspot maximum year, the QBO’s wind direction at 20 to 25 kilometers altitude, i.e. in the zone of highest ozone concentration, is east-west in each cycle.

Figure 3: QBO vs solar cycle  in May, at approx. 25 kilometers above the equator. Chart: Laurenz
As with the precipitation data from Feldberg in Figure 1, the QBO index curves bounce up and down between an upper and lower level. During the first five years of the solar cycle the curves with data from 20 to 25 kilometers altitude run in sync in almost all months of the year, obviously triggered by the sun’s drive in the year of the spot maximum. From cycle year 6 onward, phase shifts cause non-synchronized saw tooth curves.
The course of the current cycle curve (red dotted line) deviates in cycle years 3 and 4 from the trend of previous cycles. It is possible that the solar signal in sunspot maximum year of 2014 was not strong enough to align the wind direction in the QBO in the same direction for several years as in the previous stronger sun cycles due to an extremely low sun spot count.
The jagged wind direction pattern of the QBO shown in Figure 3 is transferred to tropospheric wind currents with the procession of high and low pressure areas that influence our weather.
Solar signals from the stratosphere to the Pacific
The solar signal can be detected in all zones of the atmosphere and at the ocean surface. The temperature profile in the stratosphere is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Solar cycle and temperature anomaly, stratosphere, 17 kilometers altitude. Chart: Laurenz
There is a strong correlation between the number of sunspots and the temperature level of the respective cycle. In the first two cycles (red) volcanic effects are to be assumed.
The solar signal is also visible in the temperature trend of the equatorial Pacific or in the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), see Figure 5.

Figure 5: Solar cycle and MEI, 1957 to 2019, in 6 two-month periods. Chart: Laurenz.
The mean value curves of the 4 solar cycles follow a systematic trend. In each of the 4 cycles the strongest El Nino event is in cycle year no. 9, the strongest La Nina event in year 10.
Summary
In the 11-year solar cycle (Schwabe Cycle) the sun generates a start impulse in the sunspot maximum year. Triggered by this start impulse, the data show recurring weather patterns in each sunspot cycle for about 10 years beginning at the sunspot maximum. The solar signal is detectable if the beginning of the solar cycle is taken to be at the year of the sunspot maximum.
Using this, the signals of the Schwabe Cycle from the stratosphere, oceans and the weather trends can be detected without gaps. Solar amplifiers such as UV/ozone dynamics and the interaction between solar activity, cosmic rays and cloud formation have been understood and known for a long time. What is new is the extent to which this amplification impact the weather trends.

Fast backward to February 24, 2009, the date President of Obama’s first State of the Union Speech. The order of battle was “energy, health care, and education”.



That’s right, climate change came _before_ health care. Specifically, he said we should “… invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: energy, health care, and education. It begins with energy… to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change… I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market‐​based cap on carbon pollution.”



Seems easy. He won by a landslide, grabbed a big majority in the House, and with the expected help of some Northeast republicans in the Senate, passage looked like a sure thing. Further, reducing carbon dioxide emissions was bipartisan. Only six months before Obama’s election, Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi recorded a commercial agreeing on the need to stop global warming. Now.





What killed global warming as the President’s number one priority?



Fast forward to January 24, 2012. Education comes before energy. Instead of limiting emissions, he leads off with a call for increased offshore drilling and gas drilling around the country, and finishes by saying “The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.”



What killed global warming as the President’s number one priority? I suspect it was a combination of responsive politics and a blogger by the name of Anthony Watts.



The great crack‐​up started a mere 123 days after Obama’s first SOTU speech, at 7pm on Friday, June 26, 2009, when the House of Representatives gave the President what he wished for: passage of a cap‐​and‐​trade bill cutting U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide 83% in 41 years. By 2050, the average American would be allowed the same emissions produced by a citizen in 1867.



Enviro groups jubilated. Natural Resources Defense Council doubled down, pressing the Senate for even more. The great Green Age had finally arrived!



Three days later, reality hit. On June 29, Scott Rasmussen’s presidential approval index, which is a three day average, went negative, meaning more people he polled “strongly disapproved” of the President than “strongly approved”. Obama’s index has not been positive _for one day since_.



Rasmussen also runs a weekly “generic congressional ballot”, in which pollsters ask what party you would vote if the congressional election were held tomorrow. The same week, it switched from generic Democratic to generic Republican, and it hasn’t been positive democratic _for one week since_.



Senate staffers check the daily tracking index before they go to the bathroom in the morning, so it is not surprising that there was very much hot air and very little substantive movement to pass cap and trade in the upper chamber.



The political price of cap‐​and‐​trade was paid on election day, 2010. Almost every close House race went Republican, if an incumbent Democrat had voted for it. In the Senate, which never considered it, every close race went to the Democrats.



Meanwhile, the public, which never was all that big on it, grew increasingly disenchanted with global warming. When first polled by the Pew Organization in January, 2007, 38% of respondents rated it as a “top priority” for congressional action. This month that figure is 25%, dead last among the twenty possible issues presented by Pew.



The political price was paid, and the public simply tired of the incessant gloom and doom campaign by government scientists, environmental organizations, Al Gore, the Weather Channel, Center for American Progress, every Environmental Science Department in higher education, the public schools, private schools, and Hollywood science experts (of which there are plenty—just ask!).



Standing in the way of this gargantuan effort was a weather nerd in Chico, California, by the name of Anthony Watts, the proprietor of www​.wattsup​with​that​.com. “WUWT” is by far the most popular climate science site in the world, sporting over 100 million hits to date. Watts tirelessly documented seemingly arcane climate science findings, the climategate emails, and promoted the healthiest debate in the world on the interaction of science and politics.



Not everything on WUWT is right, that’s for sure. But the sense of free inquiry and thought Watts has fostered on his site has shamed the climate apocalypse machine into inconsequence. David whupped Goliath, one of the most amazing achievements in the history of science communication.



WUWT publicized the two batches of “Climategate” emails detailing some pretty awful behavior by people who are not my friends. WUWT covered the disastrous UN global warming confab in Copenhagen in December, 2009 (where President Obama learned America’s place in the climate policy world was a spot called nowhere), and Watts publicized the revelation of glaring science mistakes by the UN, as well as the raging debate on why surface temperatures haven’t warmed for fourteen years.



It’s probable that the reaction to a politically unwise cap and trade bill, and tireless work of an obscure weather forecaster from the northeast corner of the Sacramento Valley killed climate change.
"
"

I see that my colleague Sallie James has already blogged on the inherent protectionism in the Senate’s long-awaited cap-and-tax bill. A summary was leaked last night by _The Hill_.   
  
Well, we now have the real “discussion draft” of “The American Power Act” [APA], sponsored by John Kerry (D-NH) and Joe Lieberman (I-CT). Lindsay Graham (R-SC) used to be on the earlier drafts, but excused himself to have a temper tantrum.   
  
So, while Sallie talked about the trade aspects of the bill, I’d like to blather about the mechanics, costs, and climate effects. If you don’t want to read the excruciating details, stop here and note that it mandates the impossible, _will not_ produce any meaningful reduction of planetary warming, and it _will_ subsidize just about every form of power that is too inefficient to compete today.   




APA reduces emissions to the same levels that were in the Waxman-Markey bill passed by the House last June 26. Remember that one -- snuck through on a Friday evening, just so no one would notice? Well, people did, and it, not health care, started the angry townhall meetings last summer. No accident, either, that Obama’s approval ratings immediately tanked.   
  
Just like Waxman-Markey, APA will allow the average American the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen back in 1867, a mere 39 years from today. Just like Waxman-Markey, the sponsors have absolutely no idea how to accomplish this. Instead they wave magic wands for noncompetitive technologies like “Carbon Capture and Sequestration” (“CCS”, aka “clean coal”), solar energy and windmills, and ethanol (“renewable energy”), among many others.   
  
Just like Waxman-Markey, no one knows the (enormous) cost. How do you put a price on something that doesn’t exist? We simply don’t know how to reduce emissions by 83%. Consequently, APA is yet another scheme to make carbon-based energy so expensive that you won’t use it.   
  
This will be popular! At $4.00 a gallon, Americans reduced their consumption of gasoline by a whopping 4%. Go figure out how high it has to get to drop by 83%.   
  
Oh, I know. Plug-in hybrid cars will replace gasoline powered ones. Did I mention that the government-produced Chevrolet Volt is, at first, only going to be sold to governments and where it is warm because even the Obama Administration fears that the car will not be very popular where most of us live. Did I mention that the electric power that charges the battery most likely comes from the combustion of a carbon-based fuel? Getting to that 83% requires getting rid of carbon emissions from power production. Period. In 39 years. Got a replacement handy?   
  
Don’t trot out natural gas. It burns to carbon dioxide and water, just like coal. True, it’s about 55% of the carbon dioxide that comes from coal per unit energy, but we’ll also use a lot more more electricity over the next forty years. In other words, switching to natural gas will keep adding emissions to the atmosphere.   
  
Anyway, just for fun, I plugged the APA emissions reduction schedule into the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC -- I am _not_ making this up), which is what the United Nations uses to estimate the climatic effects of various greenhouse-gas scenarios.   
  
I’ve included two charts with three scenarios. One is for 2050 and the other for 2100. They assume that the “sensitivity” of temperature to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide is 2.5°C, a number that many scientists think is too high, given the pokey greenhouse-effect warming of the planet that has occurred as we have effectively gone half way to a doubling already. The charts show prospective warming given by MAGICC.   
  
The first scenario is “business-as-usual”, the perhaps too-optimistic way of saying a nation without APA. The second assumes that only the US does APA, and the third assumes that each and every nation that has “obligations” under the UN’s Kyoto Protocol on global warming does the same.   






As you can plainly see, APA does nothing, even if all the Kyoto-signatories meet its impossible mandates. The amount of warming “saved” by 2100 is 7% of the total for Business-as-Usual, or two-tenths of a degree Celsius. That amount will be barely detectable above the year-to-year normal fluctuations. Put another way, if we believe in MAGICC, APA -- if adopted by us, Europe, Canada, and the rest of the Kyotos -- will reduce the prospective temperature in 2100 to what it would be in 2093.   
  
That’s a big if. Of course, we could go it alone. In that case, the temperature reduction would in fact be too small to measure reliably.   
  
I’m hoping these numbers surface in the “debate” over APA.   
  
So there you have it, the new American Power Act, a bill that doesn’t know how to achieve its mandates, has a completely unknown but astronomical cost, and doesn’t do a darned thing about global warming. Such a deal!

Guest ridiculing by David Middleton
This post employs Billy Madison as a euphemism.
Fossil fuel divestment is, by definition,  Billy Madisoned.  It is a concerted effort hold back or slow down fossil fuel production by cutting off access to capital.  Fossil fuel divestment is “a really futile and stupid gesture”.   An investment can only be divested if an investor is willing to invest in the divested interest.  
Perhaps realizing that fossil fuel divestment is nothing but “a really futile and stupid gesture”, Alicia Seiger, a lecturer at Stanford Law School and an affiliate of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, has determined that divestment is not sufficient…
Mother Nature is Not Calling for DivestmentMay 20, 2019     By Alicia SeigerRelated Organization(s): Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and FinanceIn honor of Earth Day, Harvard University students, faculty and alumni held rallies to pressure the university’s $39.2 billion endowment to divest from fossil-fuel related companies. Having scored what sounded like a victory five years ago, when Stanford University announced a coal divestment decision, Fossil Free Stanford is doubling down to demand the school’s $26 billion endowment sell oil and gas stocks. The divestment rallying cry has been echoing across the halls of elite universities, through US state legislatures (which govern state pension funds), and as far north as Norway, home to the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, for more than half a decade. While some calls appear to have been answered, the response won’t move the climate needle far enough or fast enough and meanwhile, pensions and endowments remain woefully underprepared to weather climate change. The divestment movement has been helpful in drawing attention to the impact of climate change on investment portfolios and increasing the stigma around fossil fuel companies. It was also well-timed. Less than two years after Bill McKibben first ignited calls for endowments to go ‘fossil-free’…[…]Stanford Law School Blogs
Let’s pause right there.  Do these buffoons have any idea how Billy Madisoned the phrase “fossil-free” is?  Or how Billy Madisoned  it is to take credit for a “a disastrous five-year run” for oil & gas stocks due to the collapse in oil prices in late 2014?  It’s particularly Billy Madisoned  because she even cites the real reason for low oil prices…
[…]The US shale boom had much more to do with driving asset values down than carbon math, but lower prices forced portfolio managers to reconsider what had long been their highest performing asset class.[…]Stanford Law School Blogs
Apparently, just being  Billy Madisoned  wasn’t good enough…
[…][W]hile investors tinker around the margins and activists claim victories, mother nature is sounding a deafening alarm. Fueled by climate change, extreme weather has been decimating economic value across the world. In the past two years alone, global financial losses from hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and other natural disasters amounted to roughly $500 billion. The scale and scope of climate impacts on investment portfolios demand investment and legislative policies more ambitious and effective than divestment. Mother nature is not calling for a Tylenol, she’s demanding interventions that address the root causes of her fever. […]Stanford Law School Blogs
The source she cites for the $500 billion claim…
According to preliminary sigma estimates, total economic losses from natural and man-made catastrophes in 2018 declined to USD 155 billion from USD 350 billion in 2017. Global insured losses are estimated to be around USD 79 billion, higher than the annual average of the previous 10 years. There have been a number of smaller and mid-sized loss-generating disaster events across all regions this year, also affecting regions with well-established insurance cover. Together, these have made 2018 the fourth costliest year on sigma records in terms of losses covered by the insurance industry. Globally, more than 11 000 people have died or gone missing in disaster events in 2018, similar to the number of victims in 2017.Total economic losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters are estimated to be USD 155 billion in 2018. Natural catastrophes caused USD 146 billion of the losses, and man-made disasters USD 9 billion. Of the total economic losses, USD 79 billion have been covered by insurance, down from USD 150 billion in 2017, but more than the previous 10-year annual average (USD 71 billion). Natural catastrophes accounted for USD 71 billion of this year’s insured losses, and man-made disasters for the remaining USD 8 billion. This year is projected to be the fourth most expensive year on sigma records for insurance. More than 11 000 people have died or gone missing in catastrophe events in 2018. The earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia in September had the highest human toll of the year, with over 3 500 estimated dead or missing.[…]Swiss Re Group
My first thought was that $155 billion is less than half of $350 billion.  
My second thought was that natural disasters aren’t all weather-related.
My third thought was that not all weather-related disasters are due to the mild warming Earth has experienced since the coldest climatic episode of the Holocene Epoch, the Little Ice Age.
Little Ice Age bad!
My fourth thought was that we had bad storms before Col. Edwin Drake drilled America’s first oil well… Technically, it wasn’t America’s oil well.  It belonged to the people who paid for its drilling.
Oops!  
Major New England hurricanes (some worse than Sandy) and sea surface temperatures back to 1000 AD.
My fifth thought was that if a warmer Atlantic Ocean caused bad weather, the Medieval Warm Period would have been really bad and the Roman & Minoan Warm Periods must have been veritable schist storms…
 Major New England hurricanes and sea surface temperatures back to 1200 BC.
My sixth thought was that a total elimination of fossils (fossil-free) is impossible.
My seventh thought was that a total elimination of fossil fuels wouldn’t fix the weather any time soon (if ever) and it would kill half of the human population rather quickly.
“Trends in human population and nitrogen use throughout the twentieth century. Of the total world population (solid line), an estimate is made of the number of people that could be sustained without reactive nitrogen from the Haber–Bosch process (long dashed line), also expressed as a percentage of the global population (short dashed line). The recorded increase in average fertilizer use per hectare of agricultural land (blue symbols) and the increase in per capita meat production (green symbols) is also shown.” Erisman et al., 2008
My eighth thought was that the proposed solutions for fixing the weather will cost a lot more than what weather-related disasters are likely ever to cost in the future… And none of the solutions will fix the weather.
My ninth thought was that even if anthropogenic climate change was a contributing factor to the $500 billion, that’s chump change compared to the cost of just about everything else.   In arguendo let’s accept the latest National Climate Assessment’s claim that “extreme weather events and natural disasters caused $91 billion in damages in 2018.” Not all of these costs were to businesses, but we’ll run with that number. What else takes bites out of businesses?
March Madness $13.3 billionShoplifting $44 billionAbsenteeism $84 billionWeather <$91 billionSurfing the Internet $200 billionRegulatory compliance $1,900 billionFederal taxes $3,594 billion
Federal taxes include personal income taxes, Social Security taxes, corporate income taxes, excise taxes and estate taxes because, ultimately, it’s businesses that generate the revenue, enabling the taxation.
The IPCC calculated that it will cost $122 trillion to avoid 1.5 °C of warming relative to the alleged pre-industrial average. The average annual cost through 2050 would be $800 to $2,900 billion…
IPCC Demands $122 Trillion to Fight the Global War on Weather
And there isn’t one shred of evidence that a $122 trillion Global War on Weather will have any effect on the weather.
“Paris climate promises will reduce temperatures by just 0.05°C in 2100” (Bjorn Lomborg)
If all of this wasn’t good enough, we haven’t even gotten to the full-Billy Madison bit yet…
First, asset owners should immediately carve out a climate solutions allocation, staff it with a dedicated team empowered to source deals across all asset classes, and give them an absolute return benchmark. A dedicated allocation will help put climate-friendly investments on a level playing field with more traditional assets and serve to drive a portfolio’s overall sustainability. This type of proactive approach will also be critical in achieving the tripling of low-carbon investment experts indicate is required to achieve the ambition of the Paris Agreement.Next, and this is the big one, investors must establish a process through which all buy, hold or sell decisions are sustainable by 2030, where “sustainable” is defined as being consistent with a 2-degree Celsius or lower warming scenario. The reason for this is not altruism, nor is it a bet on a policy response. This step is about risk management. Markets are not fully pricing climate risk, due in part to incomplete data and inertia. As a result, investors own mispriced assets.[…]Finally, and this cannot be said enough, mother nature has canceled business-as-usual. Investors must recognize that they are taking a bet on climate whether they act or not. Stanford Law School Blogs
Not just “no”… But NO FRACKING WAY!  I make investment decisions based on obtaining the best return on capital over a timeline that is meaningful to me… I’m not making bets on anything that may or may not happen 80 to 200 years in the future.  Nor would I ever trust a dime of my money to someone who would invest on the basis of what they think the weather will be like 80 to 200 years in the future and would intentionally p!$$ some of my money away on carving “out a climate solutions allocation” and staffing it with people who can’t find real jobs because they majored in sciencey-sounding liberal arts subjects.
And then, full Billy Madison went full circle…
“Fossil free” signs often generate a visceral reaction from those on the receiving end. The most disappointing responses are ones that misunderstand the message as demanding “social change” or as “a means to achieve policy ends.”Stanford Law School Blogs
The phrase “fossil-free” earns Ms. Seiger eleventy gazillion Billy Madison’s…



 “’Fossil free’ signs” should draw  “a visceral reaction” from everyone who has a real job, because the “fossil free” crowd is nothing more than a bunch of egg-head miscreants, incapable of holding real jobs,  “demanding ‘social change’” as “a means to achieve policy ends,” namely global socialism.
“This is  probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model, for the first time in human history”, Ms Figueres stated at a press conference in Brussels. “This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution. That will not happen overnight and it will not happen at a single conference on climate change, be it COP 15, 21, 40 – you choose the number. It just does not occur like that. It is a process, because of the depth of the transformation.”UNRIC

Share this...FacebookTwitterA recent study finds that Africa’s freshwater storages are driven by natural variability.

Image: ScienceDirect
Hat-tip: Mary Brown
The authors examined GRACE satellite data and also found that Central Africa’s water storages are partially controlled by deforestation, and in northern Africa are controlled by groundwater extraction.
What follows is the paper’s abstract, which does not mention anthropogenic climate change:
The freshwater resources in Africa are vulnerable to natural variabilities as well as anthropogenic interventions. In this study, temporal (April 2002–June 2017) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data are integrated, in a geographic information system environment, with rainfall, temperature, evapotranspiration, and altimetry remote sensing datasets to monitor the short-term trends in terrestrial water storage (TWS) over the African hydrogeologic systems and to explore their origins. Results show that short-term trends over the African continent are largely driven by natural variability such as changes in rainfall, evapotranspiration, and associated variations in lake levels. Exceptions to this observation include central Africa, where deforestation is found to additionally drive changes in TWS, as well as northern Africa, where TWS changes are dominated by anthropogenic groundwater extraction from fossil aquifers. Findings highlight the need for integrative responses at local, national, regional, and international levels by the African nations to overcome current and future challenges related to freshwater availability in Africa.”

"Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president of Iran and a founder of the Islamic republic, who navigated the opaque shoals of his country’s theocracy as one of its most enduring, wiliest and wealthiest leaders, died on Sunday in Tehran. He was 82. His death was announced by Iranian state television. As his career seesawed through periods of revolutionary zeal and confrontation with powerful conservative rivals, he was portrayed as a Machiavellian and often ruthless player in the power struggles among Iran’s elite factions, protected by his close association with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolutionary leader who overthrew the shah in 1979. Known as a pragmatist and centrist inclined toward economic liberalism and political authoritarianism, Mr. Rafsanjani was accused by critics of corruption in amassing his fortune and of a readiness for harsh tactics to deal with dissent at home and abroad. Argentina has accused Mr. Rafsanjani and other senior Iranian figures of complicity in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, in which 85 people died. In 1997, a German court concluded that the highest levels of Iran’s political leadership had ordered the killing five years earlier of four exiled Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin. The events added weight to American assertions that Iran was a sponsor of terrorism. Mr. Rafsanjani was president from 1989 to 1997. Yet many Western analysts believed that he sought a less confrontational relationship with the United States than other powerful figures in the Iranian hierarchy, for whom hostility toward Washington was a touchstone of ideological purity. Mr. Rafsanjani, for instance, was credited with suggesting that “Death to America” be dropped from the litany of slogans at Tehran’s Friday prayers, a weekly moment of fervor in Iran’s political and religious calendar. In the closing stages of the   war, which lasted from 1980 to 1988, Mr. Rafsanjani was appointed acting commander in chief of Iranian forces and was widely credited with persuading the leadership in Tehran to accept a United Nations resolution that ended the fighting. For much of his career, he maintained roles in Parliament and on influential clerical panels, under the tutelage of Ayatollah Khomeini and then, less durably, of his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr. Rafsanjani’s clout declined sharply during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, from 2005 to 2013. A populist conservative, Mr. Ahmadinejad had a strong following among poor Iranians, many of whom resented the affluence that endeared Mr. Rafsanjani to his wealthier compatriots. In 2013, Mr. Rafsanjani was disqualified from standing in presidential elections and swung his political weight behind a moderate, longtime associate, Hassan Rouhani, who won the vote and went on to bring many of Mr. Rafsanjani’s supporters into his cabinet and to negotiate the nuclear agreement with the United States in 2015. But Mr. Rafsanjani, himself an ayatollah, clashed with Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader, over the extent to which Iran should modify its bellicose stance toward outsiders. In March, Mr. Rafsanjani wrote on Twitter that the “world of tomorrow is one of negotiations, not the world of missiles. ” Ayatollah Khamenei responded: “Enemies continue strengthening their military and missile sectors. How can anyone say the era of missiles has passed?” Without identifying Mr. Rafsanjani by name, Ayatollah Khamenei said: “People say that tomorrow’s world is a world of negotiations and not a world of missiles. If they say this thoughtlessly, it shows they are thoughtless. However, if this is intentional, then this is treachery. ” For all that, analysts in Tehran sensed that the pendulum was swinging toward the moderate camp, in which Mr. Rafsanjani played a defining role. Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was born on Aug. 23, 1934, in the village of Bahraman near the town of Rafsanjan in Iran’s southeastern Kerman Province. He was one of five sons and four daughters born to Mirza Ali Hashemi Bahramani, a prosperous pistachio farmer, and Mahbibi Safarian Hashemi. At 14, he left his home village to study theology in the Muslim holy city of Qum, Iran, where he became a disciple of Ayatollah Khomeini. By some accounts, at the time of his death, Mr. Rafsanjani was the last surviving member of an inner circle of Islamic revolutionaries active during Ayatollah Khomeini’s exile from 1964 to 1979, fighting an often bloody    contest with the notorious Savak secret police loyal to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. From 1963 to 1978, Mr. Rafsanjani was jailed five times for his opposition to the shah, but he remained in close contact with exiled clerics, including Ayatollah Khomeini, who was living in Najaf, Iraq. During that period, in 1962, he married Effat Marashi, whose family included several respected Shiite clerics. They had five children  —   two daughters, Fatemeh and Faezeh, and three sons, Mohsen, Mehdi and Yaser. Information on survivors was not immediately available. In the turbulence after Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran, Mr. Rafsanjani was elected to Parliament, known as the Majlis, and became its speaker, serving in that position until 1989. In many accounts of the maneuvering after Ayatollah Khomeini’s death in 1989, Mr. Rafsanjani was credited with promoting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as supreme leader, possibly in the mistaken belief that he would prove a pliant figure. Instead, Ayatollah Khamenei built his own power base. But Mr. Rafsanjani’s   dealings  —   often trading on his close relationship with Ayatollah Khomeini  —   earned him the nickname “kingmaker. ” During his presidency, Mr. Rafsanjani faced the challenge of reconstruction after the   war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. While his economic liberalism and privatization policies were popular among Iran’s entrepreneurial classes, many poor Iranians perceived no improvement in their plight. As president, Mr. Rafsanjani showed little tolerance of dissent. While he sought improved ties with the West, he insisted on Iran’s right to develop its nuclear program and did not lift a fatwa declared by Ayatollah Khomeini that enjoined Muslims to kill the writer Salman Rushdie. Moreover, critics asserted that the Rafsanjani presidency coincided with the spread of corruption and the infiltration by the   Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of important economic enterprises. By 2013, Mr. Rafsanjani was said to have built a family business empire that owned Iran’s second biggest airline, exercised a near monopoly on the lucrative pistachio trade and controlled the largest private university, Azad. The family’s business interests also included real estate, construction and oil deals. In 2003, Forbes magazine said Mr. Rafsanjani’s personal wealth exceeded $1 billion. His time as president left a bitter legacy for many Iranians who struggled to get by. In parliamentary elections, he fared badly and was awarded a seat only after the intervention of a   clerical panel, prompting him to withdraw from the legislature. In 2005, Mr. Rafsanjani sought to run for the presidency again but lost in a runoff to Mr. Ahmadinejad, whose tenure until 2013 was marked by   nuclear policies, increasingly strained ties with the West and a mounting catalog of economic sanctions over Tehran’s efforts to expand its nuclear capability. In presidential elections in June 2009, Mr. Rafsanjani supported the moderate Mir Hussein Moussavi, who lost to Mr. Ahmadinejad. The outcome was widely disputed, and many Iranian protesters died or were detained challenging the authorities in the streets. The protesters included Mr. Rafsanjani’s youngest daughter, Faezeh, who had campaigned for women’s rights and was arrested in large demonstrations against Mr. Ahmadinejad’s victory. In September 2009, Mr. Rafsanjani seemed to be sidelined when the authorities barred him from addressing Friday prayers in Tehran on Quds Day, an annual display of solidarity with Palestinians. Mr. Rafsanjani had delivered the Quds Day sermon for almost 25 years, but the authorities in 2009 feared his address would provoke antigovernment protests. Mr. Ahmadinejad’s second term was marked by mounting disputes with the United States and Israel over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and its advances in missile technology. In 2011, Iran sided with President Bashar   of Syria during the Arab Spring, along with the Hezbollah Shiite militia in Lebanon, setting Tehran against Mr. Assad’s Western adversaries, including the United States. In May 2013, Mr. Rafsanjani announced plans for a comeback, entering his name for presidential elections that June, calculating that, after the years of   decline under Mr. Ahmadinejad, Iranians would think that Mr. Rafsanjani’s reputation as a pragmatist and modernizer would offset some of the opprobrium attached to his staggering wealth. At the time, he argued that Iran was in an economic “danger zone” because of Mr. Ahmadinejad’s “amateurism. ” But he was disqualified by the Guardian Council, an electoral vetting body controlled by  . Mr. Rafsanjani had long served on another critical panel, the   Assembly of Experts, which is charged with choosing a successor to the supreme leader. In 2016, Mr. Rafsanjani polled first in Tehran’s voting for the Assembly of Experts, whose role had assumed greater importance since Ayatollah Khamenei was treated for prostate cancer in 2014. In the manner of Iran’s competing power centers, however, a   Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, who was already the head of the Guardian Council, was elected by the Assembly of Experts as its chairman. The vote signaled new obstacles for the modest changes sought by Mr. Rouhani in running the Islamic republic. In another controversy, in May 2016, Mr. Rafsanjani was drawn into a ferocious debate over a meeting between his activist daughter, Faezeh, and Fariba Kamalabadi, a leader of the Baha’is, a minority religious group regarded by the clerical hierarchy as impure pagans. Mr. Rafsanjani showed little sympathy for his daughter, calling the Baha’is “heretics” and saying publicly that his daughter had “committed a wrong deed” and should be ashamed of herself."

The scientists attribute these trends to climate warming and rising CO2 concentrations.

"**In recent years there has been mounting pressure to rethink what we eat in order to reduce climate change.**
Many people have switched to veganism due to their concerns over the environmental impact of the global meat and dairy industries.
But farmers, butchers and grocers across the UK are pushing for an alternative.
They would like to see more people eating foods that are produced in their local area, significantly reducing the distance from farm to fork.
But is this sort of lifestyle realistic - or even possible - in a society where 24-hour big brand supermarkets allow us to consume anything that takes our fancy?
IT worker Dorothea Warlich buys organic food from her local grocery in Glasgow, which makes up the majority of her diet.
She has a degree in horticulture, and has been practising a local diet for so long that she no longer gives it much thought.
The environmental argument for this way of life over diets such as veganism, she says, is that plant-based diets can rely heavily on imported produce.
Avocados and soya largely come from central and south America - although a portion of soya we import is fed to livestock.
""There has to be a refocus on supplying ourselves with food - that's something that motivates me,"" said Dorothae, who is originally from Germany.
""With climate change a lot of countries will struggle to produce the amount of food they're consuming, but the UK will do comparatively well.""
One of the major challenges for Ms Warlich is sourcing organic, seasonal foods from supermarkets - which she says are quite ""global in what they sell"".
She said: ""There's not much organic food, whereas there's much more in other countries in Europe - you don't really need to think about it.
""It's enjoyable to eat food that comes from nearby - it's fresher and represents the area that you are in.""
Reuben Chesters, owner of the sustainable food social enterprise Locavore, has been eating local produce almost exclusively for many years.
He says that an increasing number of people in Glasgow are interested in local produce and that demand is so strong, he has expanded his grocery shop, in the city's Govanhill area, twice in recent years.
One of the joys of his diet, he says, is taking advantage of seasonal changes - which during the winter means lots of root vegetables and things like squash, which store well.
""At this time of year I have soups and hearty stews that are good for the soul,"" he said.
When spring arrives, he replaces warm dishes with leafy greens, fresh salads, spinach, rocket, chard, spring kale and baby carrots.
Meat does come into his diet - but far less than your average Brit.
He says that large-scale meat farms are harmful to the environment because animals are fattened on imported crops - but that this is not the only option for consumers.
He said: ""The animals on the farms I use are entirely grass-fed, so the nutrients are kept in the area. The dialogue is plant-based = good, meat = bad, but it's more complicated than that.""
Mr Chesters agrees that leading this sort of lifestyle can be more expensive for families in low-income households.
He estimates he spends around Â£30-40 per week on food - which includes a Â£10 vegetable box from his own shop - but that it could be done for around Â£25 for an adult who ate mostly vegetables and grains.
""It depends on what you're replacing,"" he said. ""If you're buying processed food it's much better to buy local and cook for yourself. If you're buying frozen pizzas and ice cream it's probably cheaper than that as well.""
In Scotland the majority of farmland is currently used for sheep, beef and other cattle, largely in Aberdeenshire in the Highlands. Dairy farming mostly occurs in the south west of Scotland with poultry in Tayside and Fife.
In order for every person to have access to a locally-sourced diet, Mr Chesters says a greater proportion of the land would need to be shared among a variety of farmers - rather than ""big food"" selling ""500 different types of frozen potatoes"".
If you live in Scotland and want to eat locally, the majority of your diet would come from fruit and vegetables as well as oats and grains in order to keep things cost-effective.
That's not to say meat is off the table - just in lower supply. Animals used for meat products would ideally be fed with grass grown on their own farms, as opposed to being fattened on imported crops on an industrial scale, according to industry professionals.
Living in this manner would involve cutting out processed foods, meaning almost all of your diet would have to be cooked fresh.
And because of seasonal changes, some items would not be available to buy during certain months - although Scottish farms are able to produce a variety of foods at all times of the year.
In January for example, Scottish farmers enjoy health crops of apples, beetroot, broccoli, Jerusalem artichokes, and various root vegetables. It's also the time when lamb, pheasant and venison is produced alongside beef and chicken.
And despite what is known as the ""hungry gap"" around March, Scotland still produces a variety of fish and seafood, and is the only grower of short sea kale during the season."

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a monthly Cato feature written by Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels on global climate change. These articles usually feature new and interesting items in the scientific literature with important implications for climate change regulations.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).



This edition departs from our usual routine because of the _very_ vitriolic fight that has broken as the result of publication of a January 27 op‐​ed titled “No Need to Panic about Global Warming” in _The Wall Street Journal_. Authored by 16 high‐​profile scientists, it made common‐​sense climate arguments that readers of this _Wisdom_ and other Cato publications on climate science and policy are certainly familiar with.



The January 27 piece can be summarized as follows:



• There has been no net warming for “well over ten years;”



• Global warming forecasts confidently made by the UN in 1990 were clearly exaggerations; 



• Carbon dioxide, the main “greenhouse” emission, stimulates plant growth;



• Climate scientists on the federal dole have a track record of punishing those who do not express alarmist views;



• Climate alarmism, public funding, and the growth of government and taxation create self‐​feeding mutual incentives; and



• Doing “nothing” about climate change in the next 50 years has little effect on climate mitigation compared to initiating taxation now.



None of the above are earthshaking propositions to any serious student of climate change. Monthly temperature departures from average show no significant trend going back to 1996. If one is concerned about biasing from the warm El Nino year of 1998, beginning post‐​2000 yields the same result. The UN was forecasting that global temperatures would be rising around twice the mean rate actually observed in surface temperatures. Greenhouse owners jack up the carbon dioxide concentration of their air several fold to stimulate plant growth. Alarmism breeds funding and new agencies that require more tax dollars, and funding begets tenure. The futility of politically feasible emissions reductions policies has been demonstrated for decades.



By January 30, the _New York Times_ , whose editorial stance on global warming is (to put it mildly) different than that of the _Journal_ , brought in their high‐​profile environmental blogger, Andrew Revkin, to carp principally about the last bullet item.



His post, “Scientists Challenging Climate Science Appear to Flunk Climate Economics,” claimed that the _Journal_ scientists had misrepresented the work of Yale economist William Nordhaus, quoting the latter’s “wise policy” (no bias there) of slowly introducing a carbon tax.



Nordhaus responded that the _Journal_ piece “completely misrepresented my work.”



At that point, Revkin opened up the controversy to commentary. Readers can decide for themselves.



Here is Nordhaus’s complete comment on the _Journal_ op‐​ed:



The piece completely misrepresented my work. My work has long taken the view that policies to slow global warming would have net economic benefits, in the trillion of dollars of present value. This is true going back to work in the early 1990s (MIT Press, Yale Press, Science, PNAS, among others). I have advocated a carbon tax for many years as the best way to attack the issue. I can only assume they either completely ignorant of the economics on the issue or are willfully misstating my findings.



And here is the response of the _Journal_ article authors:



We have accurately represented Professor Nordhaus’s findings in our _Wall Street Journal_ editorial of 01–27-12, while making and intending no statement regarding his policy beliefs and advocacy. In his 2008 book, _A Question of Balance, Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies_ , Professor Nordhaus provided the computed discounted costs and benefits for a variety of policies, assuming the IPCC central value for warming due to increased atmospheric CO2 (3 degrees C for doubling of CO2).



He finds (Table 5.3 of the book) that a policy of delaying greenhouse gas controls for 50 years gives a benefit‐​to‐​cost ratio just slightly less than his “optimum” policy. The optimum policy is a universal harmonized carbon tax, which Professor Nordhaus advocates. It starts small and is increased gradually over decades. In terms of net benefits, the 50‐​year‐​delay policy is far better than more aggressive policies that would severely limit atmospheric concentrations of CO2 or model‐​calculated global temperature rises.



Both the 50‐​year‐​delay policy and the optimum policy allow world economies to continue to develop with relatively little disruption. Aggressive policies considered in the book do not have this characteristic and display sharply higher abatement costs and lower benefit‐​to‐​cost ratios.



As we note in the _Wall Street Journal_ editorial, several more aggressive policies are negative return propositions.



Furthermore, in Chapters I and VI, Professor Nordhaus takes pains to explain that the requirement of universality of policy application is critical; regional, national, or group participation differences can be expected to lower policy effectiveness, perhaps substantially: “… there are substantial excess costs if the preponderance of sectors and countries are not fully included. We preliminarily estimate that a participation rate of 50 percent, as compared with 100 percent, will impose an abatement‐​cost penalty of 250 percent.” (Chapter 1, p.19). Therefore the optimum policy should be considered an ideal upper limit that may not be achieved in real world application.



We wish to emphasize once again that the above assumes that the IPCC climate results are correct and that significant environmental damage would result, both of which we strongly dispute. The statements made in the _Wall Street Journal_ editorial report Professor Nordhaus’s findings accurately and do not bear on his policy advocacy.



Here is Table 5.3:





Of course, that wasn’t the end.



It seems that if one ever needs to start a fire in the woods, simply rub two climatologists together. So, in the wee hours of February 1, a response to the _Journal_ article, signed now by 38 scientists, was published.



For clarity, let’s call this one “Trenberth _et al_.”, for its senior author, Kevin Trenberth of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research.



Summarizing Trenberth _et al_.:



• The authors of the original _Journal_ article were largely not climate scientists, and those that were, held “extreme views.”



• Warming has not “abated” in the last decade.



• Scientific societies worldwide concur that “the earth is heating up and humans are primarily responsible”. More than 97% of all actively publishing climate scientists “agree that climate change is real and human caused”.



• ”… The transition to a low‐​carbon economy will not only allow the world to avoid the worst risks of climate change, but could also drive decades of economic growth.”



Trenberth _et al_. is surprisingly weak and incomplete. The 16 original authors are all individuals that are highly competent in their fields, most are physicists of one stripe or another, and all can read and summarize a scientific literature. In fact, most would hold that climate science is nothing more than applied physics.



“Extreme views” lie in the eye of the beholder, and science only grudgingly backs away from established paradigms. For example, despite the obvious jigsaw‐​puzzle fit of the earth’s continents, it took 100 years of bickering before continental drift was accepted over geological stasis. And, in this case, the “extreme view” of the most prominent climate scientist of the 16, MIT’s Richard Lindzen, is hardly an outrage.



Lindzen holds that the “sensitivity” of surface temperature to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide has been overestimated because of an inaccuracy in the way that computer models magnify warming. In and of itself, it is mainstream, not extreme, to entertain the hypothesis that doubling carbon dioxide on its own would only cause a bit more than 1 degree (C) of global surface warming. Computer models arrive at much higher values, around 3.5°C, by amplifying the carbon dioxide effect because a slightly warmer atmosphere contains more water vapor, which itself is a potent greenhouse gas. Clouds are also changed in a way that enhances warming. There is evidence from the outgoing radiation signal of the earth that the effects of water vapor and clouds have been overestimated.



The 38 must somehow disagree with Susan Solomon, whose 2010 article in _Science_ attributing the lack of recent warming—that the 39 deny—to unanticipated changes in stratospheric water vapor with no known cause.



The 38 must somehow disagree with the global temperature sensing from satellites, which also shows no net warming for the last 14 years. Now, one could argue that the satellites are measuring temperatures above the surface in the lower atmosphere, but the computer models that the 38 find so accurate, predict that the lower atmosphere should be warming _faster_ than the surface over most of the planet.



Finally “more than 97% of all actively publishing* climate scientists agree that climate change is real and human caused” is probably an underestimate, as virtually everyone acknowledges that the surface temperature is warmer than it was, and that multifarious human activities have some influence on climate. Rather, he misses the point well‐​made by the original _Journal_ article, which is that the rise in surface temperature is clearly below the values first forecast by the UN in 1990. The core—unsettled—issue in climate science is the “sensitivity” of temperature to carbon dioxide, and there are several independent lines of evidence, including the surface temperature history and the water vapor problems, that argue that it has been substantially overestimated.



In global warming, it’s not the heat, it’s the sensitivity. But don’t expect much sensitivity and expect a lot of heat when climatologists voice their opinions.



* The part about “actively publishing” is saved for another day. The climategate emails—and there are plenty by, to, or about these 39 scientists, detail how difficult it is to publish anything they disagree with, thanks to intimidation and manipulation of editors, blackballing of those who disagree with them, and other blood sports.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn observational study analyzing the effects of 300, 480, 3200, 7500, and 16,900 ppm CO2 on atmospheric (and soil) temperatures has determined “temperatures of atmospheric air in mesocosms [controlled outdoor experiments] with substantially higher CO2 concentration (ranging from 3200 ppm to 16900 ppm) were lower than that with the lower CO2 concentration (480 ppm)”.

Can we find a real-world experiment assessing CO2’s temperature impact?
Using real-world experimental evidence to directly measure the effects of incremental increases in CO2 concentrations on air temperatures is highly unusual in climate science.
Most studies utilize extrapolations from radiation modeling that rest on a series of assumptions to theoretically assess CO2’s effect on the temperature of atmospheric air (Kennedy and Hodzic, 2019, Gerlich and Tscheuschner, 2009).
An exception would be Lightfoot and Mamer, 2018, who directly assessed the air temperature changes associated with specific CO2 concentrations. They found that CO2 is sometimes a cooling gas, and sometimes it’s a warming gas.

Supporting the contention of a dual cooling and warming – or negligible – effect of CO2 variability on air temperature, it has been determined that natural cave air may vary between 500 ppm in summer to 5000 ppm in winter despite very minimal seasonal temperture gradients (Pla et al., 2017).

New experimental study challenges the CO2-rise-leads-to-warming paradigm
The seven co-authors of a new paper (Zhang et al., 2020) were intent on demonstrating the dangers of substantial CO2 emissions from soil and its contribution to the greenhouse effect.

Natural soil emissions are a legitimate concern for those who believe CO2 drives the Earth’s temperature changes.
After all, the air CO2 concentrations in soil can reach 20,000 ppm (Zhang et al., 2020), and natural yearly emissions from soil respiration/perturbation are 9 times greater than that from all human activity combined.

Image Source: ScienceDaily
Zhang and colleagues utilized mesocosms – controlled outdoor experiments – to assess the air and soil temperature effect of step changes in CO2 concentration.
They “unexpectedly” found the mesocosms with the 3 highest CO2 concentrations – 3200, 7500, and 16,900 ppm – actually had lower associated atmospheric temperatures than the mesocosms with 480 ppm.
The authors suggest the higher CO2 concentrations rise, the more they “may enhance net heat loss”.
Similarly, even soil temperatures were cooler with the higher CO2 concentrations (16,900 ppm), leading the authors to suggest that substantially higher CO2 “may cool the soil”.
These experimental results would appear to undermine the popular assumption that linear increases in CO2 cause linear increases in temperature due to an enhancement of the overall greenhouse effect.

Image Source: Zhang et al., 2020
Zhang et al., 2020
“The increased atmospheric air temperatures with CO2 concentration (ranging from 300 ppm to 7500 ppm) at daytime with higher radiation were understandable. Unexpectedly, the magnitude of temperature increase of atmospheric air in mesocosms with 16900 ppm CO2 declined significantly compared to that with 7500 ppm CO2 at daytime with higher radiation. In addition, the temperatures of atmospheric air in mesocosms with substantially higher CO2 concentration (ranging from 3200 ppm to 16900 ppm) were lower than that with the lower CO2 concentration (480 ppm) at early morning and/or nighttime with lower heat radiation. These results emphasized that the molecules of CO2 not only absorb the infrared radiation but also re-emit it to the surrounding space (20). Thus an increase of CO2 concentration in atmospheric air may result in either an increase or decrease of the air temperature in the atmosphere, depending on the balance of heat gain and loss. In other words, CO2 with substantially higher concentration may enhance the net heat loss to colder surrounding interfaces when the heat absorption capacity of CO2 was saturated or heat input was much limited.”
“[T]he significant decrease of soil air temperature in mesocosms with CO2 concentration of 16900 ppm indicated that soil with substantially higher CO2 concentration may cool the soil probably by transferring more heat to surrounding space during colder periods when the temperature difference between soil and surface atmospheric air became larger. The realistic significance of these findings was greater than those in the atmosphere because CO2 concentration in soil air was often in the range of 1,000 ppm – 20,000 ppm [21-23]. Hence, the variation of soil CO2 concentration may regulate the balance of heat gain and loss in soil which determines the contribution of soil to surface warming of the earth.”

From Polar Bear Science
Posted on September 29, 2019 | Comments Off on Activist biologist filled with eco-anxiety shares unfounded fear of polar bear catastrophe
Misplaced eco-anxiety that kids have about polar bears starts with activist biologists like Steven Amstrup, spokesperson for an organization devoted to raising climate change alarm – and media outlets like The Guardian who help them spread fears unsupported by scientific evidence.

You can’t get much more over the top than these statements from Amstrup today but read carefully: it’s either opinion or factual aspects of polar bear life (“we know that the bears aren’t feeding”) made to sound like new, terrifying developments that can be blamed on climate change.
From The Guardian (29 September 2019), “We know they aren’t feeding’: fears for polar bears over shrinking Arctic ice” [my bold]:
“In 2015, the group reported that the polar bear population in the Beaufort Sea had declined by 40% over the previous decade. “We can only anticipate that those declines have continued,” Amstrup said.
The loss of sea ice this year was so pronounced early in the season that tagging crews from the US Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that the sea ice offshore in the western arctic was too thin and unstable to be able to conduct their studies – the first time the team have pulled their studies because of safety issues.”
…
“Amstrup said funding cutbacks and the fact that biologists cannot get out and study the bears means it may never be able to collect the necessary data to assess “just how bad this year was”.
Instead, Amstrup says this bad ice year and record warm summer are symbols of what the future will bring. Bad years like this will be increasingly frequent and the bad years will be increasingly worse – as long as we allow CO2 levels to continue to rise.
“We know that as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise it’s going to be warmer and we’re going to have less and less sea ice until polar bears disappear,” he said.”
Amstrup has been crying wolf since 2007: the predictions of polar bear catastrophe were all based on his opinion (that’s how the model was constructed) that this species would not be able to cope with 42% less summer sea ice than they had had in 1980 (Amstrup et al. 2007; Crockford 2017, 2019; Durner et al. 2009).
However, the evidence collected by his colleagues has proven him wrong again and again but he hasn’t changed his tune. Polar bears in the Chukchi Sea (the “western arctic”) have been thriving despite the dramatic decline in sea ice there – and so have the seals they depend upon for food (Crawford et al. 2015; Regehr et al. 2018; Rode and Regehr 2010; Rode et al. 2013, 2014, 2018). Barents Sea bears have been thriving despite an even greater loss of summer ice (Aars 208; Aars et al. 2017).
Amstrup suggests that polar bear numbers in the Southern Beaufort this year can only have declined further than the dip calculated for the 2001-2010 period. Not so: it is entirely possible – and eminently plausible – that numbers have increased. That’s because bear numbers declined due to thick ice conditions in spring between 2004 and 2007 that were as bad as they had been in 1974-1976, not because of reduced summer ice since 2007 (Crockford 2017, 2018, 2019; Stirling 2002; Stirling et al. 2008; York et al. 2016).
Southern Beaufort polar bear populations have a long history of declines and recoveries (Stirling 2002) and all the photos of polar bears out of Alaska for the last several years have shown fat healthy bears – two are shown here.  Where are the dozens of starving bears that would supposedly be the harbingers of a declining population since 2010? Amstrup does not produce evidence of them.

In addition, the idea that it’s significant that scientists can’t get out on the ice to study polar bears because the ice is “too thin” is bogus. For polar bear studies, sea ice needs to be thick enough to support the weight of a helicopter, research gear and 3-4 people without exceeding the risk threshold for insurance purposes (see photo below). That’s much thicker ice than is necessary to support the weight of a polar bear. Too thin for scientists is not too thin for polar bear survival.

“We know they aren’t feeding” Surprise, surprise! Actually, it’s known that well-fed polar bears are able to survive at least 5 months without food and most bears eat little over the summer whether they hang out on shore or stay on the sea ice (Stirling and Øritsland 1995).
Summer sea ice levels since 2007 have not been getting worse and worse: after an abrupt decline in 2007, September ice coverage has varied between about 3-5 mkm2. This year was not worse than 2012 – which did not, by the way, trigger a polar bear catastrophe – but Amstrup tries to make it sound like 2019 was especially horrific.
Amstrup says “we know” that rising CO2 is going to cause sea ice to continue to decline until polar bears “disappear” but that’s simply not true: it’s his opinion that polar bears will disappear. Moreover, he says “sea ice” when he means summer sea ice, which is deliberately misleading: in fact, no sea ice model predicts that sea ice in winter and spring will decline significantly, let alone disappear completely (Stroeve et al. 2007; Overland and Wang 2013; Perovich et al. 2018; Wang and Overland 2012, 2015).
The truth is, Amstrup has a vested interest in advancing polar bear catastrophe: as I explain in my new book, The Polar Bear Catastrophe That Never Happened (Crockford 2019), he considers his 2007 prediction that summer sea ice decline would decimate polar bear numbers to be a career legacy. He cannot bear to admit he was wrong (no pun intended) . That’s highly unscientific. Yet the media assists him in passing his unfounded eco-anxiety about polar bears on to naïve young children and gullible adults without a word about the current healthy status of the bears.

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



From [ Associated Press, June 24, 2008](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=20080624&id=7mgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7qkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5563,4123490)



Dr Hansen was right. Twenty years later we recognise him as a climate prophet.



No, we don’t. We recognise him as a climate charlatan.



Hansen left himself some wriggle room. In 5 -10 years, the summer sea ice in the Arctic would be gone. So that would be some time between June 2013 and June 2018.



June 2018 was a little under the average and one of the lower extents in the satellite record but there was still 10 million km2 of ice up there. The Arctic was certainly NOT ice-free. 



Current score: Experts 0 – Reality 20.

 _Global Science Report is a weekly feature from the Center for the Study of Science, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
You can get anything you want   
  
At Alice’s Restaurant   
  
-Arlo Guthrie, 1967   
  
Late last week, the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program (USGCRP) released a draft version of its latest assessment report on the impacts of climate change in the United States. Updated reports are required by Congressional decree every 4 years or so. The 2013 report, as it now stands, tips the scales at over 1,000 pages, consequently, we haven’t made our way through it yet, but if the Executive Summary is any indication, this report seems even worse than the one the USGCRP released in 2009.   
  
This is yet another example of our imperial government’s predilection towards “show science” in order to justify taking people’s stuff. By analogy, think of the “show trials” in some of history’s more freedom-loving regimes.   
  
As of this writing, it’s not clear if they intend to produce another “summary” document, such as the 200-pager they put out in 2009. That one was so bad as to require us to produce an _Addendum_ that represents what the USGCRP report coudda, shoudda, woudda looked like had the author team made a more complete and fair assessment of the scientific literature.   
  
Admittedly, our _Addendum_ report, which was finalized and released last fall, did include citations from the scientific literature that were published subsequent to the publication of the 2009 USGCRP report, which obviously the USGCRP report authors couldn’t have known about. But, as our _Addendum_ demonstrates, when these new research results are included, the potential impacts of climate change in the U.S. are substantially tempered. This leads us to think that the 2013 version from the USGCRP—which seems to hype the impacts of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions even more so than the 2009 report did—didn’t do a grand job in synthesizing the literature.   
  
Nor does it appear they did a good job with the statistics of climate and climate change in the U.S.   




Here is but one example of your tax dollars at work. From the USGCRP draft report:   




U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5°F since 1895, with more than 80% of this increase occurring since 1980.



This sentence is consistent with the lurid story being told by the authors, but is by no means a robust statistical assessment of the U.S. temperature record.   
  
The latest version of the official U.S. temperature record (at least for today—the historical data are subject to change daily in the new “data homogenization” (!) routines) is shown in Figure 1. And indeed, a linear fit through the data indicates that the overall trend is 0.13°F per decade, which, over the 118 years’ worth of data (1895 through 2012) produces about 1.5°F of total temperature rise.   






  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Figure 1. U.S. annual average temperatures (°F), 1895-2012, as continuously compiled and updated by the National Climatic Data Center, and fit with a linear trend over the entire period of record (Source: National Climatic Data Center).   
  
  
  
  
  
But does attributing “more than 80% of this increase” since 1980 make any kind of sense at all? And how would you even go about doing that?   
  
Probably the best way to do this would be to simply take the overall rate of temperature rise (0.13°F/decade) and multiply it by the number of decades between 1980 and now (3.3) and then divide by the overall temperature change (1.5°F). When you do this, you get 29% of the overall rise has occurred since 1980. Since 29% is nowhere close to being “more than 80%,” clearly this is not how the USGCRP authors made their determination.   
  
Another way to do it would be to find the maximum amount of temperature rise that occurred at any time before 1980 and then determine how much more the temperature since 1980 has risen above that amount. For example, from 1895 through 1940, the U.S. annual average temperature increased at a rate of 0.27°F per decade for 4.5 decades for a total rise of 1.2°F. That only leaves 0.3°F of the total overall rise of 1.5°F left over. So the maximum proportion of temperature rise that could have occurred since 1980 is 20%. Again, 20% is nowhere close to being more than 80%, so clearly this is not how they did it.   
  
Another way would be to calculate the linear temperature rise between 1895 and 1979, subtract that from the 1.5°F total rise and assign whatever is left over to the period 1980 to 2012. When you do this, you get that 77% of the rise occurred since 1980. At least this is starting to get close to the USGCRP number.   
  
Or, you could calculate the linear rise from 1980 to 2012 and compare this to the total rise. When you do this, you find that the rise from 1980 to 2012 was 1.58°F. Or, 105% of the total rise! 105% is definitely more than 80%, so maybe that is what they did.   
  
Or perhaps the USGCRP authors did something completely different. Who knows?   
  
Now, before we go any further, let’s get something straight— _none of these methods for determining the proportionate amount of warming is statistically sound_ because the nature of temperature rise in the U.S. during the last 118 years is not strictly linear. Instead, there are multi-decadal periods of rising and falling temperatures (see Figure 1). So attempting to describe the proportional change over some period of time is cherry-picking by design. As we show in the examples above, you have a wide variety of answers at your disposal depending on your analysis method. The USGCRP authors clearly wanted to choose a method that produced the appearance of a lot of rise since 1980 (and thereby completely disregarding a more rapid warming from 1910-1940).   
  
Why? Heck, ask the guy responsible for the report (jmelillo@mbl.edu). We surely don’t know but our guess is that they wanted to make the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions seem as large as they possibly could, which is certainly consistent with keeping the 60 authors flying first class.   
  
And this, in a nutshell, is the feeling we are getting about the entire report.   
  
That’s just not from our own spot checks, but from other as well (for starters, see comments from Roger Pielke Jr. and Judith Curry).   
  
Looks like our our Center for the Study of (Show) Science is going to have a good time at Alice’s Restaurant.

"On an overcast Friday morning last January, longshoremen all over New York Harbor walked off the docks, bringing the port nearly to a stop for a day. What were the longshoremen’s grievances? What were their demands? Many of the men seemed not to know. They hung around the food trucks and milled about the parking lots, unsure why they had stopped working and unsure what it would take for work to resume. “No one knew what that was about,” one recalled recently. A year later, the reason for the strike remains unclear, even as the agency tasked with ridding the waterfront of organized crime, the Waterfront Commission, has questioned dozens of longshoremen under oath. One told the commission he learned of the strike early that morning, when it was too dark to see the face of the man giving the order. It could have been anyone. It was the old D  D  —   Deaf and Dumb, the classic longshoreman’s response, popularized in the 1954 film “On the Waterfront. ” In that movie, the longshoremen were reluctant, even frightened, to talk to the authorities, whether a priest or a detective, because the mob controlled the waterfront. In the years since, much has changed around New York Harbor the heavy lifting is done not by hand but by cranes, and human voices are scarcely heard amid the beeping of the straddle carriers, giant insectlike machines that move containers back and forth. But even as New York and New Jersey’s increasingly valuable shoreline is claimed by luxury development, investigators say the mob is still present. It is where the daughter of one of the mobsters made famous in the 1997 film “Donnie Brasco” is up for a job where the nephew of another famous mobster pulled down more than $400, 000 in a single year because he was almost never off the clock, not even when he was at home sleeping where three consecutive presidents of a Newark longshoremen’s union were convicted of extortion. There is physical evidence as well, like the $51, 900 wrapped in cellophane that was discovered buried in the backyard of a longshoreman. It was, according to federal agents in a 2010 affidavit, the tribute that a group of Newark longshoremen paid the Genovese crime family each Christmas. “You will need another generation or two to get the mob out of this port, because they are very well entrenched,” said one longshoreman who requested anonymity because of a concern for his safety and his livelihood. Those who step out of line, he said, face being reassigned from   jobs unloading container ships to the cruise ship terminals, where the work and the pay is far less. While investigators say the mob and the waterfront remain entwined, both institutions are much diminished today, pushed to the margins of New York City. The  finger piers that once extended from much of Manhattan and Brooklyn are mostly gone.  These days the most famous shipping line in the city is the Circle Line, which does sightseeing tours. Container ships generally head across the harbor to New Jersey, toward the ports of Elizabeth, Newark and Bayonne. They unload at a number of terminals, one of which is owned by a Canadian teachers’ pension fund. The pay is pretty good on the docks  —   plenty of longshoremen make well over $100, 000  —   but the work is often dreary and dangerous. “It’s a funny thing about this port,” a hiring agent at Port Newark named Pasquale Pontoriero was overheard saying in a 2009 wiretap, a few years before his license was revoked because he had associated with organized crime figures. “I call it the Broadway of broken dreams. ” Perhaps the starkest difference at the port today is in how many machines there are, and how few people. A century ago New York Harbor employed 40, 000 longshoremen, who unloaded ships with hook and sling and brawn. Today, the entire workforce is just under 3, 400 longshoremen, many perched behind the controls of cranes and straddle carriers. Yet amid all the transformation, some investigators say, racketeers and mobsters are still as present as the barnacles attached to the piers. In the view of Walter M. Arsenault, the executive director of the Waterfront Commission, the fundamental relationship between the waterfront and the mob remains unchanged since “On the Waterfront. ” “The only difference is now, it’s in color,” Mr. Arsenault said. He based that assessment on several indicators, such as the number of relatives of   figures who continue to hold choice jobs, many of which involve little work and pay unusually high salaries, like the union shop steward position held by Ralph Gigante, the nephew of the boss of the Genovese family, the late Vincent (Chin) Gigante. Ralph Gigante earned $419, 000 in 2014, and has said he believes he holds the union office for life  —   “until death do us part. ” There is also the fact that some of the same New York and New Jersey union officials whom federal prosecutors have in the past accused of racketeering have since risen to the top ranks of the East Coast waterfront union, the International Longshoremen’s Association. One is Harold J. Daggett, the garrulous president, who owns a   yacht, the Obsession, and has been spotted by his members riding in a Bentley. One longshoreman said he had been surprised to catch sight of a holster strapped to Mr. Daggett’s ankle during a meeting. The Justice Department, which has lost two cases against Mr. Daggett, has described him as an “associate” of the Genovese crime family whose rise through the union ranks was part of the mob’s plan. A good portion of the Justice Department’s evidence against him came from the testimony of an aged mob turncoat, George Barone, who had once been a waterfront enforcer for the Genovese family and who described Mr. Daggett as thoroughly under the mob’s control. But Mr. Daggett, on trial in 2005, took the witness stand and portrayed himself as a mob target, describing a 1980 episode in which Mr. Barone had put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him and his family  —   an incident that so terrified Mr. Daggett he urinated in his pants, according to news accounts. During that trial, one of Mr. Daggett’s   a reputed mobster named Lawrence Ricci, went missing. Several weeks after the men were acquitted, Mr. Ricci’s decomposing body was found in the trunk of a car outside a New Jersey diner. The murder, which Mr. Arsenault said is the last known waterfront killing, remains unsolved. Mr. Daggett declined, through the longshoremen’s association’s spokesman, to be interviewed. But alluding to his brushes with the Justice Department, Mr. Daggett joked at a union conference in Puerto Rico in 2015 that when he was invited to the White House for a labor meeting, “I thought I might have a better chance ending up in the big house, but there I was, your I. L. A. president, at the White House. ” But Mr. Daggett’s lawyer in that 2005 trial, George Daggett (his cousin) said in a recent interview that “the mob on the waterfront is a myth”  —   something that has not been true for half a century. Mr. Daggett, who frequently represents longshoremen in litigation with the Waterfront Commission, said that the agency prefers to pretend “we’re still in the ’50s. ” “They can’t say, ‘We got rid of the mob,’ because then there’s no reason for them to be in existence,” George Daggett said. “I challenge them to prove mob influence on the piers. What have they come up with? A couple of guys here and a stray guy there?” The mob’s grip over the New York waterfront began nearly a century ago and was predicated on a few simple facts: The work was uneven, depending on a ship’s arrival time, and yet the cargo needed to be unloaded quickly, so that produce did not spoil and the shelves of America’s stores could remain stocked. Gangsters quickly realized that the piers were the choke point of the economy, and that a dizzying array of rackets were available to them. They pilfered cargo as it came ashore and extorted truckers who had come to collect cargo or drop it off. And, most cruelly, the mob controlled which of the longshoreman would be selected to work. Theirs was some of the most dangerous work in the country, but longshoremen had to beg to get it. At the   on the piers, where longshoremen would gather each morning in the hope of joining the group that would work on an arriving ship, it was common for a man to place a toothpick behind his ear, a signal that he would kick back some of his pay. All this began to change with containerization, as goods were no longer shipped loose but packed into containers that stacked efficiently, and transferred easily between ships and trucks and trains. With cranes doing the lifting, the number of longshoremen plummeted by more than 90 percent. Today, advances in automation threaten to reduce the number of longshoremen even further. As the workforce dwindled, the remaining jobs became well paid. This was a result of a shrewd move by the longshoremen’s association: The union negotiated a flat fee, today roughly $5 a ton, that the shipping industry would pay into various funds to provide an income for   longshoremen and supplement the benefits and income of those who would work fewer hours as a result. As global trade has soared, the few longshoremen who remain have seen their paychecks grow. The waterfront today has largely receded from the city’s consciousness and even its geography. And to some extent, so has the mob. Decimated by mass prosecutions over the last three decades, New York’s five crime families have struggled to adapt. While there have been some new, profitable ventures, like online gambling, the waterfront still exerts its own pull. Mr. Arsenault referred to the waterfront as the mob’s “last candy jar. ” In recent years, the union has brazenly recommended friends or relatives of organized crime figures for jobs on the docks, said Phoebe S. Sorial, the general counsel for the Waterfront Commission. She said the union has sought waterfront jobs for “people who posted bail for organized figures” and “people who are in business with organized crime figures,” along with any number of relatives. In 2014, for instance, the union recommended the    daughter of one of New York’s most famous mobsters, Benjamin (Lefty) Ruggiero (played by Al Pacino in the film “Donnie Brasco”) Mr. Arsenault said, adding that other such cases abound. “You can’t throw a rock on either side of the waterfront without hitting a brother, son or daughter of a made member,” Mr. Arsenault said, using the terminology for someone who has been inducted into a crime family. The   Waterfront Commission was formed in 1953 to fight organized crime on the docks. For many years, before it came under new leadership in 2008, it was a   and sleepy agency. Since then it has focused on extensive background checks, mapping the familial relationships between mobsters and longshoremen  —   an elaborate genealogy project. The Gigantes, for instance, have 10 relatives  —   mostly nephews,   and grandsons  —   working on the waterfront, according to the commission. This kind of blatant nepotism was impressive if not especially unusual. And yet Mr. Daggett, the union president, objects to the assumption that these sorts of arrangements necessarily signal corruption. “There is an old saying,” he once proclaimed at a public hearing, slightly stretching the degree of kinship in the adage, “‘The son or a nephew should not carry the sins of a father or an uncle. ’” Many of those with relatives in organized crime say the insinuation that they themselves are mixed up in racketeering is hurtful, untrue and yet maybe inescapable. “When I started out, people were a little standoffish because of fear, because of my ancestors,” James Anastasio said. His father’s uncle was Albert Anastasia, once the head of what the press called Murder, Inc. he was “Lord High Executioner,” as his 1957 obituary in The Daily News put it. “Although once they got to know me and realized I had nothing to do with that, they treated me as a normal person. ” Mr. Anastasio, who runs a training institute for longshoremen and is also an executive at a crane company, said that in his long career on the waterfront, “I’ve never really come across the mob. ” “As far as I know, no, the mob is no longer on the waterfront,” he added. “I can’t say there are not small pockets of bad people, but as far as big influence  —   not that I’ve seen in my lifetime. ” George Daggett, the lawyer and cousin of the union president, said that the Waterfront Commission has taken to harassing some longshoremen with relatives reputed to be organized crime figures. He cited a lawsuit he had brought on behalf of a longshoreman in New Jersey named Pasquale Falcetti Jr. Mr. Falcetti, he said, was denied a port registration card by the Waterfront Commission for no other reason, apparently, than “who this kid’s father is”  —   Pasquale (Uncle Patty) Falcetti, a convicted racketeer and reputed leader in the Genovese family, currently finishing a federal prison sentence. The union has complained about such aggressive tactics, and the longstanding antipathy between the longshoremen’s association and the Waterfront Commission may have been the driving force behind the strike last year. And yet a spokesman for the longshoremen’s association, James McNamara, said the union did not give the order for the strike and urged the longshoremen to return to work. “What we had heard,” Mr. McNamara said, “was the men were seemingly protesting against the Waterfront Commission and what was perceived as harassment. ” As for the presence of organized crime along the waterfront, Mr. McNamara said the mob had no influence anymore. “They just don’t,” he said. “It’s a highly automated, highly sophisticated industry. ” He added, “You just don’t hear about that at all anymore. ” But another viewpoint was offered two years ago by Sabato (Sal) Catucci, a legendary waterfront figure who operated the stevedoring company that ran the Red Hook docks in Brooklyn until 2011. At a public hearing before the Waterfront Commission in 2010, he protested investigators’ insinuation that the ports were under mob control. He was so wary of being tarred as a mobster that he even chose what to wear with care. “I didn’t come in here with a black shirt today, because I don’t feel that I wanted to be stereotyped,” he said. Yet just a few years later, Mr. Catucci, now locked in a battle over a contract to operate the Red Hook port, accused the longshoremen’s union of threatening him during negotiations. He had been told he would be taken out “in a box,” according to a lawsuit he filed. One vice president of the union “shoved me and threatened to knock me out,” Mr. Catucci said in a 2014 affidavit, in which he claimed that some of the waterfront’s most powerful figures “are, or are associated with, thugs who get their way by intimidation and force. ” Investigators insist that the same rackets that gave life to “On the Waterfront” continue today. Mr. Arsenault checked off the various forms of thievery and extortion, both big and small, that he learned of through his investigations.    containers occasionally disappear, most likely the result of theft. Truckers, in order to be allowed to retrieve their container and leave the port, have been encouraged to buy overpriced bottles of water, or even Girl Scout cookies from the longshoremen, he said. Robert Stewart, a longtime anticorruption prosecutor who until last year had worked in a   role for 13 years to rid a longshoremen’s local in Bayonne of organized crime, said that mob influence on the waterfront was “a tad better” than in the past. “You don’t have bodies showing up,” he said. But he said he wondered whether the mob had not simply directed its attention to a different source of income. For years, investigators have suspected that the mob’s most lucrative targets on the waterfront are the longshoremen benefit funds, including what is known as the “container royalty fund,” the fund that pays extra wages to longshoremen each year as compensation for the diminished work that came with containerization. The funds are worth a great deal of money one received more than $95 million in 2014. They also tend to be rather opaque. “It is an awfully inviting target, and knowing the cast of characters involved here, to think they’re not getting a piece of this is unrealistic,” Mr. Stewart said. The list of employees at the benefits fund, said one law enforcement official, include an accountant and a director of operations who are the children of dead organized crime figures. But John Nardi, the president of the New York Shipping Association, a trade group that has a role in managing the funds, said he had seen no evidence of misconduct. “Based on people’s names you can make a lot of assumptions,” he said. However, he said, “All monies are accounted for. ”"
"**There's new advice for supporting vegans in the workplace, including having a shelf in the office fridge.**
The Vegan Society has shared suggested guidelines to help businesses look after their vegan staff.
They range from offering vegan menus at events to providing vegan-friendly work-wear for people who want it.
The charity wants vegans to be exempt from corporate events like horse racing or activities that might include cooking a ""hog roast"" on a barbecue.
Other recommendations include colour-coded kitchen equipment and separate areas to prepare meat-free food - as well as non-leather phone cases, being exempt from any part of purchasing non-vegan goods and the chance for staff to have discussions about vegan-friendly pension options.
The Vegan Society says these new guidelines are intended to create a positive atmosphere at work.
""Fostering a general attitude of respect towards vegan employees is key,"" it writes.
""If 'jokes' made about an employee's veganism become burdensome, steps should be made to improve this.""
There are an estimated 600,000 vegans in the UK who follow a plant-based diet and avoid animal produce.
One of those people is Jess Hawkes - a 28-year-old who tells Radio 1 Newsbeat explaining her choice of diet to colleagues can be ""exhausting"".
""A lot of the time you get comments about being a 'weak' vegan,"" says Jess, who was vegetarian all her life before turning vegan six years ago.
""Sometimes it's not necessarily people meaning to be really offensive, but people will ask if you get enough nutrients and vitamins or if you're anaemic.
""I find it offensive, but it's been going on so long that you just get used to it.""
Now Jess, who works in works in digital marketing in Nottingham, says she finds it easier not to mention that she's a vegan.
""If someone's going to start questioning me it gets exhausting, and you end up having to justify every single meal that you have.""
Jess says the recommendations made by The Vegan Society are ""a step in the right direction"".
But she thinks a better understanding of vegans would be more useful than some of their suggestions.
""The thing I think that's dangerous is that it's assuming ethics of people because - for example, the horse-racing thing - some people might be vegan for completely different ethical reasons. It might not have anything to do with animal rights.
""Some people don't eat animal products for health, some people do it for the environment, some people do it for religion, some people might just not like meat and dairy.""
She also believes there are misconceptions about vegans that can make the workplace difficult.
""I think there's a vast misconception that vegans are going to lecture people on their ethics and their beliefs,"" she adds.
""If people had more of a broader understanding of it, then they might stop seeing it as this really radical viewpoint that needs to be commented on.""
The Vegan Society says it wants comments about vegans to be compared to those made about people in religious groups.
Last month a UK judge ruled that the beliefs of ethical vegans were protected by law and said they deserved similar legal protections in British workplaces as those who hold religious beliefs.
Ethical vegans don't just avoid eating or using animal products - they also try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation from their lifestyle. For example they avoid wearing or buying clothing made from wool or leather, or using toiletries from companies that carry out animal testing.
""One way of assessing whether a co-worker has gone too far with comments to or about vegans is to consider what type of conversational behaviour would be deemed offensive to other individuals with protected characteristics, such as those who adhere to certain religious values,"" the society says.
Since last month's ruling jokes or comments about vegans can be considered harassment in the workplace under the Equality Act 2010.
""An employer has a duty to ensure that all employees behave respectfully and courteously towards each other and vegans should also benefit from this,"" the society states.
""If this duty is not extended to vegan employees, claims of unlawful harassment related to a protected belief will be taken seriously in employment tribunals.""

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019“He who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass.” Edgar FiedlerPredicting the future has always been a perilous and uncertain activity. For centuries, soothsayers foretold events by cutting up chickens and examining their entrails. Today, scientists, economists and others use sophisticated computer models to do the same thing, often with similar results. In perhaps no other field has the practice, and malpractice, of attempting to project future events become more controversial than in the field of energy. Once, the challenge of the analyst was mainly to understanding past trends and how current events might alter them.  Today, however, he or she must be mindful of how projections will align with claims of Anthropomorphic Global Warming  (AGW) (i.e. that humans are the major influence on the global climate) and that governments must manage the energy economy to produce their preferred environmental outcomes. To some extent, projecting the energy future has become a tug of war between economic and political considerations.This point is illustrated in the most recent report by British Petroleum, the BP Energy Outlook 2019 edition. British Petroleum is one of the most highly-regarded commentators on global energy markets. This is partly because of its authoritative reporting of energy supply and demand statistics, which it provides free to the public in the annual BP Statistical Review of World Energy.  It is also because of its occasional special reports, including its energy outlook documents. The 2019 edition, just published, sets out BP’s analysis of the possible global energy supply, demand and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions trends to 2040.BP has come under increasing pressure from believers in AGW and their supporters in the financial services industry to support climate change activism. This has been increasingly evident in its last few outlook documents. The 2019 edition succumbs by not presenting two or even three alternative scenarios of the future, but four. The “More Energy” (ME) scenario assumes that the future energy outlook will be very much like the past; that is, driven by the desire of people, especially in the developing countries, for increasing access to improved lifestyles and the energy services that support them, with only modest improvements in technology. The “Evolving Transition”(ET) scenario sees the consumer-driven pressures being partially offset by more rapid technological change and a politically-driven shift towards a lower-carbon dioxide fuel mix. The “Less Globalization” (LG) scenario is much like the Evolving Transition one, but it reflects the potentially adverse economic effects of prolonged trade disputes and increasing protectionism. Finally, the “Rapid Transition” (RT) scenario is one in which all governments adopt policies that will reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45% by 2040; this might be considered the “lite” version of the policies recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the Summary for Policy Makers based on its Special Report 15 of September 2018. Most of the commentary and graphic illustrations in the report are based on the Evolving Transition scenario.The outlook is a quite long document, filled with interesting graphs and tables. One can find it here:https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2019.pdfIn this commentary, I will not attempt to summarize the outlook, but rather to draw attention to its projections that are of most interest from the perspective of those who take a skeptical view of the AGW thesis and its related policy prescriptions.Global Primary Energy Consumption and Fuel Shares Using 2017 as a base, the BP scenarios all project that the world’s primary energy consumption will grow in the period to 2040. Consumption rises from about 14 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (Btoe) in 2017 to 15 Btoe under the Rapid Transition scenario, 17 Btoe in the Evolving Transition scenario, and 23 Btoe in the More Energy scenario.All of the growth in energy demand comes from fast-growing developing economies, led by India and China.The shares held by different fuels vary considerably among the scenarios. In the ET scenario, the shares of consumption held by coal and oil decline, that held by natural gas rises considerably, nuclear and hydro stay roughly constant and renewable energy use rises considerably. In the RT scenario, each of these trends is slightly increased, except that renewables account for all the growth in energy demand.In the ET scenario, energy consumption grows at an annual average rate of 1.2 per cent, down from over 2 per cent in the previous 20 years. Despite significant growth in prosperity in many countries, a substantial portion of the world’s population still consumes relatively low levels of energy (annual consumption of less than 100 GJ per head) in 2040. They are the ones left behind.https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2019-presentation-slides.pdf Pg. 2The Dual Challenge BP states that the global energy system faces a dual challenge: the need for much more energy to serve the needs of a growing population and the need for far fewer carbon dioxide emissions. In its graphs, BP presents these goals as essentially irreconcilable. Certainly, the ET scenario is not consistent with achieving either of these challenges. The RT scenario is also described as a “half-way stop” in reducing carbon emissions.Transport Demand In the ET scenario, the demand for energy in transport services almost doubles by 2040. All of the growth is outside the OECD.The energy efficiency of the average car increases by 50 per cent, and truck fuel efficiency increases sharply as well.However, as the scope for further efficiency gains in aviation and marine modes is small, nearly half the increase in energy use from 2030 to 2040 is in these two modes.Transport continues to be dominated by oil. In the ET scenario, the share of oil in transport declines from 94 per cent currently to 85 per cent by 2040. Electricity accounts for only 5 per cent of transport demand by 2040.In the ET scenario, the number of electric vehicles reaches around 350 million by 2040, of which around 300 million are passenger cars. This is equivalent to around 15 per cent of all cars and 12 per cent of all light duty vehicles. As there are only about 5 million electric light duty vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) on the world’s roads today, this represents a large leap of faith.A counter-trend to rising fuel efficiency in passenger vehicles is that the rise in global incomes may affect commuter behaviour in Asia. Many people there may no long choose to ride in high occupancy public transport and shift to private vehicles, a fact BP describes as a “key challenge”.Natural Gas Demand In the ET scenario, the importance of natural gas as an energy source greatly increases, supported by broadly-based demand, plentiful low-cost supplies, and the increasing availability of gas globally, due to increasing trade in liquified natural gas (LNG).Natural gas grows at an average rate of 1.7 per cent per annum – increasing nearly 50 per cent by 2040.The growth in gas demand is led by the industry and the power sectors, largely driven by developments in the developing countries.The speed and pattern of gas demand growth in the non-OECD, however, depends on the pace at which the required supporting infrastructure (i.e. transmission and distribution systems) is built, which BP describes as an area of major uncertainty.The Global Fuel Mix The following graphs illustrate the projected changes in fuel mix under the ET scenario, along with the resulting changes in the shares of primary energy.Page 7, BP Energy OutlookIt is notable that:In 2040, fossil fuels, (oil, natural gas and coal) still constitute 78 per cent of primary energy consumption globally.Coal consumption, which is condemned by supporters of the AGW hypothesis, remains essentially flat over the period, but still exceeds the role played by renewables in 2040.While use of renewable energy grows at the rate of 7 per cent per annum, its share of global energy consumption only increases from 4 to 15 per cent. (Recall that the ET scenario is a moderately optimistic case from the perspective of AGW believers.)BP’s projections thus show the share of global energy demand served by fossil fuels, which has been declining at the rate of 1 per cent per decade since 1990, declining at the faster rate of 3 per cent per decade in the period to 2040. At this rate of change, fossil fuels’ share of consumption would decline to zero in 26 decades, or somewhere around the year 2500.Carbon Dioxide Emissions In the ET scenario, carbon dioxide emissions from energy use increase, not decrease, in the period to 2040.  They are higher by 7 per cent in 2040.Net emissions would rise from 33.4 billion tonnes in 2017 to 36 billion tonnes in 2040.Most of the emissions growth is in the power and buildings sectors, and all of it is in the developing countries.These trends would mean that the goals enunciated in the COP21 Climate Agreement would not be met.Comments As stated at the outset, forecasting the future is difficult at the best of times.British Petroleum undoubtedly finds itself in a quandary. As one of the premier compilers and analysts of past energy market developments, it might be tempted to base future projections largely on an extrapolation of current trends. Presenting such an outlook, however, would have exposed the company to great abuse by the adherents to the AGW hypothesis and their supporters. Faced with that threat, BP has included the extrapolation of present trends as an “outlier” scenario, and focused most of its analysis and commentary on the Evolving Transition scenario. To protect itself even further, it has added two scenarios that anticipate higher emissions reductions, including one (i.e. the Rapid Transition scenario) that comes close to, but does not quite match, the future envisaged by those who demand a “Green New Deal”.BP thus may have realistically accommodated the political pressures on it, but at some cost to its credibility. After all, if none of one’s scenarios respond adequately to what one states are the compelling dual challenges faced by the global energy system, they are all reduced to products of political compromise, not detached and objective economic analysis.Other prestigious forecasters include the International Energy Agency, the United States Energy Information Administration and EXXON. As each updates its energy outlook report in the coming months, we will see how well they accommodate or resist the politicization of energy supply and demand analysis.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

News Brief by Kip Hansen — 30 November 2019
 
A recent study in Oceanography, the Official Magazine of The Oceanography Society, titled  “Atlantic warming since the Little Ice Age” [.pdf here], is interesting in its entirety, with an Abstract as follows:
 
“Radiocarbon observations suggest that the deep Atlantic Ocean takes up to several centuries to fully respond to changes at the sea surface. Thus, the ocean’s memory is longer than the modern instrumental period of oceanography, and the determination of modern warming of the subsurface Atlantic requires information from paleoceanographic data sets. In particular, paleoceanographic proxy data compiled by the Ocean2k project indicate that there was a global cooling from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age over the years 900−1800, followed by modern warming that began around 1850. An ocean simulation that is forced by a combined instrumental-​proxy reconstruction of surface temperatures over the last 2,000 years shows that the deep Atlantic continues to cool even after the surface starts warming. As a consequence of the multicentury surface climate history, the ocean simulation suggests that the deep Atlantic doesn’t take up as much heat during the modern warming era as the case where the ocean was in equilibrium at 1750. Both historical hydrographic observations and proxy records of the subsurface Atlantic are needed to determine whether the effects of the Little Ice Age did indeed persist well after the surface climate had already shifted to warmer conditions.”
Those interested in the relationships between deep Atlantic Ocean water temperature, surface Atlantic water temperature, and possible effect on climate — and, of course, effects of atmospheric climate on deep Atlantic Ocean temperature and the ocean’s heat uptake and release — should read the whole paper.
Of particular interest for today’s Climate Debate are these three graphs — the first two of which are simply copied from the paper itself, including their captions:

This first graph shows the Ocean2K reconstruction of global surface temperatures  (anomaly with baseline 15 CE — broad black trace) and on the right-hand side, various modern regional Atlantic Ocean surface water temperatures.
The second graph:

This is the view we are accustomed to seeing in the Climate Debate — the global surface temperature anomaly (some baseline — in this case 15 CE) with a starting point around 1850 (some start a bit later, 1890).  Note that it is “Identical to Figure 1, but restricted to the years 1850−2015.”  The starting point is picked to represent “the start of the Modern Industrial Era”.
Now an annotated version of the second graph:

Here we have the second graph 1850-2015, with the global Average Surface Temperature anomaly (again — baseline 15 CE)  but I have dropped in a smaller window, on the left, bringing forward  the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) — the years 100-800 CE (same scale) — to illustrate the difference between the peak Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST)  of the Medieval Warm Period to the most current GAST on the graph (2015).
This exposes the ubiquitous trick of the Climate Debate, in which Global Temperatures are [almost] always shown only from the depths of the Little Ice Age (clearly marked on the first graph by Gebbie), resulting in images similar to Gebbie’s Figure 2 — despite the fact that most 2 millennia reconstructions clearly show the Roman and Medieval Warm Periods as generally in the same range as the Modern Warm Period.   Given the acknowledged range of error  in any temperature reconstruction and in modern estimates of global surface temperatures (today, in absolute temperatrures,  around +/- 0.5ºC  or a range of 1ºC)  — there may be little, if any,  significant-to-the-global-environment difference  between the two periods.
The Medieval Warm period did not result in a “Climate Catastrophe”  and the [iffy] little additional 0.2°C  seen today  is very unlikely to spark a modern Climate Catastrophe either.
# # # # #
Author’s Comment:
A great deal of the polarization in the Climate Debate  is based on this little trick of data presentation — using a starting date  known to represent a low point  in some data set of a measurement which the author wishes to show has increased to a present high.  Failure to show the full context of the data is a type of data falsification.
Kudos to Geoffrey Gebbie for including both graphs in his paper.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Arctic’s western Barents Sea (Storfjordrenna) surface temperatures now range between 2-4°C. Sea ice persists in the region for 10 months of the year. A new study finds this same region was sea ice-free, 10°C warmer than today (13°C), and SSTs rapidly rose and fell by degrees C per century during the mid-Holocene.
The western Barents Sea surface temperatures oscillated around 3°C in 2015 according to a new study (Łacka et al., 2019).

Image Source: Łacka et al., 2019
During the Bølling-Allerød epoch 14,500 years ago, when CO2 concentrations were still in the 230 ppm range, Łacka et al., 2019 found the western Barents Sea surface temperatures to be comparable (2-4°C) to today.
From about 9000 to 3500 years ago, this same region’s temperatures rapidly (degrees Celsius per century) fluctuated between 3°C and 13°C. The latter temperature value – 10°C warmer than today – was achieved about 6500 years ago (265 ppm CO2).
Evidence also suggests this region of the Arctic was sea ice-free throughout most of the mid-Holocene. In contrast, today’s sea ice persists for all but August and September in the northern Barents Sea.

"BACK in the 1980s anthropogenic global warming was resurrected. Its emphasis was that man-made CO2 would dangerously heat up the world and had to be controlled.
And there was lots of money available if this could be proved. So a multi-billion dollar industry was born.
The first thing was to speed up the rate of warming. This was done by ignoring a large number of temperature measuring stations from cold areas like Siberia, places with altitude such as Bolivia and only one above the Arctic Circle. So far so good.
Two distractions were the Medieval Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age. Michael Mann removed those with his hockey stick graph. It has since been shown that feeding random numbers into his program always resulted in a hockey stick. It rapidly went from the 1995 IPCC report’s cover and Al Gore’s presentations into obscurity.
There was also a problem with the record high temperatures from the 1930s–1940s. To lower them, the major measuring agencies started to adjust the original temperatures. This can be legitimate if weather stations have been moved or their surroundings compromised. A photographic record of every station in the US shows that 80% are no longer correctly positioned mostly due to urbanisation (green fields are now asphalt parking lots). Logically the old readings should have been regarded as valid and current readings would need to be lowered. They’ve done the opposite.
They started reducing the temperatures pre-1960 (give or take) and increasing them since then. NOAA for example was adjusting temperatures this way by 0.01 Fahrenheit per month, but then went to doing it twice a month. But hey, when you’re on a good thing, do it more often! The Australian, NZ and GB BOMs, and the US’s NOAA and NASA have all been doing this. They have also stopped providing historical data to other weather forecasters.
Parts of NOAA were so concerned with their official figures they established 100 green field stations across the US. After 10 years they show a steady drop, whereas the “official” adjusted figures just keep rising. Satellite measurements, which are difficult to fudge, are also showing a stable or dropping temperature pattern.
So what does this all mean? Our temperature records have been modified to meaningless; the computer models are useless (87 of 89 major models can’t get within two standard deviations of actuals); the actuals haven’t risen for 17 years; our governments do not class CO2 as a pollutant (look it up); environmentalists should embrace the benefits of more CO2; windmills and commercial solar should be junked.
Let’s get back to using coal and gas, which are more reliable, cheaper and are less dangerous (actually beneficial) to our environment.
We have experimented with square wheels and they have been a failure; we need to get back to ones that make the world go round.

Dr. Lindzen has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Jule Charney award for “highly significant research in the atmospheric sciences” from the American Meteorological Society in 1985, and the Distinguished Engineering Achievement Award from the Engineer’s Council in 2009.



Dr. Lindzen’s pioneering research in atmospheric dynamics has led to multiple analyses of the sensitivity of surface temperatures to atmospheric carbon dioxide increases, all of which support the hypothesis that the sensitivity is considerably below that necessary to generate disastrous climate change.



As a Distinguished Senior Fellow, Dr. Lindzen will focus his work on the interaction between climate science and policymakers, and the biases that are introduced into science when it becomes a government‐​funded enterprise. He will work primarily out of Cambridge, Massachusetts.



Distinguished Senior Fellow is the most prestigious appointment given by the Cato Institute, and two of these scholars have been awarded Nobel Prizes while affiliated with Cato.

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.

"Twenty-two years ago a bunch of green activists calling themselves “The Earth Summit” met in Rio and invented a way to tour the world at tax-payers’ expense – never-ending conferences on environmental alarms.
Like any good bureaucratic committee, they soon established sub-committees on sustainability, pollution, development, energy, forestry, water, biodiversity, endangered species, poverty, health, population and Agenda 21 (this item alone had 40 chapters each with its own sub-committee). Environmental conferences became the greatest multi-national growth industry in the world financed mainly by tax-payers via participating public servants, climate academics, employees of nationalised industries and tax-sheltered green “charities” such as Greenpeace and WWF.
They really hit the Mother Lode with their creation of the “United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change” which, in good bureaucratic tradition, duplicated the work of the “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” (IPCC). These then created their own brand-names called “Global Warming”, and its proxies “Climate Change” and “Extreme Weather”.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Rebecca Huntley, a prominent Aussie academic, is concerned voters choose politicians with inadequate climate policies. Her solution is for  people who dismiss the urgency of the alleged climate crisis to be driven from positions of power, and prevented from making donations to political parties. 
Climate change splits the public into six groups. Understanding them is key to future actionABC Radio National By Rebecca Huntley for Big IdeasUpdated Wed at 10:14amIn Australia there is now widespread public acceptance of the reality of climate change; we seem to see its effects almost hourly.But the electorate still votes for political parties with environment policies that I would call recalcitrant, and with significant groups of climate deniers in their ranks.…We need to increase the Alarmed cohort, absolutely no doubt.But we also need to develop and hone their skills of talking to others not of the same mindset.And we need to provide social and emotional support as many of them — many of us — struggle with feelings of grief, dread and burning anger about what’s happening to the planet and the response of many of our political leaders.We need to shift more of the Concerned group into the Alarmed group.We need to find a way to convince the Cautious that urgent action is necessary.This, very difficultly, often requires language that isn’t fraught with tones of crisis. More on this in a moment.We need to engage the Disengaged — probably the hardest task of all, because it requires us to rebuild their faith that our democratic institutions are capable and willing to do something about it.And finally — in my opinion, and I say this with no trepidation whatsoever — we need to drive the Dismissive group out of positions of power in our government, stop the flow of their donations into our political parties, and find smarter ways to engage with them in the media, including social media.…This will then expose those who dismiss both the science and the solutions, the denialists — who are today a minority, albeit a powerful one — as what they are: out of step with the rest of us, determined to put our collective wellbeing and our way of life at risk.We must not let their voices be the loudest in the public arena.…Read more: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-29/climate-change-global-warming-six-groups-rebecca-huntley/11893384
Rebecca is advocating that a group she doesn’t like, “climate dismissives”, be excluded from full participation in the democratic process, by “stopping the flow of their donations to political parties”, and by “driving the dismissive group out” of power. Her justification for these extreme views is the alleged urgency of the climate crisis.
There is a name for this brand of political ideology, and it isn’t a nice one.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman @2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here.A common Canadian response when asked whether there is a global climate problem is to declare that “we should do our part” to solve it. While typically generous-spirited, the attitude is dangerously naïve and uninformed. This paper explains why. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Doing-Our-Share-4-A-FINAL.pdfThere is now ample and broadly published evidence that the scientific claims of those who say humans are causing catastrophic global warming are wrong.Doing-Our-Share-4-A-FINALDownload The sensitivity of the global climate to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide is far less than assumed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The actual movement of average global temperatures over centuries, but especially over the last twenty years, bears no relationship to what the IPCC models predicted.The most widely-publicized claims about future adverse climate effects are all being proved wrong (e.g. sea levels are rising at 8 inches per century; polar bear populations are thriving).There have been no increases in extreme weather events, (e.g. hurricanes, floods and droughts) over the last century. These points are well documented in thousands of peer-reviewed articles and in the publications of the Non-Governmental International Panel on Climate Change.If Canadians were to “do their share” in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, what would that be a share of? In other words, what is the rest of the world doing? In fact, over the last 25 years, global CO2 emissions from energy consumption grew by 40 per cent, and they continue to rise every year. Over the last decade, 165 of the 195 countries of the world increased their emissions. This is especially true in the developing countries of Asia and the Middle East. Nine of the ten largest country emitters are not on track to meet even the relatively modest emission reduction commitments they made at the United Nations COP21 conference in 2015. China and India alone are on a track to increase their emissions to perhaps 20 billion tonnes per year in 2030. The poorer countries of the world are determined to increase their economic development and standards of living. To do this they need to gain access to the secure and plentiful energy services provided by fossil fuels that we in the more developed countries take for granted. They will not be deprived of this right because of the concerns of some about carbon dioxide emissions.The costs to Canada of present policies and programs to reduce emissions are already high, especially in terms of increased electricity rates in provinces that are forcing the introduction of high cost wind and solar energy generation and in Alberta and Saskatchewan where radicals have successfully blocked the construction of additional oil pipelines needed to deliver Canadian oil to export markets. The costs in terms of lost revenues, unemployment, and foregone investment are in the tens of billions of dollars per year.These costs will only rise far higher if, as now planned, carbon dioxide taxes continue to rise, and governments continue to increase the over 600 programs and regulations already in place to reduce emissions and halt development. This will affect every sector of the economy, not just oil and gas, but also mining, steel, petrochemicals, metal fabrication, auto and parts manufacturing and other emissions-intensive industries, as well as transportation, residential housing, and agriculture. Yet, Canada’s emissions are just 1.6% of the world’s total.One has to ask why Canadians think they bear responsibility to solve the world’s problems, when we lack the means to do so and the world does not want our “help” anyway. Why do so many share this tragic delusion? Canada’s current emissions policies and targets will inevitably impose immense costs on Canada’s economy and business, with negligible, if any, benefits in terms of changing global emissions. In short, the costs of present and future climate policies are extremely high, and the benefits are virtually nil.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Jupiter’s Cloud Tops: From High to Low

This view from NASA’s Juno spacecraft captures colorful, intricate patterns in a jet stream region of Jupiter’s northern hemisphere known as “Jet N3.”
Jupiter’s cloud tops do not form a simple, flat surface. Data from Juno helped scientists discover that the swirling bands in the atmosphere extend deep into the planet, to a depth of about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers). At center right, a patch of bright, high-altitude “pop-up” clouds rises above the surrounding atmosphere.
Citizen scientist Gerald Eichstädt created this enhanced-color image using data from the spacecraft’s JunoCam imager. The original image was taken on May 29, 2019, at 1:01 a.m. PDT (4:01 a.m. EDT) as the Juno spacecraft performed its 20th close flyby of Jupiter. At the time the image was taken, the spacecraft was about 6,000 miles (9,700 kilometers) from the tops of the clouds, at a latitude of 39 degrees north.

In case you thought you were having a bad day, think of these poor souls…[ ](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/659637a4a2c10f8c9d8636c1b9d3c7be34b1a5d588b66f9b18383eae003e6a8a.png)  




The Swedish ship M / S Malmö with 16 climate activists on board is trapped in the ice at Spitsbergen. This as reported in the Norwegian newspaper Nordlys . The news raises hilarity among critics of climate alarmism: “Maybe they had read in the media that it would now be ice-free”.  
A recurring claim by climate activists is that the Arctic is melting ice and they fear that the earth will be flooded by something similar to the flood described in the Bible. But this hypothesis receives little support from impartial measurements, something that a group of environmental activists have now experienced when their ship crashed in the not so ice-free waters around Spitsbergen.  
The trip with the M / S Malmö to Spitsbergen was launched as a “climate march” in the footsteps of the trip of the polar traveler Ludolf Schjelderup 88 years ago. But instead of melted icebergs and glaciers, they were met by a frozen sea and trapped in the ice.  
During the trip, **the activists had brought a team of documentary makers. It is unclear whether a documentary film will still be released now that the journey is not going as planned** and the reality at Spitsbergen looks different than expected. 



This is not the first time that Climate change activists have become trapped in ice. It [happened last year as well.](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/08/27/another-ship-of-fools-gets-stuck-in-arctic-ice-needs-rescue/)

Share this...FacebookTwitterTough Times for Critics
By Die kalte Sonne
(Translated by P. Gosselin)
The climate issue now dominates almost all areas of life. This makes it all the more important that the arguments of the critics of the climate alarm are finally heard seriously. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
On the contrary, those who do not support the alarm line will be publicly scolded, possibly obstructing their career and future. An almost perfectly controlled opinion system has been established.
Has something like this existed before? Have there been cases where good arguments were ignored for far too long, where critics had to fear reprisals, to the point where they were finally proved right and public opinion suddenly turned? Yes, there have been such cases. It seems to be a basic psychological pattern in human society to regard one side as the only valid truth in controversial debates and to present competing opinions as the misguided misconceptions of some madmen. The following three examples illustrate this:
1. The case of Claas Relotius
I’m sure you know the case. A Spiegel editor (Claas Relotius), who was highly respected at the time and showered with prizes, had incorporated years of invented facts into his reports. When another reporter (Juan Moreno) found out about his colleague, his superiors did not believe him at first, although he provided good evidence. This went so far that he was threatened with termination of his contract.
Moreno fought for his professional survival and was able to convict Relotius in the end. You can read in Moreno’s exciting book “Thousand Lines of Lies: The Relotius System and German Journalism“.

2. Doping in cycling
For many years, professional doping was used in cycling, and it is probably still the case today. Whoever wanted to make the manipulations public was done in the cycling scene. The best example was the multiple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, who defended himself against all accusations legally and otherwise with great effort. In the end, everything was discovered.
In January 2013 Armstrong confessed his doping past in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Read the book “The Cycling Mafia and its dirty business” by Tyler Hamilton and Daniel Coyle.



3. The rejection of continental drift
Today we know that the continents are moving. When Alfred Wegener proposed this at the beginning of the 20th century, he was laughed at and ridiculed. Long after his death it turned out that he was right. We had reported about it here in the blog (“Plate tectonics is catching on: Lessons for the Climate Debate” and “Continental Shift and Climate Change: The Miraculous Repetition of the History of Science“). A comprehensive treatise on the subject was published by Naomi Oreskes in her book “The Rejection of Continental Drift: Theory and Method in American Earth Science“.
=======================================
4. Alzheimer’s cabal
Another example of rampant dogmatism in science to add here is: “The maddening saga of how an Alzheimer’s ‘cabal’ thwarted progress toward a cure for decades” by Sharon Begley.
Her report exposes how a “cabal” of “influential researchers have long believed so dogmatically in one theory of Alzheimer’s that they systematically thwarted alternative approaches.” Had it not been for this dogmatism, “we would be 10 or 15 years ahead of where we are now,” said Dr. Daniel Alkon, a longtime NIH neuroscientist who started a company to develop an Alzheimer’s treatment.

Pat Michaels is in San Francisco this week attending the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and presenting a poster detailing the widening mismatch between observations of the earth’s temperature and climate model projections of its behavior. Since most global warming concern (including that behind regulatory action) stems from the projections of climate models as to how the earth’s temperature will evolve as we emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels to produce energy), it is important to keep a tab on how the model projections are faring when compared with reality. That they are faring not very well should be more widely known—Pat will spread the word while there.   
  
We don’t want those of you who are unable to attend the conference to think you are missing out on anything, so we have reformatted our poster presentation to fit this blog format (it is available in its original format here).

**INTRODUCTION**   
  
Recent climate change literature has been dominated by studies which show that the equilibrium climate sensitivity is better constrained than the latest estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA) and that the best estimate of the climate sensitivity is considerably lower than the climate model ensemble average. From the recent literature, the central estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity is ~2°C, while the climate model average is ~3.2°C, or an equilibrium climate sensitivity that is some 40% lower than the model average.   
  
To the extent that the recent literature produces a more accurate estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity than does the climate model average, it means that the projections of future climate change given by both the IPCC and NCA are, by default, some 40% too large (too rapid) and the associated (and described) impacts are gross overestimates.   






__



CAPTION: Climate sensitivity estimates from new research beginning in 2011 (colored), compared with the assessed range given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the collection of climate models used in the IPCC AR5. The “likely” (greater than a 66% likelihood of occurrence) range in the IPCC Assessment is indicated by the gray bar. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95 percent confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The right-hand side of the IPCC AR5 range is actually the 90% upper bound (the IPCC does not actually state the value for the upper 95 percent confidence bound of their estimate). Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best-matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing. The mean climate sensitivity (3.2°C) of the climate models used in the IPCC AR5 60% greater than the mean of recent estimates (2.0°C).  
  
  
  
A quantitative test of climate model performance can be made by comparing the range of model projections against observations of the evolution of the global average surface temperature since the mid-20th century. Here, we perform such a comparison on a collection of 108 model runs comprising the ensemble used in the IPCC’s 5th Scientific Assessment and find that the observed global average temperature evolution for trend lengths (with a few exceptions) since 1980 is less than 97.5% of the model distribution, meaning that the observed trends are significantly different from the average trend simulated by climate models. For periods approaching 40 years in length, the observed trend lies outside of (below) the range that includes 95% of all climate model simulations.   






_CAPTION: The annual average global surface temperatures from 108 individual CMIP5 climate model runs forced with historical (+ RCP45 since 2006) forcings were obtained from the KNMI Climate Explorer website. Linear trends were computed through the global temperatures from each run, ending in 2014 and beginning each year from 1951 through 2005. The trends for each period (ranging in length from 10 to 64 years) were averaged across all model runs (black dots). The range containing 90 percent (thin black lines), and 95 percent (dotted black lines) of trends from the 108 model runs is indicated. The observed linear trends for the same periods were calculated from the annual average global surface temperature record compiled by the U.K. Hadley Center (HadCRUT4) (colored dots) (the value for 2014 was the 10-mon, January through October, average). Observed trend values which were less than or equal to the 2.5 th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored red; observed trend values which were between the 2.5th and the 5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored yellow; and observed trend values greater than the 5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored green._   
  
  






_CAPTION: Distribution of 20-yr temperature trends (top) and 30-yr temperature trends (right) from 108 climate model runs during the period ending in 2014 (blue bars). The observed 20-yr temperature trend (bottom) and 30-yr temperature trend (right) over the same intervals are indicated by the arrows colored to match the designations described in the previous figure._   
  
  
  
**CONCLUSIONS**   
  
We conclude that at the global scale, this suite of climate models has failed. Treating them as mathematical hypotheses, which they are, means that it is the duty of scientists to reject their predictions in lieu of those with a lower climate sensitivity.   
  
It is impossible to present reliable future projections from a collection of climate models which generally cannot simulate observed change. As a consequence, we recommend that unless/until the collection of climate models can be demonstrated to accurately capture observed characteristics of known climate changes, policymakers should avoid basing any decisions upon projections made from them. Further, those policies which have already be established using projections from these climate models should be revisited. Assessments which suffer from the inclusion of unreliable climate model projections include those produced by the IPCC and the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program (including their most recent National Climate Assessment). Policies which are based upon such assessments include those established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pertaining to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

The Green Party posted the following status update unironically after Greta Thunberg’s United Nations speech. The Greens act like they’re still in opposition, even though the Labour Party are fully on board, with Jacinda declaring that climate change is her “nuclear free moment”.



Why haven’t they implemented all of their proposals to save the planet yet? Why are they still running Green Party rallies disguised as strikes? It’s because they don’t genuinely believe that the world is going to end.



Even Miss Thunberg’s speech writers don’t really believe it. The quotes they authored are so vague and bland they could mean anything. Things are going to change! Mass extinction is coming! The only mass extinction event coming is that of birth-striking abortion-loving liberals, who seem to be so fixated on the weather that they’ve forgotten how to breed.



What are the solutions? You must pay more taxes, give up your freedoms, and give unlimited power to the government. If they ever do convince me that climate catastrophe is upon us, then you’ll see me dumping all my trash in the ocean in the hope that the world does end in ten years.



I grew up in the climate alarmist world, although thankfully I had parents that treated it like the joke it was. I spent my childhood years looking at the “Al Gore Doomsday countdown clock” on Rush Limbaugh’s website—it even had a mushroom cloud beneath it, that was my favourite part.



I watched the whole thing go from around 8 years to nothing. That’s also precisely what happened: nothing.



I have this weird sense of deja vu, and I haven’t even reached my mid-twenties. I contemplate whether to build my children their own “countdown to Armageddon” so that they can have an identical childhood to my own. It must be torturous to be a boomer, as the various mass extinction events they’ve survived have probably blended together into one never-ending nightmare.



David Harsanyi at the Federalist has commented on the great tragedy that is playing out before our eyes.



[…] Thunberg lives in the healthiest, wealthiest, safest, and most peaceful era humans have ever known. She is one of the luckiest people to have ever lived.



In a just world, Thunberg would be at the United Nations thanking capitalist countries for bequeathing her this remarkable inheritance. Instead, she, like millions of other indoctrinated kids her age, act as if they live in a uniquely broken world on the precipice of disaster. This is a tragedy. 



Greta Thunberg herself shouldn’t be mocked or hated, but she does deserve our pity.



It’s the fault of ideologues who obsess over every weather event as if it were Armageddon, ignoring the massive moral upside of carbon-fueled modernity. It’s the fault of the politicians, too cowardly to tell voters that their utopian visions of a world run on solar panels and windmills is fairy tale.



  
Harsanyi followed his article up with[ dozens of charts](https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/25/here-are-a-bunch-of-charts-that-prove-the-world-is-better-than-ever/) demonstrating how we live in the most peaceful, prosperous, and safe era of history. “The world is better than ever”, he announced.



As [Candace Owens tweeted](https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1176251096819367936), one day Greta will realise that she is a victim of child abuse, not of climate change.



That really gets to the heart of the matter.



In 2019, the climate alarmist movement has morphed into something more cynical than the original get-rich-quick scheme concocted by Al Gore.



Victimhood is the dominant culture and currency in progressive politics. David Marcus from the Federalist picks up on this:



For white progressives, climate change is a unique issue in which racial guilt plays little to no role […] **for once, they can be the victim,** not just the ally.



And man, are they enjoying it. This is the moment for angry, young white people not only to be angry, but to actually be oppressed. It is their own future that they believe is being stripped from them by failure to accept that if we don’t act in the next eight minutes, all is lost. 



Everyone gets to be a victim of climate change.



The irony, of course, is that cheap energy has done more to lift people all across the globe out of poverty than anything in human history. The clamp-down on carbon that these privileged college kids insist upon will do more to secure their economic dominance than anything a white supremacist could come up with in his mother’s basement. They want to slam the brakes on economic progress while they are on top. 



Carbon dioxide is what propelled the western world to its greatest heights, but now developing nations must be restricted from doing the same. Clawing your way out of the stone ages takes a lot of CO2.



This is the fight for the young white progressive, who maybe, just maybe, is feeling a little tired of having to take the backseat. On this issue, they get to move back to the front of the bus, lead, and bemoan their own oppression. Ah, to be oppressed, the golden ticket of progressive culture, the chance to shine. The moment when they can focus on themselves and accept the applause and grave approval of the progressive culture. Well, it was bound to happen. And they are truly making the most of it. 



  
This analysis isn’t right-wing satire. I’ve seen genuine diversity ambassadors complain that striking for the climate is “privileged” as not everyone can afford to take a day off.



That’s more proof that basically no one really believes in catastrophic climate change—the planet is dying and we’re all going extinct, but they can’t afford to take one day off work unless they’re rich or under 18?



I’m almost tempted to go and join those kids on their umpteeth climate crusade, it’s the one chance I’ll ever get to play the victim card.



Yet it is so very tragic. A large part of the current generation, who have so much to be thankful for, are enslaved in fear and driven to the depths of despair by an immoral globalist elite who will stop at nothing in their lust for power.



They’re willing to sacrifice an entire generation on the altar of climate-induced despair in a bargain to satiate their desire for world domination.



There’s a little problem though: there is a resurgent nationalist populist movement standing in their way. They can call us many names, but “victim” isn’t one of them.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The stage is set for fierce battles starting tomorrow as the U. S. Senate begins confirmation hearings on   Donald J. Trump’s cabinet picks, even though many have not completed customary background checks or ethics reviews. The first focus will be Senator Jeff Sessions, above, Mr. Trump’s choice for attorney general. Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, is in the U. S. for talks with advisers of Mr. Trump and congressional leaders. In 2015, Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Trump displayed “an ignorance that is truly alarming. ” _____ • “Laughter of the year!” Russian politicians and commentators are ridiculing a U. S. intelligence report that outlines an elaborate plot ordered by President Vladimir V. Putin to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential race. Interviews with supporters of Mr. Trump in two U. S. states found similarly dismissive opinions. Journalists are trying to come to terms with Moscow’s ability to steer Western news coverage by doling out hacked documents. _____ • In Jerusalem, a Palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of Israeli soldiers, killing four, injuring 17 others and ending several months of relative calm in the city. Israel was shaken politically by a report that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiated for more positive coverage with Yediot Aharonot, a newspaper that is often critical of the prime minister, in exchange for curtailing its main competitor. And Israel’s ambassador to Britain apologized over a recording of a senior diplomat plotting to “take down” senior British politicians. _____ • At the Golden Globes, the musical “La La Land” dominated by winning a record seven awards. In drama categories, “Moonlight” won best picture, “The Crown” won best television show and Isabelle Huppert was named best actress for her performance in “Elle. ” And Meryl Streep used her acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award to forcefully criticize Mr. Trump. _____ • Two men who made history died: Mário Soares, who guided Portugal’s rocky transition to democracy in the 1970s, was 92. Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a founder of Iran’s Islamic Republic, was 82. _____ • Freezing temperatures spread across most of Europe over the weekend, killing dozens and disrupting traffic. Russia celebrated the coldest Orthodox Christmas in 120 years. It will remain bitterly cold across Europe’s southeast today, but temperatures are expected to rise in Western Europe. Fresh snow in the Alps is good news for ski resorts there. _____ • In London, a   strike of staff members that has shut most Underground stations in Central London is disrupting commutes today. And British Airways said a cabin crew strike on Tuesday and Wednesday would not disrupt flights. • Russia required Apple and Google to remove the LinkedIn app from their local stores. • A Volkswagen regulatory compliance executive was arrested in the U. S. on conspiracy charges, marking an escalation of the criminal investigation into the automaker’s diesel emissions cheating scandal. • The European Union’s statistics agency is expected to say that unemployment in the eurozone remained unchanged in November. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Many Turks view President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s authoritarianism as reassuring in the face of a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks. [The New York Times] • Germany threatened to end development aid to countries that refuse to take back rejected asylum seekers. [Agence  ] • An assembly of Irish citizens convened by Parliament is considering changes to one of the most divisive policies in the country: the   ban on abortions.

The combination of grain and water is comfort served in its most humble form. The dish has also been feeding the world for thousands of years. Congee, a   porridge, has been eaten in China since about 2, 500 B. C. Koreans make variations of juk, with pine nut as the main ingredient. Upma is a thick porridge made from roasted semolina or rice flour common in south India. And in Ethiopia, genfo, unique for its use of red pepper, is a traditional Sunday breakfast. On many cold mornings, Americans start their days with oatmeal. The actor Wilford Brimley famously pitched the food’s health benefits in an ad, saying, “It’s the right thing to do. ” But Scots may be the most famous consumers of oats. They’ve been a staple of their diets since the Roman Empire. Scotland even hosts a global   competition  —   the Golden Spurtle is the top prize. Scotland’s former oldest living woman swore by the dish. Before her death in 2015 at 109, she revealed her secret to longevity. “A nice warm bowl of porridge every morning,” she said, and “staying away from men. ” Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.

"In an exit memorandum reflecting on eight years of United States foreign policy, Secretary of State John Kerry enumerated the Obama administration’s diplomatic accomplishments. But that record may be weakened or overturned by   Donald J. Trump, who has denigrated many of President Obama’s policies. Here is a look at how the secretary and the   see the major foreign policy issues differently. Kerry: Mr. Kerry praised the 2015 deal that the United States brokered with Iran to curtail that country’s ability to produce nuclear weapons. Mr. Kerry wrote that before the deal was struck, Iran was less than “90 days away from having the material necessary to produce one nuclear weapon,” but “today they are at least a year away. ” He wrote on Thursday, “In reaching and implementing this deal, we took a major security threat off the table without firing a single shot. ” Trump: Mr. Trump made criticism of the nuclear deal a major talking point of his foreign policy in the presidential campaign. He has called the agreement “the worst deal ever negotiated. ” At a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March, he said, “My No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. ” Later, he said he would renegotiate the agreement. Kerry: The secretary said that the United States tried to reset relations with Russia early in President Obama’s first term, but that a series of aggressions including “unprecedented cyber intrusions,” “military intervention in Syria,” and the “illegal occupation” of Ukraine impeded that effort. Trump: Mr. Trump has made improved relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a cornerstone of his future foreign policy. After American intelligence agencies provided evidence that Russians hacked Democratic National Committee systems to help tip the election in his favor, Mr. Trump criticized the reliability of the intelligence community. He has praised Mr. Putin and said he would work closely with him to combat the Islamic State. Mr. Trump also seemed to upend American nuclear weapons policy when he declared in December: “Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all. ” Kerry: Mr. Kerry devoted a significant portion of his memo to climate change, calling it “not just a threat to the future of our planet, but a growing and immediate threat to our national security. ” He lauded an agreement struck between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, which bolstered a global climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 that he called the most “ambitious, inclusive climate agreement ever negotiated. ” Trump: Mr. Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” said he would “cancel” the Paris accords and vowed to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency “in almost every form. ” His nominee to run that agency is Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry, who has led the legal battle against Mr. Obama’s   policies. Kerry: Though the Obama administration never fulfilled a promise to shutter the Guantánamo Bay detention center, Mr. Kerry wrote that ”no single action would do more to reaffirm our commitment to international human rights norms and remove a recruiting tool for terrorists than closing” the site. During Mr. Obama’s presidency, the number of detainees decreased to 59 from 242, with 20 approved for transfer. Trump: In a message posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Mr. Trump wrote: “There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield. ” Kerry: “It would be a moral failing of the highest caliber to turn our backs on those in need  —   including and especially from countries like Syria and Iraq,” Mr. Kerry wrote, adding that the United States had a “profound responsibility to help refugees. ” Trump: After the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. in December 2015, Mr. Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. ” Later in the campaign, he said: “We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place. ”"
"The Climate Change Authority wants Australians to cut their production of carbon dioxide to 19% below 2000 levels by the year 2020.
The climate boffins should employ a demographer before they set such unrealistic goals.
The population of Australia in 2000 was about 19 million and it is now 23 million. By 2020 it will probably be over 25 million.
If Australia’s production of carbon dioxide was merely frozen at the 2000 level, that would require a 24% reduction per head of population by 2020.
If we add to that a real reduction in total emissions of 19% by 2020, emissions per capita would need to fall by 39% in just 6 years.
Even more unbelievable, China (supported by the UN/IPCC) thinks that developed countries “need to cut emissions by 40% from their 1990 levels by 2020”. This would require Australia’s per capita emissions to fall by 60% to just 40% of their 1990 levels. All achieved within the next six years.
Nothing real gets produced or done without generating carbon dioxide. Every working car, truck, tractor, dozer, quad bike, boat, helicopter, bulk carrier and aeroplane generates carbon dioxide. None of these will be powered by wind-mills, sunbeams or nuclear power in the next six years. How will they force us to use 39% less of them – carbon ration cards?
Making steel, bricks, cement, bitumen, minerals, metals, food, fertilisers and roads produces carbon dioxide – shall we each use just 61% of what we did in 2000?
Humans, cattle, sheep, pigs, barbeques, champagne and beer also emit carbon dioxide – shall we ration these too?
And Australian trains, lifts, supermarkets, operating theatres, refineries and power stations will not keep working 24/7 without base-load electricity from coal and gas, both generating carbon dioxide. Who is volunteering for living solely with Green Energy – brown-outs, blackouts or irregular “Earth Hours” for about four months of the year?
There is one way to achieve these goals – “The Tasmanian Solution”. Send 40% of our remaining industry to Asia, and convert Australia into a quiet green utopia of genteel poverty. This should create sufficient unemployment and reduced consumption to achieve the required emissions austerity.
Is the Climate Change Authority engineering an emissions target depression to achieve its savage cuts, or is this just another mindless model-driven target? We should demand to see their detailed plans for achieving these targets.
Carbon dioxide is hugely beneficial for all plant life, and its effect on global temperature is tiny and probably beneficial for most people. There is no evidence that carbon dioxide causes extreme weather. Man-made Climate Policy is a far greater and more certain danger than Man-made Climate Change.
Meanwhile, in the real world, the tide has turned in the war on carbon. Global warming stopped seventeen years ago; the carbon price collapsed a year ago; the EU is backpedalling on its disastrous green energy gamble; Russia, China, India, Japan, Canada, USA, Brazil and South Africa will not sign any binding Kyoto agreement; China has plans to build 160 new coal fired power stations in the next four years; and Tim Flannery has been sacked.

"**Greggs boss Roger Whiteside has said his firm would pay staff who have to self-isolate because of coronavirus.**
""Our default position is that we pay contract hours. We don't have any zero contract hours,"" he told BBC's Today.
The firm's policy is in contrast to some other firms, which say they will only pay the legal minimum. He said Greggs' policy could be reviewed if coronavirus became a ""big problem"".
The comments came as Greggs posted a 13.5% rise in 2019 sales to Â£1.168bn.
The sandwich chain's success was helped by the popularity of its new vegan range, but the baker saw a significant slowdown last month as storms kept customers away.
And Greggs also cautioned there is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus.
Pre-tax profits rose to Â£108.3m from Â£82.6m in 2018, the company said.
Greggs' policy for staff who are ordered to stay at home if they been in contact with an infected person is in contrast to some other companies.
Last week Wetherspoons, one of the UK's biggest employers, said staff would be subject to regular statutory sick pay rules if they had to self-isolate.
Under statutory sick pay rules, an employee is not paid for the first three days of absence, and then only if they earn at least Â£118 a week.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock has sent guidance to UK employers telling them that staff who have been asked to self-isolate are entitled to take the time as sick leave.
Michele Piertney, of the independent arbitration service Acas, said people would not get sick leave as a matter of course if a medical expert put them into quarantine.
Many casual or agency workers may be entitled to sick pay, but self-employed people are not. Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick pay and should ask their employer.
Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, has written to Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey asking her to change the rules around sick pay.
He was speaking after fears that zero-hours workers would go into work, even if they were supposed to be self-isolating, to ensure they got paid.
""The government must bring in emergency measures so these low-paid workers are protected financially, particularly those caring for the most vulnerable in society,"" said Mr Prentis. ""It should be made compulsory for employers to give them sick pay, even if they're not officially eligible.""
The startling success of Greggs - rising sales for six years in a row, a rapid expansion in geographical coverage and a share price that has doubled in three years - is one of the enduring puzzles of British business.
General retailers have been in retreat across the board, and general bakers have been squeezed by tough competition from supermarkets and booming coffee chains like Pret a Manger and Costa. If the formula is not quite right, disaster awaits, as the dramatic failure of Patisserie Valerie proved. Despite all this Greggs has prospered. Why?
Part of the answer is that Greggs has the formula right - it has constantly tweaked what it sells to get the price and range right, and has not been afraid to follow trends. It has also been cute with its marketing, using social media to give the chain an image that belies its traditional roots.
The magic ingredient though, has been its attitude to staff and customers. Chief executive Roger Whiteside says the company's ""default position"" when staff are off work is to pay. It has fixed hours contracts, not zero hours, and when its stores were closed by floods recently, it continued to pay staff who could not come to work.
It has paid out big bonuses when the times are good - 10% of profits, so Â£13m this year - and has just reworked its internal culture statement after an extensive consultation with staff. For customers there is the ""Greggs Pledge"", which promises the company will be run for their good as well.
But this does not mean the company operates in some feelgood happy zone. There is also a pragmatic edge, with the warning that while it intended to pay workers who self-isolate because of coronavirus, that largesse could not continue indefinitely.
Justin Tomlinson, a work and pensions minister, said the current advice for workers with no sick pay who had to self-isolate was to claim universal credit, the Guardian reports.
The impact of coronavirus could hit Greggs' figures in 2020.
""We made a very strong start to 2020 in January, but in February saw a significant slowdown in sales growth as a result of the storms that have affected the UK,"" said Mr Whiteside.
""There is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus. This aside, we expect to make year-on-year progress and will do so from a strong financial position."""

Tell me it isn’t true! Surely the models are not programmed to show a warming world as a result of increasing CO2? 



State-of-the-art climate models predict that as a result of human-induced climate change, the surface of the Pacific Ocean should be warming—some parts more, some less, but all warming nonetheless. Indeed, most regions are acting as expected, with one key exception: what scientists call the equatorial cold tongue. This is a strip of relatively cool water stretching along the equator from Peru into the western Pacific, across quarter of the earth’s circumference. It is produced by equatorial trade winds that blow from east to west, piling up warm surface water in the west Pacific, and also pushing surface water away from the equator itself. This makes way for colder waters to well up from the depths, creating the cold tongue.



Climate models of global warming—computerized simulations of what various parts of the earth are expected to do in reaction to rising greenhouse gases—say that the equatorial cold tongue, along with other regions, should have started warming decades ago, and should still be warming now. **But the cold tongue has remained stubbornly cold.**



This troubles many scientists, because the cold tongue plays a key role in global climate. For example, it affects the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, a natural cyclic strengthening and weakening of the trade winds that causes cooling and warming of the eastern Pacific surface every two to seven years. ENSO is the world’s master weather maker; depending on which part of the cycle it is in, its echoes in the atmosphere may bring heavy rains or drought across much of the Americas, east Asia and east Africa. Whether the cold tongue warms will likely affect weather across huge regions. Resulting shifts could affect world food supplies and outbreaks of dangerous weather. **But our predictions of those shifts rest on climate models.**



Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, **has long suspected that climate models get the cold tongue wrong.** In 1997, he and colleagues published a paper suggesting that it had not warmed at all during the 20th century. At the time, most scientists assumed that any discrepancy between real-world temperatures and those predicted by climate models were due to natural variability. We should just wait; eventually the signal of cold tongue warming would emerge. Now, two decades later, with more modern satellite data in hand, **real-world observations are veering ever more obviously from the models**. It is time to reconsider, says Seager. […]



The **mismatch between observed changes in cold tongue temperature over past decades and the models is quite striking**. There are scores of simulations with multiple models from research groups across the world. While these models are all forced by the same histories of greenhouse gases, volcanoes, solar radiation and other forces, they generate their own internal variability. Hence they create a range of estimates of climate history. **For changes in cold-tongue temperature, the observed changes are at the far cold end or outside the model range**. The average or median model says the cold tongue should have warmed by 0.8 degrees C or more over the past six decades, but the real value is only 0.4 degrees or less.



 **Well, they’ve been out of line for decades.** This is not a new problem. […] The implication for modelers is that **they must find out why their models have biases, and fix them.**

"They read like descriptions of props from the script of a Hollywood heist caper, with promises to ward off “attacks” on all six sides from the usual suspects: hammer, crowbar, drill, blowtorch, nitroglycerin. That is the language of the brochures and websites of the city’s safe dealers, a small but longstanding industry that manages fears in and around the diamond district not only of disasters like fires or explosions, but also of hypothetical supervillains. When a safe is breached, word travels quickly. What happened? Whose safe was it? How did they get in? Those were the sorts of questions raised last week after a team of burglars broke into a jeweler’s office on West 36th Street on New Year’s Eve. The crime was widely reported for its scope  —   the thieves made off with $6 million in diamonds and other gems  —   and its brazen timing, occurring as the ball dropped six blocks away in a neighborhood teeming with police officers. Surveillance video showing two people hitting a   door with hammers was taken immediately after midnight, the police said, when the sound of cheers would have most likely drowned out any banging. But what happened next is, to many in the safe industry, more important than the forced entry. The two safes that held the valuables, the police said, showed no sign of forced entry. The police have not provided further details on the safes. News reports have suggested investigators are looking into whether someone working for the dealer who provided the safes gave the thieves the combinations. A man answering the telephone at the office of the dealer, Lacka Safe in New Jersey, said on Friday that the owners declined to comment. As that investigation unfolds, the burglary  —   or “attack,” in   security parlance  —   draws attention to the last line of defense for the city’s many jewelers, an object that, for all the advances in technology over the years, remains a box with three sides, a top, a bottom and a door.   safes evoke exciting scenes from the movies, with steely safecrackers listening for clicks or drilling into dense steel with lasers. In reality, though, making safes is a hushed trade built on discretion and trust. “I get calls all the time, ‘Are your people O. K.?’” said Richard Krasilovsky of Empire Safe in Midtown. “How safe is it  —   all puns intended  —   for your people to do the work? The people know where the safe is going. I say it’s a legitimate question to ask. ” Dealers carry an array of safes and locks, including digital locks with keypads and time locks that prevent anyone from opening the door, with or without the combination, while they’re activated. The jewelers of Manhattan historically prefer more traditional designs for their safes, dealers said last week, with mechanical combination locks. “It’s an older industry,” said Dov Israeli of Precision Lock and Safe in Floral Park, N. Y. “They’re focused on price and less on what’s new. ” A jeweler typically requires a certain level of protection to satisfy its insurance company. These levels shown in ratings by Underwriters Laboratories, such as   or   indicate that safecrackers at the lab, using tools and torches, were unable to breach any of the six sides of the safe in 60 or 30 minutes. That is probably a greater margin of safety than the standard jeweler needs. “  point nine nine nine percent of burglars out there can’t penetrate a properly made ” Mr. Krasilovsky said. A brochure for a line of safes at Empire states that they are made of “  and   armor” for “greater protection against attack,” and that they protect against everything from “hammers and simple drills, to thermal and electrical equipment, such as oxyacetylene torches and disk cutters. ” Mr. Krasilovsky said he met potential clients to offer a risk assessment based on what they were protecting and other factors, looking for what he called “an Achilles’ heel. ” “It’s very easy to sell somebody protection, which is a safe,” he said. “I try to sell prevention. Protection is a science. I don’t want the schmucks coming onto the premises. ” A cheaper safe may meet the requirements of an insurance company, while appearing to a burglar to be vulnerable. A technician sets the combination for a safe’s lock for the first time. “We have you write it on a piece of paper,” and hand it to the technician, Mr. Israeli said. Some dealers may keep a copy for a period of time, in case the safe’s owner should need it. “We tear it up  —   we won’t keep a combination for you,” he said. “It’s not even a service we will provide. ”"

By Professor Fritz Vahrenholt
A few days ago, an international research group from the USA, Canada and Switzerland led by Lorenzo Polvani of Columbia University (New York) published a sensational study in Nature climate change, which attributes a large part of the warming of the 20th century to CFCs (“Substantial twentieth-century Arctic warming caused by ozone-depleting substances“).
Using 10 climate models, the researchers calculated the global and Arctic temperature development, once with CFCs in the atmosphere and once without.
According to these models, from 1955 to 2005, global temperatures increase by 0.59 °C with CFCs and by 0.39 °C without CFCs. One third of the warming is therefore not caused by CO2 but by the CFCs.
If the remaining warming for CO2 is converted over the five decades, an average warming of 0.08 °C per decade remains. Not exactly a lot. CFCs have a 19000-23000 times stronger forcing than CO2.
Half of Arctic warming due to CFCs

In the Arctic, the CFCs had an even greater impact in the model calculations. As is well known, the warming there from 1955 to 2005 was greater than on a global scale, by 1.59 °C in the models. According to Polvani, without CFCs the increase would have been only 0.82°C, i.e. only half as much.
Half of Arctic melt due to CFCs
The same applies to sea ice. According to Polvani, half of the decrease in the area of Arctic sea ice in September (the smallest extent of Arctic sea ice in each case) is thus attributable to CFCs. The other way round: only a maximum of half of the warming and the decline of the sea ice can be attributed to CO2.
Authors asked to edit conclusion
The authors conclude that the decrease of CFCs in the air due to the prohibition of the substances will substantially defuse the warming and the decrease of ice in the future. It is interesting that these clear conclusions called mainstream scientists to the scene. Piers Forster of the University of Leeds and John Fyfe of the Canadian University of Victoria asked the authors to change the sentence in the conclusion from “CFCs produce 1/3 of global warming and half of Arctic climate change” to “CFCs are an important contribution to the global climate system, especially in the Arctic”.
The numbers remain, but the interpretation is clouded because it would cause too much sensation. That’s how climate science framing works today.

"Just hours before what would have been his 70th birthday, David Bowie resurfaced. A new video for one of Mr. Bowie’s final songs and a brief EP of previously released tracks were made available late on Saturday, almost exactly a year since the release of the musician’s final album, “Blackstar,” and days before the first anniversary of his death on Jan. 10. The video, for the song “No Plan,” was directed by Tom Hingston, who also worked with Mr. Bowie on videos for the songs “I’d Rather Be High (Venetian Mix)” and “Sue (Or in a Season of Crime). ” The clip features a ghostly row of television screens flashing the lyrics of Mr. Bowie’s song, which explores themes of disembodiment and confusion. Above the screens is a sign for Newton Electrical, a reference to Thomas Jerome Newton, Mr. Bowie’s character in the film “The Man Who Fell to Earth. ” That character was resurrected as the protagonist of “Lazarus,” a musical featuring Mr. Bowie’s songs that began its run in late 2015. All of the songs on the new EP were featured on the “Lazarus” cast recording released this fall. The EP, also called “No Plan,” includes “Lazarus” from “Blackstar,” as well as “No Plan,” “Killing a Little Time” and “When I Met You. ” The four songs, all of which were recorded during sessions for “Blackstar,” are Mr. Bowie’s final studio recordings. Mr. Bowie recorded “Blackstar” with the Donny McCaslin Quartet, a jazz combo he had scouted in Greenwich Village, from January to March 2014 at the Magic Shop in SoHo. In “David Bowie: The Last Five Years,” a new documentary exploring the final period of his career that was broadcast on the BBC on Saturday night, Johan Renck, the director of the “Lazarus” video, said Mr. Bowie had learned his cancer was terminal during the filming of the clip, three months before he died. Reacting to the new release on social media, fans celebrated and mourned the musician anew. “Happy Birthday, Starman,” one Twitter user wrote. “I miss you every single day. ”"

Summary: We have had several near-misses – asteroids passing close by with little warning from our sensors. This reminds us that asteroid and comet impacts have changed the course of life on Earth, and will again unless we stop them. Which we will, eventually, either when we go deeper into space – or after we are hit. This post discusses this risk and what steps we can take now to better prepare. Perhaps it is humanity’s role to defend the planet.
“The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn’t have a space program. And if we become extinct because we don’t have a space program, it’ll serve us right!”
— Science fiction author Larry Niven, as quoted by Arthur C. Clarke.

We can’t say that we weren’t warned
WaPo: “‘It snuck up on us.’ Scientists stunned by ‘city-killer’ asteroid that just missed Earth.”
How much would an asteroid impact hurt?
Even a small asteroid could devastate a city. What would impacts of different sizes do to your community? See the stunning results at Purdue U’s Impact Earth website. A presentation by NASA’s David Kring gives examples and consequences of impacts.
How likely is an impact? One could hit tomorrow.
The U.S. Government’s sensors recorded at least 556 meteors entering the atmosphere (fireballs, technically bolides) from 1994-2013. The largest in this record was a 20 meter asteroid near Chelyabins in central Russia on 15 February 2013 (details here), an explosion equivalent to 440- 500 kilotons of TNT.
The size of the dots on this NASA map represents the meteor’s optical radiant energy. The smallest dot on the map is 1 billion Joules (1 GJ), the equivalent of roughly 5 tons of TNT. The dots for 100, 10,000 and 1,000,000 GJ convert to 300 tons, 18,000 tons and one million tons of TNT. The Hiroshima blast was equivalent to 15,000 tons.

Scientists have accumulated enough data to estimate the odds of impacts from space.
“Every day Earth is bombarded with more than 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles from space. About once a year, an automobile-sized asteroid hits Earth’s atmosphere, creating a spectacular fireball (bolide) event as the friction of the Earth’s atmosphere causes them to disintegrate – sometimes explosively.
“Studies of Earth’s history indicate that about once every 5,000 years or so on average an object the size of a football field hits Earth and causes significant damage. Once every few million years on average an object large enough to cause regional or global disaster impacts Earth. Impact craters on Earth, the Moon and other planetary bodies are evidence of these occurrences.
“Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona, is evidence of the impact with Earth’s surface of a 50-meter asteroid about 50,000 years ago. Impact of the metal-rich object released energy equivalent to a 10 megaton explosion and formed a 1.2 kilometer-diameter crater.” {Source: NASA.}
The National Research Council published a typically magisterial analysis of this threat: “Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth Object Surveys & Hazard Mitigation Strategies“ (2010). Here are the numbers, comforting or terrifying, depending on your perspective. Thirty-five million years ago, a 5-8 km impactor blasted out the Popigai crater – at the time of the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event. The dinosaurs were killed by an object 11-81 km in diameter.

Books and films about how this happens and how we respond
Stories about collisions with space objects go back to the 19thC. Perhaps the best story about doom from the sky is When Worlds Collide by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer (1933). Earth is hit by a rogue planet. But there is good news!
An example of an optimistic science-fiction story in this genre is Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke (1973). A city is destroyed. Humanity says “never again” and creates Project Spaceguard – sending us into space. An ounce of prevention is worth …etc.
Lucifer’s Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (1977) is gripping disaster porn about a comet hitting Earth. “Cities were turned into oceans; oceans turned into steam. It was the beginning of a new Ice Age and the end of civilization. But for the terrified men and women chance had saved, it was also the dawn of a new struggle for survival.”
Hollywood has given the inspiring stories about humanity defending the world against doom from space.

When Worlds Collide (1952). Trailer here. A faithful telling of the book.
My favorite (for those who like big thinking): Gorath (1962). Trailer here. The object is too big to move. So they build giant fusion rockets in Antartica and move the Earth.
Meteor (1979). Trailer here. Starring Sean Connery and Natalie Wood, it was inspired by the MIT report “Project Icarus” (1967). The Soviet Union and the US stop the Cold War and work together to save the world. It has a tragic scene in which the World Trade Center is destroyed.
Armageddon 1998. Trailer here. Bruce Willis leads roughnecks into space to save the world. I enjoyed it!
Deep Impact (1998). Trailer here.  More scientifically accurate, but still a gripping story.

What can we do to prepare?
“Find all asteroid threats to human populations and know what to do about them.”
— NASA’s Grand Challenge, 18 June 2013.
The Apollo program burned billions of dollars) but did little for America. Since then, the manned space program has done even less. The reason is simple: we lacked a good reason to put people in space. An asteroid or comet will eventually provide the motivation – either to prevent another impact or mitigate its effects. We have the technology and money to begin preparations.
Here are the four kinds of space threats, with warning times ranging from decades to days. Buying warning time is the key to preventing impacts or minimizing their damage, but it will take time to build the necessary sensor systems. As a first step, in 2016 NASA created the Planetary Defense Coordination Office. Its staff supervises NASA’s programs to detect and track potentially hazardous objects, issues notices of close passes and warnings of any detected potential impacts, and coordinates the US government’s efforts to prepare for impact threats. See their website, which has a wealth of information.
Other nations have similar programs. NASA is a member of the International Asteroid Warning Network.
What happens after we detect an object on a collision course with Earth? A presentation by NASA’s Dan Mazanek describes deflection strategies. This NASA video shows what a mission to intercept a threatening space object might look like.
The longer the warning time and the better the preparations, the higher the odds of success. Here are some ways to defend Earth: a Gravity Tractor, a Kinectic Impactor, and a Blast Deflection. This graphic shows which works best for various combinations of warning time and asteroid size. For short warning times, we can use only what we have ready to launch.

A last note about these threats
“Estimates of the frequency of space-rock strikes are just estimates, and may not tell us anything about when the next impact will occur – it could be an eon, it could be tomorrow. Floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis are sure to happen more frequently, but humanity will survive these events; we might not survive an impact from space. Meanwhile, nothing can be done to prevent earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis. But space strikes appear to be entirely avoidable, and not necessarily with “massive repositioning of government funding.” A fraction of the money NASA wants to waste on a moon base would likely be sufficient.”
— By Gregg Easterbrook in The Atlantic, September 2008.

The solar system is not in equilibrium. To learn why I recommend the brief and clearly written Newton’s Clock: Chaos in the Solar System by Ivars Peterson. From the publisher …
“Peterson explains a mystery that has fascinated and tormented astronomers and mathematicians for centuries: are the orbits of planets and other bodies stable and predictable or are there elements affecting the dynamics of the solar system that defy calculation? It is one of the most perplexing, unsolved issues in astronomy, with each step toward its resolution-from Newton’s clocklike mathematical models to the astonishing work of super computers exposing additional uncertainties and deeper questions about the stability of the solar system.
“Newton’s Clock describes the development of celestial mechanics – from the star charts of ancient navigators to the great Renaissance scientists; from the crucial work of Poincare to the startling, sometimes controversial findings and theories made possible by modern mathematics and computer simulations. Equal parts science and history, the book shows how the exploration of the solar system has taken us from clocklike precision into chaos and complexity.”

"**Food labels displaying the amount of exercise needed to burn off calories have been found by**researchers at Loughborough University **to help people consume less - but campaigners warn they could affect those vulnerable to eating disorders.**
Hope Virgo has been in recovery from an eating disorder for over a decade, but she worries that the sight of exercise calorie labels on food packs could affect her mental health.
""Even though I am 11 years into my recovery I know that if I walked into a shop and saw that information I would find that incredibly triggering,"" she says.
""There isn't one thing that causes an eating disorder, but this idea adds to it and adds to the pressure. It will trigger people to feel certain things and in itself that is just as risky.""
Researchers used data across 14 studies to find labelling exercise calories could cut about 200 calories from a person's average intake.
The study revealed it takes about four hours to walk off the calories in a pizza, or 22 minutes to run off a chocolate bar.
Hope, now a mental health campaigner, says the problem with exercise targets for snacks and meals is that they create ""the mindset that you have to earn food"".
""I developed anorexia when I was 13 and though it wasn't triggered by exercise, a huge part of it was an obsession with exercise,"" she says.
""I ended up being admitted to a mental health hospital and throughout that I had to re-learn about my body and learn how to exercise in a healthy way.""
Hope adds that a lack of education about healthy lifestyles places unfair pressure on people.
Tom Quinn, from eating disorder charity Beat, also fears the concept could be unhelpful to those vulnerable to eating disorders.
""We know that many people with eating disorders struggle with excessive exercising, so being told exactly how much exercise it would take to burn off particular foods risks exacerbating their symptoms,"" he says.
""Policy makers looking to incorporate this change need to consider the impact that it may have on people's mental health.""
Tally Rye, a personal trainer and health influencer, believes the idea of explicitly linking exercise with calories on food packaging would ""promote feelings of shame and guilt around food"".
""I don't think it will lead to long-term positive changes to having a healthy lifestyle,"" she says.
""Regardless of whether we have a completely sedentary day, we still need calories.
""This is also quite ableist - it is cutting out those who may not find it easy to move. Are the elderly not allowed to eat if they can't do the vigorous exercise required?""
""A more positive way to look would be to think how food can fuel a workout,"" she adds.
Another person who has lived with an eating disorder, Rich, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Your Call programme on Wednesday that he found the idea of an exercise calorie label ""frightening"".
""I think anybody who has gone through an eating disorder, to then hear this kind of information... it is frightening,"" he said.
Rich recalled linking his calorie counts with exercise at the beginning of his eating disorder.
He added: ""Food is an absolute necessity and it should be enjoyed not something you are looking at and worrying about. I think it is a very dangerous game.""
But Prof Amanda Daley, who led the research at Loughborough, tells the BBC ""there is no evidence that physical activity campaigns lead to eating disorders"".
""We are not disregarding people with eating disorders, but this is about educating the broader public,"" she says.
""If you ask the public, they say that current food labelling is confusing. We have all different types of labels. Our view is that we need to put all the information in as clear a way as possible.
""When you say how much exercise is needed to burn off a muffin it is really clear.""

"BEIJING  —   A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012, local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device. For more than three decades, this was national policy in China. The IUD was the government’s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one. Ms. Lu, a former advertising executive, considered the demand invasive, insulting and potentially harmful to her health. Still, like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her, she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in. Now, a year after abandoning the “ ” policy, the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her  —   by removing their IUDs, free of charge. But the offer, made without even a hint of an apology, has provoked incredulous outrage. “We shouldn’t even have had this in the first place, and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people,” Ms. Lu, 36, scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the eastern city of Linyi. “It’s like they are slapping themselves in the face. ” While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor’s office, surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract, some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all. But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government’s getting involved, yet again, in their private lives. And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child. “It’s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,” said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades. In China, women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until menopause while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years, those used in China offer birth control for much longer. China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child, and sterilized after they had two, in the early 1980s. Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and health insurance. Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs. From 1980 to 2014, according to official statistics, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs. And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their “tubes tied. ” Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets, leading some to order that the procedures  —   as well as abortions  —   be performed by force on women who resisted. Then last year, confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force, President Xi Jinping relegated the   policy to the Communist Party’s scrap heap of discarded dogma. And without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake, the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with reproducing. To that end, an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child. “Our country provides support in terms of law, finance and service systems to ensure citizens’ access to the free removal of IUDs,” said the official, Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission’s department of women and children. But the   reversal, the paternalistic attitude, the failure to accept any culpability  —   for some, it was too much. Within hours of the news conference, the internet was fuming with indignation. The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to “involuntary, forced acts of mutilation,” Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a post shared nearly 3, 000 times on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “And now, to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women  —   repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit  —   they have no shame, second to none. ” Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the IUD, which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization. In the novel “Frog,” by Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of IUDs and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them. In mainland China, being fitted with an IUD is called “shang huan,” a phrase that literally means “installing a loop,” referring to the   stainless steel ring that was the state’s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of complications. The rings were replaced in the   by safer and more effective IUDs. According to gynecologists in China, IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely, with surgery necessary to take them out. Dr. Gloria Korta, a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts, who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001, said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years, it was small. Perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model, there remains widespread concern in China about the IUD’s impact on women’s health. In 2012, the online portal Tencent published a lengthy report arguing that many Chinese women had “experienced serious damage to their mental and physical health” from the IUD campaign because of “rough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions. ” Ai Xiaoming, 63, a prominent documentary filmmaker, said many women, herself included, had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD. She had to have a hysterectomy when surgery to remove her IUD was botched. “In the eyes of the government, women are labor units,” Ms. Ai said. “When the country needs you to give birth, you have to do so. And when they don’t need you to give birth, you don’t. ” Even before the end of the   policy, the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications. Others, including Ms. Zhang’s mother, did it without permission, paying sympathetic doctors to remove them. But Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the   policy, said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale. “They were anticipating the numbers, how many operations need to be done, as if this is another government program,” he said. The government’s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation’s plummeting birthrate, now one of the lowest in the world. According to 2015 data, Chinese women had 1. 05 children on average, well below the population replacement rate of more than 2. 1. With fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in China, scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis. But many couples are not interested in having a second child, some because of the potential costs, others because of their age. Cao Cuihua, 35, a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a    boy, said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children. “I did think about having a second child, but my economic circumstances don’t allow it,” she said. “This national policy to have two children has come a bit too late. ” Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of   who studies China’s demographics, said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older. “Most people have already lost the ability to give birth,” Dr. Yi said by email. “The willingness to have children is already very low, so the Chinese government’s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail. It will have little effect on the birthrate. ” Mao Qun’an, a spokesman for China’s family planning commission, defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies. (Such procedures are more complicated, and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them.) Dr. Dalice Marriott, a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital, said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of “having it embedded in the uterine wall. ” “That makes it much more difficult to remove,” Dr. Marriott said, adding that the surgery could result in bleeding, infection and injury to the uterus. Asked about the public outcry over the government’s offer to remove IUDs, Mr. Mao replied, “We did not deliberately emphasize that it’s a government benefit. ” Li Yinhe, a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family, defended the government’s approach, arguing that population control measures were “not targeted against women’s rights. ” “If the state doesn’t engage in this, then it’s not only a disadvantage for men, it also hurts the interests of women,” she said. “Women giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society. ” But many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong. “What they’ve done to women is inhumane,” said Xu Dali, 35, a mother of two sons in Linyi. “Why did the government force every women then to have an IUD? At that time, why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman?”"

Global warming has many good and bad effects, but one that is becoming especially clear is that it makes us all weenies when it comes to colder weather.



You might have noticed that this winter is cold. OK. But it’s not nearly as nasty as, say, the late 1970s, which brought the three coldest consecutive U.S. winters in the entire record (which started in 1895). The last winter of any consequence was 2000-01, but that was only the 26th coldest. Where this one will wind up no one can say, but I would be surprised if it even gets to the bottom 20. 



Blame global warming 



So why all the bellyaching? Well, it turns out you can blame your current discomfort on global warming. Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, warm up winters more than summers. In other words, since the second warming of the 20th century began more than 30 years ago, it’s the coldest days of the winter that have warmed up more than any others — and our bodies adapted. So when a truly cold winter shows up, people are physiologically and psychologically shocked.



The coldest temperatures in the Lower 48 are caused by big high pressure systems that form in northwestern North America or (rarely) Siberia. They are blown southward by unusual waves in the jet stream that should become less common in a warmer world. As these are the systems most susceptible to greenhouse warming, extreme cold “outbreaks,” like the two we have seen this January, should become more moderate and less frequent. 



There are real consequences when certain extreme types of weather become rarer, or when they visit places where they are very uncommon: Besides making people uncomfortable, they tend to kill. But as luck would have it, this effect has been studied more for heat waves than it has for cold.



The U.N.‘s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which purports to be the prime authority on all things climatic, has maintained for years that global warming’s more frequent heat waves will kill increasing numbers of city dwellers. If so, we should be seeing more headlines of heat‐​related deaths in urban areas. Indeed, cities laden with brick and concrete warm up on their own, global warming or not.



In reality, as heat waves become more frequent, fewer people die in them because they adapt. There’s hardly any heat‐​related mortality in Tampa or Phoenix (despite large populations of retirees) because heat waves are common. The only large U.S. city that shows a recent spike in heat‐​related mortality is Seattle, because heat is rare there. 



What about cold spells? 



But virtually nowhere is the U.N. on record that the same phenomenon holds true for cold. The great cold wave of Christmas 1983 killed dozens in South Carolina, where cold is rare, but hardly anyone in Chicago, where everyone expects minus‐​20 wind chills. This winter in northern India, more than 300 deaths have been attributed to “intense cold” — even though the lowest recorded temperature in the state having the most deaths was 39 degrees. 



All this underscores the reality that “heat” and “cold,” while having real and sometimes dire consequences, are largely a matter of perception. For those of us fortunate enough to have access to adequate clothing and shelter, this winter merely holds the lesson that sometimes, we need to stop complaining about the weather and just deal with it.

"**Six months after ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid announced an end to austerity, many families still rely on food banks to survive. The BBC's Chris Vallance has been spending time at a food bank in Oxford, hearing the stories of those who come seeking help.**
She sits in a red plastic chair, at a table covered in a blue and white cloth and she cries. There are freshly cut daffodils in the window, fresh groceries in rows beside her and she is distraught. For 20 minutes, a volunteer at the Community Emergency Foodbank in Oxford listens to her story, takes some of the weight of it from her shoulders, and brings heavy sacks of groceries to carry home to her family.
In the food bank's little kitchen I speak to Mary, the volunteer who helped her. ""It's a different story from every person but it's a similar sort of thing,"" she says. ""Parents struggling to feed their families, teenagers that are always hungry, looking for food that isn't there. Sometimes you hear stories that they've been living on bread for a few days. They say, 'I feel a failure, a failure that I can't feed my children.'""
Every Tuesday and Friday between noon and 2pm the food bank sign is wheeled out, outside St Francis church in east Oxford, and people who cannot afford food walk in.
Sometimes they wait by the door, at other times they walk back and forth while they summon up the courage to enter. They are entitled to three visits a year but the food bank rarely turns people away. Sometimes it's the job centre or social services that gives them the necessary little blue referral form. Sometimes they are referred by a doctor who can tell they are not eating.
I have been visiting the food bank since mid-January, on and off, listening to people's stories.
In that time I've spoken to a nurse, a student librarian, former academic researchers, someone who gets ambulances ready to answer calls, a nursery teacher, a former primary school teacher, a funeral director, carers, a charity worker, someone on a zero-hours contract, a former chef, a painter and decorator, the recently destitute, the recently separated, the mentally ill, the physically ill and the homeless.
""If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone,"" said an unemployed woman who had an MA, an unfinished PhD in a technical field and a family to feed.
Listen to Chris Vallance's reports from the Oxford food bank this week Listen to Chris Vallance's reports from the Oxford food bank this week on PM, on BBC Radio 4
Work begins before visitors cross the threshold. The hall is set up - folding tables are put out, red stacking chairs put around them, fresh fruit and veg arranged and sometimes cut flowers.
On the tables there are recipes (mostly of things to make with tins and packets) lists of other places to get help, and a little cardboard box with a rectangular hole in the top for suggestions. When I first arrived I saw a young woman carefully writing a note, hunched over the table as though she were doing homework. It read: ""I am a single parent who is struggling with debt. Thank you so much.""
The more time I have spent here, the more conscious I have become of the food I eat myself.
It has been humbling and frightening.
Life seems precarious - so many people inhabiting the narrow space between high rents and modest earnings.
The saying that we are all two pay cheques away from disaster rattles around my head.
The food bank was set up by Jane Benyon, 11 years ago. A former social worker, whose husband was once the Conservative MP for nearby Abingdon, Jane could tell from her work that there was hidden hunger in Oxford.
People are visiting the food bank in increasing numbers. Last year it helped 3,205 adults and children, up from 2,626 in 2018. It was in 2018 that Universal Credit was rolled out to single people in Oxfordshire, and research by Oxford University student Rosie Sourbut found that 39% of those visiting a food bank in the city in 2018/2019 cited delays with Universal Credit as one of the reasons.
""The concept was a good one but it's had some huge teething problems,"" Jane Benyon tells me. ""And whether those will ever be resolved I'm not sure.""
Paul Clarke a Baptist minister who is in charge of another branch of the Community Emergency Foodbank, a mile to the north of St Francis in the Oxford suburb of Barton, runs through a sheaf of blue referral forms. Even now, he says, most mention problems with Universal Credit. ""It does feel to me we are relying on charitable organisations to sort these things out,"" he says.
The Oxford served by this branch of the food bank is not the one you see in tourist brochures. It is among the top tier of most deprived areas in England, according to the City Council.
""These estates they're massive, they're dotted around and they are a lot poorer than what you see in the centre,"" says Sharon. Drug dealers thrown off other estates sometimes end up in Barton, she says.
It's here that I meet Rachel, a mother of four, a grandmother, a former alcoholic and drug user who has turned her life around, gaining qualifications and studying for a while at university. Volunteers bring her bags of groceries and toiletries.
Rachel has lived in Barton for 18 years. She is softly spoken, but this cannot mask her anger.
She tells me some local women are so desperate they have to steal when they have their period. ""Nicking sanitary towels, how embarrassing that people have to stoop that low,"" she says.
She tells me she usually doesn't eat breakfast. Her priority is feeding her children, two of whom are still under 18.
When I ask if Christmas was difficult, the pain of not having enough money to be able to give her kids what she would like to rises to the surface, and we have to pause the interview.
She says a lot of people on the estate are still embarrassed to use the food bank but others accept have become accustomed to it.
""We're supposed to be one of the richest countries in the world but we've got to use food banks. We're talking about food banks at the school gates like it's normal!""
The last time I visit the food bank, large parts of Italy are in lockdown because of coronavirus. When I enter I am told to cover my hands in sanitiser. Volunteers and everyone who visits get the same treatment.
The latest I hear from Jane Benyon is that the food bank is continuing to open and donations are holding up. The volunteers, many over 70, are bravely continuing to help all who visit. She worries that the food bank may face problems when, as seems likely, the elderly have to self-isolate.
Food banks are also expecting a big increase in demand if schools close, and children are no longer given free school meals.
At a small branch of the food bank in Littlemore, south Oxford, I meet a young freelance video editor, who asks to be called William. He's a big, gentle man, who speaks slowly and deliberately.
Like most freelancers, William's hours are variable. But if he's only paid the minimum he's entitled to under his contract, this barely covers the rent on a single room. He's passionate about his job and the career it promises, but it's feast or famine. In October he ran out of cash and didn't eat for four days.
""I've never not eaten before, and it was terrible. After the first day you think this isn't so bad, and then you start to feel sick, like empty-inside sick. And then it just gets worse and worse, and you just feel so hollow inside.""
He vowed he would never not eat again. So the next time he had a bad month he went to a job centre, where he started a benefits claim, and they in turn referred him to the food bank. Initially he felt ashamed, but knew he had no choice.
He says his parents would help but he doesn't want to ask. ""I fought to get to where I am, I had to build contacts over the past few years just to get where I am now. I left on my own and that's something I'm proud of.""
He tells me he is the first in his family to go to university.
A few weeks later, as we chat in a cafÃ©, he tells me he has Asperger's Syndrome. It sounds like school was a significant struggle.
We go to his flat. His room is a small box, the bathroom and kitchen are shared. There's mould on the window frame and the floor is filthy, as there's no vacuum cleaner and William can't afford to buy one. It does get a bit lonely in the little room when the weather's bad, he tells me.
I understand William's commitment to his career and his independence, and I'm glad things are looking up for him. I'm glad he's found out he's entitled to benefits that should help cover the lean months. What has he learned from his experience, I ask later, over the phone. Don't be embarrassed - he says - go to a food bank if you need to.
The words ""anxiety"" and ""depression"" come up time and again when I speak to food bank visitors. Volunteers tell me how prevalent mental illness is among the users and emphasise the effect poverty can have on mental health. One, who also volunteers for a mental health charity, says she thinks it may affect children too. ""Some of them are obviously aware that their mothers or fathers are distressed asking for food, and sometimes the child tries to protect the parent,"" she tells me.
It's impossible to guess who will walk through the door next. A man enters wearing a dark suit, though I don't at first notice just how dark it is. ""I'm a funeral director, I'm the gentleman who wears the hat and tails, I'm the gentleman who walks in front of the hearse"" he says.
Steve, as we'll call him, is the sole wage earner in his family. His wife is unwell and he has four children, two of whom live at home. He used to be in the armed services.
For some time, the difference between his monthly wages and the rent hasn't been enough to cover the remaining bills, even with a little bit of help from the benefits system, he tells me. His wife sometimes skips breakfast to help feed the children, he says.
He had always assumed that food banks were ""literally for homeless people"".
We talk for a while, but as we part he says there's one more thing - the family is likely to be evicted.
The landlord has given them notice because of rent arrears, and with nowhere else to go he has no choice but to wait for the bailiffs. The City Council is helping them find a home but it will be difficult to get somewhere they can afford. He worries it will be outside Oxford.
High rents are one of the reasons Oxford is regularly listed as one of Britain's least affordable cities.
""The pressure I'm under of course I'm going to crack at some point,"" he tells me. ""But every day I get up and I've got to keep going.""

_Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
A new paper shows that climate models are getting worse at replicating a collection of known climate changes as incentivized efforts to improve them have them universally veering off course.   
  
Anyone who is familiar with John Allison’s book _The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure_ knows that incentives can drive otherwise “independent” decisions in a common direction, with sometimes disastrous results. Allison documents how a collection of government incentives (intentionally and unintentionally) drove decisions in the wider financial markets towards overinvesting in residential real estate. The resulting massive misallocation of funds and ultimate bubble burst sent us into the Great Recession, from which we have yet to recover.   
  
Obviously, that was not the intended outcome of the federal policies, but as Allison writes “Intentions that are called ‘good’ often do not produce favorable outcomes.” Allison argues that a free market, one that is free from centralized incentives, and one in which truly independent decisions are being made, is less susceptible to a universal failure and that when failures do occur, they are not as severe and they are more quickly recovered from. Had the financial markets been operating without federal regulations and incentives, not only would the Great Recession not have occurred (or would have been minor), but that our country would be in a much healthier financial state with an overall higher standard of living for everyone.   
  
Not only can (and do) targeted incentives lead financial markets astray, they also operate the same way in the field of science.   
  
In either case, the ultimate effect is to steer the outcome away from its most efficient pathway and instead send it veering towards dangerous territory that is marked by a decline in our overall well-being.   
  
This is nowhere more evident than in the field of climate science, as a new paper by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Kyle Swanson clearly illuminates.   
  
In his work “Emerging selection bias in large climate change simulations,” Swanson finds that the new generation of climate models has become _worse_ at matching recent climate change than the generation of models which they supplant.   




According to Swanson:   




[T]he current generation (CMIP5) model ensemble mean performs worse at capturing the observed latitudinal structure of warming than the earlier generation (CMIP3) model ensemble. This is despite a marked reduction in the inter-ensemble spread going from CMIP3 to CMIP5, which by itself indicates higher confidence in the consensus solution. In other words, CMIP5 simulations viewed in aggregate appear to provide a more precise, but less accurate picture of actual climate warming compared to CMIP3.



The climate model collective is becoming more precise, but more precisely wrong.   
  
Swanson suggests that the reason for the deteriorating overall performance of a collection of somewhat “independent” models is that the model developers are focusing too intently on trying to improve a single aspect of climate model performance, that being a better replication of the observed climate changes which have been taking place in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. Previous versions of climate models generally tend to underestimate the magnitude of the loss of Arctic sea ice in recent decades and the resulting feedbacks to other aspects of the regional climate.   
  
There is increasing incentive for model developers to get this aspect of climate change right.   
  
It comes from the high profile attention (from climate activists and the media) that is heaped upon observed changes in the Arctic. Just think of all the stories that you have heard about the loss of Arctic sea ice, and the threat to polar bears, seals, native peoples, etc. When it comes to a poster child for global warming, there is little better than some furry dewy-eyed arctic creature precariously perched upon the last bit of ice in an otherwise ice-free Arctic ocean. If climate models are under-predicting the extent of climate changes there, their potential as a tool to force climate change mitigation efforts (e.g., a carbon tax) is being under-realized. The sooner this situation is rectified, the sooner we can get on with saving mankind from itself. Or so it goes.   
  
But does doing a better job in the Arctic lead to more valuable models?   
  
Swanson isn’t so sure:   




While the observed Arctic warming is spectacular and important, it is unclear why it is more important from the perspective of the evolution of the overall climate system than the relatively modest warming in the tropics and southern hemisphere. It is unclear whether the CMIP5 simulations are even getting the reason for the actual Arctic warming correct, as they are inconsistent with the strong Arctic warming but only modest warming in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and tropics that best describes the recent evolution of the actual climate system.



So what we are left with is a giant mess. Newer models overall perform worse than older models, and in the specific region where the new models are designed to replicate the observed climate the best—the Arctic—it isn’t even clear that they are getting things right for the right reason.   
  
This situation is not much different than the situation leading up to the Great Recession.   
  
In that case, government incentives reduced the independence of decision-making in financial markets. With climate models, environmental incentives have reduced the independent decision-making in model development.   
  
Swanson describes the situation like this:   




[T]he proverbial ‘marketplace of ideas’ about how climate change has and will continue to occur has shrunk. Instead of 38 unique models, each responding differently to increased anthropogenic forcing, in the CMIP5 project climate simulation is evolving towards a state where there are 38 ‘unique’ models that all respond the same.



Incentives have driven a misallocation of resources towards producing an outcome which is getting ever further from the optimal one. Consequences may follow which lead to a decrease in human well-being (for example, restricting the development of inexpensive and reliable sources of energy).   
  
Swanson provides some suggestions as to how to get climate models back on the right course:   




Whether through re-examination of the radiative forcings that underlie climate change, the dynamical variability of the models, the sensitivity of the models to imposed radiative forcings or the heat uptake of model oceans, a healthy dose of diversity must somehow be reintroduced into climate simulation enterprise. [references removed]



Allison also recognizes the need to have more diversity in financial decision-making to avoid looming future disasters from deficits in social security and Medicare, annual operating deficits and unfunded government pension liabilities. In his book, he lays out the steps that must be taken to get things going again in the proper direction.   
  
Righting the ship will not be easy. Allison sums up the situation why, which in form, applies equally well to financial markets as well as climate (and all) science:   




People cannot think unless they are free to think. Government rules and regulations literally prevent thought and prevent experimentation. A free market is a massive experiment in competing ideas, the most productive of which win out. Most of the experiments fail, but even failed experiments lead to a better understanding. When intellectual elitists stop the experiments because they are smarter than the rest of us and know what is in the “public good’ the learning stops—witness the Soviet Union. By now, the elitists should know better. Often the use public good as an excuse for their own lust for power. Those of us who have had to face government bureaucrats often see the lust for power as the true motivation and the “public good” as the bureaucrat’s rationalization.

"**New York's proposed foie gras ban has been met with fury by the food industry, with one wholesaler claiming it could backfire.**
Ariane Daguin from food manufacturer D'Artagnan said chefs were likely to order more ""because they are so mad"".
On Wednesday the city council voted to ban sales of the controversial product, a move hailed by animal rights groups.
Foie gras is made from the livers of ducks and geese that have traditionally been force-fed corn.
The law, which would be introduced in 2022, now needs to be signed into effect by Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Ms Daguin from D'Artagnan told the BBC she thought it was a ""very bad"" decision.
""There are 1,000 restaurateurs in New York City who have foie gras on their menu right now. They are all very incensed,"" she said.
Izzy Yanay, co-founder and general manager of Hudson Valley Foie Gras, one of New York's state major foie gras producers, meanwhile told AFP the industry would fight back.
""We're going to kick their ass in court.""
Council members approved the ban by 42 votes to six.
Jeremy Unger, spokesman for council member Carlina Riviera, who introduced the bill, said: ""The council is banning a really cruel and inhumane practice.""
Those found in violation of the law will be fined between $500 (Â£386) and $2,000.
Matthew Dominguez from campaign group Voters for Animal Rights said Wednesday's vote marked a ""historic day for New York City"".
While foie gras can be produced by natural feeding, in France it must be made by a process known as gavage in which ducks and geese are force-fed corn through a tube. The force-feeding occurs for about two weeks after the animals reach maturity. The practice is banned in some countries.
However Ms Daguin said the farms she uses feed the ducks ""without stress and without harm"".
""These farmers respect the animals get good results because they do not stress the animals out. I have visited them several times and I know and am convinced in my heart that we are not harming those ducks,"" she said.
""This law is unfair, unjust and we think illegal.""
She said that council members had been invited to tour the farms ahead of the vote but says not one member visited.
New York isn't the first city to ban the product. California issued a ban on foie gras in 2012.
Chicago issued a ban in 2006 which was reversed two years later after then-mayor Richard Daley called it the ""silliest ordinance"" ever passed in the city."

The fair dinkum Aussie voters did not buy into the hype of the climate emergency as Shorten snatched defeat from the jaws of certain victory by promising to save the planet. Quote.



Against all the polls, the money, advertising, and the non-stop media coverage, against all expectations and the betting agencies — the Extreme Climate Fix was a flop. **The Labor Plan to cut Australian emissions by 45% percent is now gone** — per capita this would have been **a world record sacrifice** in a country already increasing their renewable energy faster than any other.



Major betting agency Sportsbet were so **sure Labor would win they paid out $1.3 million on bets two days early.** Someone cleaned up with a $128,000 win for a party that lost. 



They called this a climate election and the people voted “No”  
Activists thought it was safe to piggy back on a “sure thing”, and they went in hard. Volunteers even wore bright orange “I’m a climate voter” T-shirts.



If Labor had won, they would be crowing right now about how it proved the people wanted action.



 **Labor was tipped to win decisively in every poll.** Even in the exit polls. So thousands of people told pollsters one thing, then they voted the other way, and hid that again on the way out the polling door.



This was not just the abject failure of climate change as a vote winner, it was also a **crashing fail for the pollsters**. Australians have been badgered and bullied into saying they believe in climate change and prefer the left-leaning parties. (They knew it was uncool to vote “right”.) **But when the time came, they voted against them both.**



Bullying works in public, but people vote alone.



To understand just how far they got it wrong, read Aaron Patrick yesterday:



The latest Ipsos poll predicted Labor would win 78 lower house seats on Saturday… Betting on seven commercial marketspredicted Labor would win 83… the chances of 12 polls getting it wrong is 0.024 per cent.



Even though recent opinion polls have put the two sides within the margin of error, 44 polls since Scott Morrison became prime minister have pointed in the same direction: a narrowing contest, but one which Labor has exclusively led.



A Coalition win would represent one of the great upsets of modern Australian polling…”It’s virtually impossible for them to win,” says Andy Marks, a political scientist at Western Sydney University.



So much for academics. […] End quote.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Jonah Engel Bromwich for today’s introduction. A California law that went into effect on Sunday barring drivers from holding phones while operating vehicles is among the most stringent in the nation. But experts say that it most likely won’t be enough to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving. Jennifer Ryan, AAA’s director of state relations, cautioned in a phone interview on Thursday that, “hands free is not risk free. ” Ms. Ryan said the California measure matched a larger trend of states bringing legislation    with contemporary phones. But while the state’s provisions were particularly broad, she said, it was important for motorists to take responsibility for themselves and pay attention. The law goes beyond what federal authorities recommend to prevent distracted driving, which remains a significant cause of traffic fatalities. The latest statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that more than 3, 400 people died in 2015 in crashes that involved a distracted driver. Of those, 272 were teenagers. And while the use of smartphones is certainly part of the problem, many are unconvinced that keeping them out of drivers’ hands will be a panacea. Some have speculated that the California law may encourage enthusiasm for   cars. When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure into law in September, he approved of another bill that allowed for the first tests of autonomous driving vehicles on public roads. Steve Finnegan, the government affairs manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California, said that while the new legislation “is a step in the right direction,” it does not address “the complete issue of distracted driving. ” “One of the bigger issues is cognitive distraction,” Mr. Finnegan said. “It’s not what your hands are doing it’s what your brain is doing. ” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have metered paywalls.) • Senator Dianne Feinstein will be at the center of the debate over   Donald J.

So it was, many summers ago, that Otis Redding stayed on a houseboat there and came up with the first idea for an American classic. It was this weekend in 1968 that Mr. Redding’s “(Sittin’ on) the Dock of the Bay” was released. In August 1967, the   soul singer had come to San Francisco to do a series of gigs at Basin Street West, a storied club at the time. According to Jonathan Gould, the author of a forthcoming biography of Mr. Redding, the rock promoter Bill Graham offered Mr. Redding the use of his houseboat up in Sausalito. While relaxing there with his guitar, he is thought to have sketched the lines: Later, the guitarist Steve Cropper helped to fill out the rest of the song and it was recorded in November. But Mr. Redding never heard the single. Just 18 days after the studio session, he died in a plane crash in Madison, Wis. on Dec. 10, 1967. He was 26. On Jan. 8, 1968, the “Dock of the Bay” album was released. The single rose to No. 1 on Billboard’s pop chart and stayed there for four weeks. It was the biggest hit of Mr. Redding’s career.

"The Kyoto Protocol was dreamed up by the Climate Jet-set in Kyoto, Japan in 1997.
One of the first decisions of born-again-green PM, Kevin Rudd, was to commit Australia to Kyoto Phase 1 in 2007. This treaty required signatories to reduce production of carbon dioxide to 5% below 1990 levels by 2012.
As a late joiner, Australia got a lower target, involving no actual cuts. And they achieved that easy target by robbing Australian landowners – they stole carbon credits from landowners by imposing tree clearing bans. That larcenous trick can’t be pulled twice.
Ironically, the death notice for the Kyoto misadventure was posted by Japan, the birthplace of Kyoto, when they announced at Cancun in 2010 that Japan would not agree to any further targets. Japan was shocked at the billions in liabilities they had accumulated by not meeting Kyoto 1 target cuts.
Undeterred by this warning, another ALP/Green government agreed to Kyoto 2 in 2012 – 5% below 2000 levels by 2020.
This target, agreed to without due diligence, is dreamland stuff for Australia. Once the growing population is taken into account, this target would require Australians in 2020 to maintain industries and create new jobs using 30% less hydro-carbon energy per capita than was used in 2000.
Mining and mineral processing, agriculture, manufacturing, transport, tourism, electricity generation, cement, forestry and fishing are the backbone industries of Australia.
Not one of these industries could maintain production while also significantly reducing their production of carbon dioxide, unless Australia embarks on a crash program of building new hydro and/or nuclear power stations. The chance that green regulators or politicians will allow either of these options any time soon is zero.
The use of carbon fuels, more than any other indicator, measures the growth and health of modern economies. The only way to kill carbon is to kill the economy – close industries or send them overseas. The Global Financial Crisis probably did more to reduce the use of hydro-carbon fuels than Kyoto will ever do.
Japan’s exit from Kyoto obligations was soon followed by Canada and Russia. USA never signed, nor did China, India, South Africa or Brazil.
Thus the four biggest economies in our region (USA, China, Japan and India) are not burdened by Kyoto. Nor are our big competitors – Brazil (iron and beef), Indonesia (coal), Chile (copper) and Canada (wheat). We only have the Kiwis and the faraway Europeans sharing the sinking Kyoto ship.
The Kyoto Agreement is a failure. Australia repealed the costly carbon dioxide tax. Next we should get rid of Kyoto liabilities.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Carbon dioxide emissions in the United States from the production and consumption of energy have been on the decline since about 2005, after generally being on the rise ever since our country was first founded.   
  
The decline in emissions between 2012 and 2011 was 3.8 percent, which, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) was the largest decline in a non-recession year since 1990 and the first time that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell while the per capita economic output increased by more than 2 percent. In other words, we are producingmore while emitting less carbon dioxide.   
  
  






The big player in 2012 was the continued switch from coal to natural gas for electrical generation. It is generally accepted that gas-fired generation results in about half as much carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt-hour as coal-fired.   
  
While some would glibly say this is a result of increased regulation of greenhouse gases, it’s much more just good-old economics and the profit motive that are responsible. Hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, and inherently less expensive physical plants mean it is cheaper to produce electrical power from gas than from coal. In fact, as the figure below shows, there’s been pretty much a one-for-one switch between the two sources, with coal-fired down by 215 billion kilowatt-hours (kwh) and gas up by 212.   
  
Despite the fact that “renewable” electricity generation declined in 2012, carbon dioxide emissions per kwh still went down, by 3.5 percent, thanks to the overwhelming effect of natural gas substitution.   






In 2012, the CO2 reductions from the combination of a more energy-efficient economy and a lower carbon-intensity energy supply were larger than the combined increase in gross domestic output and growth in population.   
  
One signature of greenhouse-effect driven climate change is that winters (and especially the lowest temperatures of winter) should warm preferentially to summers. According to the EIA, “much more energy is needed for space heating than for air conditioning” and the very warm winter of 2012 saved much more energy than was cost by the warmer-than-average summer.   
  
The combination of fuel switching, weather, and some incremental increase in vehicular fuel efficiency produced the largest drop in carbon intensity since 1949, the year the EIA data compilation begins. “Carbon intensity” is the emission of carbon dioxide associated with the production of a constant dollar of gross domestic product.   
  
And while all of this should make President Obama happy as the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions decline is ahead of the pace needed to meet his goal of reducing emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, little of this is actually from his doing.   
  
This means that the majority of it is being achieved without governmental interference. The fact is that capital is required for investment in technologies that produce things more efficiently (like new gas-fired power plants) or produce more efficient things (such as stingier gasoline engines and [maybe] hybrid cars, though life-cycle analyses of them are somewhat conflicting).   
  
Which should make you wonder, why is the government intervening at all? We wonder the same thing.


"
"

If you were to believe the media and green alarmists (which are the same thing, really), you would be convinced that not only is an existential climate apocalypse looming, but that there is a worldwide mass movement demanding urgent and drastic action.



 **Quite simply, neither is the least bit true.**



This month was supposed to be the one in which a global push for higher ambition on climate change took flight […] despite this, momentum behind real action by government has been steadily drained away.



Politicians might lend lip-service to the shouty green zealots, but they know what voters really think. Climate change alarmism is electoral poison. Just ask Australian Labor.



Few world leaders are lining up to deliver what UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had in mind when he called them together for a New York conference to boost ambition. The New York meeting, scheduled for September 23, was conceived as a show of global defiance at US President Donald Trump’s decision to ditch the Paris Agreement.



Rather than a competition for more robust action, as was intended, the New York agenda looks deflated.



Key world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, will not be attending.



This is perhaps the most devastating embarrassment for the climate change church since “Climategate” in 2009. Word to the wise: **if even a massive, taxpayer-funded beano in New York can’t rustle up the usual troughers, your cause is screwed**.



Even the green virtue-signallers of Europe are arking up, as the cost of their climate grandstanding comes home to bite them in the hip pocket.



A pushback is building in Germany against higher energy prices and the impact of strict new emissions regulations on a struggling car industry. Renewable energy investment across much of Europe has stalled.



The EU admits it is not on track to meet its 2030 target of a 40 per cent emissions cut on 1990 levels.



As the late Richard Feynman said, “It doesn’t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong”. So far, the theory of climate alarmism has drastically failed to measure up to the real world. It doesn’t take a scientist to notice that we’re not drowning, burning, or ice-free, as we’ve been continually warned was about to happen any day, for the last 40 years.



A 2013 paper in the journal Biogeosciences found the year-to-year variation in the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by natural processes is bigger than Australia’s total annual greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels.



Research published in the journal Nature in 2014 found that record-breaking rains had triggered so much new growth across Australia that the continent turned into a giant green carbon sink to rival tropical rainforests including the Amazon.



The study found that vegetation worldwide had soaked up 4.1 billion tonnes of carbon in 2011 — the equivalent of more than 40 per cent of emissions from burning fossil fuels that year […] A paper published in April found that global land and ocean sinks had largely kept pace with rising carbon dioxide emissions since 1958 and were still absorbing about 50 per cent of atmospheric CO2.



That’s not to say that there is no case against transitioning away from fossil fuels. Thanks to human ingenuity, that will almost certainly happen, regardless. What it does mean is that climate alarmism and its attendant demands to immediately dismantle industrial civilisation is not a “science-based” argument. For years, green catastrophists have raged against “deniers”.



 **In fact, as scientists are starting to admit, the real threat – especially to scientific standards – is from alarmists.**



World Meteorological Organisation secretary-general Petteri Taalas […] [says] while climate scepticism had become less of an issue, the challenge was now coming from “doomsters and extremists”.



“Climate experts have been attacked by these people and they claim that we should be much more radical,” Taalas said.



He said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports had been “read in a similar way to the Bible: you try to find certain pieces or sections from which you try to justify your extreme views”.



“This resembles religious extremism.”

"**Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is to open more restaurants abroad, six months after he was forced to close most of his UK operations.**
Jamie Oliver Group has said international franchisees plan to open 21 new Jamie Oliver-branded restaurants by the end of 2020.
At least two of those restaurants will be under a new casual dining brand called Jamie Oliver Kitchen.
In May, the UK business fell into administration, with 1,000 jobs lost.
At the time, the celebrity chef said he was ""devastated [and] saddened"" by what had happened.
However, while the UK group - which included the Jamie's Italian chain, Barbecoa and Fifteen - collapsed, the international businesses stayed afloat.
It has 70 restaurants, all of which are run as franchises, in 27 markets worldwide.
Two new Jamie Oliver Kitchen restaurants are now due to open in Bali and Bangkok by the end of November and will be run by group franchise partner HPL.
The restaurants will open in repurposed Jamie's Italian premises.
Nineteen further restaurants will open abroad next year under various brands, including Jamie's Italian, Jamie Oliver's Pizzeria, Jamie's Deli and Jamie Oliver's Diner. The firm did not say where they would be based.
Following the administration in May, all but three of Jamie Oliver's 25 UK restaurants closed. The firm had been struggling with a UK-wide slowdown in the casual dining sector which also saw Byron and Prezzo announce closures.
In September, it emerged that Mr Oliver had paid himself a Â£5.2m dividend in 2018, but also poured millions of his own money into supporting his restaurants.
Profits at the Jamie Oliver Group - which includes the chef's media business as well as his restaurant interests - fell sharply that year.
Speaking about the new openings, Mr Oliver said: ""Over the past 20 years, I have travelled around the world to discover exciting flavour combinations, picking up incredible influences along the way.
""The new restaurants will bring those inspirations to life and serve some of my absolute all-time favourites."""

The Cato Institute’s Center for the Study of Science today kicks off its rapid response center that will identify and correct inappropriate and generally bizarre claims on behalf of climate alarm. I wish them luck in this worthy enterprise, but more will surely be needed to deal with this issue.   
  
To be sure, there is an important role for such a center. It is not to convince the ‘believers.’ Nor do I think that there is any longer a significant body of sincere and intelligent individuals who are simply trying to assess the evidence. As far as I can tell, the issue has largely polarized that relatively small portion of the population that has chosen to care about the issue. The remainder quite reasonably have chosen to remain outside the polarization. Thus the purpose of a rapid response Center will be to reassure those who realize that this is a fishy issue, that there remain scientists who are still concerned with the integrity of science. There is also a crucial role in informing those who wish to avoid the conflict as to what is at stake. While these are important functions, there are other issues that I feel a think tank ought to consider. Moreover, there is a danger that rapid response to trivial claims lends unwarranted seriousness to these claims.   
  
Climate alarm belongs to a class of issues characterized by a claim for which there is no evidence, that nonetheless appeals strongly to one or more interests or prejudices. Once the issue is adopted, evidence becomes irrelevant. Instead, the believer sees what he believes. Anything can serve as a supporting omen. Three very different previous examples come to mind (though there are many more examples that could be cited): Malthus’ theory of overpopulation, social Darwinism and the Dreyfus Affair. Although each of these issues engendered opposition, only the Dreyfus Affair led to widespread societal polarization. More commonly, only the ‘believers’ are sufficiently driven to form a movement. We will briefly review these examples (though each has been subject to book length analyses), but the issue of climate alarm is somewhat special in that it appeals to a sizeable number of interests, and has strong claims on the scientific community. It also has the potential to cause exceptional harm to an unprecedented number of people. This has led to persistent opposition amidst widespread lack of interest. However, all these issues are characterized by profound immorality pretending to virtue.   




Malthus’ peculiar theory wherein the claimed linear growth of food loses out to the exponential growth of population has maintained continuous popularity in the faculty lounge for about two centuries. It is, therefore, worth noting that Malthus had no evidence that food supply would increase only linearly. Nor did he have evidence for exponential population growth. Malthus initially went so far as to estimate an e-folding time for population of 25 years, based on the population of North America, and ignoring the role of immigration. Although Malthus, himself, eventually acknowledged these problems, the enthusiasm for his anti-human conclusions remains strong. Neither the green revolution nor the diminution of famine amidst increasing population dissuades them. The fact that Chad is poor and the Netherlands is rich never strikes the believer as odd. Apparently, the growth of cities, the movement of workers from the farm to the city, and, for much of the developed world, immigration, all served to convince people of means that there were too many other people around, and Malthusian theory formed a framework for something they were (and are) eager to believe.   
  
Social Darwinism and its corollary, eugenics, represents another case of a theory without support that was widely accepted with, at times, horrid consequences. Darwin’s “The Origin of the Species” had immense influence. It presented a theory whereby natural selection and what were essentially mutations could account for biological evolution. While it offered valuable insights into the development of finch beaks, it was hardly meant to describe societal evolution. Nevertheless, the notion of ‘survival of the fittest’ applied to society had obvious appeal to those who perceived themselves to be the fittest and who naturally regarded the application as scientifically justified. It was a small step to eugenics which was the counterpart of modern day environmentalism during the first third of the twentieth century, and was supported by all the ‘best’ people (including George Bernard Shaw, Margaret Sanger, Alexander Graham Bell, and Theodore Roosevelt) despite the fact that there actually was a mathematical theorem (the Hardy-Weinberg Theorem) that showed that the impact of eugenics on the gene pool would be negligible. Needless to add, mathematics is of no importance to the ‘best’ people. Malthusian population fears continue to the present, but eugenics was rendered unfashionable by the obvious implications presented by the Nazis.   
  
While science is a common vehicle for such misuse, the Dreyfus Affair shows that other vehicles exist. In 1894, Captain Alfred Dreyfus was accused of passing secret French military information to the Germans. There was, in fact, no evidence to support this accusation. Nevertheless, there was again a strong desire on the part of many people in France to believe the accusation. To be sure, there was the endemic anti-Semitism in France. However, there was also the humiliation of France’s loss in the Franco-Prussian War, and the desire to blame such loss not on the army, but on the perfidy of a group that some considered to be ‘outside’. (The Nazis’ ‘stab in the back’ theory for the German loss in WW1 represents a similar instinct). Dreyfus was tried (several times) and sentenced to Devil’s Island. Prominent Frenchmen (Emile Zola in particular) , incensed by the obvious injustice campaigned for Dreyfus, and the issue literally split France in half (partly because the conflict between Catholics and Secularists also entered the Affair). Dreyfus was eventually exonerated after the identification of the actual spy became undeniable.   
  
The current issue of global warming/climate change is extreme in terms of the number of special interests that opportunistically have strong interests in believing in the claims of catastrophe despite the lack of evidence. In no particular order, there are the leftist economists for whom global warming represents a market failure, there are the UN apparatchiks for whom global warming is the route to global governance, there are third world dictators who see guilt over global warming as providing a convenient claim on aid (ie, the transfer of wealth from the poor in rich countries to the wealthy in poor countries), there are the environmental activists who love any issue that has the capacity to frighten the gullible into making hefty contributions to their numerous NGOs, there are the crony capitalists who see the opportunity to cash in on the immense sums being made available for ‘sustainable’ energy, there are the government regulators for whom the control of a natural product of breathing is a dream come true, there are newly minted billionaires who find the issue of ‘saving the planet’ appropriately suitable to their grandiose pretensions, etc., etc. Strange as it may seem, even the fossil fuel industry is generally willing to go along. After all, they realize better than most, that there is no current replacement for fossil fuels. The closest possibilities, nuclear and hydro, are despised by the environmentalists. As long as fossil fuel companies have a level playing field, and can pass expenses to the consumers, they are satisfied. Given the nature of corporate overhead, the latter can even form a profit center. The situation within science itself is equally grim. Huge sums of government and private funding have become available to what was initially a small backwater field. Science becomes easy when emphasis is on malleable models supported by hugely uncertain data that can be readily found ‘consistent’ with the models supplemented by fervidly imagined catastrophic ‘implications.’ Indeed, uncertainty is often exaggerated for just this purpose. Opposition within the scientific community is immediately met with ad hominem attacks, loss of funding, and difficulty in publishing.   
  
Of course, science is not the only victim of this situation. Affordable energy has been the primary vehicle for the greatest advance in human welfare in human history. This issue promises to deny this to the over 1 billion humans who still lack electricity. For billions more energy will be much less affordable leading to increased poverty. Poverty, itself, is a major factor in reduced life expectancy. It requires a peculiarly ugly obtuseness to ignore the fundamental immorality of this issue.   
  
Although all these issues have strong political consequences, it is by no means clear that their origin is, itself, political. I would suggest that a more likely situation is that politics is always opportunistically seeking some cause that fits its needs. However, once an illusional issue becomes a passionate belief, it becomes impervious to argument. Given how dangerous some illusional positions are, it is an important problem to know how to avoid them. This is a problem that is truly worthy of Cato’s attention. Rapid response can only do so much; belief seems to inevitably trump objective reality when one is free to choose ones narrative.

Information



Humour ( not an actual product)



With some New Zealand councils recently declaring Climate Emergencies, the Blog team realised that it was time to put together a Climate Emergency Survival pack.



The first item included in our pack is a highly sophisticated rain, snow, flooding and sun gauge made from **100% organic materials** and based on the below design.



WH pointed out that with all the expected hot weather a delicious drink should also be included.



Our pack includes everything you need to whip up a **Bahama Mama** which is a delicious tropical cocktail. A fruity beverage, it blends 151 proof coconut rum, coffee liqueur, coconut liqueur, fresh lemon or orange juice and a generous amount of pineapple juice. Try it frozen for a cool treat.



For those prepared to spend a little more our pack includes ( in any colour you want as long as it’s yellow) this sporty wood-gas fueled car. How exactly it helps save the environment I am unsure but WH is keen to get it out of his garage and into a new owner’s hands so who am I to argue?



With all the temperatures rising it is going to be BBQ season all year around so our pack also includes the Whale Meat Company BAA BAA QUE meat box.



The [Baa Baa Que ](https://whalemeat.co.nz/products/baa-baa-que)contains:



The final item in our pack was recommended by exPFC who thinks that a Tazer pulse electric stun gun is just the ticket for keeping the roaming Vegan hordes away from your meat and your ice-cold **Bahama Mama**.



The entire pack ( apart from the car) will be delivered inside a thick plastic recycled plastic bag from Countdown. At no extra cost, we will also throw in a packet of turtle snorkels because someone needs to think of the turtles.

"About 25 years ago, a conversation between me and one of the greatest biologists of the 20th century took a weird turn. I was talking to William D. Hamilton, who was famous for coming up with the theory of “kin selection,” which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species, including ours. This and other seminal ideas had earned Hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern Darwinian understanding of social behavior. Richard Dawkins, in the preface to his landmark 1976 book,“The Selfish Gene,” paid tribute to Hamilton and the three other “dominant figures” in social biology whose ideas formed the book’s foundation. I was interviewing Hamilton at the University of Michigan, where he was on sabbatical from Oxford. A video camera was rolling. I had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology, and I was hoping to create a documentary on the subject. The documentary never materialized, and Hamilton died in early 2000. My interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year, when I tracked down the tape containing it. During the interview, I was trying to steer Hamilton toward philosophical topics, and at one point he went further than I had expected. He said, “I’m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature  —   that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is, coming from some other source. ” That’s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say, but the most unusual part was still to come. Hamilton continued, in his British accent, “I could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere, and so on, but I think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion. ” Well, maybe, but this sounded at least as interesting as the general topic of discussion. I asked him if he meant that there was some kind of “transcendental purpose” that we humans are generally oblivious to. He answered: “Yes, yes. There’s one theory of the universe that I rather like  —   I accept it in an almost joking spirit  —   and that is that Planet Earth in our solar system is a kind of zoo for extraterrestrial beings who dwell out there somewhere. And this is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans who go around doing things  —   and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn’t look quite right  —   this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that. ” So, he continued, these extraterrestrials “insert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize. ” He reiterated: “I put it forward in an almost joking spirit. But I think it’s a kind of hypothesis that’s very, very hard to dismiss. ” The headline almost writes itself: “  Scientist Says Miracles Can Happen!” The subhead would add: “Extraterrestrials may play a role. ” But that’s the headline you’d write if you were just trying to maximize clicks. If you wanted to capture the philosophical significance of what Hamilton was saying, you’d take another tack. Rather than focus on miracles, you’d focus on the idea of “higher purpose”  —   the idea that there’s some point to life on earth that emanates from something that is in some sense beyond it. And  —   in hopes of generating as many clicks as possible, notwithstanding the philosophical significance  —   you’d put this in listicle form, laying out several misconceptions that Hamilton had implicitly dispelled. You could call these the “Three Great Myths About Evolution and Purpose. ” Myth number one: To say that there’s in some sense a “higher purpose” means there are “spooky forces” at work. When I ask scientifically minded people if they think life on earth may have some larger purpose, they typically say no. If I ask them to explain their view, it often turns out that they think that answering yes would mean departing from a scientific worldview  —   embracing the possibility of supernatural beings or, at the very least, of immaterial factors that lie beyond scientific measurement. But Hamilton’s thought experiment shows that this isn’t necessarily so. You may consider aliens spooky, but they’re not a spooky force. And they’re not supernatural beings. They’re just physical beings, like us. Their technology is so advanced that their interventions might seem miraculous to us  —   as various smartphone apps would seem to my      —   but these interventions would in fact comply with the laws of science. More to the point: If you ask how Hamilton’s aliens had initially imparted “purpose” to life, the answer is that they did so in concrete fashion: by planting simple   material on earth a few billion years ago, confident that it would lead to something that would keep them entertained (keeping them entertained being, in this scenario, life’s purpose). Which leads to: Myth number two: To say that evolution has a purpose is to say that it is driven by something other than natural selection.  The correction of this misconception is in some ways just a corollary of the correction of the first misconception, but it’s worth spelling out: Evolution can have a purpose even if it is a wholly mechanical, material process  —   that is, even if its sole engine is natural selection. After all, clocks have purposes  —   to keep time, a purpose imparted by clockmakers  —   and they’re wholly mechanical. Of course, to suggest that evolution involves the unfolding of some purpose is to suggest that evolution has in some sense been heading somewhere  —   namely, toward the realization of its purpose. Which leads to: Myth number three: Evolution couldn’t have a purpose, because it doesn’t have a direction. The idea that evolution is fundamentally directionless is widespread, in part because one great popularizer of evolution, Stephen Jay Gould, worked hard to leave that impression. As I and others have argued, Gould was at best misleading on this point. And, anyway, even Gould admitted that, yes, on balance evolution tends to create beings of greater and greater complexity. A number of evolutionary biologists would go further and say that evolution was likely, given long enough, to create animals as intelligent as us. In fact, that idea is implicit in Hamilton’s saying the aliens could have “set up” evolution in such a way that “it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans. ” This part of Hamilton’s scenario requires no intervention on the part of the aliens, because he believed that evolution by natural selection has a kind of direction in the sense that it is likely, given long enough, to produce very intelligent forms of life. (When speaking more precisely, as he did in other parts of the interview, Hamilton would say that the human species per se wasn’t in the cards  —   that it wasn’t inevitable that the first intelligent species would look like us.) With these three myths dispelled, you’re left with this philosophically liberating upshot: You can entertain the possibility that evolution has a purpose, a kind of goal (a “telos,” as philosophers say) without departing from a strictly Darwinian view of evolution  —   without abandoning belief in natural selection as evolution’s only engine, and without surrendering your credentials as a modern, scientifically minded kind of person. In case you’re still feeling a little uneasy about becoming a purpose ponderer, I should emphasize that not all teleological scenarios that pass scientific muster involve space aliens. Indeed, some scientists have suggested that natural selection has a purpose that wasn’t instilled by any kind of intelligent being. This scenario emerges from one version of physicist Lee Smolin’s theory of “cosmological natural selection. ” Smolin thinks our universe may itself be a product of a kind of evolution: maybe universes can replicate themselves via black holes, so over time  —   over a lot of time  —   you get universes whose physical laws are more and more conducive to replication. (So that’s why our universe is so good at   making!) In some variants of Smolin’s theory  —   such as those developed by the late cosmologist Edward Harrison and the mathematician Louis Crane  —   intelligent beings can play a role in this replication once their technology reaches a point where they can produce black holes. So through cosmological natural selection you’d get universes whose physical properties were more and more conducive to the evolution of intelligent life. This might explain the   observation that the physical constants of this universe seem “ ” to permit the emergence of life. Crane, in a recent dialogue on my website meaningoflife. tv, told me that in this scenario “human life —  and I don’t mean on an individual scale, but as a whole —  has a purpose in the same sense that a chicken’s egg has a purpose. The purpose of a chicken’s egg is to create a chicken. ” Crane isn’t using language carelessly here. Some philosophers are comfortable talking about animals having a “purpose” imbued by natural selection (to spread their genes). So if biological evolution is a product of cosmological natural selection, it has a purpose in a defensible sense of that term —  and we’re part of that purpose. So add another item to our listicle: Myth number four: If evolution has a purpose, the purpose must have been imbued by an intelligent being.  That said, one interesting feature of current discourse is a growing openness among some scientifically minded people to the possibility that our world has a purpose that was imparted by an intelligent being. I’m referring to “simulation” scenarios, which hold that our seemingly tangible world is actually a kind of projection emanating from some sort of   powerful computer and the history of our universe, including evolution on this planet, is the unfolding of a computer algorithm whose author must be pretty bright. You may scoff, but in 2003 the philosopher Nick Bostrom of Oxford University published a paper laying out reasons to think that we are pretty likely to be living in a simulation. And the simulation hypothesis has gained influential supporters. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and America’s de facto astronomer laureate, finds it plausible. The visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says there’s almost no chance that we’re living in “base reality. ” The New Yorker reported earlier this year that “two tech billionaires”  —   it didn’t say whether Musk is one of them  —   “have gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. ” I’m guessing that will take awhile, and meanwhile I’d like to note an irony. When an argument for higher purpose is put this way  —   that is, when it doesn’t involve the phrase “higher purpose” and, further, is cast more as a technological scenario than a metaphysical one  —   it is considered intellectually respectable. I don’t mean there aren’t plenty of people who dismiss it. I’m talking about how people dismiss it. The Bostrom paper drew flack, but a lot of it was from people who thought the chances that we’re living in a simulation are way less than 50 percent, not from people who thought the idea was wholly crazy. If you walked up to the same people who gave Bostrom a respectful hearing and told them there is a transcendent God, many would dismiss the idea out of hand. Yet the simulation hypothesis is a God hypothesis: An intelligence of   power created our universe for reasons we can speculate about but can’t entirely fathom. And, assuming this intelligence still exists, it is in some sense outside of our reality  —   beyond the reach of our senses  —   and yet, presumably, it has the power to intervene in our world. Theology has entered “secular” discourse under another name. Personally, I’m fine with that. I think discussion of higher purpose should be respectable even in a scientific age. I don’t mean I buy the simulation scenario in particular, or the space alien scenario, or the cosmological natural selection scenario. But I do think there’s reason to suspect that there’s some point to this exercise we Earthlings are engaged in, some purpose imbued by something  —   and that, even if identifying that something is for now hopeless, there are grounds for speculating about what the point of the exercise is. I won’t elaborate much on this, since I’ve done that elsewhere, arguing that higher purpose can be framed as a hypothesis, and that evidence for or against the hypothesis can be marshaled. But I will say that the evidence I see for purpose includes not just the direction of biological evolution, but the direction of technological evolution and of the broader social and cultural evolution it drives  —   the evolution that has carried us from   bands to the brink of a cohesive global community. And if the purpose involves sustaining this direction  —   becoming a true global community  —   then it would seem to include moral progress. In particular, our purpose would involve transcending the psychology of tribalism that can otherwise divide people along ethnic, national, religious and ideological lines. Which would mean  —   in light of recent political and social developments in the United States and abroad  —   that our work is cut out for us."

A few days ago we looked at 19 stations scattered across Antarctica and found no unusual climate trends taking place there over the past 31 years.
Today we focus on 13 crucial stations located on and around the Antarctic Peninsula, which alarmists say is threatening to melt down and cause sea level rise to accelerate rapidly, and plot the data from NASA going back to 1998, i.e. 21 years.
13 of 13 Antarctic Peninsula/island stations cooling
The following map shows the location of the stations:

What now follows are the mean annual temperature plots of the 13 stations, using NASA Version 4 unadjusted data:

13 of 13 Antarctic Peninsula and nearby island stations show cooling over the past 21 years. There hasn’t been any warming there so far this century. Data source: NASA GISS, Version 4 unadjusted.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert LymanAs a frequent contributor to Friends of Science Society reports and blog posts and as a guest speaker at the 2017 annual event, I have usually presented my biography in simple terms, that I worked in the public service for 27 years and was a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.  However, people have requested more information about my experience and with what authority do I write on the energy and environmental policy issues.  I prepared this overview. In a nutshell, I have spent over forty years as an economist, manager and consultant working on a broad range of energy and environment public policy issues, mainly for the Canadian federal government. The following is a point form summary of my experience.  After graduation with an Honours degree in International Relations (Economics, Political Science and History), I joined the former federal Department of External Affairs. I served as a Canadian diplomat for ten years, with postings in Caracas, Venezuela and Washington, D.C.My assignment in Washington occurred during a period when both Canada and the U.S. were heavily regulating oil and natural gas markets and prices, and there were several outstanding issues to be resolved concerning cross-border oil and gas trade and pipelines, including whether the MacKenzie Valley Pipeline should be built. This gave me an opportunity to learn a great deal about energy and trade regulation and pricing issues.After leaving the foreign service, I worked as an economist in the Energy Policy Branch of the Energy, Mines and Resources department during the acrimonious negotiations over oil and gas policy before and after the publication of the National Energy Program.I worked for two years in Finance Canada analyzing and advising on energy expenditure issues related to the federal Budget.After that, I led a group of economists responsible for analysis of international oil prices and market conditions.For two years, I worked on Executive Interchange as the Ottawa representative of the Canadian Gas Association at the time of natural gas deregulation.In the late 1980s, I was the Senior Director of Energy Policy when climate change issues first arose; I was heavily engaged at that time in implementation of the Offshore Accords with Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and with the negotiation of the resource aspects of aboriginal land claims.I was the first federal co-chair of the Federal-Provincial Committee on Climate Change.I was the Senior Director of Oil Policy from 1995 to 2002 when the fiscal regime governing oil sands development was being expanded, and I worked closely with Finance Canada on the key issues. At that time, I led the first federal work assessing the public policy that should govern carbon dioxide capture and geological storage.I managed the group providing expert advice on the potential for emissions reduction in the oil industry during the Climate Change Table Process prior to the Kyoto Accord.I was the Director General, Environmental Affairs, in Transport Canada from 2002 to 2006, leading the analysis and policy development with respect to emissions reduction in the transport sector, development and implementation of climate programs, and promotion of technology development to reduce emissions in the transport sector.As a consultant from 2006 on, I performed major studies for Transport Canada on the implementation of the new Navigable Waters Protection Act, on the governance of the offshore oil shipping regime and on the development of a seamless regulatory regime to govern the prevention of and response to ship-source oil spills.I have written extensively on energy and climate-related issues, including several articles for the FOSS and a major paper on the factors affecting energy transitions for the U.K. Global Warming Policy Foundation.Throughout my public service career, I worked for eight Prime Ministers: Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark, John Turner, Brian Mulroney, Kim Campbell, Jean Chretien, Paul Martin and Stephen Harper. I was proud to perform my public service duties in a non-partisan way.~~~~Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy? Text of address:Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
We have two new entries to the long (and growing) list of papers appearing the in recent scientific literature that argue that the earth’s climate sensitivity—the ultimate rise in the earth’s average surface temperature from a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide content—is close to 2°C, or near the low end of the range of possible values presented by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). With a low‐​end warming comes low‐​end impacts and an overall lack of urgency for federal rules and regulations (such as those outlined in the President’s Climate Action Plan) to limit carbon dioxide emissions and limit our energy choices.   
  
  
The first is the result of a research effort conducted by Craig Loehle and published in the journal _Ecological Modelling_. The paper is a pretty straightforward determination of the climate sensitivity. Loehle first uses a model of natural modulations to remove the influence of natural variability (such as solar activity and ocean circulation cycles) from the observed temperature history since 1850. The linear trend in the post‐​1950 residuals from Loehle’s natural variability model was then assumed to be largely the result, in net, of human carbon dioxide emissions. By dividing the total temperature change (as indicated by the best‐​fit linear trend) by the observed rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide content, and then applying that relationship to a doubling of the carbon dioxide content, Loehle arrives at an estimate of the earth’s _transient_ climate sensitivity—transient, in the sense that at the time of CO2 doubling, the earth has yet to reach a state of equilibrium and some warming is still to come.   
  
  
Loehle estimated the _equilibrium_ climate sensitivity from his transient calculation based on the average transient:equilibrium ratio projected by the collection of climate models used in the IPCC’s most recent _Assessment Report_. In doing so, he arrived at an equilibrium climate sensitivity estimate of 1.99°C with a 95% confidence range of it being between 1.75°C and 2.23°C.   
  
  
Compare Loehle’s estimate to the IPCC’s latest assessment of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity which assigns a 66 percent or greater likelihood that it lies somewhere in the range from 1.5°C to 4.5°C. Loehle’s determination is more precise and decidedly towards the low end of the range.   
  
  
The second entry to our list of low climate sensitivity estimates comes from Roy Spencer and William Braswell and published in the _Asia‐​Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Sciences_. Spencer and Braswell used a very simple climate model to simulate the global temperature variations averaged over the top 2000 meters of the global ocean during the period 1955–2011. They first ran the simulation using only volcanic and anthropogenic influences on the climate. They ran the simulation again adding a simple take on the natural variability contributed by the El Niño/​La Niña process. And they ran the simulation a final time adding in a more complex situation involving a feedback from El Niño/​La Niña onto natural cloud characteristics. They then compared their model results with the set of real‐​world observations.   
  
  
What the found, was the that the complex situation involving El Niño/​La Niña feedbacks onto cloud properties produced the best match to the observations. And this situation also produced the lowest estimate for the earth’s climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions—a value of 1.3°C.   
  
  
Spencer and Braswell freely admit that using their simple model is just the first step in a complicated diagnosis, but also point out that the results from simple models provide insight that should help guide the development of more complex models, and ultimately could help unravel some of the mystery as to why full climate models produce high estimates of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity, while estimates based in real‐​world observations are much lower.   
  
  
Our Figure below helps to illustrate the discrepancy between climate model estimates and real‐​world estimates of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity. It shows Loehle’s determination as well as that of Spencer and Braswell along with 16 other estimates reported in the scientific literature, beginning in 2011. Also included in our Figure is both the IPCC’s latest assessment of the literature as well as the characteristics of the equilibrium climate sensitivity from the collection of climate models that the IPCC uses to base its impacts assessment.

Figure 1. Climate sensitivity estimates from new research beginning in 2011 (colored), compared with the assessed range given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the collection of climate models used in the IPCC AR5. The “likely” (greater than a 66% likelihood of occurrence)range in the IPCC Assessment is indicated by the gray bar. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95 percent confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The right‐​hand side of the IPCC AR5 range is actually the 90% upper bound (the IPCC does not actually state the value for the upper 95 percent confidence bound of their estimate). Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best‐​matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing.[/caption]   
  
  
Quite obviously, the IPCC is rapidly losing is credibility.   
  
  
As a result, the Obama Administration would do better to come to grips with this fact and stop deferring to the IPCC findings when trying to justify increasingly burdensome federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, with the combined effects of manipulating markets and restricting energy choices.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman evolutionary biologist and physiologist Prof. Dr. Ulrich Kutschera told in an interview that “CO2 is a blessing for mankind” and that the claimed “97% consensus” among scientists is “a myth”.

97% consensus claim “untenable” 
Kutschera, who has authored over three hundred scientific publications and twelve books, told the German “Junge Freiheit” (JF) that the 97% figure on consensus was created in 2013 by Australian cognitive scientist John Cook and that it has since “turned out to be untenable”, as proven by David R. Legates.
“Cook and Powell evaluated an arbitrary number of climate publications according to questionable criteria,” Kutschera told JF.
Climate doomsday “kind of religious cult”
When asked why he also signed the European Climate Declaration declaring no climate emergency, he said he considered it “important that a professional educational initiative, hopefully politically neutral, should finally emerge” and that he rejected extremes, among them the “‘climate alarmists’ who predict a fictitious, imminent ‘earth heat death’ and thus practice a kind of religious cult.”

“Basic nutrient for all plants”
“So since plants need CO2 as a basic foodstuff, there would be no life on earth without this trace gas,” said Kutschera, in response to claims that CO2 is a pollutant. “Therefore, the scientific discipline of plant physiology is of central importance, and CO2 is therefore a blessing for mankind!”
CO2 tax “nonsensical”
“Since about 1850, the CO2 content of the air has risen from 0.028 volume percent (280 ppm) to 0.041 volume percent (410 ppm) today. This has led to an increase in global photosynthesis – in other words, we humans have made the earth greener!” said the highly controversial professor from Kassel.
He also calls the planned CO2 tax “nonsensical” and that it is “actually a kind of new ‘special food tax’ on the state”.
Earth being greened by man
The renowned biologist also told JF that the natural carbon cycle has been altered by man so “that currently about a third of the CO2 we put into the air is consumed by plants, which increases their growth. The result is that the earth is greened by man, including higher crop yields – from which, incidentally, agriculture benefits worldwide – i.e. mainly poor countries that depend on agricultural products to a much greater extent than we do.”
97% of FFF activists don’t understand carbon cycle
Kutschera criticizes the hysteria that some of his fellow scientists are spreading and he sees the climate issue as highly politicized and poorly understood. Concerning the Fridays for Future activists, he tells JF:
As I have been active in nature conservation since my early youth – building ponds, etc. – I basically rate the movement positively. However, I fear that more than 97 percent of its activists can neither define the term ‘climate’ nor have understood the carbon cycle or the function of the Rubisco enzyme, and therefore act purely politically. Since the irrational climate cult is on the rise, I advocate a ‘Fridays for Plant Physiology’ movement.”

"Climate Alarmists turn back the Clock
Three centuries ago, the world ran on green power. Wood was used for heating and cooking, charcoal for smelting and smithing, wind or water-power for pumps mills and ships, and whale oil or tallow for lamps. People and soldiers walked or rode horses, and millions of horses and oxen pulled ploughs, wagons, coaches and artillery.
But smoke from open fires choked cities, forests were stripped of trees, most of the crops went to feed draft animals, and streets were littered with horse manure. For many people, life was “nasty, brutish and short”.
Then the steam engine was developed, and later the internal combustion engine, electricity and refrigeration came along. Green power was replaced by coal and oil. Carbon energy powered factories, mills, pumps, ships, trains, and smelters; and cars, trucks and tractors replaced the work-horses. The result was a green revolution – forests began to regrow and vast areas of crop-land used for horse feed were released to produce food for humans. Poverty declined and population soared.
But new environmental problems emerged. Smoke pollution from burning cheap dirty coal in millions of open fires, old boilers and smelters produced massive smog problems in cities like London and Pittsburgh.
The solution was improved technology, sensible pollution-control laws and the supply of coal gas and coal-powered electricity to the cities. The air was cleared by “Clean Coal by Wire” at the flick of a switch and “Piped Coal Energy” at the click of a gas-lighter. In some places use of hydro, geothermal and nuclear power also helped.
In recent years, however, affluent urban alarmists have declared war on the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal, oil and gas. They claim it is a pollutant and it causes dangerous global warming.

The pollutant claims are easy to refute.
The worst air pollution in the world today is the Asian smog. Smog is very visible – but carbon dioxide is a transparent gas that is exhaled by all living creatures.
Smog is air polluted with particulates and noxious gases – but there are no particulates or noxious components in carbon dioxide. Therefore carbon dioxide plays no part in creating smog.
Smog consists of ash particles, unburnt fuels and noxious gases produced by the inefficient combustion of anything, usually in open fires or obsolete boilers engines or smelters with no pollution control equipment. Wind-blown dust, bush and forest fires, blue haze from forests and drifting volcanic ash add to the smog. Modern coal-fired power stations with efficient pollution controls do not release detectable particulates or noxious gases. Bans on dirty combustion and more clean electricity will clear the smog of Asian cities.
All gases in the atmosphere have an effect on global climate, usually a moderating one, reducing the intense heat of the midday sun and reducing the rate of cooling at night. But only in theoretical climate models does carbon dioxide drive global warming – real evidence contradicts them.
The unrelenting war on carbon fuels has far greater risks, with some zealots advocating “Zero Emissions”, while also, incredibly, opposing nuclear and hydro-power. They would take us all back to the BC Era (before coal).
Already urban environmentalists are polluting city air by burning wood (“biomass”) and briquetted paper in stoves and home heaters; and trying to prevent millions in Asia and Africa from getting cheap clean electricity. Other misguided nations are clearing forests and transporting low-energy wood chips to burn in distant power stations. And the high costs of green energy are already forcing some poor people to burn old books and strip parks and forests for fire-wood.
In addition, crops that once fed people are now making “green” ethanol to fuel cars, and native forests are being cleared and burnt to make way for more fuel crops. Our modern “Iron Horses” are eating the crops again.
The use of carbon fuels in the production, fertilising, transport and storage of food has been a major factor in allowing the world population to grow by several billions since the start of the industrial revolution. If climate alarmists succeed in turning back the clock, food and energy will again become reserved for the rich and powerful, and billions of poor people will die of starvation or exposure.

"**Sriracha Hot Chilli sauce has been recalled in Australia and New Zealand over fears bottles could ""explode"" when opened.**
Food Standards Australia New Zealand warned a build-up of lactic acid could cause bottles to ""bloat and continue to ferment"".
It said the condiment may splatter over people or property when opened.
The product is sold widely in supermarkets and Asian grocery stores across Australia and New Zealand.
Made from chillies, vinegar and garlic, the red sauce has become popular worldwide and is often referred to as ""hipster Tabasco"".
The recall applies to 502ml and 828ml sized bottles with a best before date of March 2021.
""Do not open bottles that feel bloated and return the products to the place of purchase for a full refund,"" Food Standards Australia New Zealand said on its website.
Last month, the condiment faced a recall in Ireland on similar grounds.
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland recalled a batch of the product due to the ""risk of the contents exploding once the bottle is opened. This poses a risk of hot chili sauce irritating eyes or skin"".
In October, the sauce made headlines in Australia for a very different reason.
Four men were arrested when police found 400kg (882lb) of crystal methamphetamine hidden inside imported bottles of the hot sauce.
Five years earlier, a California city declared a factory which makes the spicy sauce a public nuisance, after residents nearby complained about the smell."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBusiness soon could be getting awfully rough for electric (battery) car technology manufacturers.
For example, German online news weekly FOCUS here reports how the Singapore government “does not want electric cars” and even “is blocking electric cars”.
E-cars dirtier than claimed
According to Minister Masago Zulkifli bin Masagos Mohamad, who is responsible for the environment and water supply, Singapore has “no interest in a lifestyle, that is being promoted by Tesla’s Elon Musk.
“We are interested in clean solutions to get climate problems under control,” said Zukifli.
FOCUS adds that Musk’s e-car strategy has been “met with massive criticism” in Singapore.
In fact, the Singapore government also had previously decided to impose a CO2 tax on e-cars because the fossil fuels used for generating electricity for the e-car needs to be taken into account.
E-cars have environmental drawbacks
Singapore has strong arguments against more e-cars, FOCUS adds. One reason is that the country relies on a dense public transport network of bus and rail, and so throwing e-cars into the mix would only lead to congestion. The forward-looking Zukifli is clearly placing bets on hydrogen propulsion for the future.

This may explain why a number of countries (e.g. Germany) have been stalling when it comes to investments in electric car infrastructure. Why invest tens of billions in an electric car infrastructure when it may be obsolete in a decade or less?
According to FOCUS: “This [hydrogen propulsion] has a particularly low CO2 footprint, given that rare metals are required for the manufacture of electric car batteries and it has not yet been clarified how they can later be disposed of safely.”
Asia going full throttle to hydrogen
Reuters here reports that China, Japan and South Korea “have set ambitious targets to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles” – hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) – on the road by the end of the next decade.
According to proponents, hydrogen FCVs are clean, the gas is plentiful in supply, offers distance ranges similar to gasoline cars and are free of battery-manufacture and after-life disposal/environmental issues.
According to Reuters: “Many backers in China and Japan see FCVs as complementing EVs rather than replacing them. In general, hydrogen is seen as the more efficient choice for heavier vehicles that drive longer distances, hence the current emphasis on city buses.”

" Contributed by Michelle Stirling ©2019For the past few days, all major TV news stations in Canada have been tweeting a clip of Green Party leader, Elizabeth May, bloviating about not leaving fossil fuel workers behind in the Green Party’s proposed “Mission Possible” plan.I say ‘bloviating’ because she offers no evidence to support any of her claims – and worse, the media and journalists whose mandate is to make sure we are not being fed ‘fake news’ …just let her go on and on!Ask the woman a few hard questions.Here’s one for starters – since the world runs almost entirely on fossil fuels, with wind and solar providing a tiny percentage of energy generation, why does she think oil and gas and oil sands workers would not be employed – if pipelines to market were built?Ask Elizabeth May what wind turbines and solar panels are made from.  Ask her.  Ask her why oil and gas and coal workers…and oil sands workers…would not be employed when no renewables are possible without scads of oil, natural gas, coal and oil sands?These are not tough questions – and they are not meant to embarrass the Green Party leader. But if Elizabeth May is making claims that are based on unicorns and fairy dust – and planning to impose these on the Canadian taxpayer, shouldn’t we know if they are at all workable or not?And Ms. May claims the Green Party will not leave any one behind.Ask her about her days in the Sierra Club as Executive Director -from 1989 to 2006 – and the Sierra Club’s role in pushing for the Ontario Green Energy Act.https://www.pembina.org/reports/plugging-in-ontario-report.pdfIn Robert Lyman’s report on the Ontario Government’s Climate Legacy, he documents the almost absolute destruction of the industrial heartland through that plan.With the current push for public policy to adopt ‘green energy’ schemes, it is time to reflect on the Ontario experience. Ontario’s disastrous electricity policy has been publicized and commented on extensively by many sources, so this is not news. What is news is to lay the blame squarely at the door of its climate policy motivation, and, perhaps, to remind people of high the bill has been – $9 billion for poor contracting practices, $133 billion in global adjustment fees from 2015 to 2032 (at least 20 per cent of which relates to renewables), $3.6 billion to build the “smart grid and smart meters”, up to $55 billion in deferred costs that will hit future ratepayers, and 75,000 lost industrial jobs. That is quite the tally for zero global environmental benefit.Most Canadians think the #TarSandsCampaign is just about Alberta crying over collapsed international oil markets and coming up with conspiracy theories.  I ask you to look at the players funded by the tar sands campaign and realize that it has attacked every part of the Canadian economy – and look who the consistent players are.Seventy Five THOUSAND Ontarians were left behind by the Green Energy Act – promoted by Elizabeth May’s Sierra Club.That’s pretty close to the 100,000 Albertans left behind by the NDP and Liberal climate policies…and look who spoke at the Sierra Club sponsored 2010 Zombie Duck rally.Upon Elizabeth May leaving the Sierra Club to run for the Green Party, Board President Louise Comeau noted, “Elizabeth has led the Club at the national level from its infancy to the enormously effective entity it is today.”Sierra Club is so effective that it also helped put 7,000 coal workers out of a job in Alberta and is responsible for the devastation of 30 coal industry communities.The Sierra Club has been funded for millions of dollars by billionaires with vested interests in renewables to demarket coal, oil, gas and oil sands.  http://leftexposed.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2014-Senate-Billionaire-Club-Report.pdf Now Ms. May, in her new incarnation as Green Party leader, is promising more of the same in terms of unworkable green policies…yet claiming no worker will be left behind!Elizabeth May also claims that geothermal can become a big player in providing energy – but if you look at the global reality of geothermal, even in the US, the world’s largest geothermal generation market…..geothermal only provides 0.4% of the power generation.Geothermal for Canada – Questions and ChallengesAnd what of wind and solar in the US?  After 40 years and TRILLIONS of dollars spent on wind and solar in the US, wind generates only 6.6% of US energy and solar – thermal and PV combined? Just 1.6% – and that’s in a country with far better solar and wind resources than Canada.Not to mention, looks like Ms. May is leading Canadians down the garden path to a dead end. The CEO of Iberdrola says the renewables sector is heading for an Enron-style endgame. Enron was a huge energy company in the US that collapsed into ashes due to a combination of fake holdings and off-the-books accounting – fraudulent accounting.Enron was also one of the main advocates for various cap and trade, carbon pricing and renewables schemes that we see today.Back in the world of reality…Oil, gas, coal and oil sands grow in demand worldwide…but Canada just can’t get these resources to market like our competitors can – and none of our competitor nations are trying to be climate leaders….they are all trying to get more market share.One way to do that of course, is for any of our competitor to fund environmental groups like the > 100 international groups that participate in the tar sands campaign to drive off investors, shakedown banks and insurance companies…to block Canada from world markets….and to demoralize Canada’s industrial workforce.If you want to know what Canada will look like after the ‘go-green’ environmental groups are done with our country, just look at Ontario. Crippled. Nearly bankrupt.Maybe that debacle wouldn’t have happened if the media had been more critical, more questioning, more demanding of the facts instead of fawning over enviro-celebs.We have many reports with these facts – but the media have mostly locked us out because an influential PR guy who is an Al Gore acolyte has successfully labelled us as ‘deniers’.So, you read our reports. Make up your mind for yourself.  Instead of an eco-activist making up things, we rely on Robert Lyman, a former public servant of 27 years, 10 years a diplomat, who provided non-partisan advice to government at a time when experts were helping the government, not activists.Then demand that your local media report on the facts and ask the hardball questions of ALL politicians and environmental groups.  After all, it’s YOUR money, your jobs and your environment they are toying with – you will be left behind and hurting if you don’t speak up now.For Friends of Science Society, I’m Michelle Stirling.Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists, AAAS, and APS.Read our reports:Climate Change Your Mindhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/01/climate-change-your-mind-rebutting-canadian-governments-climate-report/The Stakes Are Too High to be Tricked by the Numbershttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/19/the-stakes-are-too-high-to-be-tricked-by-the-numbers/Futile Folly: Canada’s Climate Policy Goals in the Global Contexthttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/05/futile-folly-canadas-climate-policy-goals-in-the-global-context/Ontario Government Climate Legacyhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/the-ontario-government-climate-legacy/Look Before You Leap into Climate Emergency Modehttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/13/look-before-you-leap-into-climate-emergency-mode/Shocking Realityhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/19/shocking-reality-electrification-and-decarbonization-net-zero-pathway-to-economic-and-energy-catastrophe/Climate Science Basic Issueshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/29/climate-change-some-basic-issues/?highlight=Don%20MortonIn the Dark on Renewableshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/In-the-Dark-on-Renewables-FINAL-Nov-18-2018.pdfTransition to Realityhttps://www.thegwpf.org/energy-policy-needs-to-transition-to-reality/Related: Oak Foundation grant databases(s) (downloaded from their public site)grants-env oak pdf 75 pageoak-foundation-all-current-grants_latest-update-18.03.2019ClimateWorks  – ‘green’ billionaires and their influence on public policy via funding local ENGOsClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165Nisbet  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.524 Nisbet (Not paywalled)https://web.northeastern.edu/matthewnisbet/2018/05/21/summary-of-strategic-philanthropy-in-the-post-cap-and-trade-years-reviewing-u-s-foundation-climate-and-energy-funding-at-wires-climate-change/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Leighton Baker, leader of New Conservative talks about how our party takes a different approach to Climate Change. We believe hard-earned taxpayers money is better well spent looking for solutions to pollution and other environmental ills including climate change. Carbon credits are a wasted effort as we have little ability to control our planet. An environmental solution example is to invest in building animal pest traps instead of dropping 1080 poisons. New Conservative would pull NZ out of the Paris Accord and focus on exporting the Pollution Solution technologies that would actively help other countries reduce their own pollution.

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



Surprise, surprise! There was a **consensus** way back in 1976. Probably 97% of scientists agreed – who knows? However, the consensus was that it was cooling, not warming. No matter, there was a consensus.



The world was going to run out of food and it was going to get worse.

It’s the weekend, and so I have decided to give you all a break from the doom and gloom that we seem to be facing on a daily basis, and instead enlighten you all on award-winning journalist, Verity Johnson’s solution to the ragged subject of climate emergencies. She has the solution; buy a KeepCup.



She even seems to think that this is the solution to being a feminist as well. And no… it is not April 1st. I seem to say that a lot these days, don’t I?



I’ll be honest, I’ve never been overly concerned about environmentalism.  
It’s not like I wanted to douse the planet in napalm, I just haven’t ever really been an environmental type. I was put off easily and early on by the stereotypes around environmental activists, all of whom I knew were more earnest than an American Christian summer camp leader, and used lemons as deodorant.   
And honestly, I just never really thought about it much more than that. Yeah, I recycled and bought carbon offsetting on flights, but my efforts probably never amounted to more than spitting on a house fire. 



For a _Stuff_ journalist to be saying all that, expect to be lectured on how this is totally the wrong way of thinking. Expect Verity to reveal how she has now seen the light – Hallelujah! – and how we sinners must all do so too.



However, all of that changed when my office reacted with outrage to the news that [Wellington City Council is refusing to recycle “compostable” coffee cups](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/113597468/dumped--compostable-coffee-cups--shock-to-wellington-businesses). We’re a KeepCup? office. 



How absolutely environmental of you, Verity. A KeepCup office indeed. I had no idea this was how to save the world. You really are an inspiration.



It just so happens that I’m also the resident caffeine junkie, who at any one point will be surrounded by a sea of half-empty, non-recyclable coffee-stained cylinders of imminent turtle death. And so in the climate of office-based outrage, it was collectively decided this week that I needed to change. A jury was called at the watercooler, and I had to explain myself …  
My problem has been that environmentalism has never been my cause. 



So you keep saying, Verity. I get it. You were not an environmentalist… until suddenly, you were. 



I have a theory that everyone has their one cause. One thing they get really, really het up over, which provides an endless well of outrage and energy to draw upon and fuels them to do all the campaigning, donating and small everyday life changes that add up to significant change. We all have one big cause we’re willing to die on a rock for, like a morally outraged Prometheus.   
Mine’s always been feminism (closely followed by the exploitation of vulnerable people). For a lot of people, it’s animal abuse. And, for the watercooler witch trial, it’s takeaway coffee cups. 



Sigh. Not only is this going to be a climate crisis lecture, it is going to be a long winded one too. 



And when you’re like me (chaotic, last-minute and with an appalling grasp of time), it’s easy to drown out the vague traces of guilt about taking Ubers everywhere with, “But I’m too late to wait for the bus!” Likewise I always justify takeaway cups by reasoning that I’d never remember to carry a KeepCup/wash it/not smash it like I have the last five phones I’ve had these past 12 months. 



You know what? I really hate people who talk about ‘first world problems’, but this is the worst case of first world problems that I have ever encountered. Having to take an Uber… not being able to remember a KeepCup. For goodness sake…



I tried explaining all of these things to the cardigan-clad office judiciary. But midway through I heard myself saying, “I just don’t think it’s my responsibility given that 100 multinationals have been responsible for 70 per cent of the world’s carbon emissions … besides, what impact will one individual have …”   
Not only was I denying my individual responsibility in upholding a damaging system. But I was also downplaying my role in being able to help solve it. I sounded exactly like your average anti-feminist. 



I am still trying to figure out where feminism fits into this. Being unenvironmental, or unable to handle the massive issues involved with a KeepCup surely must apply pretty much equally to men and women. It seems not.



The environment isn’t my great inflaming passion, but I can see how, as an individual, I’ve got responsibility in climate change and should therefore do more to create change. At least to avoid being a glaring hypocrite who asked others to make small changes to things they didn’t really care about, but didn’t do it myself. 



So you keep saying. Verity. Just one thing though. Climate crises, if they exist (which I doubt) affect men and women equally, whereas feminism advantages only women. They are not comparable in any shape or form.



And yes, swearing off takeaway cups is a tiny action. But just in the same way that standing up for someone who’s being sexually harassed at the office can be life-changing, it’s the spending choices of everyday consumers that dictate the habits of big companies – look at the popularity of free-range products. 



  
**So I bought a KeepCup. Two, actually. And now I couldn’t call myself a feminist without it.**



  
Well, I am aghast. Buying a KeepCup makes you both an environmentalist and a feminist. I have no idea how… but apparently, it does.



I have a tiny suggestion for Verity. If you really want to save the environment singlehandedly… buy a china cup. Even better, bring one to the office from home. There. Climate crisis solved.

Summary:  2018 using Renewable Energy Foundation data

In 2018 UK Weather dependent renewables generated some 7.7 Gigawatts of power from an installed fleet of ~34 Gigawatts achieving a satisfactory overall capacity factor for Renewables of ~23%.  The installed fleet cost ~84£billion in capital costs with average costs of ~11£billion/Gigawatt produced in capital costs and ~42£billion/Gigawatt produced long-term.  Because of the comparative capacity factors Offshore wind and Solar PV were roughly equivalent in capital costs at ~15£billion / Gigawatt produced and ~60£billion / Gigawatt produced over the long-term.  The direct comparison in the UK situation with similar measures for traditional generation technologies, Gas-firing and Nuclear, can be seen to be substantially lower above.
This post gives indicative cost estimates of the current 2018 UK fleet of Weather Dependent Renewables, assuming no further growth, as both capital and probable long-term expenditures.
It shows clearly the likely cost differentials and overspend over effective traditional Electricity generation technologies, (Gas-firing and Nuclear) that Renewables incur and will incur to support political “Green Virtue Signalling” and the Government mandated “Anthropogenic Global Warming” hypothesis.  These investments might contribute to the reduction of about a quarter of the UK’s 1.1% of 2018 Global CO2 emissions.
https://edmhdotme.wordpress.com/global-man-made-co2-emissions-1965-2018-bp-data/
These calculations clearly contradict the popular assertion that Weather Dependent Renewables are now price competitive with conventional power generation, Gas-firing  and even Nuclear power.  They only compare the comparative costs of their power generating capability, leaving aside other unquantified ancillary costs of their use in operation.
This post quantifies the scale of the fiscal waste and the burdens on utility bills attributable to the use of UK Weather Dependent Renewables.
Introduction
This post gives indicative, (back of the envelope, expressed in £billion), estimates of the net capital and net 60 year long-term costs of Weather Dependent Renewables as compared to the use of Gas-firing for electricity generation in the UK.  These net calculations should avoid the market distortions arising from the political interventions that have been made to support Renewables.
The introductory table above shows that the indicative overnight capital costs of the current UK Renewable fleet is ~84 £billion and the anticipated further long-term costs would be ~350 £billion, were those existing Renewables to be maintained for the 60 year long-term.
They give an idea of the present scale of the bare costs for “Green virtue signalling” in the UK.  The equivalent costs using Gas-firing to provide a similar level of consistent power generation would be ~7 £billion in capital costs and a further ~31 £billion long-term respectively.
In the UK the three main forms of UK Weather Dependent Renewable Energy are Wind Power, (Onshore and Offshore), and on grid Photovoltaic Solar Power, about 75% of the Renewables total.  The other “Renewable” energy inputs include traditional Hydro power ~8% and the remainder are other sources such as biomass, waste and landfill gas amounting to ~17%.
In 2018 the UK represented only 1.1% of the global CO2 emissions and power generation only amounted for less than one quarter of those CO2 emissions, transport and space heating accounting for the remainder.
So making costly and self-harming modifications UK electrical  generation technologies can only have a marginal and minor impact on a very small proportion of current UK and global CO2 emissions.  That impact is even less if one looks into the CO2 emission and energy requirements of Renewable technologies from their use of fossil essential for their manufacture to demolition.
Whenever announcements are made about Weather Dependent Renewable Energy installations, they are reported as the full Name Plate rating, (in other words the maximum potential power output the installation can produce under ideal Weather conditions), and also disingenuously as the number of homes that could be supplied at their full level of power output.
The question of Capacity  /  Load Factors is never fully explained, so such announcements are deliberately deceptive.  Such promotional Renewable Energy announcements thus falsely assume that the wind blows all the time, (24/7), at productive speeds and that the sun shines overhead 24 hours/day and the seasons never change from summer.  In fact the 2018 the combined capacity factor of UK Renewables amounted to ~1/5th, ~22% of their installed Nameplate rating.


Comparative Cost Model for Electricity Generation Technologies

The table above provides comparative costing for differing generation technologies.  It is derived from the most recent, 2017, US  EIA data in US$ on comparative costs of generation technologies.
https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table_8.2.pdf
The US EIA table quotes the overnight capital costs of each technology and the above table condenses the total costs of the technology when maintained in operation for 60 years expressed as £billion / Gigawatt.  These base data avoid the distorting effects of Government fiscal and subsidy policies supporting Renewable Energy.  It is hoped therefore that these results give a valid comparative analysis of the true cost effectiveness of Weather Dependent Renewables.   These EIA updates fully account for any recent cost reductions of Renewable technology costs, particularly those for Solar panels.
The table above assumes that the purchasing power of £1 is equivalent to US$1.20.  The service life allocated for Renewables used above may well be generous, particularly for Offshore Wind and Solar Photovoltaics.  The production capability of all Renewable technologies have been shown to progressively deteriorate significantly over their service life.
Note that in addition that these comparative figures are underestimates of the true costs of using Weather Dependent Renewables.  The results above only account for the cost comparisons for the actual electrical power generated accounting for the capacity of each generating technology.
The costs projected here ignore the ancillary costs inevitably associated with Wind power and Solar Renewables resulting from:

unreliability in terms of both intermittency and variability
poor timing of generation, unlikely to be coordinated with demand
long transmission lines with costly power losses and increased maintenance
additional infrastructure necessary for access
the costs of largely redundant back up generation only used on occasions but wastefully running in spinning reserve nonetheless
unsynchronised generation with lack of inherent inertia.
inability to recover from a “black start”, when essential after failure.

These net cost calculations should avoid the distortions arising from the political interventions in support of Renewables.
In addition these cost analyses do not account for:

The “Carbon footprint” of Renewable technologies, they may never save as much CO2 during their service life as they are likely to require for their manufacture, installation and eventual demolition.  When viewed in the round, all these activities are entirely dependent on the use of substantial amounts of fossil fuels.
The Energy Return on Energy Invested, Renewables may well not produce as much Energy during their service life as was needed for their original manufacture and installation.  They certainly do not provide the regular excess power sufficient to support the multiple needs of a developed society.

Renewables K.O.-ed by EROI?
The Renewable Energy Foundation time series data for the UK 2002 – 2018
The Renewable Energy Foundation reports on Weather Dependent Renewables and Green energy in the UK.
https://ref.org.uk/energy-data
It has provided comprehensive time series data on Renewable Installations in the UK since 2002.  This includes the Nameplate rating of installations and the annual Gigawatt Hour electrical output over the year for each generation technology.  This post uses those data and provides graphic representations of the Renewable Energy Foundation information, with time series presentations showing the progress of UK Weather Dependent Renewables.
According the Renewable Energy Foundation data, 2018 was a reasonable year for UK Weather Dependent Renewables productivity. 

Productivity expressed as  a percentage capacity factor, (actual power produced / nameplate value), is crucial to evaluating the true comparative value of power produced.  The progress since 2002 of installation of Weather Dependent Renewables in the UK is shown below.The capacity figures that have been achieved in the UK are shown below.
Overall, on average the UK Renewables performance has exceeded 22%, providing a better than average performance for the year 2018.  Onshore Wind power, now substantially curtailed in the UK, has achieved capacities around ~25%.  Offshore Wind power has been more variable but achieved a capacity figure of ~35% in 2018.
But of course the “trip” of an Offshore wind farm on a breezy summer afternoon contributed to the major UK power outage of 9/8/2019.  An outage like that will be all the more severe and probably longer lasting one still foggy winter evening soon. Weather Dependent Renewables can not provide inherent inertia in the grid to overcome short term sudden variability and to enable a “Black Start”, if needed.
The productivity of Solar Power in the UK is consistently at the ~10% capacity level.
The two graphs below show the progress of Renewable installations in the UK since 2002 noting:

the gross over commitment to Solar PV Power 2013-2016, (yielding only ~10% capacity)
the remarkable cut back in Renewable installations that occurred in 2018
the very large future cost commitments made in 2010 and 2017 particularly for Offshore Wind power.  In 2017 this alone amounted a future cost of some 50£billion.


Comparative Generation Costings
The table below gives a capital valuation of the current 2018 UK Weather Dependent Renewables fleet at ~84£billion with probable ongoing costs of ~325£billion.  This is approximately twice the cost of providing the same power output with Nuclear power and more than 11 times the cost of using Gas-firing for equivalent generation.
The excess capital expenditures of Renewables range from ~41£billion to ~77£billion.  The long-term excess expenditures range from 230£billion to 300£billion depending on the substituted technology.
These significant excess costs represent the wastage imposed on the UK population both via direct taxation and added to utility bills by the Government mandates imposing Renewables on the UK electricity generation.  That wastage amounts to a very regressive tax burden imposed on the poorer in UK society.

The following three tables show how differing existing Renewable technologies contribute to the Government mandated excess costs.  Onshore Wind power is the most competitive achieving parity with Nuclear power in capital cost but being about twice as expensive long -term.  Onshore wind power is only about 6 times more costly than Gas-firing.
Offshore wind power and Solar PV power are similarly cost-ineffective being 2.5 – 5 times more costly than Nuclear but about 16 times more costly than Gas-firing.  They together are responsible for more than 75% of the excess costs of the UK Renewables fleet even though they are responsible for only ~55% of the Renewable power output produced.  Together wastage in the capital cost from Offshore wind and Solar power amounts to some 60£billion with a long-term anticipated cost of ~230billion.



Conclusion
Weather Dependent Renewable Energy depends on capturing essentially dilute and very variable sources of power.  At the same time Weather Dependent Renewables are both capital and maintenance expensive and inevitably unreliable.
Weather Dependent Renewables are universally more expensive than the conventional alternatives of Gas-firing or Nuclear power.  ~2-5 times for Nuclear power and in the UK ~16 times more expensive than Gas-firing.
The late Prof David Mackay (former chef scientific advisor of the Department of Energy and Climate Change) in a final interview before his untimely death in 2016 said that the concept of powering a developed country such as the UK with Weather Dependent Renewable energy was:
“an appalling delusion”.
At the time he also said:
“There’s so much delusion, it’s so dangerous for humanity that people allow themselves to have such delusions, that they are willing to not think carefully about the numbers, and the reality of the laws of physics and the reality of engineering….humanity does need to pay attention to arithmetic and the laws of physics.”
This costing model has followed through on Professor Mackay’s back of the envelope calculations. in the UK, showing that Weather Dependent Renewables, (Offshore wind and Solar Power), are approximately ~16  times more expensive in both capital and lifetime costs when compared to the use of Gas-fired Generation technologies.  At the same time Onshore wind power is only ~6 times more costly than Gas-firing.
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/03/idea-of-renewables-powering-uk-is-an-appalling-delusion-david-mackay
The excess overspend instead of  using Gas-firing of the current UK generation fleet amount to some 77£billion in capital costs and the long-term costs approach a further 300£billion.
If the objectives of using Weather Dependent Renewables were not confused with possibly “saving the planet” from the output of the UK’s small amount, (~25%  of 1.1%,  much less than the annual growth in China and the Developing world), of Man-made CO2 produced by the UK for electricity generation, their actual costs, in-effectiveness and their inherent unreliability, Weather Dependent Renewables would have always been ruled them out of any engineering consideration as means of National scale electricity generation.
It is essential to ask the question what is the actual value of these government mandated excess costs to the improvement of the environment and for the possibility of perhaps saving undetectable temperature increases a 100 years in the future, especially in a context where the developing world will be increasing its CO2 emissions to attain it’s further enhancement of living standards over the coming decades.  
Reducing the UK’s minor part of Man-made CO2 emissions as a means to control a “warming” climate seems even less relevant as the long-term temperature trend has been downwards for last 3 millennia, since 1000BC,  towards the coming end of the current Holocene interglacial epoch.

Ian Duncan writes on Facebook:

‘France has its hottest recorded temperature ever’.
New record – 45.9C on June 28th, beating the old absolute record of 44.1C in 2003.
But they don’t mention that where it was recorded was next to a concrete drain, and a steel chain mesh fence close to a bitumen (asphalt) highway.

So much for only using correctly placed instruments in a Stevenson Screen in a open space away from unnatural heat source. 

You can see the station here:

https://goo.gl/maps/hF4KbSoXTt6WZfLr6
Here is the fun part – it might be the “greenhouse effect” /sarc

Seriously though, who knows what effect those greenhouses might have had on the high temperature? What we do know is that greenhouses accumulate heat and raise the temperature. Depending on wind direction that day, they may have vented waste heat in the direction of the thermometer shelter. The same could be true for the asphalt highway.
As for the heat wave itself, Dr.  Roy W. Spencer adds:
When Saharan air reaches Europe, it’s going to be hot. Regarding record-high measurements, it is legitimate to ask about the placement of temperature sensors, as well as the length of temperature records. For a record length of, say, 100+ years and NO long term warming trend, it is still expected from random weather variations that new record high temperatures will be recorded from time to time. The recent record high in Miami, FL was made in the middle of a vast concrete jungle that did not exist 100 years ago, and now averages 10 deg. F warmer at night than rural surroundings.
One other thing to consider – Stevenson screens that are easily accessible like that are prone to biases (or forcings, if you will) that “real climatologists” don’t usually consider – like vehicles being parked next to them. Look at the satellite view: (station circled in red)
Aerial view of the location of France’s “all time high temperature” weather station. (circled in red) Note proximity of highway and greenhouses.  Google Earth:  https://www.google.com/maps/@43.746687,4.2594672,126m/data=!3m1!1e3 
Remember this fiasco in Scotland a couple of years ago? An ice-cream truck with generators constantly running was the cause of a “man-made climatological event”.
Friday Funny: Scottish “record high temperature” caused by Ice Cream Truck

So is the new French absolute all time high temperature record valid? I’m surmising it is not. There’s just too many influences to consider.
Certainly, the measurement environment there is far different than that of 100 years ago. And, who knows if somebody parked a vehicle next to that French station on June 28th? Maybe a lunch wagon/food truck frequents there to cater to the nursery workers.
UPDATE: 6/29/19 11:40AM From comments, there’s some question as to whether this is “the station” or not. Regardless, the station shown above is in fact poorly sited. I’ll do more checking this evening. -Anthony
UPDATE2: 6/29/19 11:56AM It seems that it may not even be an “all time record”.

Next month, President Obama is scheduled to attend a climate summit hosted by United Nations Secretary‐​General Ban Ki‐​moon to “galvanize and catalyze climate action.” Undoubtedly, Obama will be touting recent successes in the policy arena of climate change and urging world leaders to follow our lead.



Well, perhaps _successes_ ought to be in quotes.



In actuality, the “successes” have only come in the form of proposed regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (which were basically commanded by the White House) and from other Executive Orders. In other words, President Obama is pretty much acting as a one man wrecking crew when it comes to breaking the impasse on actions geared towards mitigating climate change by restricting greenhouse gas emissions.





What’s to be gained by “taking the lead” on climate change?



Which begs the question, is this really what Americans want?



What’s to be gained by “taking the lead” on climate change, anyway?



It turns out to be very little. In fact, it may actually be detrimental.



The U.S. is not at particularly large risk from climate change. The Obama Administration’s Interagency Working Group tasked with establishing the social cost of carbon (SCC)—a loosely constrained and readily gamed estimate of how much future damage accrues from today’s carbon dioxide emissions—determined that the SCC for the U.S. was only a few dollars per emitted ton of CO2. And that number was calculated using models that, as shown by a growing body of scientific research, produce too much warming and too little agricultural benefit from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Accounting for these inaccuracies drops the “social cost of carbon” in the U.S. close to zero (perhaps even becoming negative, that is, carbon dioxide emissions may actually provide a net benefit to the economy).



But such information is carefully concealed in Obama Administration reports, such as the one issued recently by the Council of Economic Advisors that predicts escalating costs the longer we delay serious climate change mitigation efforts. Instead of focusing on domestic costs of climate change, the report is built around an estimation of the _global_ cost for carbon dioxide emissions—which, by the Administration’s numbers—is some 4 to 14 times greater on a per ton of emitted CO2 basis than those projected for the U.S.



Why should the President’s rush to restrict U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, which even his own officials say raises concerns about domestic energy costs and grid reliability, be justified upon supposed benefits which will largely accrue to foreign nations?



The Council of Economic Advisors report clarifies:



Climate change is a global problem, and it will require strong international leadership to secure cooperation among both developed and developing countries to solve it. America must help forge a truly global solution to this global challenge by galvanizing international action to significantly reduce emissions.



This explains why Obama is headed to New York.



But he must know that all he’ll be able to accomplish, even in the best case, will simply be lip service to his urgings.



First, where “taking the lead” on climate change has been tried in _developed_ countries, politicians responsible for it often find themselves seeking other employment. When the Democrat‐​controlled U.S. House of Representative tried to take the lead and passed cap‐​and‐​trade legislation during the summer of 2009, its make‐​up turned over in the succeeding 2010 election. In Australia, since 2009, three political leaders, including two Prime Ministers were ousted over their support of schemes to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the latest being Julia Gillard, who just this past June was voted out over her carbon tax (the Australian Parliament repealed the carbon tax in July.)



Second, current‐​generation renewable technologies are insufficient to meet the energy needs at the pace that _developing_ countries (like China and India) would like to develop. Considering that opinion polls show that “climate change” ranks low among priorities of the U.S. populous, imagine where it must rank in countries with large populations with little to no access to electricity.



So even if the President sees heads nodding along when he is speaking at the climate summit, it is unlikely that anything concrete—with lasting and demonstrable effects on the climate—will (or can) result.



So where does that leave us?



Leading on an issue which increasingly science says is overblown, one with few willing and able followers, and one that will produce few tangible results—results that, as far as the U.S. economy is concerned, may even prove negative.



Thanks, but no thanks, Mr. President.

"WASHINGTON  —   The speed of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act has stunned health industry lobbyists, leaving representatives of insurance companies, hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical makers in disarray and struggling for a response to a legislative quick strike that would upend much of the American health care system. The Senate is expected to take the first step by Thursday morning, approving parliamentary language in a budget resolution that would   a repeal bill that could not be filibustered in the Senate. House and Senate committees would have until Jan. 27 to report out repeal legislation. Health insurance and health care for millions of Americans are at risk. But far from reflecting the magnitude of the moment, the most prominent message from lobbyists that lawmakers saw in their first week back at work was a narrowly focused advertisement from the U. S. Chamber of Commerce demanding the repeal of “Obamacare taxes,” especially an annual fee imposed on health insurance companies to help pay for the expansion of coverage under the health law. “More than 20 million people could lose their health insurance, and states could lose billions of dollars in Medicaid money,” said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. But, he added, many health care executives “don’t want to get on the wrong side of the new administration or the Republican majority in Congress. ” Health care professionals are not totally silent, but industries that were integral to the creation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 are keeping their voices down as Republicans rush to dismantle it. Some Republican lawmakers are openly fretting about their leaders’ repeal strategy, saying they must develop an Affordable Care Act replacement before they repeal it. Five Republican senators proposed on Monday to extend the deadline for drafting repeal legislation by five weeks, until March 3. One of the five, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, said the extra time would allow Congress and the Trump administration to “get the policy right” as they try to arrange a smooth transition to a new system of health coverage. But the naysayers are getting no cover from a major lobbying and advertisement blitz like the ones that blanketed the airwaves in 2009 and 2010. To block the repeal effort, said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, “we need two or three Republicans to join us. ” Doctors are telling Congress to proceed with caution, insisting that no one should lose coverage. The American College of Physicians, representing 148, 000 specialists in internal medicine, has sent letters to senators urging them to “vote no” this week on the budget resolution. Hospitals were expecting to receive tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue for treating people who were newly insured under the health law, and they are alarmed at the prospect that it may now be repealed. But, they say, if Congress goes ahead and rolls back the expansion of coverage, it must also restore tens of billions of dollars that the health law cut from Medicare payments to hospitals. Top executives from state hospital associations will fly to Washington this week to develop their strategy. Many also plan to visit offices on Capitol Hill, where they will warn of the potential damage if Congress repeals the health law without guaranteeing similar coverage for those who would lose it. A coalition of consumers and liberal advocacy groups is spending more than $2 million on television advertisements urging Congress to stop its attack on the law. The ads, by the Alliance for Healthcare Security, are aimed at a handful of Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, Lamar Alexander and Mr. Corker of Tennessee, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. But by Washington standards, that is a pittance. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry lobbying group, set aside $150 million in 2009 to support the law’s passage. Some lobbyists have tacitly accepted the likelihood that major provisions of the health law will be repealed, setting their sights instead on shaping its replacement. They fear that if they come out strongly in opposition to repealing the law, they will lose their seats at the table as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration negotiate a replacement. For now, passage of the budget resolution this week looks likely. The real fight is expected to come two to three weeks from now, when two House committees and two Senate committees produce legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and must answer to Republicans who say a replacement measure must be ready at the same time. At least a   Republican senators have expressed doubts about the Republican leadership strategy of using the budget resolution to   legislation to repeal the law, with a delayed effective date to allow time to find a replacement in the future. “Repeal and replacement should take place simultaneously,” Mr. Corker said last week. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on MSNBC, “It would not be the right path for us to repeal Obamacare without laying out a path forward. ” Members of the   House Freedom Caucus are also pressing leaders to embrace a replacement bill before they eviscerate the existing law. And that concern is not confined to Congress. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, has also warned Congress against repealing the law without a replacement. What, he has asked, will happen to the 700, 000 people who have gained coverage under the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio? Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said that he spoke on Friday with   Donald J. Trump, and that Mr. Trump agreed a replacement measure must be ready. “I think he consistently has said, and I think many people who look at this say, ‘Gosh, you’re going to repeal this huge, dramatic thing and not have a replacement on the same day? ’” Mr. Paul said on Monday. “I mean, doesn’t make a lot of sense to do that. ” Many of the lobbyists who might have slowed the process appear flummoxed, in part because they were expecting Hillary Clinton to win the election. Some companies, anxious about changes in health policy, said they were afraid to speak out because they feared that Mr. Trump would attack them on Twitter, as he has badgered Boeing, Ford, General Motors, Lockheed Martin and Toyota. Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of the leading lobby for insurers, America’s Health Insurance Plans, is in a particularly awkward position. As an Obama administration official from 2010 to 2015, she led work on the health law, issued rules to carry it out and often defended it on Capitol Hill. In December 2015, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin pointed to her as an example of how federal officials passed through a revolving door to work for companies they once regulated. “If the insurance industry does not understand how Obamacare works, why not hire the person who ran it?” Mr. Ryan said in a gibe at Ms. Tavenner that drew laughter from his audience at the Library of Congress. Ms. Tavenner said the requirement for people to have insurance  —   the individual mandate  —   was likely to be eliminated. But, she said, to stabilize the market, Congress should maintain “subsidies for   and   individuals to purchase insurance and financial help for plans that enroll   individuals, through at least Jan. 1, 2019. ” She is also asking Congress to kill the tax on insurers, which has already been suspended for 2017. Kaiser Permanente, the managed care company that serves more than 10 million people, declined to comment specifically on Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Instead, it offered a statement of general principles saying that people should have access to health care and that “we must continue to accommodate those who have   conditions. ” George C. Halvorson, a former chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, said insurers were guarded in their comments because the current environment was “extremely politicized. ” He predicted they have more to say when Congress turns to the task of devising a replacement for the law. “You need to make your point when it will have optimal impact,” Mr. Halvorson said. Lobbyists for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association have been more active and outspoken. They support changes to the health care law because, they say, premiums and deductibles are too high and commercial insurers have been dropping out of the public insurance marketplaces.   of counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage in the marketplace, they say, and in many cases, it is a Blue Cross plan. But Blue Cross lobbyists expressed alarm that Congress or a federal court might eliminate the   subsidies that the government pays insurers to reduce    costs for   people. Without these payments, Blue Cross wrote in a primer delivered to congressional offices, consumers will see “significant premium increases in 2018, making coverage even more unaffordable for millions of working Americans. ” While defenders of the Affordable Care Act try to figure out a strategy, conservative groups are pressing hard for full repeal of the law as soon as possible. Among them are Heritage Action for America, an offshoot of the Heritage Foundation, and Freedom Partners, a conservative group backed by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch."
"Evidence Trumps the Phony Consensus.
We are lectured monotonously about the “consensus” that carbon dioxide produced by human activities is “highly likely to cause dangerous global warming”. The alarmist computer models are all based on this assumption, with predicted warming multiplied by also assuming strong positive feedbacks.
A consensus of opinion never determines a scientific question – real proof depends on evidence and logic. Consensus is a tool of politics and a guidepost for lemmings.

[We and the cartoon creator, Steve Hunter, have full rights to this cartoon, and grant permission for anyone to reproduce it in any media as long as the Steve Hunter signature remains on it. For electronic media, the source link should also be displayed.]
The so-called “Greenhouse Effect” depends entirely on the known property of carbon dioxide gas to intercept radiant heat in certain wavelengths. This process starts operating as soon as the extra gas enters the atmosphere.
If this influence is strong enough to drive “dangerous global warming”, its effect should be noticeable even in the short term, with Earth’s surface temperature increasing in step with increasing carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing for over a century, but global temperatures have fluctuated in broad cycles decades long, and the temperature trend has been flat for the last 17 years.
This evidence suggests that increasing carbon dioxide is not a major driver for dangerous global warming, no matter what the consensus says – even if a million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.
We may still get natural global warming, as the vast restless oceans roll over or the solar cycles change, but man-made carbon dioxide is not driving these processes. Moreover, a bit of warming is not our greatest risk – history shows that ice ages extinguish more species and habitats than warm eras.
The consensus of alarmists is trying to lynch an innocent party.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).



Generally, the biggest (recognized) sources of uncertainty in climate projections involve cloud processes. Compared to climate model resolution, clouds are small on both spatial and temporal scales. Further, there is much we don’t understand about clouds themselves, and especially the human influences on them.



One particularly vexing aspect of cloud processes which is neither well understood nor well modeled involves how anthropogenic aerosol emissions (i.e., particulate matter or its precursors such as sulfate and black carbon) alters them. The ways in which aerosols influence cloud properties are collectively known as the aerosol _indirect_ effects on climate. The _direct_ effect of aerosols, which includes blocking and scattering radiation from the sun (and the earth) is another forest of unknowns.



Consider how the climate impact of aerosols has been handled by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Up until their most‐​recent (2007) “Fourth Assessment Report” (aka, “AR4”), the IPCC offered no “best estimate” for the magnitude of climate change resulting from the direct and indirect aerosol effects. Instead, a large range of possibilities was presented. According to the IPCC’s 2001 “Third Assessment Report” (TAR), when considered together, the net impact from aerosols was causing climate cooling, but the range for the estimated magnitude of the cooling was so large as to include the possibility of entirely offsetting the warming from the total of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Needless to say the IPCC assessed the “level of scientific understanding” of the climate change from aerosols as “low” to “very low.”



Climate scientists anticipate the climate impacts from aerosols by assessing the pressure that aerosol emissions put on global temperature through a quantity called “radiative forcing.” Radiative forcing is a measure of the change in earth‐​directed radiation as a result of the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. It is measured in Watts/​square meter. If the radiative forcing is negative, then, everything else being equal, aerosols will cool lower atmospheric temperatures. Positive forcing changes create warming. It is generally assumed that the surface temperature response is about 0.75 degrees Celsius per additional Watt per square meter of positive radiative forcing. The current “forcing” from all the anthropogenerated greenhouse gases is estimated by the IPCC to be around 3 Watts/​square meter, which, at equilibrium, would yield about 2.25°C of warming, something that obviously has not happened. And so, for nearly twenty years, the search has been on to try to determine why warming has been so pokey. The debate usually centers about the role of aerosols and whether or not increasing carbon dioxide will create more or less cloud‐​related warming.



For what it is worth (and after you read on, you may conclude, “not much”), the AR4 IPCC report gives a “best estimate” for the aerosol direct effect of -0.50 Watts/​square meter, and an aerosol indirect effect of -0.70 W/​m2. The actual ranges were -0.1 to -0.9 W/​m2, and +0/4 to -1.1 W/​m2, respectively. The “best estimate” is that overall cooling from aerosols should be about 0.9°C.



Recent research has only made things murkier. In a recent issue of the _Journal of Climate_ , a team led by Dr. Steven Ghan of the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNNL}, plugged an aerosol module into the widely used “Community Atmosphere Model” (version 5), from the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder. They compared model results using a background (“control”) level of aerosols to the current atmospheric aerosol load.



[Note here the peculiar process of “model‐​to‐​model” comparisons. This is only valid if the models themselves comport properly with reality, which readers of _The Current Wisdom_ know to be highly debatable]



What they found was rather interesting.



As for the direct effect from aerosols (again, that is from the direct reflection or absorption of incoming solar or outgoing terrestrial radiation by aerosols particles), Ghan et al. find that the net global climate forcing is very near _zero._ That is, they neither warm nor cool the lower atmosphere.



However, while Ghan et al. found that the _direct_ climate forcing from aerosols was more positive (warmer) than the IPCC AR4 “best estimate”, Ghan et al. found that the _indirect_ climate forcing from aerosols was more negative (cooler) than the IPCC AR4 best estimate. It total, in Ghan’s et al.’s model, changes to cloud characteristics induced by aerosol emissions led to a net climate forcing of -1.47 W/​m2 +/- 0.11 W/​m2—a value which is substantially more negative than the IPCC AR4’s best guess of -0.7 W/​m2 with a range of +0.4 to -1.1 W/​m2. As was the case for the direct climate forcing, the indirect climate forcing in the newest NCAR model lies outside the 5 to 95% confidence range of the IPCC AR4 estimates.



Think about that the next time you hear about the IPCC and the “scientific consensus”!



Before we get lost in climate models, perhaps a bit of reality should intrude, as can be found in a paper in press at _Journal of Geophysical Research_ , by Minghuai Wang and another team, also from PNNL.



Wang used data collected from the satellites that make up the A‐​train satellite constellation (http://​en​.wikipedia​.org/​w​i​k​i​/​A​-​t​r​a​i​n​_​(​s​a​t​e​l​l​i​t​e​_​c​o​n​s​t​e​l​l​ation)) to compare observed cloud and precipitation properties with those from cloud models, including the CAM5 model investigated by Ghan et al.



The A‐​train constellation of satellites provides many different types of observations of a location taken from different satellites at virtually the same time. From this array of data, the researchers determined how often it rained from warm marine clouds and what effect the concentration of aerosols had on the chance of rain. They found that the probability of precipitation declined as the aerosol loading in the clouds increased. In other words, high aerosol loadings suppressed precipitation which in turn leads to a longer lived cloud which thus reflects away a greater amount of incoming solar radiation than it would otherwise (producing a negative climate forcing, i.e., cooling). This finding in and of itself is not new, as this “cloud lifetime effect” has been known to for some time.



However, what it new and important, is that the observed degree to which aerosols suppress precipitation was found by Wang et al. to be much less than that which is calculated by the cloud/​aerosol schemes in the climate model. This means that the widely‐​used Community Atmospheric model is producing a greater indirect aerosol effect (i.e., more cooling) than the observations show.



Wang also looked at two other models and found similar results.



Factoring this lower cooling effect from aerosols into the model results reported by Ghan et al., reduces the total (direct + indirect) climate forcing from aerosols to about -1 W/​m2—a value that is about 15% lower in magnitude than the IPCC AR4 best estimate of -1.2W/m2. This would suggest that the net cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosol emissions is less than expected and thus so too must be the net warming effect from anthropogenic GHG emissions (in order for everything to balance out)—in other words, the climate sensitivity is lower than the models portray.



Whew! We finally get to our repeating meme here at _The Current Wisdom_ —that global warming, while real, is being overestimated because of systematic errors that are propagating through climate science.



But, we want to caution about jumping to any firm conclusions here. The biggest thing evident in these new research papers is that the level of scientific understanding of aerosols and clouds is still quite low.



Bear this in mind next time you hear about how anthropogenic GHG emissions are impacting (or expected to impact) some aspect of the weather/​climate.

Southern Ocean/SE Pacific (SSTs)
The Medieval Warm Period (1100 years BP) was 1.5°C warmer than today (14°C vs. 12.5°C) in the SE Pacific or Southern Ocean.
Collins et al., 2019

Antarctica/Southern Ocean (SSTs)
Elephant seals used to breed on the Victoria Land Coast ~1000 years ago because there was open water access back then whereas this region is locked in sea ice today. To escape the reach of modern sea ice, elephant seal breeding colonies are now located ~2,400 km further north (sub-Antarctic islands) of where they bred during Medieval times.
Koch et al., 2019

Peru coastal region (SSTs)
There has been a rapid drop (approximately -1°C to -1.5°C) in sea surface temperatures during the last 50 years near the coast of Peru. 1-2°C warmer temperatures persisted ~1,000 years ago and there were 4°C warmer temperatures during the Mid-Holocene in this region.
Salvatteci et al., 2019

Canadian Arctic (SSTs)
During the Medieval Warm Period, bowhead whales occupied Canadian Arctic waters that are today sea ice-covered and inaccessible. During the Mid-Holocene (5000 to 3000 years ago), bowhead whales swam in the open-water Canadian Arctic.
Szpak et al., 2019

Endangered Przewalski horses have become extinct in the wild. Photo: AP
Preservationists think that Herculean efforts should be made to preserve every dying species.
Attempting to preserve environments of the past, they lock up land, sea and mineral resources, prohibit development and oppose water conservation. And now, in a vain attempt to preserve the climate of the recent past, they are crippling our energy supplies with futile mandates and taxes designed to force-feed “green energy”.
They should engage in preservation activities at their own cost with their own property, but should not use governments to force society down this risky road.

Admitted fraudster Peter Gleick rewrites history. Rewriting appears to be in his blood.

You mean when I worked with a whistle-blower to reveal the dark money funding being used by climate deniers to produce pseudoscience for young school children and policymakers? Yes.
— Peter Gleick (@PeterGleick) May 29, 2019

The link in the twitter conversation doesn’t work, I believe this is the correct one.
https://dailycaller.com/2018/11/09/carl-sagan-prize-conservative-think-tank-scientist/
And more background:
http://fakegate.org/
Gleick eventually confessed to being the ‘insider’ and explained that he had stolen the identity of another person – a member of Heartland’s board of directors, it soon became known – in order to steal the confidential documents. There was no ‘leak.’ Gleick also admitted to lying about the nature of one document he originally claimed had come from Heartland, a ‘strategy memo’ that purported to describe Heartland’s plans to address climate change in the coming year. That document was quickly shown to be a fake, written to misrepresent and defame The Heartland Institute. Gleick denied he was the author of the fake memo.
There are dozens of stories on “Fakegate”  on WUWT, most tagged fakegate but here are some good overviews.

https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/02/20/breaking-gleick-confesses/
See also Andy Revkin’s DotEarth here. Revkin writes:
Now, Gleick has admitted to an act that leaves his reputation in ruins and threatens to undercut the cause he spent so much time pursuing. His summary, just published on his blog at Huffington Post,
(Added 7:25PM PST) One way or the other, Gleick’s use of deception in pursuit of his cause after years of calling out climate deception has destroyed his credibility and harmed others. (Some of the released documents contain information about Heartland employees that has no bearing on the climate fight.) That is his personal tragedy and shame (and I’m sure devastating for his colleagues, friends and family).
And many here may not know, it was our very own Steven Mosher who deduced the fraudster was Gleick, based on an analyses of  the forged strategy document.
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/02/21/megan-mcardle-gives-mosher-and-the-blogosphere-props-for-pointing-to-gleick/
If you want to look for the author of the fake memo, then look for somebody who tweets the word “anti-climate”. you’ll find it. Look for somebody on the west coast ( the time zone the document was scanned in)
You’ll find somebody who doesn’t know how to use parenthesis or commas, both in this memo and in other things he has written.
you’ll find he mentions himself in the memo
that’s all the clues for now. of course its all just speculation. Note, he’s not tweeted for a couple days. very rare for him.
In closing, here is a picture of a sign posted in all Heartland offices.  Feel free to ask Peter Gleick if there is any equivalent posted at the Pacific Institute.

Opinion by Anthony Watts, originally published on Townhall,com
From 1947 to today, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, keepers of the “doomsday clock”—a holdover from the atomic age and Cold War—has predicted doom by moving the hands of a prop clock closer to or further away from midnight. Midnight represents a global doom disaster in progress.
In a breathless press release on January 23, which included a cameo from former California governor and climate activist Jerry Brown, the group announced that due to “climate change,” the world is 20 seconds closer to midnight, standing at 100 seconds (1 minute 40 seconds) before midnight.

Photo by Lexey Swall Photography, courtesy of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
The scientists announced:
Civilization-ending nuclear war—whether started by design, blunder, or simple miscommunication—is a genuine possibility. Climate change that could devastate the planet is undeniably happening. And for a variety of reasons that include a corrupted and manipulated media environment, democratic governments and other institutions that should be working to address these threats have failed to rise to the challenge.
In essence, they are saying nuclear war and climate change are equivalent threats. Such a comparison is mind-bogglingly ridiculous.
Consider that climate change has no “hair trigger” like nuclear catastrophe does. Some despot or dictator who obtains a nuclear weapon is entirely different from the slow change of climate over 100 years.
Yet, these supposedly learned scientists have embraced the hype of “climate emergency” as if it was on par with a nuclear hair trigger. Lamenting the lack of action and interest in climate change, they write:
Lip service continued, with some governments now echoing many scientists’ use of the term “climate emergency.” But the policies and actions that governments proposed were hardly commensurate to an emergency. Exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels continues to grow.
Because all governments don’t sense an “emergency” and have not pulled the plug on electricity grids powered by fossil fuels, the Atomic Scientists are in despair.
They would actually like us to believe that we are presently in more danger of global apocalypse than during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Really? Ask yourself this: Do you feel like climate change may burn your town to a crisp any day now? Do we need to implement “duck and cover” exercises for school kids in case the boogeyman of climate change sweeps down and attacks a city?
The threat comparison between nuclear war and climate change is patently absurd—there’s really no other way to describe it.
Interestingly, it wasn’t until 2007 that “climate change” became a main target on the radar of the atomic scientists. That was one year after Al Gore released his widely viewed scary movie known as An Inconvenient Truth. Since then, “climate change” has been listed as a doomsday factor in each of the eight clock adjustments.
It’s almost as if they swapped one boogeyman for another. Yet, look at the history of the doomsday clock:
Click to enlarge
Comparing “climate change” to the intensity of all the other threats, it seems completely out of place and of far less magnitude and urgency. Despite 73 years of predicting doomsday proximity, it has never materialized.
So again, with such a track record, ask yourself: Do you feel more threatened by nuclear Armageddon, or the possibility that it might be a little bit warmer next year?

From EURATIV
By Sam Morgan | EURACTIV.com
 Jan 28, 2020 (updated:  2:29)
The EU could deploy a carbon border tax against the UK after Brexit, according to the head of the European Parliament’s environment committee, if Westminster diverges from bloc rules on issues like carbon markets.
French MEP Pascal Canfin told reporters on Monday (27 January) that the EU “should be tough” and “shouldn’t be afraid of an economic no-deal in December”, as the next round of Brexit-based negotiations loom on the horizon.
The talks will determine what sort of relationship the UK and EU will have after the transition period ends on 31 December and Canfin made clear that divergence from bloc rules will make trade relations more difficult.
“Talks haven’t started on the right path, with the UK government saying it wants full [single market] access but also divergence. To me that is like the EU asking for full alignment but with quotas,” the lawmaker warned.
As head of the Parliament’s environment committee (ENVI), Canfin will help advise negotiators on related issues during the talks, citing carbon markets as a tangible example of where difficulties might arise.
The UK is currently a part of the EU’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) but the government plans to leave the carbon market and set up its own carbon-pricing equivalent. Canfin told reporters that “the markets have to have the same price”.
“For the EU’s industry, you can’t accept that the UK has full access” to the EU’s single market while a lower carbon price is on offer across the Channel, he insisted.
UK government documents from 2018 suggest that a British equivalent would add up to around €35 per tonne, while the EU ETS currently trades at roughly €25, although the price is expected to increase as new green policies are signed and delivered.
“We started designing the carbon border adjustment mechanism. We might imagine that we will apply this mechanism to the UK in order to restore the level playing field,” Canfin suggested, referring to a new tool aimed at preventing ‘climate dumping’.
The Renew Europe MEP also cited carbon markets when asked if the UK would only be expected to accept EU laws as they stand on the day a new trade deal is signed or if it would have to comply with updates and reviews, known as ‘dynamic alignment’.
Canfin replied that “for the EU team, it’s about no-regression clauses, so you can’t diverge regarding current EU law”, adding that updates to climate rules like the ETS will soon be on the cards with the new Green Deal agenda presented by the European Commission last month.
Full story here.

The U.S. is not in the driver’s seat when it comes to charting the future course of global climate change that may result from carbon dioxide emitted by human activities. That seat is occupied by the world’s developing countries, with large populations seeking to improve their standard of living through better access to energy. The world’s developed countries, like the U.S., have been relegated to the backseat. And like most backseat drivers, they may think that they exert some influence, but mostly they are powerless and annoying.





The U.S. can spin its imaginary steering wheel and stomp on its imaginary brake all it wants, but those actions won’t change the direction or the speed of approach of the climate changes that are to come.



The U.S. can spin its imaginary steering wheel and stomp on its imaginary brake all it wants, but those actions won’t change the direction or the speed of approach of the climate changes that are to come.



Case in point: The mid‐​range estimate from the latest United Nations’ climate assessment report is that the earth’s average temperature will rise by about 2.2 degrees Celsius between now and the end of this century. The same computerized climate models used to make those projections indicate that the U.S.‘s contribution to that rise is about 0.14 C. But even this minor amount may be an overestimate.



A collection of scientific evidence has been published recently that suggests that these computer models predict too much warming from greenhouse gas emissions. Over the past 25 years, for example, the earth only warmed up about half as much as was predicted to have occurred by the climate models. So the 0.14 C is probably closer to 0.10 C.



That value — one tenth of a degree — is the most climate change that the Obama administration and the Environmental Protection Agency would be able to mitigate even if they were able to eliminate 100 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal‐​fired power plants and from everything else as well, including cars, trucks, lawnmowers, backyard propane grills, home furnaces, natural gas electrical plants and on and on. No matter how successful they are in reducing emissions, the impact on the weather and the climate from global to local scales, will be scientifically undetectable and environmentally meaningless.



The only way that the EPA’s emissions limits will have any climatic impact at all will be if they engender new, carbon‐​free energy producing technologies that are reliable, safe and widely adopted. There is no guarantee that these particular regulations will lead to those outcomes. Nor is it clear that government involvement is the best way forward.



But in the meantime, Americans will have their energy choice limited, their pocketbooks lightened, the reliability of their energy supply threatened and more government intervention in their lives.



Undoubtedly, the climate road ahead will be a bumpy one, marred by strong hurricanes, major floods, prolonged heat waves and rising seas. The degree to which such occurrences will be marked by our own hand may never be known. Nature is pretty good at roughening the road on its own. But one thing that we can be sure of is that any attempt by the EPA to mitigate these effects through carbon dioxide emissions restrictions will be negligible at best — at least to the climate.

"**Farmers have accused the media of unbalanced reporting on the impact eating meat has on the environment.**
Meat Promotion Wales said online carbon calculators measuring the impact food choices often fail to make allowances for where the meat is sourced.
Wrexham beef farmer Cheryl Reeves said ""propaganda"" was damaging the industry.
But vegan chef and Dirty Sanchez star Matt Pritchard said: ""People always say 'we're really looking after our cows' but you're still killing it.""
Farming has faced criticism for damaging the environment via methane emissions from belching livestock, deforestation, water shortages and agricultural pollution.
In September, the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales (NFU) launched a plan to make British agriculture carbon neutral in 20 years with measures including applying farm chemicals more precisely using satellite technology, capturing methane from manure to heat people's homes and changing the diets of sheep and cattle so they do not belch so much methane.
Mrs Reeves, who rears about 200 calves a year at her farm near Bangor-on-Dee, said she was passionate about teaching the public about the agricultural industry and believed people could eat meat in a sustainable way.
""If you buy British you aren't impacting the environment as much as people think you are,"" she said.
""The media shows images of calves in crates and they portray negative propaganda of calves being snatched from their mothers.
""We as British farmers have the health and wellbeing of all our animals at the forefront of our daily routines and our standards are the highest across the globe.
""People need educating on our high standards. British farmers cannot sell their produce to supermarkets without being audited annually by a Red Tractor inspector, this is all to benefit the end consumer and to make sure we as farmers have the best interest of the animal's health and well-being.""
She said her business worked with a dairy farmer based 400 metres away and her animals were taken to abattoirs within 30 miles (48km), with the closest being four miles (6km) away.
She does not think the recent interest in veganism will last: ""I think it's a trend and it will pass. Supermarkets are promoting it because it's fashionable at the moment. They've jumped on the bandwagon.
""I have no problem with someone who doesn't want to eat meat, but I'm not so keen on people who say they're a vegan for fashionable reasons as they don't look at the bigger picture.""
Pritchard, host of BBC vegan cookery show Dirty Vegan, said after getting a pet dog several years ago he found himself thinking: ""Why am I eating meat when I love animals so much?
""I haven't eaten a dead animal for years - I'm perfectly fine, breathing, healthy. I went vegan for the animals. A lot do it for the environment, a lot do it for health, a lot for the animals - each to their own.
""If it stops the slaughter of animals I'm all for it. I'm not one to tell others what to do - I'll tell you why I don't eat meat and if you decide to listen to me, happy days"".
He is indifferent on whether the media is biased when it comes to veganism: ""Some are going to slate vegans and some will slate meat eaters, that's their decision.""
But Meat Promotion Wales claims vegan diets receive far more coverage than their popularity warrants.
Chief executive Gwyn Howells said: ""We respect the fact that people make their own dietary decisions for a range of personal reasons, however it's vital that the media doesn't distort the debate, and helps people to make informed choices.
""Welsh lamb and Welsh beef is overwhelmingly reared in non-intensive ways and fed on natural grass. It's a world away from systems abroad which often have a much more destructive environmental impact.
""In terms of water resources, for instance, the media and campaign groups sometimes say that it takes 15,000 litres to produce a kilo of beef, whereas research into sustainable grass-based production systems say the figure can be as little as 221 litres, which is lower than many plant-based foods."""
"Earth has only three significant sources of energy.
First is geothermal energy from Earth’s molten core and decaying radioactive minerals in Earth’s crust. This energy moves continents, powers volcanoes and its heat migrates towards the crust, warming the lithosphere and the deep oceans. It can be harvested successfully in favourable locations, and radioactive minerals can be extracted to provide large amounts of reliable heat for power generation.
Second is energy stored in combustible hydrocarbon minerals such as coal, oil, gas, tar sands and oil shale. These all store solar and geothermal energy collected eons ago and they are the primary energy sources supporting the modern world and its large and growing populations.
Third are radiation and gravitational energies from the Sun and Moon which are captured by the biosphere as heat, winds, tides, rain, rivers and in biomass such as forests, crops and animals. These are the natural “Green” energies that support all processes of life and still support a peasant existence for some peoples.
Green zealots believe that we can and should run modern societies exclusively on “Green” energies, and they have embarked on a war on hydrocarbons. They need to be told that their green energy favourites are just stealing from the biosphere – they are not as green as they claim.

The most obvious example is the ethanol industry which takes food crops like corn, sugar and palm oil and uses heaps of water and a lot of hydrocarbon energy to convert them to ethanol alcohol which will burn in internal combustion engines, but has less energy density than petrol.
See: The Water and Corn costs to produce Ethanol:
http://gazette.Com/the-water-and-corn-cost-for-a-gallon-of-ethanol/article/1506579
This process is replacing natural grasslands and forests with artificial monocultures.
The latest stupid ethanol suggestion is to power Obama’s “wanna-be-green” US Pacific Fleet using Queensland food crops. Feeding ethanol to the engines of the US Navy would consume far more food than was used feeding hay and grain to the thousands of horses used to move our artillery and Light Horse Brigades in the Great War. Sailors in the British Navy got much of their energy from Jamaican Rum, but the American navy will not run on Queensland ethanol whiskey.
More: World turning against Biofuels:
http://www.cfact.org/2014/06/02/a-world-turning-against-biofuels/
Biomass is a fancy name for plant material and vegetable trash which, if maintained in/on the soil, will provide the fertility for the next crop. Burning it reduces the humus that maintains fertile soil. The ultimate biomass stupidity is to harvest American forests, pelletise them, dry them and ship them across the Atlantic (all using hydrocarbon fuels) to burn in a UK power station. Burning biomass produces the same emission gases as coal.
Most plants will not grow without energy from the sun. Solar arrays steal energy directly from the biosphere. Some incoming solar energy is reflected to space by the panels, some is converted to waste heat on the panels, and some is converted to electricity – much of which ends up as waste heat. Solar radiation that could have given energy to growing plants is largely returned to the atmosphere as waste heat and much is then lost to space.
Some solar farms are built over land that is already a desert – the rest create their own deserts in their shadow. Because solar energy is very dilute, very large areas of land must be shaded and sterilised by the panels in order to collect significant energy.
Solar radiation also evaporates water from the oceans and provides the energy for rain, winds and storms. Much of this moisture falls as useful rain when the winds penetrate land masses. Wind turbines create artificial obstacles to the wind, reducing its velocity and thus tending to create more rain near the coast and rain shadows behind the turbine walls. And they chop up many birds and bats. Again, green energy harms the biosphere.

Hydro power is one of the few green energy sources that is “grid ready” and can supply economical reliable energy. So, naturally, many greens are opposed to it. However, in most places there is competition for fresh water for domestic uses, irrigation, industry and environmental flow. Hydro power is just one more competitor for this valuable green resource.
So… Green energy is not so green after all. It reduces the supply of food, water and energy available to all life on earth, and it often consumes large amounts of hydrocarbon energy for its manufacture, construction, maintenance and backup.
Green advocates are enemies of the poor. They want to burn their food, waste their water and deny them access to cheap reliable energy.
Hydrocarbon fuels are the true green energy sources. They disturb less land per unit of energy produced, they do not murder wildlife, and their combustion produces new supplies of water and carbon dioxide for the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere enables plants to grow faster, bigger and more able to cope with heat or drought.
It was coal, and later oil, which created and still largely supports the populations, prosperity and industry of developed nations. With a backdrop of freedom under the law, they can do the same for the whole world.
Those professing concern for the poor need to realise that Green Energy steals from the biosphere and that hydrocarbons are the real friends of the poor.
Finally, those who have swallowed the carbon dioxide scare should be told that nuclear energy is the most reliable and least damaging “low carbon” option.

"Anti-fossil fuel SCC (Social Cost of Carbon) relies on garbage models, ignores carbon benefits and hurts the poor. 
By Paul Driessen and Roger Bezdek 
“If you could pick just one thing to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy,” Bill Gates has said. “Access to energy is absolutely fundamental in the struggle against poverty,” World Bank VP Rachel Kyte and Nobel Prize Laureate Dr. Amartya Sen agree.
The UN Development Program also calls energy “central to poverty reduction.” And International Energy Agency Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol notes that “coal is raising living standards and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.” In fact, all fossil fuels are doing so.
Indeed, fossil fuels created the modern world and the housing, transportation, other technologies and living standards so many of us take for granted. They are essential for electricity and life, and over the past 250 years they more than doubled average life expectancy in countries that took advantage of them.
But the Obama Administration and radical environmentalists despise fossil fuels and used every tactic they could devise to eliminate them. One of their most important schemes was the “social cost of carbon.”

Federal agencies used the SCC to calculate the “hidden costs” of carbon dioxide emissions associated with fossil fuel use, by assigning a dollar value to every ton of CO2 emitted by power plants, factories, homes, vehicles and other sources. However, the entire process was little more than junk science and Garbage In-Garbage Out forecasting. 
First, each ton of U.S. emissions averted would initially have prevented a hypothetical $25/ton in global societal costs allegedly resulting from dangerous man-made climate change: less coastal flooding and tropical disease, fewer droughts and extreme weather events, for example. But within three years regulators arbitrarily increased the SCC to around $40/ton.
That made it easier to justify the Clean Power Plan, Paris climate agreement, and countless Obama Era actions on electricity generation, fracking, methane, pipelines, vehicle mileage and appliance efficiency standards, livestock operations, carbon taxes, and wind, solar and biofuel mandates and subsidies. 
Second, the supposed bedrock for the concept is the now rapidly shifting sands of climate chaos theory. New questions are arising almost daily about data quality and manipulation, the degree to which carbon dioxide affects global temperatures, the complex interplay of solar, cosmic ray, oceanic and other natural forces, and the inability of computer models to predict temperatures, sea level rise or hurricanes. 
Meanwhile, as the 2015-16 El Nino dissipated, average global temperatures rapidly fell back almost to their 1998-2014 level, according to Britain’s Met Office and other experts. That means there has been no measurable planetary warming for 18 years. Nor are other predicted disasters happening in the real world. 
That means the very notion that U.S. emissions impose major climate costs is increasingly indefensible. Moreover, developing nations are burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide at many times the U.S. rate; that means even eliminating their use in America would have no effect on atmospheric CO2 levels. 
Third, the SCC scheme blames American emissions for supposed costs worldwide (even though U.S. CO2 emissions are declining each year). It incorporates almost every conceivable cost of oil, gas and coal use on crops, forests, coastal cities, property damage, “forced migration,” and human health, nutrition and disease. However, it utterly fails to mention, much less analyze, tremendous and obvious carbon benefits.
That violates a 1993 Bill Clinton executive order requiring that federal agencies assess both benefits and costs of proposed regulations. It is also irrational, and completely contrary to human experience. 
Fossil fuels created the modern world and lifted billions out of destitution and disease. They supply over 80% of the energy that powers United States and other modern civilizations; they will continue doing so for decades to come. They generate up to $70 trillion in annual global GDP. 
Using readily available data on global living standards, economies, disease, nutrition, life spans and other benefits – and the government’s own SCC cost figures and methodologies – we estimate that carbon benefits exceed costs by orders of magnitude: at least 50 to 1 and as much as 500 to 1! 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that fossil fuels will provide 75-80% of worldwide energy through 2040 – when the total amount of energy consumed will be at least 25% greater than today. That means these notable benefit-cost ratios will continue. The Obama Era SCC ignores all of this, too. 
Fourth, SCC schemes likewise impute only costs to carbon dioxide emissions. However, as thousands of scientific studies verify, rising levels of this miracle molecule are “greening” the Earth – reducing deserts, and improving forests, grasslands, drought resistance, crop yields and human nutrition. No matter which government report or discount rate is used, asserted social costs of more CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere are infinitesimal compared to its estimated benefits.
Fifth, government officials claim they can accurately forecast damages to the world’s climate, economies, civilizations, populations and ecosystems from U.S. carbon dioxide emissions over the next three centuries. They say we must base today’s energy policies, laws and regulations on those forecasts. 
The notion is delusional and dangerous. The rate of change in energy generation and other technologies has become exponential over the past several decades, with forecasting ability declining at an equal rate. Uncertainties over man and nature-driven climate changes during the next 300 years are equally colossal. Combining all the SCC assumptions, methodologies, fabrications and omissions, and injecting its absurd predictions into high-speed computer models, just means bogus forecasts are generated more quickly. 
Finally, the most fundamental issue isn’t even the social cost of carbon. It is the costs inflicted on society by anti-carbon regulations. Those rules replace fossil fuel revenues with renewable energy subsidies; reliable, affordable electricity with unreliable power that costs two to three times as much; and mines, drill holes, cropland and wildlife habitats with tens of millions of acres of wind, solar and biofuel “farms.” 
Anti-carbon rules are designed to drive energy de-carbonization and modern nation de-industrialization. Perhaps worst, their impacts fall hardest on poor, minority and blue-collar families. Those families spend proportionately three to ten times more of their incomes on energy than families earning $50,000 to $250,000 a year. They have little discretionary income and face the greatest risk of having their electricity cut off – as happened to 330,000 families during 2015 in ultra-green Germany. Worldwide, billions of people still do not have electricity – and the SCC would keep them deprived of its benefits. 
Bureaucrats, activists, scientists and corporate rent-seekers certainly welcome the SCC mumbo-jumbo. They have profited the most from the countless billions that Obama regulatory agencies lavished on them every year, and from the tens of billions that Mr. Obama stashed in dozens of agencies, programs and crannies throughout the government, so they couldn’t easily be found or cut. 
Above all, they would profit massively from the $93 trillion that the Financial Stability Board’s climate task force says the world must spend in low-carbon infrastructure programs over the next 15 years, as part of the Obama-UN-FSB-Climate Crisis, Inc. plan to de-carbonize and de-industrialize the planet.
Taxpayers, consumers and families would be hammered if the Climate Cabal got even more power over energy policies, economic growth, livelihoods and living standards. Thankfully, eliminating the social cost of carbon and programs implemented under it requires little more than applying the same rules and standards that government regulators have imposed on Volkswagen, Fiat and Wall Street dishonesty. 
That is why the Trump Administration is challenging the SCC, climate cataclysm deception, and the bloated EPA budget behind so much of it. It’s why the House Science Committee’s Environment and Oversight Subcommittees held a hearing on the SCC, and why we and other experts will eviscerate it during the upcoming Heartland Institute 12th International Climate Conference in Washington, DC.
It’s time to rescind and defund the SCC – and replace it with honest, objective cost-benefit analyses.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
h/t JaneHM – the University of New South Wales, the home university of Chris Turney, leader of the Ship of Fools expedition which got stuck in the Antarctic ice, has just forbidden lecturers from teaching anthropological historical facts which might offend Australia’s indigenous community.

University bans ‘inappropriate’ scientific data about the arrival of humans in Australia because it is offensive to Aboriginals who believe they have been here ‘forever’

UNSW lecturers told to not teach date Indigenous people arrived in Australia 
The language guidelines were sent out staff and approved by a working group 
Told more appropriate is that Indigenous Australians here ‘since the Dreaming’ 

By BRETT LACKEY FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIAPUBLISHED: 16:01 AEST, 29 June 2019 | UPDATED: 16:01 AEST, 29 June 2019
Science lecturers at the University of New South Wales have been told to stop telling students that Indigenous people’s arrived in Australia 40,000 years ago.
In a letter sent to staff the lecturers were told that it is ‘inappropriate’ to teach dates and they should say Aboriginals have been here ‘since the beginning of the Dreamings’ because that is what indigenous people believe. 
A set of classroom guidelines were circulated in the science faculty this month which alerted the scientists to the existing language advice, according to The Weekend Australian. 
…
The guidelines say teaching a date for the arrival of Indigenous people ‘tends to lend support to migration theories and anthropological assumptions.’

Maybe we’ve all been unfair to Chris Turney. 
Perhaps Turney got into trouble, because he was never taught that Antarctic pack ice can be dangerous to ships, because learning there is lots of floating ice around Antarctica would upset climate activists, who are utterly convinced it has all melted away.

" Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here.A number of the candidates to lead the Democratic Party in the 2020 US election, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have stated that if elected they would immediately seek to shut down all exploration development and production of oil and natural gas on federal lands and all production based on hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”).As a result of increased fractionation andoil development, US crude oil production has more than doubled in a decade. Bymid-2019, US production was over 12 million barrels per day, surpassing Russianand Saudi Arabian output as the world’s largest. Academic and business modelssuggest that oil prices are up to $40 – $50 per barrel lower than they wouldhave been were it not for the US fracking revolution. The benefits of these lower prices haveprimarily flowed to China, India, Japan and South Korea, which constitute fourof the world’s five largest oil importers (the US itself being one of the topfive), largely at the cost of reduced oil revenues to OPEC and Russia. GivenAsia’s oil consumption of almost 36 million barrels per day in 2018, theregion’s consumers would have saved over $325 billion dollars annually if crudeoil prices were lower by just $25 per barrel due to the US production boom. If priceswere $50 per barrel lower, the Asian countries would have saved over $650billion per year.The benefits to all the world’s oilconsumers from higher U.S. production can be estimated based on the fact thatworld oil consumption in 2018 was about 100 million barrels per day. With aprice reduction of $25 per barrel, the daily savings to consumers would be $2.5billion, or an annual savings of $912.5 billion. If the price reduction was $50per barrel, the daily savings for the world’s consumers would be $5 billion, or$1.8 trillion per year. Loss of this savings could hasten the onset of a globalrecession.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.

 _The_ Current Wisdom _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. ""Chip"" Knappenberger, from Cato’s Center for the Study of Science, review interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press._   
  
  
  
The biggest criticism to emerge so far regarding the new _Fifth Assessment Report_ from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that it generally fails to acknowledge how poorly climate model simulations of the earth’s temperature evolution compare with actual observations. If the models cannot accurately simulate known climate variability and change, using them for policy purposes is a fool’s errand.   
  
There are two lines of evidence that converge to show that the climate models are largely failing to accurately simulate observed climate behavior.   
  
The first is that a collection of about ten research papers (including 16 separate analyses) published in the scientific literature beginning in 2011 that collectively indicate that the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity—that is, how much the earth’s average surface temperature rises as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration—is about 2°C, give or take about 0.5°C (Figure 1). You can find details here.   






_Figure 1. Climate sensitivity estimates from new research published since 2010 (colored), compared with range of estimates from the climate models incorporated into the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5; black). The arrows indicate the 5 to 95 percent confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The light grey vertical bar is the mean of the 16 estimates from the new findings. The mean climate sensitivity (3.2°C) of the climate models used in the IPCC AR5 is 60 percent greater than the mean of recent estimates (2.0°C)._   
  
__



  
  
The second line of evidence is that climate models have simply predicted too much warming, as evidenced, for example, by the lack of observed warming during the past 15, 16, or 17 years (depending on which temperature history you consult) despite climate models projections that the earth’s average temperature should have warmed up by just over 0.3°C during that time.   
  
You’d think that these two glaring faults should have made the IPCC tear the whole report up and start over, but that’s not what happened.   
  
Instead, while the IPCC did grudgingly concede that climate model simulations of the past 15 years do, in fact, over-predict the amount of warming that took place over that period, they largely deflect the blame for this mismatch away from the models and onto elements of natural variability or a misquantification of the forces of climate change that were input to the models. Blame-shifting in science is usually a bad idea, and the IPCC’s bumbling attempt wouldn’t have passed muster as an undergraduate thesis   
  
Think that’s a bit harsh? Read on…   
  
The IPCC analyzes 114 different climate model simulations of the evolution of the earth’s average temperature for the 15 year period from 1998 to 2012, and compares those simulations to the observed temperature record. Candidly, the IPCC states that:   




...111 out of 114 realisations [sic] show a GMST [global mean surface temperature] trend over 1998–2012 that is higher than the [trend in observed temperatures even after accounting for statistical uncertainty in the observed trend].



So far, so good.   
  
But, never fear, says the IPCC, because if you look at the preceding 15 year period, from 1984 through 1998, opposite mistakes were being made:   




...during the 15-year period ending in 1998, [the trend in observed temperature] lies above 93 out of 114 modelled trends. 



We’ll guess that in science two wrongs usually don’t make a right, but that is not how the IPCC sees things.   
  
The IPCC goes on to explain:   




Due to internal climate variability, in any given 15-year period the observed GMST trend sometimes lies near one end of a model ensemble…an effect that is pronounced in Box 9.2, Figure 1a,b since GMST was influenced by a very strong El Niño event in 1998.



To seal the deal, the IPCC then claims that, over the longer run these short-term variations all average out and the match between models and observations is outstanding:   




Over the 62-year period 1951–2012, observed and [climate model] ensemble-mean trend agree to within 0.02 °C per decade (Box 9.2 Figure 1c; [climate model] ensemble-mean trend 0.13°C per decade). There is hence _very high confidence_ that the [climate] models show long-term GMST trends consistent with observations, despite the disagreement over the most recent 15-year period. [italics in original]



Our Figure 2 shows the IPCC Box 9.2 Figure 1a,b,c referred to in the above quotes.   






  
  
_Figure 2. Frequency distribution of trends from 114 model runs (grey bars) for the period 1998-2012 (a); 1984-1998 (b); and 1951-2012 (c); compared with the observed trend (red) over the same periods (from IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Box 9.2)._   
  
  
  
As the IPCC correctly contends, the value of a trend is overly sensitive to its endpoint data (especially over shorter periods). So rather than picking just one cherry that depends on the unusually warm year of 1998, how about we look at the whole tree. Below we show the results for _every_ overlapping 15-yr period during the period 1951-2012 (i.e., starting with the period 1951-1965, 1952-1966, 1953-1967,… and ending with 1998-2012). In Figure 3, the thick red line traces the 15-yr model trend values, the thin red lines are include 95 percent of the model trend values, and the thick blue line traces the evolution of the observed 15-yr trends.   






  
  
_Figure 3. The observed 15-yr moving trend during the period 1951-2012 from the Hadley Center temperature record (blue) compared to the multi-model mean trend (thick red line) and the 95 percent range of individual model simulations (thin red lines). (The model simulations consisted of 108 individual model runs downloaded from Climate Explorer that combined the RCP4.5 scenario with historical simulations)._   
  
  
  
The result isn’t very pretty for the IPCC.   
  
Most of the time, the observed trend is either near or below the average trend from the models. At the recent end of the record, the observed trend has fallen below the model trend for 12 consecutive overlapping periods, and the discrepancy is growing larger. For the past two periods, 1997-2011 and 1998-2012, the observed trend falls below the 95 percent range of modeled trends, a statistical indication that the observed trend is not a member of the modeled set of predictions (i.e., the models do not statistically capture reality as represented by the observations).   
  
Also notice that there are few excursions of the observed trend above the value of the modeled trend—a few periods ending in the late 1960s, mid-1980s, and again for the period ending in 1998 and 1999. The 1998 endpoint is the one that the IPCC decided to highlight—the fattest cherry they could find. It ends the largest positive discrepancy between observations and models during the past 40 years. Had they chosen to break their analysis in 1997, the observed trend during the period 1983-1997 would have been very close to the multi-model mean, while during the period 1997-2011, it still would have fallen below virtually every climate model simulation.   
  
By carefully choosing the break point in their analysis to be 1998, the IPCC concocts a narrative that sometimes the observed warming trend is less than the model average and at other times it is greater than the model average and that it all works out. The reality of the situation is that the small (in time as well as magnitude) positive excursion during the late 1990s is dwarfed by the large (in time as well as in magnitude) negative excursion of the observed trend beneath the model average trend at the end of the record. _Two wrongs do not make a right._   
  
In fact, the El Niño-influenced positive blip for the 15-yr period ending in 1998 is largely smoothed out and disappears if the trends are computed over a longer period of time, say 20 years. Figure 4 shows the observed/model comparisons for each overlapping 20-yr period from 1951-2012.   
  
Notice that there are again very few periods when the observed trend is greater than the model mean trend (and the ones that do exist are small), instead, the observed trend consistently runs either near, or below, the model mean trend. And the negative excursion at the end of the record is long and growing, with the observed trend during the most recent 20 years (1993-2012) again falling outside of the model 95 percent range.   






  
  
_Figure 4. The observed 20-yr moving trend during the period 1951-2012 from the Hadley Center temperature record (blue) compared to the multi-model mean trend (thick red line) and the 95 percent range of individual model simulations (thin red lines). (the model simulations consisted of 108 individual model runs downloaded from Climate Explorer that combined the RCP4.5 scenario with historical simulations)._   
  
  
  
There is no way that anyone could look at our Figure 4 and not think that the climate models have a generaly tendency to predict more warming than is observed—and that this tendency seems to becoming more distinct (and disturbing) as time goes on. Natural variability isn’t the culprit.   
  
But no such figure appears in the new IPCC _Fifth Assessment Report_. Instead, the reader is left to take the IPCC’s word for it that natural variability is a primary cause for the recent observed/model mismatch, that the sign of the mismatch routinely swings back and forth from negative to positive, and that soon enough the observations will come back into agreement with the model simulations. None of this is supported by the data in Figure 4.   
  
By not showing all the data, and instead, only that which best supports the narrative the IPCC wishes to spin—that climate models are reliable tools for projecting future climate changes resulting from human emissions of greenhouse gases—the IPCC misleads the public, government entities that defer to the IPCC (such as the EPA and the Supreme Court), and policymakers.   
  
This has got to stop.   
  
The IPCC has outlived whatever usefulness it may ever have had. It is time to disband this central climate “authority” and disperse the assessment of climate science to a broader, more diverse community.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
According to The Guardian, climate change caused 200 reindeer to starve to death in Svalbard, though the scientists conducting the study think overpopulation might have been a factor.
Starvation deaths of 200 reindeer in Arctic caused by climate crisis, say researchersComparable death toll has been recorded only once before, says Norwegian Polar InstituteAbout 200 reindeer have been found dead from starvation in the Arctic archipelago Svalbard, an unusually high number, the Norwegian Polar Institute has said, pointing the finger at climate crisis.…Ashild Onvik Pedersen, the head of the census, said the high degree of mortality was a consequence of climate crisis, which according to climate scientists, is happening twice as fast in the Arctic as the rest of the world.“Climate change is making it rain much more. The rain falls on the snow and forms a layer of ice on the tundra, making grazing conditions very poor for animals,” she said.…The increased mortality is also due in part to a significant increase in the number of reindeer in the Norwegian archipelago. That is partly thanks to climate crisis and the warmer summers, meaning more individuals compete in the same grazing areas.…Read more: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/deaths-of-200-reindeer-in-arctic-caused-by-climate-change-say-researchers
I’m starting to see this more and more, scientists genuflect to the alleged climate crisis, but they seem to qualify their statement, to let the truth about what is really causing the problem peek through what they are saying about climate change.

"**Are the days of families tucking into a Christmas pudding after their festive dinner slowly coming to an end?**
Figures from market research company Kantar suggest they may be, as sales of the traditional dessert fell by 16% in the UK in the run-up to Christmas.
There was also an 11% drop in sales of seasonal biscuits in supermarkets, while turkey sales were down by 1%.
The figures come as Morrisons said its sales fell over the Christmas period amid ""challenging"" trading conditions.
The UK's fourth-largest supermarket group reported a 1.7% fall in like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - excluding fuel, for the 22 weeks to 5 January.
Morrisons is the first of the big four chains to report Christmas sales, with Sainsbury's and Tesco due to report later this week.
On Monday, discount chain Aldi said that its total UK sales in the four weeks to 24 December rose 7.9% from a year before, although it did not give a like-for-like comparison. It also said it sold 55 million mince pies over the festive period.
According to Kantar, Aldi's sales over the 12 weeks to 29 December went up by 5.9%.
Fellow discount retailer Lidl had the highest percentage increase in sales growth for bricks and mortar supermarkets over the same period, with its sales up 10.8%.
Lidl and Aldi had their highest-ever combined Christmas market share of 13.7% - more than treble the figure in 2009.
However, Britain's fastest-growing grocer according to Kantar was online retailer Ocado, where sales rose by 12.5%.
This industry data shows that it's been a pretty slow Christmas for the supermarkets, with next to no growth.
Households, on average, spent less this festive period than last. The big grocers have been working really hard to get us to part with our cash, with lots of promotions on alcohol and cut-price fuel.
The competition has been intense. According to Kantar, the big four grocers have all struggled to increase sales and have lost market share. Once again, Aldi and Lidl have pulled in shoppers, thanks largely to opening dozens of new stores.
Retailers will be hoping that consumers will be feeling more confident in 2020, buoyed by wages rising faster than inflation. But the big grocers are likely to remain under pressure.
The discounters could reach a combined 17% market share this year and shopper behaviour continues to change. For instance, fast-food operators such as Deliveroo are growing in popularity.
Overall, Kantar's figures indicated that in the 12 weeks to 29 December, supermarket sales grew by 0.2% from a year earlier - the slowest rate of growth over the Christmas period since 2015.
""There was no sign of the post-election rush many had hoped for in the final weeks before Christmas, with shoppers carefully watching their budgets,"" said Kantar's Fraser McKevitt.
While sales of some foods went down, the fizz also went out of sparkling wine with its sales falling by 8%.
However, beer and wine were more popular than in 2018 with respective rises of 1% and 2% in their sales over the previous year.
And instead of Christmas pudding, the desserts that proved most popular were sponge puddings (up 12.4% on 2018), crumble (up 9.4%) and custard to go with them (up 28%).
Another data firm - Nielsen - using different methodology to Kantar, said supermarket sales grew by just 0.5% in the last four weeks.
It said grocery sales reached a peak of Â£6.2bn over the two weeks to 28 December - but this was down 0.2% compared with the same period in 2018.
Reflecting on the Morrisons figures, the company's chief executive, David Potts, said: ""It was encouraging that during an unusually challenging period for sales, our execution was strong and our profitability robust, demonstrating the broad-based progress we have made during the turnaround.
""As always, we will take some learnings into the new year and look forward to 2020 with a strong plan and solid foundations on which to continue to grow.""
Morrisons said its key Christmas items were ""once again very competitive"", with most prices the same as or lower than in 2018.

""Shrinking sales demonstrate the fiercely competitive food sector,"" he added. ""Shoppers remained fixated on searching for the best value and highly price-sensitive against the backdrop of ongoing uncertainty."""

His full biography is here.The Trudeau government, supported by environmental groups and many in the Canadian business community, has implemented a carbon dioxide pricing system as one component of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. “Carbon pricing” is the term that includes carbon dioxide taxes, emissions trading, and fees on industrial emissions intensity, all intended to create a financial incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In a recent paper, I compared the design of the Canadian carbon pricing system to the theoretical model that has been used to justify it. I also examined the actual and expected effects of the system on pricing, consumers, industry and regions.LINK TO PDF OF ‘Carbon Taxation: The Canadian Experience”:  Lyman-carbontax-1 (1)The federal government’s national policy framework allows each province and territory to decide how it will implement carbon pricing, while at the same time setting certain minimum conditions that must be met. Jurisdictions may use either carbon taxes or emissions trading (‘cap and trade’) systems. For larger emitters, they may also employ output-based pricing systems (OBSP). An OBSP imposes fees on firms that do not meet prescribed levels of emissions intensity in their production processes. The framework requires steadily rising prices for the effective tax, levy or emissions trading permit price. Starting at $10 per tonne of CO2 equivalent in 2018, the rate must increase by $10 per tonne per year until it reaches $50 per tonne in 2022. The jurisdictions must return a portion of the revenues collected to the public, although there is considerable room for flexibility in how this is done. If, in the federal government’s judgment, a province or territory does not meet these conditions, the government will impose a ‘backstop’ system. The backstop system will apply in New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. While the carbon tax rates have not been set for the period after 2022, it is clear that $50 per tonne is not high enough to meet the government’s emissions reduction target for 2030 and the much more demanding reductions now being advocated by the New Democratic Party, Green Party and others. There are six key flaws in the present carbon pricing system. In theory, the price increase caused by carbon taxes should reflect the “social cost of carbon’, or the estimated present value of the impact that an emitted tonne of carbon dioxide today will have on humans in the future. In fact, no one really knows what this is. There are other alternatives, such as the current market price of internationally traded carbon credits. The Canadian rates, however,  bear no relationship to the social cost that, theoretically, they are supposed to represent. The rates are based on political, not economic, considerations. Carbon taxes are beneficial when they provide a market-based substitute for a host of intrusive government programs and regulations that seek to manage and direct consumer and industry behaviour. Canada’s system merely adds to a large and growing number of government regulations, subsidies and other program measures. There are over 600 of these. The taxes will have severe adverse effects on the emissions-intensive sectors and firms in Canada. By far the largest adverse impacts will occur in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where almost half of all Canadian emissions occur. This is not just a western Canadian problem, though. The energy-intensive resource and manufacturing industries in other provinces and territories must inevitably be affected by the impact of the taxes on their competitiveness. This includes primarily firms in the emissions-intensive industries like mining, petrochemicals, iron, steel, cement, metal fabrication and vehicle and parts manufacturing. The United States, our main trading partner, has no federal carbon tax and China has regional taxes of about $2 per tonne. The system will vary considerably across Canada in terms of coverage, rates, exemptions and revenue recycling. Rates will be highest in provinces and territories subject to the federal “backstop” regime, and lowest in Atlantic Canada and, for the time being, in Quebec. Quebec’s carbon prices will be set by the price of permits in the Western Climate Initiative with the State of California; Quebec firms pay millions of dollars to California permit holders, but the cost will be less than the residents of other provinces pay to governments. Revenue recycling, in theory, should be done in ways that would minimize the adverse macroeconomic effects of the tax, ideally through reductions in the rates of other generally -applied taxes like corporate income taxes. The Canadian system, to the extent that it provides for recycling, is instead an income redistribution system. It is not yet clear how much, if at all, businesses will benefit from rebates. The rebates thus serve essentially to deflect the criticism that carbon taxes are a “revenue grab”, while failing to compensate households for the full economic costs of imposing the tax. Three provinces – Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick – have filed appeals to the courts seeking judgments that the federal legislation authorizing implementation of the carbon pricing regime is unconstitutional. Alberta may follow suit. In the single court decision rendered so far, the federal jurisdiction was upheld. With provinces representing over half the Canadian population opposed on political and legal grounds to the tax, this raises obvious problems for the future viability of the system. Finally, the public should be aware of the exaggerated estimates of carbon tax effectiveness. By 2022, the carbon tax rates will be the equivalent of about eleven cents per litre of gasoline. Canadian Taxpayers Federation surveys show that the national average pump price of gasoline in 2018 was $1.35 per litre, so the tax would add 8 per cent to that. Yet, in its latest report to the United Nations, Environment and Climate Change Canada estimated that present climate policies will reduce 2022 emissions by 80 to 90 million tonnes per year. That is more than the emissions of all light duty passenger vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) in 2017. As with respect to other aspects of carbon pricing, the government should think again.Additional Carbon Tax resources:“Just the Facts on Carbon Tax”Debunking Ecofiscal Canada on Carbon TaxCarbon KleptomaniaLet Them Eat Carbon Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Dear Prime Minister
The Paris Climate Agreement.

You ratified the Paris Climate Agreement on Thursday 10 November 2016 without discussion with the Australian people and without revealing the implications or the cost.
You did this despite protests from Liberal and LNP Branches in NSW and Queensland.

The Cap and Trade Emissions Trading Scheme.

Mr Abbott handsomely won the 2013 election by committing to revoke Labor’s Carbon Tax.
We didn’t know then that Mr Abbott had apparently made an unpublicised deal with Greg Hunt to support a Cap and Trade Emissions Trading Scheme.CamScanner for PC
You broke faith with the Australian people by usurping Mr Abbot as leader in September.
Then, on the last sitting day of Parliament in December 2015, you enacted Greg Hunt’s bill, supported by Labor and the Greens, for “The Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard”.
This bill was in effect a Cap and Trade Emissions Trading Scheme, not dissimilar to Ms Gillard’s Clean Energy Act 2011 which the people had previously rejected.
We only learned of it when we read Alan Kohler’s article in The Australian on May 23, 2016.

Renewable Energy.

Australia has an ambitious and scientifically unjustifiable target to reduce CO2 emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
Subsidies for Renewable Energy are currently running at over $2.8bn a year.
Estimates of the total cost to Australia of renewable energy are up to $60bn.
There is a worldwide commercial failure of renewable energy projects,
There are no foreseeable prospects of affordable bulk energy storage technology,
There is a TOTAL lack of any scientific evidence justifying the closure of thermal power stations because of their CO2 emissions in favour of renewable energy plants,
It is essential that we have the lowest cost electrical energy technically available, and
Mr Trump and the Republicans have said they will wind back President Obama’s Climate Change policies. When they do, you and your policies will be left politically high and dry.

You have not been practicing Open Government Prime Minister, so now please tell us:
1. Why are you ratifying unexplained secretive Climate Change Agreements with the UN?
2. Why did you introduce a Cap and Trade ETS contrary to public expectations?
3. Why are you supporting costly and unreliable renewable energy?
4. What is the cost to Australia of these Climate Change Agreements?
This week’s Newspoll and Mr Trump’s Presidential victory are clear warnings that if you don’t start acting like the leader of a true Right-of-Centre Political Party, we will all have three years of a Labor Government and you will be yet another failed Australian Prime Minister.
Yours faithfully,
Robert J Brock.

"We hope you got some rest over the holidays, but it’s clear from our mailbox that you remained sharp and attentive readers. We will address a few of those complaints first, before turning to this week’s topics. A   Social Q’s column, which administers lighthearted advice about awkward social situations, addressed what an adult should do when one child taunts another at a holiday party. The specific taunt in question, which was directed toward a Latina girl, was this: “Pack your bags. Trump is going to send you back to Mexico. ” The headline on the column? “Should I Stay Silent During One Child’s Populist Taunt of Another?” Readers took issue with the description of the taunt. The author of the column, Philip Galanes, took the time to reply to a reader who wrote to him directly. Shortly before the new year, an ad ran on a Times story that left some readers befuddled. The ad was indeed a hoax, and readers who realized this have asked The Times to address the issue. Indeed, such ads do seem to find their way onto the Times website occassionally, as a public editor column explained in November, but we asked Sebastian Tomich, senior vice president for advertising and innovation, to comment once more. Here’s his response: An hour into the new year, tragedy struck in Turkey when a gunman attacked an Istanbul nightclub. The lead byline on The Times’s story was anonymous  —   “an Employee of The New York Times”  —   and readers had theories as to why. The public editor’s take: We’ve received several letters asking about the unusual byline. The international editor, Michael Slackman, said he’s not in position to comment but I suspect you are hinting at the right issues in your letter. From my experience, it is not uncommon to use a generic byline when the security of journalists may be at risk, or when a widespread team of editors and reporters is assembling a deadline story. But I’m only speaking for myself, not the paper. Just last week, a Wall Street Journal reporter was detained by Turkish officials for three days and held in isolation. The same story caught readers’ attentions for other reasons, too. Initially, the story reported that the single gunman may have been as many as three gunmen, and they were wearing Santa Claus suits, an image which stayed with readers. The Times, however, never appended a correction to the story nor added a note explaining the change. We asked Slackman about this. Here’s his response: The public editor’s take: Time for me to make my plug again for attaching notes to stories that undergo a notable change from a previous edition. This wasn’t just a routine change in a rapidly unfolding story. It was a rather dramatic visual  —   a team of men in Santa Claus suits firing into the crowd. If that turned into one man dressed like the crowd, as later stories suggest, isn’t it more transparent just to flag that? Another reader raised an issue that will hopefully be addressed in the new year. We asked Alexandra MacCallum, who oversees Times video, for an answer. She told us that while some videos have text overlay, which editors add manually, an automated closed caption system is in the works this year. As trust in the media falters, a reader has taken a stand, one friend at a time. He wrote us to ask for our aid in his mission. We, of course, pointed him to their location on the web, and if you have any upcoming debates, too, you can find The Times’s standards and ethics here. Good luck, and see you next week."

Isn’t it ironic that the flagship policy this year presented by this COLs, led by Ardern, was to focus on mental health and wellbeing? Hundreds of millions of dollars have been targeted to alleviate what is perceived to be the declining state of emotional stability within society, which is highlighted by the increasing number of youth suicides and anxiety-related concerns within everyday life. Yet this COL is hell-bent on **creating a climate of fear and trepidation focusing largely on our youth.**



In the wake of the dreadful discovery of the Canterbury University student who had died and yet was not discovered until eight weeks later, UNZ chief executive Chris Whelan had this to say. 



“The increase in the declining mental health within universities is due to a of range of factors, **including relentless global change.”**



On Friday we witnessed mass hysteria throughout the country being exhibited by a reported 150,000 kids. Almost all were being **emotionally manipulated** into a state of dread, fear and terror by a political movement with an agenda. The mental stability of this generation of children is being manipulated by politicians and is reminiscent of the Hitler youth movement, a group designed to indoctrinate children into Hitler’s ideology, then send them off to war. Early Nazi leaders hoped that the organisations would serve as conduits of political mobilisation and ideological indoctrination for the young.



It might be stretching the analogy a little, but is James Shaw NZ’s Hitler? Are those of us who refuse to buy into man-made global warming about to be exterminated by way of eco-friendly gas chambers? Seriously though, the man is whipping up a frenzy of revulsion towards those who see the idiocies of his ideology. If ever a political party was guilty of manipulating the youth of this country, it is the Green Party. They are slowly but surely sowing the seed of dread amongst our youth. So good luck with your well-being budget as you manoeuvre our young into a state of fear and trepidation. What a pack of dangerous and demented fools.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant. He was a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior. His full biography is here. With the current push for public policy to adopt ‘green energy’ schemes, it is time to reflect on the Ontario experience. Ontario’s disastrous electricity policy has been publicized and commented on extensively by many sources, so this is not news. What is news is to lay the blame squarely at the door of its climate policy motivation, and, perhaps, to remind people of high the bill has been – $9 billion for poor contracting practices, $133 billion in global adjustment fees from 2015 to 2032 (at least 20 per cent of which relates to renewables), $3.6 billion to build the “smart grid and smart meters”, up to $55 billion in deferred costs that will hit future ratepayers, and 75,000 lost industrial jobs. That is quite the tally for zero global environmental benefit.Executive SummaryFrom 2003 to 2018, two Ontario Premiers, Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne, and their parties governed the province of Ontario and implemented a series of policies founded on the theory that humans are causing catastrophic global warming and that reducing greenhouse emissions in Ontario would make things better. The centerpiece of their climate policy was the transformation of Ontario’s electricity sector.LINK TO FULL REPORT: The Ontario Electricity Legacy FINALCover image licensed from Shutterstock.After winning the provincial election in 2003, the McGuinty government began closing coal plants, adding wind and solar power generation and expanding the nuclear and hydro generation in the province. It did not anticipate the effects of the global financial crisis or of the higher electricity prices that resulted from their actions. By 2008, it became clear that electricity demand had declined significantly, and that the by-then available nuclear, hydro and natural-gas fired generation was more than adequate to meet Ontario’s needs, even if the coal-fired plants were closed. Yet the Ontario government embarked on a major expenditure program, which it presented as a job creation initiative. In 2009, the Ontario government passed the Green Energy Act. The Act sought to stimulate investment in wind, solar, hydro, biomass and biogas projects and to increase energy conservation.  Notably, it: Created a Feed-in-Tariff that the Independent Electricity Systems Operator (IESO) must pay, guaranteeing specific above-market rates for energy generated from renewable energy sources under 20-year contracts;Gave renewables “first-to-the-grid” rights, meaning that IESO had to take their production in preference to all other sources of generation; andImplemented a “smart” grid to support the development of renewable energy projects. On December 2, 2015, Bonnie Lysyk, Auditor General of Ontario, released her 2015 annual report on the value for money received by Ontario residents from the operations of the Ontario provincial government. Chapter 3 of the report contained a blockbuster – an extraordinarily damning assessment of the actions of the government with respect to electricity power system planning over the period from 2003 to the end of 2014. The report found that, from 2004 to 2014, the portion of residential and small commercial customers’ bills covering electricity generation costs increased by 80%, from 5.02 cents per kWh to 9.06 cents per kWh. The overall cost of electricity to consumers increased by 56%, from $12.2 billion in 2004 to $18.9 billion in 2014. Electricity consumers had to pay $9.2 billion more for renewable energy (wind, solar and biomass generation sources) over the 20-year contract terms under the Ministry’s current guaranteed price (i.e. feed-in-tariff) program than they would have under the previous program under which renewable energy was purchased through competitive bidding. Because of the mismatch between when wind and solar generation provides power and when consumers want it, Ontario increasingly had to curtail generation from other sources (i.e. pay generators not to produce) and dump surplus generation on the export market. From 2009 to 2014, Ontario exported 95.1 million MWh of power; the total cost of producing this power was about $3.1 billion more than the revenue Ontario received for exporting it. This had adverse consequences for ratepayers. Between 2010 and 2016, monthly electricity bills (including tax) in major Canadian cities increased by an average of $37.68. During the same period, electricity bills in Toronto and Ottawa increased by $77.09 and $66.96, respectively. The annual average household cost of electricity in 2009 was $486.72; in 2016 it was $1,002.48. By 2016, Ontario’s electricity rates were among the highest in North America. The largest corporations in the province, especially those facing stiff competition from companies in other jurisdictions, successfully lobbied to have their rates reduced. So, in 2011 the Wynne government decided that residential and small commercial customers should be forced to cross-subsidize the large companies. From mid-2011 to 2017, $6.2 billion in costs were transferred from large industrial users to residential and commercial users. Despite having some of their costs allocated to other users, large industrial firms saw their rates rise above those of their competitors and downsized accordingly. Ontario lost almost 75,000 industrial jobs. To deal with the mounting political opposition to high electricity costs, the Wynne government belatedly introduced the “Fair Hydro Plan”. The plan involved a shifting of costs from some groups to others through a complicated system of refinancing. Basically, the province will borrow the money to pay some of the current costs that would normally be passed on to electricity users in their rates, to reduce rates below the levels they would otherwise be until 2027, then increase rates after that to recover both the deferred costs and the interest that it had to pay to borrow. It was initially estimated that electricity cost refinancing alone would reduce ratepayers’ bills by $18.4 billion from 2017 to 2027. The actual costs have been higher. As a result, after paying elevated electricity bills for the next ten years, future ratepayers could be on the hook for as much as $54.7 billion in deferred generation and interest costs. From 2005 to 2016, Ontario reduced greenhouse gas emissions from utilities by 27 megatonnes. Canada’s GHG emissions declined due to the economic recession and then gradually increased to 722 Mt. Global emissions, meanwhile, grew from 30.1 billion tonnes in 2007 to 32.8 billion tonnes in 2015 and 33.4 billion tonnes in 2017, almost entirely due to economic developments in the Asia-Pacific area. So, Ontario’s actions reduced Canada’s overall emissions in 2015 by 3.7% and had no effect whatsoever on global emissions. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline site wind energy proponent site, Energiezukunft.eu here presents a commentary telling why Germany is seeing ever increasing resistance to wind energy projects and how the wind industry could be seeing the final nail in its coffin.

German wind industry losing its shine, seeing growing resistance. Photo: Pierre Gosselin
Behind the mounting resistance are hundreds of anti-wind farm citizens’ initiatives across the country, stricter rules for wind projects and powerful anti-wind bureaucrats now heading key government positions.
According to Energiezukunft.eu,(Energy Future.eu) the new German draft laws are also calling on wind farm operators “to participate in the costs of grid expansion”, a costly requirement that wind energy proponents say “could ruin the wind energy industry”.
“Actions in the Ministry of Economics show: This is being done deliberately.”
Wind running up against fierce citizens’ opposition
Once welcome with open arms by citizens in Europe, wind projects today are being met with fierce opposition as citizens have come to realize how wind parks horrendously blight the landscape, threaten endangered species, produce unhealthy infrasound and generate electricity only sporadically.
Actions speaking louder than words
While the German CDU/CSU/SPD grand coalition government openly preaches the virtues of changing over to green energies like wind and sun and that they are the future, their actions and proposals in reality speak tell us the opposite. The German government indeed seems to be ending the free ride that wind energy has enjoyed for more than 2 decades.
Energiezukunft.eu reports that the planned grid expansion participation regulation “could stifle the construction of new wind turbines in overloaded power grids such as those in northern Germany” and “would lead to incalculable costs for wind farm operators.”

Onshore wind parks are looking less attractive than ever.
Anti-wind citizens groups now a formidable force
Once ridiculed and often ignored, citizens’ initiatives against wind projects now “have great influence up to the highest circles” of federal ministries, Energiezukunft.eu acknowledges.
Wind energy proponent Energiezukunft.eu attacks the citizen initiatives, claiming their arguments “are often put forward under the guise of environmental protection.” Energiezukunft.eu then even claims wind turbines in fact protect species and the environment: “In addition, there is climate change, which severely disrupts and destroys the environment of the animals. The expansion of wind power would bring positive benefits here.”
Anti-wind officials in key positions
Energiezukunft.eu points out there is another major obstacle that the wind industry is facing in the future: high-level, anti-wind energy officials appointed to key positions, such as Stephanie von Ahlefeldt, head of the “Energy Policy – Electricity and Networks” department.
Because Ahlefeldt is now sitting at the levers of control, “She knows exactly which levers to pull in order to make a difference, and she is pulling all the levers at the same time,” Energiezukunft.eu warns.
Bleak future for German wind energy
Bright future for conservationists
The mounting obstacles against wind energy from citizens initiatives, stricter regulations and powerful anti-wind officials in key positions mean the future for wind energy development across Germany’s landscape looks bleaker than ever. This has real environmentalists celebrating.
Tens of thousands of wind jobs lost
The situation for the wind industry in Germany has been dismal for some two years. Energiezukunft.eu writes: “Several 10,000 jobs have already been lost in the wind energy sector” and “many thousands more jobs are at risk as a result of the planned regulations.”

Michael Loftus admits he’ll grab any excuse to share his Al Gore impression.
Why not? It’s rock solid. Only this time the Big Tech Overlords were listening, too. And, apparently, they weren’t pleased that Loftus poked fun at the “Inconvenient Sequel” star.
The most recent Loftus Party video mocks both the former Vice President as well as President Barack Obama. The latter brought it on himself, to be fair.

The Obamas just bought a $15 million property on Martha’s Vineyard, AKA land kissing the Atlantic Ocean. The move drew plenty of criticism from conservatives, but not for any one-percent complaints.
Why would someone who believes global warming is causing the oceans to rise gobble up coastal property?
It’s a legitimate question, one most journalists refuse to ask. Not Loftus. The conservative comic joined the fray, using comedy to pile on the former President.

Is this a new feature at YouTube? Does the platform fact check liberal comedians, too? What about hard news clips exploring the now-debunked Russia collusion hoax? Do they get a horizontal explainer ribbon as well?
Loftus shared the YouTube situation on his latest podcast episode.

“At first, I was’t outraged by it … because they haven’t demonetized the video,” Loftus said. His anger grew the more he drilled into the matter.
“They are playing hardball … I can’t get rid of it,” he says of the info strip.

"Let’s just be very clear about this: There is no movie called “Hidden Fences. ” But you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise after watching the Golden Globes, after the nonexistent movie was mentioned twice. The first time was definitely a mistake. The second time is not so clear. First, NBC’s Jenna Bush Hager, taking her first turn at Golden Globes reporting, presumably meant to ask Pharrell Williams about his best original score nomination for “Hidden Figures,” a movie about three black women who would play crucial roles in the American space program. Surely she didn’t mean to ask him about “Fences,” a similarly renowned film starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. Mr. Williams had no involvement in that. But: Mr. Williams’s   reaction, in which he appeared to be doing his best to hold back whatever he badly wished to say, was impressive in its restraint. Unsurprisingly, the immediate reaction on Twitter was less restrained. “So Jenna Bush is just merging all of the black movies tonight at the #GoldenGlobes, huh?” one user asked. “Pharrell’s face just held hundreds of years of whitewashing resolve,” another said. Others had fun in similarly inventing new movie titles. That seemed to be the end of things, but for some reason, Michael Keaton also referred to “Hidden Fences” when listing the nominees for best supporting actress in a motion picture. Since the camera was focused on the actresses, it’s unclear if Mr. Keaton said it with a wink and a nod."

The Auckland council has declared a climate emergency, but I am sure that the ratepayers of Titirangi would much prefer that they paid attention to the core services such as rubbish and sewage, given that they are currently enduring a plague of rats!



To be fair though, rubbish does not appear to be the cause of the infestation.



A community has become over-run by “giant” and brazen rats which have been attracted by food left out for its population of wild chickens.





The solution then, you would think, would be staring them in the face.



Rats “as big as cats” were said to be everywhere in west Auckland’s Titirangi Village, where authorities are scrambling to get the infestation under control.  
Locals said the rodents were running rampant near shops, cafes, retaining walls, carparks and near Rangiwai Rd.   
  
Residents of Titirangi Village – which is famed for its wild chickens – said the problem had been going on for months.



So what has changed? If the wild chickens have been there previously without a rat plague then something must have changed. Why the rat plague now?



One resident said the rats were “not scared of humans” and were coming out boldly into the open. […]  
  
Waitakere Ranges Local Board chairman **Greg Presland** confirmed there was an infestation in the village.



[…] Local board chairman Presland said they were aware of concerns raised by residents about the chickens and roosters in the Titirangi town centre.  
“We are also aware that a recent rat infestation problem has emerged,” Presland said.  
He has met with Auckland Council’s environmental services department and confirmed the deep interest the local community has in dealing with this problem, he said.[…]



Perhaps if Greg Presland spent more time doing his elected job rather than defending the government constantly at The Standard, then his voters wouldn’t have a rat infestation and wouldn’t need to hire a rat catcher general. Just a thought.



[…] “We have an actual rat problem, it’s completely out of control,” Jack said.  
[…] “They’re the size of cats. We’ve always had chickens in the village but sadly it’s increased the rat population because **someone is feeding the chickens too much** and are leaving food for the rats as well.  
“The balance is not there anymore, it is undermining the natural biodiversity of the area.”



  
The natural biodiversity? Wild chickens are no more natural to the biodiversity of New Zealand than deer, goats or pigs. This problem is easily fixed. Stop feeding the wild chickens and start eating them instead.

"Hillary Clinton, who has kept a relatively low public profile since losing the presidential election two months ago, on Sunday showed up at the final performance of the Broadway revival of “The Color Purple,” reveling in the story of a beleaguered woman who triumphs over the oppressive men in her life (and, along the way, discovers a love for colorful pants). Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, received several ovations from the   audience as she arrived, and then another round of applause when she was acknowledged by the cast after the show. “There’s a lot of really awesome famous and notable people here today,” the actress Patrice Covington, who gave the farewell speech on behalf of the cast after the show, said to the audience. “I’m not going to call all of them out  —   I know you already know them,” she said, before pausing, looking in Mrs. Clinton’s direction, and waving at her mischievously. At that, the audience erupted into a new, loud round of applause. The reaction was substantially warmer than the scattered booing and clapping that greeted the arrival of Vice   Mike Pence when he attended “Hamilton,” just one block north, on Nov. 18. “We love you Hillary,” some audience members shouted. Several thanked Mrs. Clinton and told her, “God bless you. ” “God bless you,” Mrs. Clinton replied. Mrs. Clinton was besieged by   before the show, at intermission and as she was ushered out a side door after the musical ended (“Whoa!” said her husband as they left.) Jordan Serpone, 33, an audience member from Boston, said that spotting Mrs. Clinton was a surprisingly moving experience for him. “I was having every emotion I’ve tried to get rid of over the past few weeks,” he said during intermission. He shook her hand, but said he is still filled with frustration over her loss. “She shouldn’t be here. She should be planning her cabinet,” he said. Because the Sunday matinee was the last performance for the acclaimed production, which won last year’s Tony award for best musical revival, the crowd was starry: Among those in the audience were Jonathan Groff, Mariska Hargitay, Gayle King, Debra Messing, Leslie Odom Jr. Billy Porter, Phylicia Rashad and Anna Wintour. Public sightings of Mrs. Clinton in the weeks since the election have been sufficiently rare that they create a stir on social media. Strangers have sought photographs with her at stores and in the woods near her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. But Mrs. Clinton has indicated that she and her husband plan to attend the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president on Jan. 20. “The Color Purple” tells the searing story of a young black woman abused by her stepfather and her husband in rural Georgia in the early 20th century. The musical is an adaptation of a   1982 novel, by Alice Walker, which was awarded the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Steven Spielberg adapted the novel into a film in 1985, and Oprah Winfrey, who was featured in the film, went on to become an important champion, and   of the musical. The musical has been one of the most successful at attracting black audiences to Broadway. It first opened on Broadway in 2005, and features a book by Marsha Norman and music and lyrics by Stephen Bray, Brenda Russell and Allee Willis. The revival, which opened in 2015 and was directed by John Doyle, featured a   performance by the British actress Cynthia Erivo. She won a Tony award for best actress in a leading role in a musical. The last show took place on Ms. Erivo’s 30th birthday."

"TEHRAN  —   With the death of Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Sunday, Iran’s political factions knew immediately that any space by reformers to maneuver had just significantly decreased. Change had come, and it did not favor those seeking to turn Iran into a less revolutionary country with more tolerance and outreach to the West  —   especially the United States. Mr. Rafsanjani, a former president who helped found the Islamic republic, had been the one man too large to be sidelined by conservative  . Now he was suddenly gone, dead from what state media described as cardiac arrest  —   and with no one influential enough to fill his shoes. Iran’s   reformists and moderates, who would use Mr. Rafsanjani’s regular calls for more personal freedoms and requests to establish better relations with the United States to advance their political agendas, suddenly felt exposed and weakened. Who would now warn publicly against “Islamic fascism,” when the   sought to influence elections? Who would state openly that there should be a nuclear compromise? Mr. Rafsanjani said things others would not dare to say, all agreed, and his voice had at least created some tolerance for debates. “  will be happy, but this is the start of a period of anxiety for many,” said Fazel Meybodi, a cleric from the holy city Qum who supports reforms in Iran. “His death disturbs the fragile balance we had in Iran. ” There simply are no replacements for Mr. Rafsanjani, analysts from all factions say. His death also reflects the dwindling number of leaders from the generation that overthrew the shah nearly four decades ago. Most are now in their 80s or even older. “It is a very powerful reminder that Iran is at the beginning of a major leadership transition that will play a very psychological role in Iran’s politics,” said Vali R. Nasr, a Middle East scholar who is dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “I think this in some ways rattles Iran’s political system, in that it underscores the fact that with everything else going on  —   Syria, the nuclear deal  —   there will be a passing of the baton to the next generation,” Mr. Nasr said. Two of Mr. Rafsanjani’s most important protégés  —   Hassan Rouhani, the current president, and Mohammad Khatami, a former president  —   both owe their political careers to him. But Mr. Rouhani, up for   this year, is fighting for his political life. Mr. Khatami, who has been sidelined by conservative adversaries for years, is now even weaker. Mr. Rouhani managed to create a coalition to win the elections in 2013, with Mr. Rafsanjani’s support. Having successfully negotiated a nuclear agreement with the United States and other big powers, partly from encouragement by Mr. Rafsanjani, Mr. Rouhani promised a bright economic future for Iran  —   which has yet to happen. With the demise of his mentor and protector, Iran’s president will find it hard to gather the same level of support he received four years ago with the backing of Mr. Rafsanjani, analysts say. “He was a very powerful figure for Mr. Rouhani to rely upon,” said Mohammad Marandi, a professor at Tehran University who is close to Iran’s leaders. “Many worked with him because of that support. The passing of Mr. Rafsanjani complicates the president’s position and makes his   less certain. ” Mr. Khatami won presidential elections in 1997 after having received Mr. Rafsanjani’s support, and led Iran through an era of greater personal freedoms and Western outreach that was quashed by unelected,   centers of power. “It is Mr. Khatami who should take on the burden of the late Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani’s responsibility,” said Mohammadreza Shamsolvaezin, a former reformist politician and activist. But Mr. Khatami is all but paralyzed politically. The    judiciary has ordered all Iranian media not to carry his picture or even quote his website. Besides appearances at theater plays, religious gatherings and art exhibitions, Mr. Khatami has remained silent. Mr. Rafsanjani could speak more freely than others, not only because of his revolutionary credentials, but also because of his friendship with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whom he helped become supreme leader in 1989. Ayatollah Khamenei, who has skillfully played all Iranian factions, would never go as far as to completely isolate Mr. Rafsanjani, even when he supported protests that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election. While the presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest in 2011 for their criticisms, Mr. Rafsanjani was stripped of several functions but never purged. In a statement, Ayatollah Khamenei lamented the passing of Mr. Rafsanjani. Still, it was clear to many that Ayatollah Khamenei regarded him not only as a friend but a rival, whose absence could now make the role of supreme leader even more powerful. “The loss of a comrade and ally, with whom I share a friendship that dates back to 59 years ago, is difficult and ” said a statement posted on Ayatollah Khamenei’s website on Sunday. He also referred obliquely to their disagreements. “Differences in views and interpretations of Islamic law in various points of this long time could never break the friendship,” the statement said. “After him, I cannot think of anyone with whom I share such long history and experience along the highs and lows of historical moments. ”   joined in on the mourning, giving public statements of condolence, but with the realization that the political wind in Iran would now blow even more in their favor. For them Mr. Rafsanjani had been a wild card, who could evoke rulings from the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, that would oppose their rigid narrative of isolation and  . Mr. Rafsanjani was especially dangerous, they said, because of his conviction that Iran had changed and that establishing relations with the United States was the only way to secure the future of the Islamic republic. Mr. Rafsanjani also had cordial ties with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran’s principal rival in the Middle East, who share a mutual hostility with Ayatollah Khamenei.   also have faulted Mr. Rafsanjani for having founded a chain of affordable universities during the reconstruction that followed the     war. Some conservatives now blame these schools for having helped sow what they regard as the dangerous modernist aspirations of Iran’s middle class. Many conservatives in Iran also suspected Mr. Rafsanjani of having used his contacts to undercut Ayatollah Khamenei on issues where Ayatollah Khamenei would choose ideology over diplomacy. Mr. Rafsanjani preferred pragmatism and change to keep the ruling system in power. “The invisible hands of the late Ali Akbar Rafsanjani are gone,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a   political analyst who has close relations with many of Iran’s top leaders. “This means an end to secret meetings by reformists and moderates seeking closer ties with America from now on we can make decisions much easier and with more coordination. ”"
"Yesterday Flora went down the road for a chat with our deep-green neighbour, Professor Percival. She hoped this would earn green points for her in the Leafy-green Ladies Circle.
She came back agog: “Our Professor is flying business class to Canberra hoping to get on the climate cavalcade going to a classy conference in Paris soon. He says they have this important job to prepare the secret first draft of a new international treaty to save the world from your wicked coal-mining mates.”
I said they should put them all to work underground.
Later, I had a whinge about such travel rorts to our sensible neighbour, Fred McNally.
But Fred had a totally different view.
“It was not a bunch of airborne academics who concocted the Kyoto land grab that stopped me from feeding mulga to starving sheep – it was climate industry busybodies at their desks. Better if the whole green industry is kept in the air flying, or sipping champagne in Paris, rather than modelling carbon ration plans for us, or tramping over every proposed development site looking for skinks, toads and butterflies.”
“We should keep the whole lot in the air, all the time – it would cost the country a lot less.”

Alex Epstein's long-anticipated book, _The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels_, published by Penguin, comes out today! I reviewed it as, ""simply the best popular-market book about climate, environmental policy, and energy that I have read. Laymen and experts alike will be boggled by Epstein's clarity.""   
  
Alex recently sent us a brief essay based upon material in the book. Alex Epstein is President and Founder of the Center for Industrial Progress—an organization sowing the seeds of energy enthusiasm to counter the tide of climate alarmism. We asked Alex to share a few thoughts with our readers here at Cato; find them below.   
  
If you are in Washington, you might want to meet Alex. He will be giving a Hill Briefing in B-369 Rayburn at 9am on Friday, November 21.

But that’s not the graph that really matters. There is no intrinsically perfect global temperature and, if there was, we would expect it to be warmer. Until it became politically correct for temperature trends to warm, people around the world prayed for far more warming than we’ve experienced. There is no time in human history when it has been considered “too warm” for human beings.   
  
What matters is: is the climate becoming more or less _livable_? The key statistic here, one that is unfortunately almost never mentioned, is “climate-related deaths.”   
  
The best source I have found for this data is the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters International Disaster Database (OFDA/CRED EM-DAT), based in Brussels.1 It gathers data about disasters since 1900.   
  
Here is a graph comparing CO2 emissions, the alleged climate danger, to the number of climate-related deaths, which reflects actual climate danger to humans. It’s striking—as CO2 emissions rise, climate-related deaths plunge.   
  
[caption]  




 _Sources: Boden, Marland, Andres (2013); Etheridge et al. (1998); Keeling et al. (2001); MacFarling Meure et al. (2006); Merged IceCore Record Data, Scripps Institution of Oceanography; EM-DAT International Disaster Database_ [/caption]   
  
To make matters better, in reality the trend is even more dramatically downward, as before the 1970s many disasters went unreported. One big reason for this was lack of satellite data—we can now see the whole world, enabling us to track icecaps and disaster areas with relative ease. In 1950, if there was a disaster in the middle of what is now Bangladesh, would information have been accurately collected? In general, we can expect in more recent years, more deaths were recorded and in earlier years, fewer deaths were recorded. For some countries there is simply no good data, because in underdeveloped places like Haiti or Ethiopia we do not even know exactly how many people lived in a particular place before a disaster struck. Today we have much better information—and because disaster statistics are tied to aid, there is incentive to overreport.   
  
And the more we dig into the data, the stronger the correlations get.   
  
Here are a couple of striking numbers from the data: in the decade from 2004 to 2013, worldwide climate-related deaths (including droughts, floods, extreme temperatures, wildfires, and storms) plummeted to a level 88.6 percent below that of the peak decade, 1930 to 1939.2 The year 2013, with 29,404 reported deaths, had 99.4 percent fewer climate-related deaths than the historic record year of 1932, which had 5,073,283 reported deaths for the same category.3   
  
That reduction occurred despite more complete reporting, an incentive to declare greater damage to gain more aid, and a massively growing population, particularly in vulnerable places like coastal areas, in recent times.   
  
The climate catastrophists don’t want you to know this because it reveals how fundamentally flawed their viewpoint is. They treat the global climate system as a stable and safe place we make volatile and dangerous. In fact, the global climate system is _naturally_ volatile and dangerous—we make it _livable_ through development and technology—development and technology powered by the only form of cheap, reliable, scalable reliable energy that can make climate livable for 7 billion people.   
  
As the climate-related death data show, there are some major benefits—namely, the power of fossil-fueled machines to build a _durable_ civilization highly resilient to extreme heat, extreme cold, floods, storms, and so on. Why weren’t those mentioned in the discussion when we talked about storms like Sandy and Irene, even though anyone going through those storms was far more protected from them than he or she would have been a century ago?   
  
I have debated representatives of the three leading environmental organizations in the world—Greenpeace, Sierra Club and 350.org—including 350.org’s Bill McKibben, the leading environmentalist in the world today—and every time, I have _repeatedly_ mentioned the climate livability statistics. I raised it to Bill McKibben before I debated him and half a dozen times during my debate with him—he didn’t acknowledge it. He just called it “one number.” Yeah, one number, based on billions of empirical observations, that destroys billions of dollars worth of speculation.   
  
Why? Because the dogma that man is ruining the planet rather than improving it is a religion, a source of prestige, and a career for too many people. But for the rest of us, the statistic climate catastrophists don’t want us to know is very, very good news.

" Canadians will have many challenges in the coming year – one of them is the argument for or against carbon taxes. Be informed.  Here’s a collection of some of our more useful and popular resources.  Most of our material is written in plain language – we do provide some more technical material here.  For those who don’t enjoy reading, we’ve included some short videos. Please share and discuss these with family, friends and business associates.Dr. Judith Curry explains why carbon dioxide is not a control knob that can fine tune climate.https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/curry-senatetestimony-2014-final.pdf William Nordhaus versus the United Nations on Climate Change Economicshttps://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2018/MurphyNordhaus.html Excerpt: Consider, now, the scenario “Limit temp. to 1.5°C.” Recall that this is the IPCC’s current policy goal and that various environmental analysts and pundits also embrace it. Because Nordhaus just won the Nobel Prize for his work on climate change, one might suppose that his model would provide support for the UN’s goal. It doesn’t. As Table 1 indicates, Nordhaus’s model—at least as of its 2007 calibration—estimated that such a policy goal would make humanity $14 trillion poorer compared to doing nothing at all about climate change. Moreover, the $14 trillion magnitude of the net damages from the wrong policy—including what is now the UN’s goal—dwarfs the $3.07 trillion size of the net benefits from even the best theoretically possible policy. In light of Nordhaus’s calculations shown above, the apparently urgent need for “climate action” is not so urgent. It now looks more analogous to economists discovering the theoretical possibility of an “optimal tariff” but still understanding that free trade is the safest rule of thumb. Carbon Tax Reports, Video ClipsLet Them Eat Carbon: Rebutting Ecofiscal Commissionhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Let-Them-Eat-Carbon-FINAL-R-1-April-18-2018.pdfVideo: https://youtu.be/xBYbtQRzV2kCheckstop: Challenging the Canadian Federal Government’s Carbon Pollution Pricing Results report:http://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Challenging-the-Canadian-Federal-Government-FINAL-R-2-May-2-2018.pdfCarbon Kleptomania (Is there really such a thing as a carbon ‘dividend’??)https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Carbon-Kleptomania.pdfVideo: https://youtu.be/4jhvSyQ9Z2EAlberta Climate Plan – A Burden with No Benefit (technical)https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/AB_Climate%20Plan_Economic_Impact_Gregory_Tech.pdf McKitrick on Climate Change –a Plain Language Guide to Social Costs of Carbon (Carbon Taxes)https://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/McKitrick_Climate_Change_SCC_Feb_14_2015.pdf14 short, plain language video clips with Dr. Ross McKitrick, professor of economics at the University of Guelph, that explain carbon taxes and their failingsDr. McKitrick’s full presentation is here: (technical in nature)https://friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=750UN CLIMATE PANEL (IPCC) – We dispute their findings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s one that almost got past my radar.
Last September the leftist Berliner Zeitung (BZ) here reportsed on climate hypocrisy coming from Berlin, Germany’s socialist-green city government and the city’s mayor, Michael Müller.
The administration of Germany’s capital is really serious about climate change, so much so that they earnestly participated in an EU-sponsored action on getting more people out of those sinful cars and instead onto their feet and thus so achieve a more climate friendly form of mobility – it was all part of the “European Mobility Week”.
But according to the BZ, the pedestrian lifestyle (and going without flying) is not something that Berlin’s ruling green socialists are really into themselves, but rather it’s something for the millions of little climate-misbehaving people, who pay taxes and honestly should be there to serve the ruling class.
Traveling over in 16 luxury government limousines
The BZ’s Benedikt Teichmann reported how Berlin’s Transportation Senator Regine Günther (46, Green Party) had twittered about the European Mobility Week just a day earlier: “Join us, and leave the car at home.” But then just a day later, she and other members of Berlin’s Socialist-Green government “hopped into their large government cars to get to their meeting”.
According to the BZ, Berlin’s “Socialist, Communist-Green government drove over with 16 limousines to their pedestrian conference”, which took place near Berlin in Hellersdorf.
The European Mobility Week website proudly states that the event this year saw participants in 50 countries across the globe.

And according to its summary report here, organizers boasted of a new participation record: “EUROPEANMOBILITYWEEK 2019 had the highest participation rate ever witnessed since its launch in 2002 (3,135 participating towns and cities), surpassing the record set by the previous year’s campaign.”

When Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD Socialist Party) was asked why he and other members of his administration did not go to their meeting concerning pedestrian mobility by foot, or at least carpool in the spirit of environmental protection, he answered:
We all come from different places. And today when we all have our heavy files with us, it’s just not an option.”
What follows is the European Commission’s video promoting pedestrian mobility:

Unfortunately, few of the climate-rescuing politicians are following their own advice. For them it’s just too inconvenient, and walking is not that cool.

"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Some of the inmates were beheaded. Others had their hearts torn from their bodies. Gang leaders used the blood of their victims to write a nightmarish message of retribution: “Blood is paid for with blood. ” The harrowing scenes on Friday from the latest prison riot in Brazil, in which 31 inmates were killed in the northern state of Roraima in the Amazon River Basin, pushed the death toll to 93 in six days of mayhem in penitentiaries around the country. The bloodshed has shocked the country and is emerging as the most pressing crisis facing President Michel Temer, whose beleaguered government was already grappling with graft scandals, a weak economy and simmering anger over austerity measures. “The bloodshed is revealing a war between drug gangs, a failed prison system and a weak government,” said Rafael Alcadipani, a scholar who specializes in public security policies at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a leading Brazilian university. “And now the horror is spreading. ” Prison violence that has spilled out into neighboring communities has been a perennial problem in Brazil. In 2006, street fighting between the police and First Capital Command, a   gang, left almost 200 people dead in São Paulo, causing chaos in the city of 20 million people. The killings in Roraima came just days after 56 men were killed in a massacre at a prison in the city of Manaus. In two different riots at prisons this week in the states of Amazonas and Paraíba, six men were also killed. The violence at the Monte Cristo Agricultural Penitentiary in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, adds to fears about an intensifying war between drug gangs for control of the cocaine trade in the Amazon region in Brazil. The latest episode is thought to involve fighting between First Capital Command, commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P. C. C. which has roots in the prisons of São Paulo in southeastern Brazil, and supporters of Red Command, a drug trafficking organization that has long held sway in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities, however, tried to play down the possibility that warring gangs were to blame. The gangs, which operate inside prisons as well as on the streets of many Brazilian cities, are battling for supremacy over the trade in cocaine smuggled into Brazil across the porous Amazonian frontier from countries like Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. Family of the North, an increasingly influential gang in the Amazon that has allied itself with Red Command, was responsible for the attack at the prison in Manaus, massacring dozens of rivals from the P. C. C. gang. The attack had been planned for months, according to text messages intercepted by intelligence agents. Mr. Temer, the president, has been chided for what some have called a   response to the crisis. He said nothing for two days about the killings in Manaus, before calling them a “dreadful accident” and seeking to deflect blame from public agencies because a private contractor runs the prison there. Just months after emerging victorious in the battle to impeach his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, Mr. Temer is grappling with calls from some of his own allies to resign. In an effort to defend himself, he sent a message Thursday on Twitter listing synonyms for the word “accident”  —   tragedy, loss, disaster, disgrace and misfortune. Although the Manaus riot has fueled a debate over whether management of some prisons should be handed to private companies, the violence in Roraima casts scrutiny directly on state officials. The Boa Vista prison, which is run by the state, has a long history of deadly riots and inmate escapes. The prison was built for 700 inmates but currently holds about 1, 400. Carlos Paixão de Oliveira, a prosecutor in Roraima, publicly criticized the management of the facility in October, when inmates from the P. C. C. gang killed at least 10 rivals from Red Command. Mr. Oliveira suggested at the time that the prison should be demolished and replaced. “If they want, the inmates will carry out a new slaughter in there, because no one has control of that prison,” he said. Despite the writing in blood on Friday proclaiming the supremacy of the P. C. C. the authorities contended that the latest killings did not involve   between gangs but a power struggle within the P. C. C. itself, or an effort to project power by the gang. “We’ve been on guard about something like this for some time, transferring prisoners from Red Command to other units,” said Uziel Castro, the top security official in Roraima. “We think this had to do with an internal battle. ” Either way, the scenes from the Roraima penitentiary offered an unsettling reminder of how the bloodshed in the country’s prisons is a problem that has been building for decades, revealing a system hobbled by corruption, overcrowding and mismanagement. Human rights groups compare the current string of uprisings to the Carandiru prison massacre in 1992 in São Paulo, when the police stormed the facility and killed 111 inmates. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings. The problems in Brazil’s prisons that led to earlier episodes of carnage have intensified with the growing drug trade, security experts say. Brazil’s prison population has swelled this century as the authorities lock up more people on minor drug offenses. Brazil now has a prison population exceeding half a million, with about 40 percent of detainees awaiting trial. Drug gangs that originated in prisons are expanding their sway and battling one another for territorial control of the trade. “This war between the criminal factions is worsening,” said Antonio Cláudio Mariz de Oliveira, a former security official in São Paulo. “The problem is largely a result of the lack of attention towards the prison system, both by the government and the public. ” “People only react when there’s an episode like this,” said Mr. Mariz de Oliveira. “Then they forget about it until the next one. ” Indeed, some elected officials have expressed the hardened views held by   voters. José Melo, the governor of Amazonas State, said “there were no saints” among the dozens of inmates killed in the state’s prisons this week, calling the victims murderers, rapists or gang members. At the same time, officials in Mr. Temer’s administration have tried to play down the prison crisis. “The situation is not out of control,” said Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes."
"**A councillor is set to be appointed to deliver food justice and tackle food poverty in a local authority area.**
The plan also aims to see a non-profit organisation set up to help people learn to cook, eat a healthy diet, grow their own food and waste less food.
Powys council has been looking into the extent of the problem and what can be done since July.
A meeting will now be arranged for councillors to discuss findings on the extent of the problems.
Newtown East councillor Joy Jones, who is also its anti-poverty champion, has been nominated as a possible lead member with responsibility of delivering food justice, according to the Local Democracy Reporting service."
"**A third of the poorest countries in the world are dealing with high levels of obesity as well as under-nourishment, which leaves people too thin, according to a report in The Lancet.**
It says the problem is caused by global access to ultra-processed foods, and people exercising less.
The authors are calling for changes to the ""modern food system"" which they believe to be driving it.
Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are most affected.
The report estimates that nearly 2.3 billion children and adults on the planet are overweight, and more than 150 million children have stunted growth.
And many low and middle-income countries are facing these two issues at once - known as the 'double burden of malnutrition'.
This means that 20% of people are overweight, 30% of children under four are not growing properly, and 20% of women are classified as thin.
Communities and families can be affected by both forms of malnutrition, as well as individual people at different points in their lives, the report says.
According to the report, 45 out of 123 countries were affected by the burden in the 1990s, and 48 out of 126 countries in the 2010s.
By the 2010s, 14 countries with some of the lowest incomes in the world had developed this 'double problem' since the 1990s.
The report authors say action should be taken by governments, the United Nations and academics to address the problem, and it points the finger at changing diets.
The way people eat, drink and move is changing. Increasing numbers of supermarkets, easy availability of less nutritious food, as well as a decrease in physical activity, are leading to more people becoming overweight.
And these changes are affecting low and middle-income countries, as well as high-income ones.
Although stunted growth of children in many countries is becoming less frequent, eating ultra-processed foods early in life is linked to poor growth.
""We are facing a new nutrition reality,"" says lead author Dr Francesco Branca, director of the department of nutrition for health and development at the World Health Organization.
""We can no longer characterise countries as low-income and undernourished, or high-income and only concerned with obesity.
""All forms of malnutrition have a common denominator - food systems that fail to provide all people with healthy, safe, affordable, and sustainable diets.""
Dr Branca said changing this needed changes in food systems - from production and processing, through trade and distribution, pricing, marketing, and labelling, to consumption and waste.
""All relevant policies and investments must be radically re-examined,"" he said.
According to the report, it contains:
High-quality diets reduce the risk of malnutrition by encouraging healthy growth, development, and the body's protection against diseases throughout life."

When it comes to the press, the _New York Times_ pretty much defines “mainstream.”   
  
  
And Justin Gillis is the _Times’_ mainstream reporter on the global warming beat.   
  
  
So it is somewhat telling, that his article on Tuesday, “A Change in Temperature,” was largely dedicated (although begrudgingly) to facing up to the possibility that mainstream estimates (i.e., those produced by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) of climate sensitivity are too large.   
  
  
Readers of this blog are probably well aware of the reasons why.   
  
  
Despite our illusions of grandeur, this blog isn’t the mainstream press –although we do seek to influence it. Maybe we are being successful.   
  
  
Throughout Gillis’ article are sprinkled references to “climate contrarians,” and even the recognition of the effort by such contrarians to push the new science on low climate sensitivity to the forefront of the discussion to change the existing politics of climate change.   
  
  
Gillis writes:   




Still, the recent body of evidence — and the political use that climate contrarians are making of it to claim that everything is fine — sheds some light on where we are in our scientific and public understanding of the risks of climate change.



We at the Cato’s Center for the Study of Science are at the leading edge of efforts to present a more accurate representation of the scientific of climate change through our testimony to Congress, public comments and review of government documents and proposals, media appearances, op‐​eds, and serial posts on this blog, among other projects. We emphasize that current regulations and proposed legislation are based on outdated, and likely wrong, projections of future climate impacts from human carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels to produce energy.   
  
  
Gillis recognizes the positives of a low climate sensitivity value:   




“…tantalizing possibility that climate change might be slow and limited enough that human society could adapt to it without major trauma.”   
  
  
“It will certainly be good news if these recent papers stand up to critical scrutiny, something that will take at least a year or two to figure out.”   
  
  
“So if the recent science stands up to critical examination, it could indeed turn into a ray of hope…”



But, the “mainstream” is slow to change. And so despite the good news about climate sensitivity, Gillis closes his article by pointing out that, in his opinion, the political response to climate change has been “weak” (contrary to our view), and that therefore:   




Even if climate sensitivity turns out to be on the low end of the range, total emissions may wind up being so excessive as to drive the earth toward dangerous temperature increases.



Clearly we still have work to do, but there are signs of progress!

"The 2007 film, “The Great Global Warming Swindle”:

"
"Don’t worry. It’s totally natural. There’s no mother ship hovering above the earth, waiting to carry you away, and no demon shooting light from beneath, signaling to pull you below. It’s a light pillar  —   or a few of them  —   a colorful column of sparkling light that appears to beam up toward the sky. It’s all just an icy illusion. And now, during winter, when nights are long and cold, you have a good chance to spot one as long as conditions are right. If you’re lucky enough to spot a light pillar, what you’re seeing is actually artificial light from a ground source reflecting off millions of floating ice crystals. “It’s not an upward beam of light,” said Les Cowley, a physicist who runs a website on atmospheric optics, or the way light travels through the atmosphere. “Although they look pretty, they’re also a sign that someone, somewhere could do better with their lighting. You might call them light pollution pillars if you wanted to be environmental about it. ” Light pillars occur when   clouds  —   normally miles high in the atmosphere  —   cling closer to the Earth’s surface, just a hundred or a few thousand feet above it. These thin clouds contain millions of flat, hexagonal crystals of ice that float horizontally in the air Each ice crystal acts like a mirror pointed downward, reflecting the artificial light back to your eyes  —   as long as the cloud is about halfway between you and the light source. Together, the crystals form a cluster of mirrors floating at different heights, which allows you to see the light as a column if they all were at the same level, you’d see only a spot of light. The pillars can be quite colorful at times because each reflected beam is the same color as its source. To find a good source  —   one bright, close to the ground, and just far enough away  —   your best bet is to travel a few miles outside your city or town on a dark night. The weather doesn’t have to be frigid, but it helps. Light pillars are frequently spotted in Scandinavia, upstate New York, Canada and other cold spots in the winter. But Dr. Cowley said that this week he received a photo of light pillars from about 30 miles outside of a town in Iran  —   perhaps because the desert can get cold at night. If leaving the city is not an option, look up at streetlights on a freezing cold night. You may spot the sparkly, ghostly blur of diamond dust. This illusion is created by the same flat ice crystals that produce light pillars, but this time, they’re so low to the ground you can feel them prickling your skin. “When that happens, you see other nearby halos, and it’s quite a spectacular sight,” Dr. Cowley said."
"Every public housing complex in America is filled with individual tales of struggle and survival. This is the story of a dapper man in a black fedora who lives in unit 16G in the Bronx. His name is Souleymane Guengueng, and he brought down a murderous African dictator. In the 1980s, Mr. Guengueng was one of numerous people imprisoned and tortured during the brutal reign of President Hissène Habré in Chad, a landlocked country in central Africa. When he was released from prison after two and a half years, Mr. Guengueng began a quest for justice, meticulously recording the testimonies of survivors and the relatives of those who had been killed at the direction of Mr. Habré. He wound up with records detailing the abuse and murder of more than 700 people. Human rights advocates collected his accounts and used them as critical pieces of evidence to pursue criminal action against Mr. Habré. The legal case was not an easy one. Finding a court to prosecute a head of state proved difficult. For more than 16 years, the case bounced between nations and continents, with Mr. Guengueng offering his personal plea for justice to anyone who would listen. In May, in Dakar, Senegal, where Mr. Habré had lived in exile, the dictator was finally convicted. Next week, a court there will hear his appeal. On the day of the guilty verdict, a defiant Mr. Habré, wearing dark glasses and with his head wrapped in white scarves as though he were bracing for a desert storm, raised his fists and yelled to supporters in the courtroom. Mr. Guengueng was in the courtroom, too, his trademark hat on the seat beside him, flanked by human rights advocates who had pursued justice against other dictators. He had been a key witness in the trial. Tears spilled from his eyes, a mix of pride and revenge and sadness and relief. “It was like an    experience for me,” Mr. Guengueng, 67, said. “Habré is in prison now. Habré must be saying, ‘Look at me now, he’s in this place and I’m in prison.’ ” For Mr. Guengueng, “this place” is a tidy,   apartment in the Bronx, one of 160 apartments in a towering public housing complex on a busy, nondescript New York City street. In the human rights world, Mr. Guengueng is a celebrity, sometimes even stopped on the street by people who recognize him when he travels across the globe. In New York, he is another face in the crowd. Mr. Guengueng first came to the United States in 2002 from his   home in Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, to accept a human rights award. He met the actor Samuel L. Jackson, cruised California’s State Route 1 along the Pacific coast in a convertible and detoured to check out     Calif. (“Très chic!” he said, eyebrows raised.) He returned to Chad, where most people live on less than $5 a day, to his job as an accountant at the Lake Chad Basin Commission, a multinational group that manages resources around the lake. His vocal activism in pursuing legal action against Mr. Habré was wearing on the commission, Mr. Guengueng said, and he lost his job. Mr. Guengueng blames his work with the commission for getting him into trouble with Mr. Habré’s government in the first place. At one point during Mr. Habré’s presidency, the commission had moved its headquarters to nearby Cameroon, and Mr. Guengueng presumes that Mr. Habré’s supporters passing through must have labeled the civil servants there political enemies. In 2005, while living in Chad, Mr. Guengueng had a tear in his retina. He had long worn   glasses because of vision problems, and he said he suspected his time in prison had aggravated his condition. Reed Brody, a former Human Rights Watch lawyer who doggedly pursued the case against Mr. Habré, arranged for Mr. Guengueng to fly to New York for medical care. He recovered in Mr. Brody’s apartment in Brooklyn, taking long walks in Prospect Park. While his eyes were healing he started hearing from friends and family members that his life might be at risk if he returned home. Mr. Habré was ousted in a 1990 coup, but he still had many supporters in Chad. With the help of Human Rights Watch, Mr. Guengueng successfully applied for asylum in America. Soon, he brought his wife and seven children to New York. Then financial troubles and bad luck set in. Mr. Guengueng was on the Human Rights Watch payroll, working on the criminal case from New York. But that work ran out. He was hired as a night watchman. But in 2007 during a stroll on the Coney Island Boardwalk, he fell and broke his leg. His recovery was long, and he lost his job. His oldest daughter supported the family with a restaurant job. But she became ill and died, leaving the family with little income. Home life was tense. Mr. Guengueng is trilingual, but English has been difficult. Taking classes has not helped. In New York, his wife felt as if she had lost her independence living in an unfamiliar place where she did not speak the language. And New York was cold. In Chad, afternoon temperatures rarely dipped below 90 degrees. Mr. Guengueng did not give up. He and some friends pooled their resources to buy a deli but lost the money when the deal fell apart. He enrolled in a course to learn medical coding and billing but could not find a job in that field. He tried driving a taxi but the work aggravated his leg, which has never been the same since the break. His wife took a babysitting course but had no space to care for children. Back in Chad, another daughter died in a fire. Mr. Guengueng was interspersing his daily tribulations with work on the Habré case, flying with Mr. Brody to courts worldwide to personally plead for justice. “He’s a hero,” Mr. Brody said. “He’s done so much to change history. Yet his    life is one of hardships and heartbreaks. ” The family moved from a friend’s home on Long Island to a tiny rental in Queens. They could not keep up with the $2, 000 a month rent and were evicted. Three and a half years ago, Mr. Guengueng’s family had to move into a homeless shelter, where they were crammed into two rooms. Determined to find something better, he practically memorized the intricacies of New York’s housing laws as he searched for   housing. Finally, in March, the family left the shelter and moved into their current apartment in the Bronx. He lives there with three of his children the others are now grown and have moved out. Most speak English, and one son, Jacob, 25, graduated from college and is an Uber driver. On a recent afternoon at Mr. Guengueng’s apartment, a film from Ivory Coast was on the television. Mr. Brody arrived to see his old friend. Mr. Guengueng insisted on pulling his dusty human rights awards and statuettes from his closet. He carefully fingered them like gemstones. Mr. Guengueng will be in court next week for the appeal, but his long obsession with the case is finished. “It’s like a psychological healing has taken place,” said Mr. Guengueng, whose face is marked by deep tribal scars. “If I had just allowed this situation to persist and had a normal life I would have felt incomplete. Like I was half a man. ” The case also was   for Mr. Brody. He left his job with Human Rights Watch this past summer and has taken on volunteer legal work for now. “We’re both unemployed,” Mr. Guengueng said, nudging Mr. Brody and laughing. Despite the hardships in New York, Mr. Guengueng calls his time in America a success. His family has health care. His children have an education. He and most of his family have become American citizens. And Mr. Guengueng is thrilled with his new apartment. “We’re in paradise now,” he said. Mr. Guengueng, who says he is too old to find a good job, spends his days shuffling between municipal offices for food stamps and housing allowances. Every once in a while, the grind is broken by a   dinner in Manhattan where he receives awards for his work. He wants to create a foundation where he can advise other victims like himself, but he has yet to find a major donor. His own hardship is over. “Now,” he said, “I think about the others. ”"
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, a former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior.The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment is a U.K.-based foundation that conducts studies and prepares policy briefs in support of the United Nations goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. In an October, 2018 policy brief entitled, Aligning National and International Climate Targets, it examined the extent to which the countries that adhered to the COP21 Paris Agreement in December 2015 have moved beyond setting general objectives to setting specific economy-wide emissions reductions targets, sector-specific targets, and then embodying these targets in specific laws and policies. The brief can be read here: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Aligning-national-and-international-climate-targets.pdf The brief argued that setting very specific targets and embodying them in laws and policies was important for four reasons: Setting “robust, consistent, and measurable” targets will facilitate monitoring of progress towards the attainment of country and international goals;Setting national quantified targets informs the design, implementation, tracking and revision of policies and measures;Setting transparent and robust targets supports political momentum, establishing benchmarks and “new norms of leadership on climate policy”; andThe Paris Agreement includes a ratcheting mechanism, which stipulates that countries shall prepare successive “Nationally Determined Contributions” (NDCs) every five years that “represent a progression beyond the Party’s current NDC, and reflect their highest possible ambition”. Concrete targets can serve as benchmarks to track the ratcheting up of ambition. One might be forgiven for viewing this endorsement of emissions reduction targets in a skeptical light. For the most part, since countries began setting GHG emission reduction targets in 1992, in almost no case have the targets actually been met. This is certainly the case for Canada. Every few years, however, another international conference is held at which countries discuss the desirability to imposing on themselves, collectively and individually, even more restrictive targets. COP21, in fact, represented the first time that the countries of the world recognized that they could not collectively set emission reduction targets because of the political and policy discord among them. That is why they committed only to submitting plans, individually determined, every five years. There is no legal requirement under the Paris Agreement for an individual country to set a target. In practice, emission reduction targets have served primarily  not as public administration management tools but rather as political commitments, usually well beyond a country’s ability to meet at acceptable cost. Environmental organizations have used these public commitments to shame governments that fail to take more stringent measures. Politicians have been caught in the Catch-22 situation of having to choose between being publicly berated for failing to commit to an ambitious target to please the environmental lobby, or being publicly berated every year when the emissions reductions inevitably failed to materialize. In any event, the Grantham Institute’s review of the performance of the signatories to the Paris Agreement since 2015 is quite revealing, in ways the Institute undoubtedly did not intend. While 157 of the 197 Parties to the Agreement have set economy-wide emissions reductions targets in their NDCs, only 58 have done so with domestic laws and policies, and only 17 of those are consistent with the targets set out in the NDCs. For the rest, there is insufficient data for comparison. Expressed in other terms, only 9 % of the signatories of the Paris Agreement have gone beyond general political commitments to express their emissions reduction objectives in law or policy that are consistent with the political commitments. The target planning horizons of countries differ. Conferences before 2015 led to the establishment of 2020 as one target-base year. COP21 extended that to 2030. Today, while most (142) countries have set 2030 targets in their NDCs, only 33 countries have set economy-wide targets in laws and policies beyond 2020. In fact, when the Institute examined all the targets set to date (including both economy-wide and sectoral targets) only 60% of them have a target year later than 2020. The Grantham policy brief recommended, of course, that more countries introduce targets in laws and policies. Reading the Grantham Institute brief, one cannot help but be impressed by the gulf between its focus on emission reduction targets as bureaucratic, legal and political instruments and the emission reduction demands being made of countries by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).According to the International Energy Agency, the global GHG emissions from fuel combustion in 2016 (the most recent year published by the IEA) were 32.3 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent. Those emissions arise from two groups, the 36 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED), the more developed countries, and the rest of the world, generally considered the developing countries. All of the OECD countries combined produced 11.6 Gt, or 36% of the total. The non-OECD countries combined produced 20.7 Gt, or 64% of the total. China alone produced 9.1 Gt.In its Special Report 15 of October, 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that global emissions must be reduced by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030; otherwise, it predicted a warming of 1.5 degrees C. sometime between 2030 and 2050, bringing “species extinction, weather extremes, and risks to food supply, health and economic growth.” As global emissions from fuel combustion were 30.5 Gt in 2010, that means emissions would have to decline to 16.78 Gt, or 15.5 Gt from 2016 levels, by 2030.Virtually all major authorities that publish analyses of global energy supply, demand and emissions project emissions to grow, not decline, by 2030. However, even if all economic and emissions growth could somehow be reduced to 2016 levels and frozen there until 2030, the emissions from the non-OECD countries alone (i.e. 20.7 Gt) would exceed the level that the IPCC claims must be the global maximum by 2030.In other words, even if the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada and all the other 36 countries of the OECD ceased to exist and did not emit one gram of GHGs by 2030, the IPCC goal would not be met. When no “target” short of oblivion would align with the IPCC’s analysis of the needed emissions reduction, the OECD countries either must question the IPCC’s analysis and objectives, or take a far more jaded approach to setting domestic targets and incurring large emission reduction costs.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels, Director for the Center for the Study of Science, reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press. Occasionally — as in this edition — we examine recent global warming perceptions that are at odds with reality.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this Wisdom, which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication in conjunction with the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication have just released the most recent of their periodic surveys on American’s thoughts about global warming. 1,061 adults across the country were questioned during September about it and extreme weather events across the U.S.



Given that we are supposed to know what we are talking about, we’re going to answer a few of the chief questions. 



But first, a complaint. The Yale/​GMU survey has many of the bad aspects of “push” polling, where the design assures a certain answer. Here’s a related example from a recent University of Illinois survey by Peter Doran:



We constantly hear the meme that this “96 per cent of climate scientists surveyed say global warming is real”. That’s based on Doran’s survey, and is an artifact of the way the question was asked, which was, “when compared with pre‐​1800 levels do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?” Actually, 100% should have answered “risen”. It’s irrefutable that the 17th century was colder than the 20th. The subsequent question, on human attribution, was also worded in such a way that also guaranteed a lot of agreement. If properly designed, the survey would have asked how much was related to human activity, not just whether humans were involved in the temperature change. 



The planet’s surface temperature is higher than it was 100 years ago, and so is the temperature of the U.S. It’s not whether or not it’s warmer, it’s “how much warmer” and “what are the implications?”. 



So with that in mind, let’s move on to some of the main questions asked by the Yale/​GMU pollsters.



Survey Question: “How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements [sic]: “Global warming is affecting weather in the United States?” (strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree, don’t know/​no answer)



Answer: _Somewhat agree. On a scale of 0 (completely disagree) to 100 (completely agree) we would score our answer at 55._



Brief Rationale: Global warming has to affect “the weather” in the United States, or anywhere else. Big deal. Changing the radiative properties of the atmosphere — which is what increasing carbon dioxide does — must alter the character of weather events as well as the climate. But how much? In reality, _the amount of weather related to natural variability dramatically exceeds what is “added on”_ by global warming. This is obvious from a look at the “Climate Extremes Index” from the National Climatic Data Center (Figure 1).





While it is true that this index has risen from a low point around 1970, it is also clear that it merely returned to values observed in the early 20th century. Did greenhouse gases raise the extremes index in the early 20th century? Obviously not.



Survey Results:





Comments: The survey results seem to pretty much square with our opinion. “Somewhat agree” is the answer with the greatest percentage of response, and there is a relatively even split of respondents on either side of that. But our guess is that most of those who “somewhat agree” are probably thinking that global warming is affecting the weather in a way that can be perceived as separated from normal variability, which is not the case. 



People are answering this Yale/​GMU survey question correctly, but for the wrong reason. This is reflected in the next question.



Survey Question: Some people say that global warming made each of the following events worse. How much do you agree or disagree? (strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree)



• The current drought in the Midwest and the Great Plains?



Answer: _Strongly disagree. Score: 0_



Rationale: There is no correlation between global temperatures and drought in the United States (Figure 2). We wrote on this when NASA’s James Hansen was hyping this story: (http://​www​.world​cli​matere​port​.com/​i​n​d​e​x​.​p​h​p​/​2​0​1​2​/​0​8​/​1​4​/​h​a​n​s​e​n​-​i​s​-​w​rong/)





• The severe storm (known as a “derecho”) that knocked down trees and power lines from Indiana to Washington D.C. in June of 2012



Answer: _Strongly disagree. Score: 0_



Rationale: Derechos are thunderstorms with damaging straight‐​line winds, as opposed to tornadoes, which form from strong thunderstorms that have a rotational component. If there were any relationship between derechos and global warming, we would also be seeing an increase in tornadoes. While the new Doppler radars detect many more weak tornadoes than earlier technology, no one needs a radar to see a Fujita‐​scale 3, 4 or 5 storm, and there’s simply no trend in their frequency. Perhaps even more interesting is that constant‐​dollar and value‐​adjusted damages from tornadoes are going down, according to a paper recently accepted for publication by University of Colorado’s Roger Pielke, Jr. 



• This year’s record forest fires in Colorado and elsewhere in the American West?



Answer: _Strongly Disagree. Score: 20_



Rationale: Historically, warm and dry periods are linked to more Western fires. While Colorado has experienced some substantial droughts since the turn of the century, the integrated dryness (moisture deficit multiplied by time) has yet to reach that of the 1930s, which was before substantial emissions of greenhouse gases. In the Northwest, another center of fire activity this year, there is simply no trend whatsoever in dryness in recent decades. Further, paleo‐​climatic indicators show much more severe and prolonged western droughts — particularly in the 17th century — than those currently being experienced. 



• Record high Summer temperatures in the U.S. in 2012?



Answer: _Somewhat agree. Score: 55_



Brief Rationale: As its name implies, “global warming” puts an ongoing pressure on temperatures to increase, both in the global average, as well as in regions such as the U.S. 



But the linkage, while statistically significant, is quite weak. Generally speaking, global average seasonal temperatures explain about 20% of the year‐​to‐​year variability in U.S. seasonal temperatures. While that is statistically significant, it also means that the 80% of the remaining variability is related to things other than global warming. 



The largest number of statewide temperature records were set in the 1920s and 30s, and, warming or not, they have yet to be exceeded. In fact, what is peculiar about these state records is the lack of them during the relatively warm recent 15 years. What that shows is that single daily records are caused by atmospheric circulation anomalies of true rarity, and individual events cannot be scientifically related to a larger‐​scale global phenomenon except to note that the _probability_ of an extreme temperature event should be elevated. “Should” &mndash; because of the odd paucity of recent state records. 



• The unusually warm Spring across the United States in 2012?



Answer: _Somewhat agree. Score: 60_



Rationale: See explanation above. Score raised from 50 to 60 because greenhouse‐​gas‐​induced warming should concentrate more in cold air (i.e. the beginning of Spring) than in the hot air of summer.



• The unusually warm Winter across the United States in 2011–2012?



Answer: _Somewhat agree. Score: 70_



Rationale: See the explanations above. That does not mean that every winter will be warm and relatively snow‐​free, like last year. Everyone in the eastern U.S. still remembers the very cold and snowy winter of 2009-10. 



Survey results:





Comments: The public’s perception of a single derecho as significant flies in the face of 60 years of good tornado data (the relationship between the two is noted above), and it is very easy to examine historical drought data for global warming‐​related trends. Averaged across the nation, there aren’t any. There has been an increase in drought frequency in the Southwest, but there is an equal and opposite tendency for increasing wetness in the Northeast.



Question: “In your opinion, over the past several years, has the weather in the U.S. been… (much worse, somewhat worse, about the same, somewhat better, much better)?”



Answer: _About the same. Score: 50_



Brief Rationale: This is a pretty subjective question. What is better or worse weather? Is more rain better or worse? Are higher temperatures better or worse? Perhaps some would consider the amount of damage that is caused by the weather to be an indication of weather quality (i.e., goodness or badness). In that case, once the damage estimates are adjusted to account for changes in inflation, wealth, and population, there are no detectable trends. 



Survey results:





Comments: Most of the respondents seem to have got this answer wrong. Although, as we mentioned above, the question is a largely a qualitative one. We like big snowstorms, so we would consider a winter without them to be worse than a winter with many. Many other folks hold the opposite view. The same goes for virtually all weather events, with perhaps the exception of tornadoes (although the annual army of storm chasers may disagree).



Question: “Have each of the following types of extreme weather events become more or less common in your local area over the past few decades? Would you say much more common, somewhat more common, somewhat less common, much less common, or has it stayed about the same?



• Very heavy rainstorms?



• Droughts?



• Heat waves?



Answer: The correct answer to the questions above depends on where you live. For instance, if you live in the Northeast, the frequency of heavy rains has been increasing, but that has not been in the case if you live in the Northwest.



The Southwest has seen an increase in drought conditions during the past few decades, while nearly everywhere else in the country has not, and the Northeast has gotten wetter. Averaged across the country, there is simply no trend in drought. 



And while the Upper Midwest has seen little change in summer heat waves over the past several decades, residents of the Southeast may have noticed in increase over the same time period. Very few statewide temperature records are from recent years, with the largest number of decadal records set in the 1930s — and these still stand.



Again, the question “how much” should be asked. We (Pat Michaels and Chip Knappenberger) published a paper a few years back in which we examined precipitation on the heaviest day of the year around the country. Indeed, we found an increase. But before getting too worked up, consider the important question of “how much”. The fact is that rainfall on the heaviest day of the year, averaged across the country, has increased a grand total of 0.26 inches in the last 100 years, something no one could “notice.”





Survey results:





The Yale/​GMU pollsters consistently produce results which suggest that American’s are much more concerned about global warming than is indicated by the results of most other polling agencies (see here for further examples, http://​sci​ence​and​pub​licpol​i​cy​.org/​i​m​a​g​e​s​/​s​t​o​r​i​e​s​/​p​a​p​e​r​s​/​o​r​i​g​i​n​a​l​s​/​n​o​_​e​n​e​r​g​y​_​t​a​x​e​s.pdf). 



Finally, a more telling measure of public concern is how much money people are willing to spend to mitigate global warming. According to a recent survey from Stanford University, the answer is not much: http://woods.stanford.edu/docs/surveys/GW-Policy-Trend-2010–2012-1.pdf.

Guest essay by Larry Hamlin
The Green New Deal (GND) and California’s SB 100 are both draconian and completely unrealistic pipe dreams that politically mandate “100% renewable electricity” for the U.S. and California respectively.
A new 117 page study from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) has determined that these politically contrived schemes of “100% renewable energy” are self defeating because of the inherent unreliability of renewables which results in significant GHG emissions occurring from the unavoidable need for backup dispatchable and reliable fossil generation. This backup fossil generation is required to provide grid stability functions including frequency, voltage and synchronization control, daily system load ramping and to prevent power shortages and blackouts.

The AEI study evaluated the GND proposed scheme presented to Congress and concluded that any attempt to mandate “100% renewable electricity” that could achieve the necessary outcome of preserving electric system grid stability and reliability requires that backup fossil generation be operating to deal with the inherent and unavoidable unreliability of renewables thus yielding the result that significant GHG emissions cannot be avoided.
The AEI study found that the amount of fossil backup generation required for a 100% GND renewable generation scenario for the U.S. would result in GHG emissions the equivalent of 35% of the emissions levels that occurred from all U.S. power generation in the year 2017.
Accordingly unless the U.S. is willing to abandon electric grid system stability and reliability and knowingly accept that significant periods of unreliable electric grid stability along with power shortages and blackouts will occur throughout the U.S. there is no choice but to acknowledge that GHG emissions cannot be avoided with a 100% renewable generation political mandate.
This same outcome occurs at the state level as well where the 100% renewable generation electric grid stability and reliability failings must be addressed either through importing backup fossil generation via transmission links, operating through the use of in-state backup fossil generation or a combination of both these backup fossil generation options.
The AEI study summary concludes the following regarding the impracticality of trying to operate a reliable and stable 100% renewable energy system:  
“Because of the need for conventional backup generation to avoid blackouts in a “100 percent renewable system” and because those backup units would have to be cycled up and down depending on wind and sunlight conditions, one ironic effect would be GHG emissions from natural gas–fired backup generation 22 percent higher than those resulting in 2017 from all natural gas–fired power generation. And those backup emissions would be over 35 percent of the emissions from all power generation in 2017.
Without fossil-fired backup generation, the national and regional electricity systems would be characterized by a significant decline in service reliability — that is, a large increase in the frequency and duration of blackouts. Battery backup technology cannot solve this problem. It is unlikely that a power system characterized by regular, widespread service interruptions would be acceptable to a large majority of Americans. Accordingly, the emissions effects of backup generation as just described in fact would be observed, which is to say that to a significant degree the GND is self-defeating in its asserted climate goals. That is another reason to conclude that the true goals are an expansion of wealth transfers to favored interests and the power of government to command and allocate resources. Moreover, the reduction in individual and aggregate incomes attendant upon the GND policies would yield a reduction in the collective political willingness to invest in environmental protection over time.”
The GND proposal scheme articulates among its fanciful provisions the following regarding 100% renewable electricity:
And “it is the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal,” the goals of which “should be accomplished through a 10-year national mobilization . . . that will require the following goals and projects—”
• “Eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible”;
• “Meeting100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources . . . by dramatically expanding and upgrading renewable power sources”;
The AEI GND report provides the following assessment of the significant and intractable problems facing any attempt to implement a stable and reliable 100% renewable electricity system:
“It is technically impossible for a 100 percent renewable power system, as defined in the GND, or anything approximating it to avoid both frequent service interruptions (“blackouts”) and a far smaller decline than commonly assumed in emissions of conventional pollutants and GHG. In other words, service interruptions are a crucial problem under a 100 percent renewable power system, a problem that can be addressed only with conventional backup capacity. This observation requires a brief primer on the operation of an electric power system.
Electric energy in large amounts cannot be stored at low cost in batteries due to technological limitations; only indirect storage in the form of water in dams is economic. (The problems with battery storage are discussed in Chapter 4.) This reality means that the production and consumption of electricity in a given power network must be balanced constantly to prevent blackouts and more generally to preserve the expected reliability of the system.
Because unexpected surges in demand and/or outages of generating equipment can occur, backup generation capacity must be maintained; such backup capacity is termed the “operating reserve” for the given network. This operating reserve is of two types; the first is the “spinning reserve”—that is, generators already connected to the network, the output of which can be increased by raising the torque applied to the generating turbines. The typical system requirement is that spinning reserves be 50 percent or more of total operating reserves. The second component of operating reserves is the supplemental reserve, which comprises generation capacity that can be brought on line within five to 10 minutes and/or electric power that can be obtained quickly from other networks or by withholding power being distributed to other networks. Additional reserve capacity often is provided by generators that require up to an hour to come on line; this backup capacity is not included in measures of the operating reserve for a system because of the length of time required for availability.
Electric supply systems respond to growing demands (“load”) over the course of a day (or year) by increasing output from the lowest-cost generating units first and then calling on successively more expensive units as electric loads grow toward the daily (or seasonal) peak. (“Baseload” units run more or less constantly except for scheduled and unscheduled downtime.) Electric generation capacity fueled by renewable energy sources is not “dispatchable”; that is, it is not available on demand because wind and sunlight are intermittent. In other words, system planning and optimization cannot be based on an assumption that it will be available to provide power to the grid when it is expected to be most economic. Accordingly, it cannot be scheduled: It requires backup generation capacity to preserve system reliability.
Several studies have concluded that wind capacity does not impose large reliability costs on a given power system as long as the wind generation remains about 10–20 percent or less of system out- put, because the intermittent nature of wind resources given a small market share has effects similar to those of unexpected outages and other familiar problems characterizing conventional generation.51 At the same time, outages of wind capacity due to weak wind conditions are much more likely to be correlated geographically than is the case for outages of conventional plants, for the obvious reason that weak winds in part of a given region are likely to be observed in tandem with weak winds in other parts of that region. Because appropriate sites for utility-scale solar facilities (and rooftop photovoltaic systems) are concentrated geographically, the same correlation problem is likely to affect solar electric generation as well.
The problem of frequency regulation and grid stability—related to but distinct from the intermittency problem—created by a large expansion of non-dispatchable power generation is well-known.52 In brief, most US generating capacity is alternating current (AC) and must be synchronized at 60 hertz. Because generation from wind and solar units cannot be ramped up and down in response to disequilibria in power frequencies in a grid, conventional units must be used to regulate those frequencies. Without such frequency regulation, the grid can become unstable, in the sense that the generators comprising the grid would be spinning at different speeds, a condition of nonsynchronous generation that can cause a power outage. In a critique of a proposal53 for a 100 percent renewable power grid, Christopher Clack et al. make the following central observation.
An important gap in the analysis of [Jacobson et al.] is that it does not provide evidence that the proposed [100 percent renewable] system can maintain sufficient frequency regulation to preserve power system stability. The designers of power markets have known for decades that there is a need for improved markets that reward ancillary services that contribute to grid stability.
Further, [Jacobson et al.] state that [their] model “assumes a fully interconnected grid” that does not include any transmission constraints. [They] simply assume that there is unlimited transmission availability and that if “congestion is an issue at the baseline level of long-distance transmission, increasing the transmission capacity will relieve congestion with only a modest increase in cost.”
This is a striking set of assumptions given that it has proven extremely difficult to site vital transmission lines, notably near urban areas (where loads are concentrated).54
In short, expansion of renewable power generation requires ancillary investment in backup capacity using conventional (dispatchable) technologies if frequent service interruptions are to be avoided.”
In summary the AEI study evaluates U.S. electric power generation and energy data for the year 2017 and calculates from that data the amount of new renewable generation required for a 100% renewable generation system, the necessary backup fossil generation required and the resulting GHG emissions associated with this GND scheme.
The study established that 848 GW of conventional generation must be replaced by 2,627 GW’s of new renewable generation to achieve 100% renewable electricity. The much larger amount of replacement renewable generation reflects the much lower capacity factors from renewable power plants versus reliable and predictable fossil generation plant capacity factors. The many issues affecting the much lower renewable energy capacity factors are addressed in detail in the AEI study. The study estimates that the new100% renewable generation system will require 394 GW of backup electric system reserve natural gas combined cycle power plants.
The study utilizes a conservatively low 15% electric system generation reserve margin for its evaluation. Most North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) grid organizations operate with reserve margins in the range between 15% to 25%. The required backup generation is estimated to be operating at about a 40% capacity factor needed to provide all electric grid stability functions, daily ramping of system load, system regulating margin and spinning and standby reserves to prevent power shortages and blackouts.   
The study determined that “annual emissions from natural gas backup generation under the GND “100 percent renewables” mandate, perhaps surprisingly, would be 22 percent higher than the emissions from all 2017 natural gas–fired generation and over 35 percent of the emissions from all power generation in 2017. This is the direct result of the unreliability of renewable power: The backup units must be cycled up and down depending on wind and sunlight conditions, thus increasing heat rates (btu per kWh) and emissions.63 The seriousness of this cycling problem is illustrated in Table 2: Annual natural gas backup generation under the GND would be over 6 percent higher than all natural gas generation in 2017, but emissions from natural gas backup power production, again, would be 22 percent higher. In short, the GND “100 percent renewables” mandate—even given the assumptions inherent in the GND policy proposals—to a significant degree is self-defeating as a purported solution to a climate crisis.”
In addition the AEI study addressed the costs that would be associated with the GND electricity mandate which included cost evaluations of new renewable energy capacity and related costs associated with transmission, backup power, land and emissions which are summarized in Table 10 of the study as presented below.

The $490.5 billion dollars per year cost just for the electricity portion of the GND proposal schemes (the GND socialized goodies dealing with single-payer health care, “free” college, national high speed rail system, national building efficiency retrofit program, national employment guarantee, etc are addressed in the AEI study but not in this essay) does NOT include how the sunk costs of the 848 GW of existing conventional generation would be dealt with by the government with the sunk costs of these assets likely to be in the multi trillion dollar range.
The AEI study also provides a breakdown of the electrical system 100% renewable energy GND scheme by each state. Each states year 2017 data is evaluated by addressing its respective generation capacity, fuel mix and energy consumption. The costs for each state reflects the differences between these components among the various states. The graph below presents this data.

For the state of California the cost per household is $1,885 per year or a total annual cost of about $22 billion dollars per year.
The summary of the AEI study clearly notes that the end result of the GND even if zero emissions could be achieved has no discernible impact on global temperatures which is highlighted in the report as follows: 
“Moreover, notwithstanding the assertions from GND proponents that it is an essential policy to confront purportedly adverse climate phenomena, the future temperature impacts of the zero-emissions objective would be barely distinguishable from zero: 0.173°C by 2100, under the maximum Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change parameter (equilibrium climate sensitivity) about the effects of reduced GHG emissions. Under an assumption consistent with the findings reported in the recent peer-reviewed literature, the effect would be 0.083°C by 2100, a policy impact not measurable against normal variation in temperatures. This conclusion is not controversial and suggests strongly that the GND’s real goal is wealth redistribution to favored political interests under the GND social-policy agenda and a dramatic increase in government control of resource allocation more generally”.
Also unaddressed in the GND proposal is the indisputable fact that any reductions in GHG emissions by the U.S., which already leads the world in reducing CO2 emissions, is completely irrelevant to the future growth both cumulatively and incrementally of global emissions which are totally controlled by the world’s developing nations.

By way of introduction, I am neither a scientist nor a farmer but have significant commercial qualifications and a lifelong connection to Agriculture.



I have grave concerns that the proposed legislation is heading in the wrong direction and will have a significant adverse impact on the countries overall wellbeing, specifically from a financial perspective but this will then flow on into our standard of living lowering it from levels we currently enjoy. Government action and policy should be all about increasing the standard of living for its citizens, not the reverse.



I do not deny that the climate is changing; it always has changed and it will continue to do so. For evidence of this, you only have to look at the arrival and then the disappearance of the large Ice Ages. There have not been one but five such periods experiencing a reduction in the surface of the earth’s temperature with significant glaciations in the northern and southern hemispheres. It is accepted that the additional heat-trapping gasses emitted into the atmosphere will prevent the next ice age which if it follows the cycle would be expected in around 50000 years. What causes that cooling followed by warming? Possibly changes in atmospheric composition or changes in the earths orbit around the sun, tectonic plate changes, volcanism, or meteorites or various combinations? 



On a more micro scale, we have the more recent global warming that took place during the medieval period (800 – 1400 AD). That allowed civilisation to flourish during that time. More recently we have a recent mini ice age commonly called the Maunder Minimum (1645 – 1715) during which time the Thames River was known to freeze over allowing ice skating on it. It is widely accepted that this recent cool period was associated with a time where there was next to no sunspot activity. **Here is where we first establish that variation in the suns activity impacts on the earth’s temperature.**



We are often told by those most loudly promoting the Global Warming / Climate Change story that we have a consensus of the scientific community and that “The Science is settled” regarding the recent change in global temperatures being fully attributed to human activity. I don’t believe for one minute the science is settled or there is a full consensus. That is not the job of science as we will continue to discover all manner of things and there are always dissenting views and all scientific findings need to be subjected to full peer review to establish full credibility. We definitely do not have consensus. It appears to me that the chorus of consensus comes from an echo chamber happy to accept only those findings that fit with the UN accepted IPPC model.



The most recent climate findings by 2 researchers at Turku University in Finland have found that the human contribution to the rise of 0.1 deg C in global temperatures attributed to carbon dioxide over the last century **is in fact just 1/10th of that at 0.01 deg C.**



Their paper is titled: “No experimental evidence for the significant anthropogenic climate change” by Kauppinen and Malmi. Their conclusion is that global temperatures are controlled primarily by cloud cover and only a small part of the increased Carbon Dioxide concentration is anthropogenic.   
This, the latest of many papers, calls into question claims by the IPPC that those global temperatures changes are driven by human activity.



Then we have further recent research undertaken by Russian Professor Valentina Zharkova leading a team looking at Climate and Solar magnetic field activity. There are over 150 climate models monitoring the solar cycle and she has one of only 2 such models that correctly predicted that the current solar cycle 24 would be weaker than the previous one with her model predicting with 97% accuracy and now suggesting that a Grand Solar Minimum is on the cards from 2020. 



These are prolonged periods of reduced solar activity that have in the past gone hand in hand with times of global cooling, I refer to my earlier comment about the Maunder Minimum mini ice age period.  
The time of the last grand solar minimum saw 2 of the suns magnetic fields out of phase; this time around it will be four. It is the reversing of the suns magnetic poles that appears to impact on sunspot activity  
It is their recent work discovering the long term oscillations of the solar background magnetic field associated with double Dynamo waves generated from the inner and outer layers of the sun that indicate the sun is heading to a grand solar minimum over the next 3 decades (2019-2055).



Also to put it in layman’s term the sun has cycles within cycles within cycles. There is the regular 11-year cycle well understood, and the recently reported grand solar cycle of 350 – 400 years and then further oscillation of 1950 +/- 95 years referred to as a super grand solar minimum. The researches predict there will be a slow increase in temperatures over the next 6 centuries until 2600 followed by a decrease and minimum around the year 3700.



These oscillations of the baseline solar magnetic field are associated with a long term solar inertial motion about the barycentre of the solar system. As I understand it and if I can put into layman’s term all of the bodies circulating in the solar system have different magnetic attraction and depending on where they are in their solar cycle will all impact on each other so the orbits will never be continuously centric but will vary over time.



Of course there are going to be sceptics who disagree but if it is true (in the same way we are told to believe that human activity is impacting the temperature through increased CO2 levels) then what is to be gained by incurring all the costs associated with trying to eliminate the release of carbon into the atmosphere by humans? That carbon that has always been on earth and is the main building block of life on earth



How important is CO2? Are you aware that fruit and vegetables grown indoors have additional CO2 pumped into the glass or plastic house to increase the production output. High levels of CO2 are essential for plant growth and the current increase in global CO2 levels have resulted in Global Greening which means there is more plant life on earth to support the global population and reduce the incidence of famine



We are encouraged to plant tree forests to soak up the carbon; no I’m not against planting trees but they are such a temporary holding vessel in the overall scheme of things. That carbon is not going to be held in those forests forever. They will be milled and those softwoods will be disposed of again at some stage in the future and when they either rot or burn will release that carbon back into the atmosphere.



This brings me to the emissions attributed to animals. There were probably just as many and possibly more animals naturally occurring on the planet a 1000 yrs ago well before man started more intensive livestock farming ( the large Bison herds in Nth America have all but disappeared to be replaced with cropping). **The digestive systems of these animals haven’t changed so they have always emitted methane into the atmosphere.**



Its many years ago when I first heard of the proposed cow “fart tax “ , how stupid that concept is when you look at it from a most basic 3rd form Biology fundamental of photosynthesis.  
The cows eat the grass which contains CO2, as does every other plant when it uses the process of photosynthesis to take the CO2 out of the atmosphere, fix the carbon to the plant and emit Oxygen so important for all living animals.  
The cows break down the cellulose in the grass and release the CO2 which is then released to the atmosphere by the cows in the form of methane. That methane in the form of CO2 is the reabsorbed by the grass and the cycle goes round and round, no new CO2 is added to the system.



Knowing this ( cars boats and planes don’t reabsorb their emissions) why are we beating ourselves up saying the methane from animal accounts for 1/3 of NZ greenhouse emissions when they are reabsorbed, **It’s ultimately a closed system that is not generating any additional CO2.**



I understand methane accounts for over 40% of all emissions in terms of global warming potential; however, the dominant sources are from rice paddies and wetlands, not farm animals.  
Here we have it again as I mentioned earlier that the CO2 absorbed by trees will be ultimately released when rotting occurs in the same way if is released from rotting vegetable matter in rice paddies and wetlands, the release process just happens to occur quicker in those areas of high moisture content speeding up the rotting process.



The fact that NZ is in a unique position on one hand that we have such high levels of sustainably produced Electricity making our “carbon footprint” a world low in that area. This does not mean that we should be penalising ourselves on the other hand because we have one of the highest per capita emission of greenhouse gas (0.6 t per person being 6 times the global average) derived solely from our unique position of having a very high animal population. Our absolute amount of emissions is minimal.



Do we agree those animals are not producing and additional greenhouse gas but simply part of a closed cycle of continuous absorption by plants and release by animals that eat that grass and round and round it goes as it has for 1000’s of years.



We have some major large industrial countries who openly admit to producing increasing amounts of greenhouse gas over the next 20 – 30 years while we think it beneficial to be working toward eliminate ours **when only producing 0.1% of the world’s greenhouse gas** while China 29% and India 6.5% continue unabated.



On the subject of weather and climate change some regular changes in the earth’s climate that are accepted as being normal such as the likes of the El Nino / La Nina Southern Oscillation. This phenomenon causes global changes in both rainfall and temperature. Centred in central and the eastern central Pacific Ocean this cycle of warm and cold sea surface temperature accompanied by a different air pressure differential on either side of the Pacific Ocean occurs on average every 4 years with a range from 2 – 7 years. 



There were 26 El Nino events recorded last century. It is now understood this has been occurring for 1000s of years with some specimens of coral displaying evidence of chemical signatures of temperature variation dating back 13000 years.  
These systems affect global climate, disrupting normal weather patterns resulting in intense storms in some places and droughts in others. We know it has significant effects on the NZ climate with stronger westerly winds in summer leading to rain in the west and drought in the east.  
 **This is an entirely natural phenomenon** that has been naturally occurring for 1000s of years exhibiting far more impact on the earth’s climate in a short space of time than man is ever able to, short of release numerous atomic bombs



In summary as a global population, we can accept that what we have been doing to the environment for the last 100 years is not sustainable and we need to make a collective effort to improve the stewardship of our planet on a number of fronts.



I don’t, however, subscribe to any urgency in NZ to impact on our standard of living in any way due to a perceived urgency that we need to do something significant right now. I’m in my late 60s and I can only recollect small changes in weather obviously caused by the likes of El Nina. For anyone to either subscribe to the current Climate emergency scenarios or provide scaremongering advice and teaching to our young people such as we only have 12 years left before the world will implode is plain nonsensical behaviour.



I do however subscribe to the theory of leaving the world in a better place than the way I found it. I owe that to my children and grandchildren and those that follow them to ensure their world is a better place and concentrating on the dubious task of eliminating carbon emissions **will not produce a better world for them if it is at the expense of their standard of living.**



Yes, we need to talk about these issues and keep them at the top of our minds and the generations that follow us will pick up on them as they can and as the general marketplace is able to come up with solutions like alternative fuel sources. It will be no different to the way a lot of my generation were slow to embrace the concept of recycling, now a mainstream activity but a concept quite alien to most of our ancestors.



 **There is absolutely no need to adopt a “cart before the horse” mentality** and rush into actions like penalising fossil-fuelled cars and subsidizing alternative fuel ones before we are sure we have a viable and sustainable alternative fuel. I reference killing the natural gas industry and then having to import coal to produce electricity that will be used to power electric vehicles.  
All I can say to that is stupidity at its absolute best.



I hope you will take on my very basic and inarticulate ramblings and look at what I believe are some very practical considerations to be woven into deliberations on any real and tangible benefits that will accrue to us by adopting the measures in the proposed amendment. **I am opposed to any regulatory change that will bring unnecessary cost on society and affect overall wellbeing based on the dubious assumption that man is having a long term detrimental impact on world climate.**

"**In our series of letters from African journalists, Ismail Einashe discovers how Nigerian women are standing up to traffickers in Italy.**
In the mountains of Sicily a Nigerian woman is leading a battle to help rescue women like herself from a life of forced sex work.
Osas Egbon opened up a shelter for these victims of trafficking on the Italian island in January - the first of its kind created by and for Nigerian women.
She currently has four women in their 20s, one with a baby - and hopes by the end of the year two more will join them.
On a hot September afternoon I drove up to see the shelter in a sleepy village - far away from the island's capital, Palermo, so the women can be hidden away from those they are escaping.
It is a typical Sicilian village house with a large kitchen, a terrace with views out on to the verdant hills. The women each have their own rooms but share a kitchen and bathroom.
She was given the use of the property by an Italian friend.
Many Italians want to help Nigerian women, she says, but the trouble is that in a time of increasing anti-migrant sentiments, some other Italians do not want them to do so.
I first met Ms Egbon in 2018, three years after she and other Nigerian women had set up the organisation Women of Benin City.
It supports female victims of trafficking in Sicily - the majority of whom come from Nigeria's Edo state, the capital of which is Benin City.
Ms Egbon was trafficked 18 years ago from her home there to work in forced prostitution.
She managed to pay off her traffickers - and now lives happily with her family in Palermo but she has a steely determination to stop others having to go through the same experience.
She and her friends were prompted to act after the horrific murders in late 2011 and early 2012 of two young Nigerian women.
They were aged just 20 and 22.
The murders shocked people in Sicily and put a spotlight on the harrowing experiences Nigerian women face in forced prostitution.
Such trafficking is not new but the numbers since the so-called migrant crisis began in 2015 have doubled.
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in 2016 of the 11,000 Nigerian women registered as landing in Sicily, 80% were trafficked with most ending up in forced prostitution.
After the women arrive, they must start paying their debts back to their traffickers - which can be up to $35,000 (Â£27,000) - through forced sex work, often leaving them in debt bondage.
In Palermo the women usually end up in the multicultural neighbourhood of BallarÃ², where they are forced to work in what are called ""connection houses"" managed by ""mamas"", or they work on the streets.
Before arriving in Italy the women are forced to swear juju oaths - a ritual ceremony overseen by spiritual priests where they promise never to denounce their traffickers to the police, to obey their ""mamas"" and to fully pay their debts.
The traffickers prey on the women's spiritual beliefs so they become too afraid to speak up, fearing if they do so harm will come to them or loved ones back home.
For Ms Egbon these oaths are the biggest obstacle to freeing women from the trafficking gangs and a life of exploitation.
Two years ago she and her colleagues were greatly helped in their efforts by the Oba of Benin City, an influential Nigerian traditional leader, when he placed a curse on the traffickers - turning the tables on them.
At the time there were posters in Palermo announcing the news.
Since then Ms Egbon says it has become easier to gain the trust of the women and she has been able to help free many of them.
Women of Benin City runs a drop-in centre, offering advice and, importantly, emotional support, which sets the group apart.
The volunteers there understand the sexual relationships the women form with the traffickers, which also become a means of preventing their escape.
At the shelter, Ms Egbon says she wants to empower the women by giving them access to education - Italian classes and training that may help them get jobs.
She allows the women to stay in the shelter for one year so that they can recover from their traumatic experiences and prepare for their futures.
For Ms Egbon, who has become part-aunty, part-councillor, part-sister to the women, the shelter is a dream come true.
But to keep it open will be hard as she runs on a voluntary basis from donations.
Members of the Nigerian community in Palermo have stepped in to pool their resources together to give what little they can. And churches also play a role in raising money.
From my afternoon at the secret shelter, it was clear the women there felt safe and happy - recovering well from their trauma.
They sat braiding each other's hair as they listened to Ms Egbon - and looking forward to the dinner to be made from goat's meat I had brought on special request from Palermo.

" Contributed by William Walter Kay BA LL B ©2019 100 million years ago (100 Ma) Earth’s surface temperature, already hotter than now, resumed an intermittent warming march. Humidity kept apace. By 70 Ma forests graced Antarctica and Greenland. By 60 Ma dense rainforests carpeted land masses pole to pole. By 66 Ma these forests hosted 30 species of flying bird, 34 species of mammal and scores of snake species.The present is the key to the past.Presently, a dozen snake species subsist exclusively via egg predation. Weasels, skunks and badgers also raid nests for their supper. Buzzards and crows do likewise.Owls are living fossils; having emerged pre-65 Ma. Presently, 200 species of owl scour habitats from the Arctic to the Congo. Famously silent and equipped with remarkable night vision, owls often prey not on eggs but on recent hatchlings thereof. Dinosaurs would have been helpless against owls who, along with their ancestors and cousins, perched atop the food-chain 60 Ma.Dinosaurs perished 66-64ish Ma. Thick dark woods flush with egg-cracking, hatchling-snatching critters proved inhospitable environs for these clumsy monsters.*The son of a Spanish royal family adjutant, Luis F Alvarez (1853-1937), migrated to California, acquired an MD from Stanford, then moved to Hawaii to supervise hospitals and conduct experiments. Luis’s son, Walter, a Mayo Clinic professor, penned a medical column syndicated to hundreds of newspapers. Walter’s son, Luis W Alvarez, attained his PhD (Physics) from the University of Chicago and received a Nobel Prize (1968) for mathematical analysis of particle physics experiments.A deep state denizen, Luis W Alvarez flew as a passenger in a B-29 alongside Enola Gay and Bockscar to watch the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. He investigated UFOs for the CIA. He secretly smeared Robert Oppenheimer as a Soviet spy. Chosen to refute a Congressional report on JFK’s assassination that indicated multiple shooters; Alvarez loyally upheld the Warren Commission’s lone shooter theory.While Luis lacked geological or paleontological credentials, his son Walter had a Geology PhD (Princeton) and dabbled in archeology. The duo embarked on their asteroid-dinosaur adventure in 1977. Walter embalmed his recollections in: T Rex and the Crater of Doom.*Paleontologists and Geologists, being historians, agonize over periodization i.e. over how to best divide Earth’s past into chronological episodes. History is continuous; without precise beginnings and endings. Descriptive stable blocks of time are arbitrary, problematic conveniences. Absent periodization, however, there is no system; just scattered events. Geological/paleontological boundaries undergo constant re-categorization; the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary being no exception.The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) is official keeper of the International Geological Time Scale. In 2008 ICS replaced “Tertiary” with “Paleogene.” K-T is now K-Pg. (K means Cretaceous.) This boundary divides a world blighted by conifers and dinosaurs from one blessed with flowers and mammals.While K-Pg is renowned for dinosaur extinction; it is actually demarcated with reference to lineages of marine invertebrates found in Euro-Mediterranean rock strata. Geological timescales are biased towards shoreline rock-beds which, not having suffered terrestrial erosion, are easier to analyse.Coastal rocks chronicle the rise and fall of oceanic protozoan species. Not to denigrate plankton, but other lifeforms are at least as interesting. Alongside the nanoplankton series now run alternative biostratigraphic series. Thirty mammalian bio-zones lay within the Paleogene Period (65.5 to 2.58 Ma). Advances in magnetic and isotropic analyses have engendered additional, parallel time columns.ICS’s Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) program began in 1977. “Golden spikes” are pounded in at accessible, well-preserved cites to serve as reference points for geological age boundaries. GSSPs are chosen paleontologically (from fossil evidence) but possess good secondary (isotropic, magnetic) markers. Sixty-four spikes have been pounded; 37 more are planned.K-Pg’s spike adorns a ravine outside El Kef, Tunisia. This site was chosen for its clear depiction of the first appearance date of the flagellate, Danea californica, which heralds the disappearance of signature Cretaceous plankton.*It was at another K-Pg boundary site (Gubbio, Italy) where Luis and Walter Alvarez made their fabled find. In a centimeter-thick clay layer separating Cretaceous from Paleogene limestone strata they discovered abnormally high iridium concentrations. Iridium is rare in Earth’s crust. It is more abundant in Earth’s mantle and far more abundant in meteorites. The duo surmised that Earth had been struck by a 10-kilometre wide asteroid circa 66 Ma. Fallout from said asteroid spread iridium around the globe whilst inflicting the mass extinction which claimed the dinosaurs.The alleged killing mechanism… Catastrophic Climate Change!Alvarez’s asteroid kicked-up sky-darkening dust that suppressed photosynthesis and wrought famine.“Global cooling” memes circulated in the 1970s. This theory, much like Alvarez’s “impact winter,” claims industrial pollution significantly blocks sunlight. A related horror-show, “nuclear winter,” envisions an ice age triggered by nuclear war. Circa 1980 two additional potential climate catastrophes gained notoriety – greenhouse warming and acid rain. Alvarez mongered all three scares.William Glen, scribe of dinosaur extinction controversies, notes:“Enhanced greenhouse warming has been suggested as a killing mechanism almost from the time the impact hypothesis was put forward.”A key concept here is “shock metamorphism.” Limestone, it is contended, when pulverized by meteorites generates heat-trapping CO2. In the late-1980s a Caltech team blasted cannonballs into limestone. They concluded Alvarez’s asteroid tripled atmospheric CO2, setting off global heat devastation.A famous September 1991 K-Pg paper speculated:“…shock-produced CO2 from the impact may have caused a severe greenhouse warming.”This paper came out in advance of the June 1992 Rio Summit; a milestone in CO2 diabolization.Immediately after the 1980 release of the original Alvarez paper, an MIT team began issuing papers detailing how heat from the asteroid’s ejecta plum, through shock metamorphism, fused atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen into nitric acid. The resultant acid rain not only killed dinosaurs, it dissolved their bones; thereby explaining the annoying dearth of dinosaur fossils immediately below the K-Pg boundary.Another impact-induced climate catastrophe scenario has the asteroid annihilating sulphur emitting microalgae. The resultant shortage of atmospheric sulphate particles thwarted cloud formation, kindling lethal warming.Debate was restricted to asteroid partisans versus vulcanists. The latter, also climate catastrophists, contended mass extinction resulted from either SO2 (acid rain) or CO2 (global warming) volcanic emissions.A compromise faction argued Alvarez’s asteroid rang Earth like a bell, waking dormant volcanos; hence an asteroid-volcano double-whammy dealt the dinos their deathblow.Paleontologists were denied a podium on the debate stage.*The K-Pg iridium anomaly became a battlefield. In 1981 geologists examining Alvarez’s Gubbio site found high iridium levels above and below the K-Pg boundary. They concluded the iridium enrichment was of local volcanogenic, not cosmogenic, origins. Alvarez bitterly disputed their findings.Charles B. Officer, leader of the opposition, received his PhD (Oceanography) from Columbia U before settling in as a Geophysics professor at Dartmouth College. Officer authored 10 science texts and countless papers.In 1988 Officer’s team analysed rock 2.85 metres above, and 219 metres below, the K-Pg boundary layer at Gubbio. They found four fluxes in iridium concentration above the boundary; consistent with 3 million years of intense volcanic activity.Officer’s allies also noted that the tiny spherical rocks, which Alvarez claimed were ejecta raining down from a single impact, could be found in several million years of rock strata.Others noted wide variations in iridium concentrations at K-Pg boundary sites around the world; again suggesting local volcanic origins.There is no consensus that K-Pg boundary layer iridium enrichment resulted from extraterrestrial impact. There is consensus regarding a 10,000-to-100,000 year intense volcanic episode in the late Cretaceous. This volcanic uprising explains the iridium anomaly.(A third iridium anomaly hypothesis, that Earth experienced an uptick in meteor showers over several thousand years, was useless to Alvarez as this couldn’t cause mass extinction.)By 1988 Alvarez’s asteroid appeared destined for the dustbin. Geophysicist R Jastrow confidently wrote:“It is now clear that a catastrophe of extraterrestrial origins had no discernable impact on the history of life as measured over a million years.”Then, in 1991, evidence of a huge crater was found under the Gulf of Mexico. Alvarez’s camp unleashed a salvo of papers aimed at proving “Chicxulub” to be their asteroid’s tomb.In two papers (1993 and 1994) Officer’s team intercepted and destroyed Alvarez’s evidence. As PEMEX had done much drilling in the area; there was grist for the geological mill.A 10-kilometre wide asteroid would have left unmistakable splatter around the immediate vicinity. The evidence shows a regional hiatus of impact-generated and/or tsunami-generated deposits at the K-Pg layer. Conversely, the Caribbean’s K-Pg boundary layer resides amidst 3 metres of volcanic deposits.Officer’s team showed that one of Alvarez’s prize K-Pg rocks contained fossils millions of years too old. Also, a Cuban boulder that Alvarez claimed to be impact ejecta was proven to be the product of local erosion. Alvarez’s trophies from northern Mexico and Haiti were not impact ejecta but river-bed deposits built-up slowly with telltale gravity drainage features.Signing off on Officer’s conclusions was the legendary A. A. Meyerhoff. As Project Geologist for PEMEX’s deep drilling program Meyerhoff inspected every sample. He saw scant evidence of spectacular asteroid impact. He saw ample evidence of six volcanic episodes.*Another Alvarez opponent, William Clemens, is currently Professor Emeritus at Berkeley. Clemens chaired Berkeley’s Paleontology Department and ran their museum. He won several awards.An authority on North American dinosaurs, Clemens believes these dinosaurs died out over a 500,000 year period. Flood plain dinosaurs disappeared quickly. River valley dinos clung on.Dinosaurs inhabited Alaska’s North Slope for millions of years. While it was much warmer then than now, these dinosaurs still endured many cool dark polar winters. It is unlikely a meteorite off southern Mexico wiped them out.Alvarez claimed his asteroid wreaked havoc uniquely upon larger animals. Clemens notes that during the K-Pg transition many small animals also disappeared.According to Clemens, a sudden extinction paroxysm is simply not where the evidence points. Countless studies of K-Pg era fossils chronical complex floral and faunal transitions lasting over 100,000 years and exhibiting a range of regional sequences and timelines. Paleontologists explains K-Pg with reference to continental drift, long-term climate change, and gradual terrestrial and oceanic re-configurations.Layers of rock, varying in thickness from 1 to 4.5 metres, separate the last dinosaur fossils from strata celebrating the triumph of modern plants. This is consistent with gradual, regional extinctions. The Alvarez hypothesis has all dinosaurs vanishing in a few years, if not months, circa 66.7 Ma. More troubling for the Alvarez hypothesis are dinosaur fossils radiometrically dated to 63.6 Ma.Asteroid impact cannot explain the selectivity of K-Pg extinctions. Many lifeforms survived K-Pg unscathed. Alligators, sharks and turtles thrived. A review of 31 sites showed some equatorial regions enjoying 50% increases in bio-diversity during the K-Pg transition; albeit higher latitudes suffered 70% declines.Extinctions occur continuously. These “turnovers” involve certain lifeforms displacing others. “Mass extinctions” are merely accelerated turnovers. 100,000 years is a jiffy to paleontologists.*Alvarez’s hypothesis debuted as a lead Science article (June, 1980) after a contrived roll-out. Starting in 1978 Science Digest, Science News and Time ran preparatory articles. In 1979 Astronomy published: Death of the Dinosaurs. (Astrophysicists embraced the impact-extinction hypothesis; using it to campaign for asteroid research funding. They claimed meteorites caused all mass extinctions.)By 1992 the Alvarez paper had been cited 2,000 times. 130 scientific journals ran 500 articles about it. Thirteen major periodicals printed 143 stories on the topic. Graphic accounts of a dino-killing asteroid appeared 25 times in Newsweek, Time, New Yorker and Scientific American; often as a cover story. Walter Alvarez’s lectures packed halls at science confabs.Despite the hype, many scientists, and most paleontologists, rejected Alvarez’s hypothesis. A 1985 survey found paleontologists complaining that the impact theory sought to solve a non-existent mystery. Seeking silver-bullet explanations for dinosaur extinction was likened to searching for the Missing Link.Papers from either side of the debate were published weekly throughout the decade. Rapid, coordinated responses by Alvarez supporters, from across several disciplines, betrayed conspiracy. Nature’s editor complained pre-prints of yet-to-be published articles circulated in Alvarez’s camp.Luis Alvarez stooped to nasty, dishonest personal attacks. Worse, according to journalist Bruce Fellman:“…critics of the asteroid-impact theory are firmly convinced that the late Nobel laureate was pulling strings behind the scenes – and the price of hewing to what they perceive to be the scientific truth was loss of access to news coverage, grant money, the leading journals, and even tenure.”A New York Times exposé of the dispute claimed:“Charges and recriminations have also flowed through the informal academic grapevine that can make or break a scientific career.”Professor Dewey McLean argued convincingly that the iridium anomaly was volcanogenic. Several scientists, who requested anonymity, claimed Alvarez agents tried to block Dewey’s promotion to full professor. Alvarez denied the charge but was quick to call Mclean a “weak sister” whose reputation had been destroyed, gloating: “nobody invites him to conferences anymore.”Alvarez added:“I don’t like to say bad things about paleontologists, but they’re really not very good scientists. They’re more like stamp collectors.”The struggle continues. A 2010 paper, signed by 41 scientists, declared the K-Pg asteroid-extinction event to be a fact. The paper elicited a counter-paper led by Clemens and signed by 29 scientists. The counter-paper, published in Science, noted the absence of vertebrate paleontologists among the 41 bombardiers. It went on to point out that no other known mass extinction event corresponds to a meteorite impact, and that no other known meteorite impact corresponds to any extinction.Catastrophists, controlling the commanding heights, continue dispensing ‘ground-breaking’ evidence for their theory. Many circumspect paleontologists now privately disparage Alvarez’s hypothesis but publically avoid the topic.*Farcically millenarian, environmentalists traffic in: tipping points, carrying capacities, ecological thresholds, population overshoots, feedback loops, rumours of doom and horrors to come. While eco-apocalyptic pseudoscience dates to the 1800s, an unprecedented resurgence swept the late-1960s after its affiliated political tendency re-marshalled their assault upon the state.“Millenarian” derives from millennium, 1,000 years. Numerologically 1,000 indicates completeness. 1,000 years translates to “epoch.” Bewildering calculations go into apocalyptic timetables but cabbalistic foreshortening invariably reels the final epoch into imminent proximity.Faith in an imminent cataclysm appears across history and around the globe. Hindus preach a cycle of cosmic disasters. Shiites await a riotous finale. Rastafarians, Mormons and Marxists brace for the ultimate transformation.Between 200 BC and 300 AD Jewish/Christian pamphleteers prophesied an apocalypse rife with infernos and deluges. End Times doctrine undergirds Christian soteriology and theodicy. Suppressed during the Middle Ages, millenarianism rebounded in Protestantism and remains fundamental to American Christianity. Europe’s most prescient modern theologian, Albert Schweitzer, stressed Christianity’s millenarian constitution; recommending its revival.Geology was born bearing millenarian defects.Until the late-1800s “catastrophism” was Geology’s consensus view. Catastrophists believed Earth’s crustal features resulted from exotic cataclysms. Disparate fossils unearthed in rock strata were explained as products of repeated Acts of God lacking any connection to profane scientific laws.Guided by Natural Theology, catastrophists reconciled scripture with Geology. They believed in a recent divine creation event. They rejected evolution, contending modern animals appeared as God made them. They sought geological evidence for the Garden of Eden and the Great Flood. They deemed Noah’s flood to be the most recent of a series of worldwide inundations.Catastrophism yielded to “uniformitarianism” and its linear geological column. Uniformitarians emphasised gradualism, sedimentation, erosion, evolution etc. They confined theorising to observable processes. The present was key to the past.Millenarianism, often a feature of populist uprisings, can be an instrument of oppression. Imperial-aristocratic millenarianism is nostalgic, traditionalist, conservationist and restorative. It brandishes a vision of theocratic global conquest.Ritual masks worn by today’s crafty practitioners exploit engrained religious symbology. This is evident in “sixth mass extinction” propaganda. Cabbalistic numerology fixates on the passage of six to seven. The sixth yom of Creation was followed by the Sabbath. The six millennia of tribulations are followed by the Jubilee. This sixth mass extinction will surely be our last.After an early 20th century nadir millenarianism filtered back into scientific discourse. This disguised attack on science manifests in astronomy, cosmology, ecology, climatology and math (catastrophe theory).In 1977 Alvarez hatched his asteroid caper amidst a zeitgeist saturated with eco-apocalyptic propaganda supplemented by mega-hyped screeds like The Late Great Planet Earth (25 million copies sold) and the syzygy scare, The Jupiter Effect (which also sold millions).*Sociology of Science professor Elisabeth Clemens (William Clemens’ daughter) enlivened the fray with poignant commentary about how politics corrupts science. She claims Alvarez’s hypothesis received lavish attention because it buttressed trending climate catastrophe narratives.Institutions of science popularization, especially science journalism, steer professional scientific research – it’s not the other way around. Dig into highfalutin, jargon-dense papers from august specialised science journals, and you shall unearth: agenda-driven pop science baubles.SourcesBrowne, Malcolm.

" Gavin Schmidt tweeted that he liked a #ClimateStrike poster that read “Soon even moving to Canada isn’t going to solve our problems.”  That reminded us that we had a parody submission on the Canadian government’s tiered climate refugee program, that would at least be worth a laugh, if not serious consideration for some!!  See what you think.Introduction to the Climate Refugee PlansIf you are reading this, you are no doubt deeply concerned by the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Prognosticators of Climate Catastrophes (the “IPCC”), which confirms what the members of that panel have known since before their research began: humans have put just too darn much carbon dioxide into the air. Now, if the developed world spends trillions and trillions of dollars very quickly to completely destroy and then rebuild its energy infrastructure so as not to use any of those nasty fossil fuels, sends hundreds of billions of dollars in climate reparations to third-world dictators, and gives unelected officials sweeping powers to control our lives and redistribute wealth, the world just might be able to avert hotter (or perhaps colder) temperatures, more (or possibly less) snow, more (or possibly less) wind, more (or possibly fewer) hurricanes, too much rain or too little rain, stronger and more frequent (or maybe not) tornadoes, fewer dog-walking opportunities, reduced male fertility, and a whole bunch of unprecedented weather events just too nasty to think about. But what if our best efforts fail? What happens if spending a hundred trillion dollars or more does not limit the temperature increase to an arbitrary 1.5°C (which used to be an arbitrary 2°C) above the arbitrary baseline at an arbitrarily chosen level of CO₂ at a randomly selected point in Earth’s 4-billion-year history?  What if the gas you breathe out—the gas that plants turn into oxygen and that makes up a tiny fraction of all the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—is not the control knob for Earth’s temperature after all? What then?Well, we have good news for you! Canada’s Climate Refugee Plans™ are here.  Canada has come up with the following climate refugee plans that will save most of peoplekind™ from the ravages of there being just too much plant food in the air, causing plants to grow bigger and stronger and to inhabit areas where they just wouldn’t grow before. You can chose the plan that best matches your status in the world: the Climate Scientist Plan™, the Global Warming Journalist Plan™, the Tropical Islander’s Plan™, or the Everyone Else.  Well, almost everyone else: for the truly elite among you, we also have the Movie Star Plan™! Old stock Canucks need not despair, though, because Canada needs you, too: after all, who else could we get to pay for all of this?For the last few years, Canada has been busy laying the groundwork for our Climate Refugee Plans™.  There were pipelines to kill (two down, one to go), business competitiveness to destroy via punishing carbon taxes and/or threats thereof, terrorists to enrich, and drugs to legalize. Canada has not yet succeeded in pushing Canada’s emissions down to zero from a whopping 1.6% of the world’s total, but we are not done destroying the country’s economy yet—that could take more of the same climate policies.  We assume if elected again, the government’s primary environmental objectives are to legislate a complete ban on carbon dioxide in Canada’s airspace and to negotiate treaties with other nations to ensure that their carbon dioxide emissions do not enter Canada illegally.  (Illegal Irregular entry is reserved for refugees from the United States.)The LEAPers Climate Refugee Plan™https://theleap.org/The first 100 people who sign up for Canada’s Climate Refugee Plan™ will automatically be enrolled in the LEAPers Climate Refugee Plan™. This plan is reserved for those truly, truly special members of peoplekind who have an unquenchable desire to LEAP lead by example.One-way transportation will be provided by Fort McMurray truckers to you and 99 others to the northeast corner of Alberta, near the shores of Lake Athabasca—which just happens to be due north of… gasp!!… the Oil Sands!!  (Canada is not sure why, but a large number of Canadians who normally complain about excessive taxation have volunteered to contribute to the cost of transporting LEAPers to their new home.)  What makes the LEAP Climate Refugee Plan™ truly special is that the trip in by truck will be your last-ever contact with those nasty fossil fuels and the horrors of combustion.  Living just outside Wood Buffalo National Park, you can both survive and demonstrate your commitment to reducing methane emissions by culling the area’s large bison population by hunting with sticks, stones, and your bare hands. (Steel, of course, requires combustion.) You can supplement your diet by catching fish from the lake, gathering berries (stay alert for the many bears in the area), and eating members of the area’s truly enormous population of mosquitoes, black flies, and other insects.  You won’t even have to go looking for the insects—they will come right to you!  The dense forest will provide plenty of natural fiber from which you can weave your no-synthetic-material clothing and will shelter you from temperatures that often dip below −40 (it’s the same in Fahrenheit or Celsius) in the winter.While it might be tough to live without fossil fuels or combustion for the first while, Canada knows you have an unwavering commitment to saving the world by showing others how to do it.  A few dozen generations from now your descendants might be almost as good at living off the land as were the First Nations people that were in the area thousands of years ago, when the temperature was five four three two one degree colder than it is nowadays.  (Of course, they had fire and you can’t, but that should be okay, right?)  Think of the accolades for showing how lifestyles from when the world’s population was 500 million can be applied to seven billion!  Think of the statues that will be erected in your honor for being the first humans to kick the fossil-fuel habit!  Streets will be named after you!  Schoolchildren everywhere will sing in eternal praise of your exploits!Applicants for the LEAPers Climate Refugee Plan™ must pass Canada’s strict Canadian entry test.  When you get to the border, you must be able to say, “I am a climate refugee” or “Je suis un réfugié climatique.”The Movie-Star Climate Refugee PlanIf you’re a movie star, you know you are the top rung of humanity, the elite of the elites, second only to the LEAPers.  In recognition of this—and unlike all other Climate Refugee Plans™—the Movie Star Plan does not require that you give up using fossil fuels. After all, how could you flit around the world in your private jets, hang out in the tropics on your yachts, or air-condition your mansions, using enough energy for a few dozen little-people families, if you had to live by your own words? Instead of giving up fossil fuels, Canadian climate leaders need you to attend photo shoots with them and other stars and occasionally talk about sciencey stuff like greenhouse gases and carbon, and about Chinook winds signaling climate Armageddon like Leonardo DiCaprio did a couple of years ago. Canada also needs you to explain to the little people that, by giving up their jobs, foregoing meat, not heating their homes, walking to work, and paying more for everything because of Canada’s breath carbon dioxide carbon tax, they’re leaving a better world for you and other glitterati.As you know all too well, global warming will soon—say, in the next 100,000 years or so—make Hollywood uninhabitable. To save you from hotness (the temperature kind, not the star kind), we are offering you free land in and around Yellowknife, in Canada’s Northwest Territory.  Uncrowded, unspoiled, and free of paparazzi, the city has almost too many advantages for people of your elite status.From Hollywood, it is only 2691 miles (4330 km) by road, almost due north. By electric car, it should only take 24 days and 156 recharging stops to make the trip. For your chauffeur’s convenience we have provided Google’s route map. In case you need to stock up on supplies for a, well, rather cooler world, the route takes you right past the West Edmonton Mall. Of course, if you’d rather fly, the airstrip in Yellowknife will accommodate your private jet.The indigenous peoples’ name for the city is Sǫ̀mbak’è, which means, “where the money is.” Doesn’t the name just say it all?  And as the icing on the cake, there are several diamond mines just short, private-jet flights from the city.  In case you want to demonstrate your commitment to reducing CO2, we can arrange tours to and from the mines via dog-sled, with five-star cabins and photo ops along the way.The average daily high temperature in Yellowknife in July is a perfect 70°F (21°C). That’s only 9°F less than Hollywood’s July high of 79°F, so you and your offspring can count on many thousands of years of global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer before afternoons become intolerable again. Of course, the average daily high in January is −13°F (−25°C), so you’ll want to bring some of that really warm, fossil-fuel-derived, synthetic-fiber winter gear.On June 21, the sun rises at 3:39 a.m. and sets at 11:38 p.m., so as you and other stars have come to expect, the sun will almost never set on you—well, except in the winter. But we’ve got that covered, because the Northern Lights will continue to shine on you during many of the cold winter nights (see Figure 2). The City of Yellowknife even has an aurora forecast on its website and tiny lighthouses located around the city that alert visitors and residents when active aurorae are in the evening forecast.No doubt, stars, you’ll want to be among the first to demonstrate your deep concern about global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer by securing a spot well outside the soon-to-be-too-hot parts of the world, and Yellowknife awaits.Figure 1:  The drive from Hollywood to Yellowknife.  (Image by Google Maps.)Figure 2: Northern Lights in the Northwest Territories.  Their radiance is exceeded only by you! (Image from spectacularnwt.com.)The Climate Scientist Climate Refugee Plan™If you aren’t a movie star but you are a climate scientist, Canada knows you’re super-important for this plan, too.  So, Environment and Climate Catastrophe Canada has established a new climate research institute here in Canada that is large enough to house all of you. That way, you can have as many Conferences of the Parties as you wish, without having to consume any of those evil fossil fuels to get there.Knowing that the chief concern among many of you is the melting of polar ice and sea-level rise, we have found the perfect location for the institute: it’s Alert, in Canada’s Artic territory of  Nunavut (see Figure 3). At an altitude of 76 metres (250 feet), Alert is close enough to sea level that you can keep a close eye on Artic Ocean ice but not so close that it will disappear under the sea any time soon.  Of course, we already know that things are worse than we thought, but if things turn out to be worse than worse than we thought, Alert is surrounded by hills, thereby allowing for even more sea-level rise. And if things get worse than worse than worse than we thought, the British Empire Range, with several peaks over 2000 metres, is not far away.Alert is on Ellesmere Island, which is perhaps the best place on the planet to study climate change. You see, about 3.4 million years ago, the island was inhabited by High Arctic camels (see Figure 4). They inhabited a boreal-type forest dominated by larch trees that was also inhabited by beavers, deer, rabbits, and fish. Global temperatures were 2 to 3°C warmer than today, Arctic temperatures were ~19°C warmer, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were ~390 ppm, and the Arctic Ocean was ice-free for a significant period each year.[1],[2]  Since Ellesmere Island has an area of 196,235 km2 (75,767 mi2) and a population of 191, give or take a few, there’s plenty of room for the institute to expand.  The urban heat island effect should be minimal.  And with an annual average daily high temperature of −14°C, you’ll be able to keep all those supercomputers cool while they are running all those sciencey climate models, powered of course by wind turbines, solar panels (except from October to February, when there is no sun), and lots and lots and lots and lots of new-technology batteries.No doubt you will want to demonstrate your personal concern about carbon dioxide emissions and the use of fossil fuels to the rest of the world. So, there will be some restrictions on bringing in anything composed of petroleum products or that involved petroleum products in their manufacture—which, come to think of it, might require that you run your climate models using an abacus or an Aztec nepohualtzintzin.  But even if that’s the case, the models’ accuracy won’t suffer.Figure 3: The location of Alert, Nunavut, Canada (where the little blue writing is).  The image shows sea-ice extent on September 15, 2008.  (Image by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center)  Figure 4: During the mid-Pliocene period the high Arctic was balmier and was home to camels, as shown in this artist’s rendering.  (Image from Powell in Discover Magazine.)The Tropical Islanders’ Climate Refugee Plan™For those of you currently inhabiting oceanic islands whose homes are about to be swallowed by the sea—notwithstanding that Earth’s surface gained 173,000 km2 of land over the last 30 years[1]— Canada offers the Tropical Islanders’ Climate Refugee Plan™.  After travelling by sailboat, horseback, and dog-sled from your current island homes, you will be re-settled in one of Canada’s three territories. Covering approximately 3.7 million km2 (1.4 million mi2) and having a total population of only 120,000, there’s plenty of room to grow.  While temperatures today can be as much as 70°C below what you’ve become accustomed to, with global warming it won’t be more a few hundred centuries before your great-many-times-over grandchildren will be able to enjoy the climate you’ve come to know and love—unless, of course, the ice sheets that once covered the region to a depth of three to five kilometres return first.The Climate Journalist’s Refugee Plan™Male climate leaders in Canada say “don’t call me a man, call me a people” and they, who recognize as well as any modern climate journalist that you must never let facts get in the way of a good story, have come up with an unprecedented opportunity for climate journalists.  You know you’re a climate journalist when you have an unprecedented ability to use the word “unprecedented” an unprecedented number of times in association with unprecedented stories about unprecedented events caused by global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer involving heat, cold, wind, rain, fog, clouds, floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, continental drift, the movement of the magnetic poles, war, peace, famine, bumper crops, earlier and/or later freeze-ups, feminist glaciology (see below), reduced male fertility, melting ice, crime or lack thereof, increases or decreases in dog-walking opportunities, the motion of the planets, sunspots, comets, asteroids, supernovae, cosmic rays, and Donald Trump.  What’s more, you can understand and fully identify with this:[2]Through a review and synthesis of a multi-disciplinary and wide-ranging literature on human-ice relations, this paper proposes a feminist glaciology framework to analyze human-glacier dynamics, glacier narratives and discourse, and claims to credibility and authority of glaciological knowledge through the lens of feminist studies. As a point of departure, we use ‘glaciology’ in an encompassing sense that exceeds the immediate scientific meanings of the label, much as feminist critiques of geography, for example, have expanded what it is that ‘geography’ might mean vis-à-vis geographic knowledge (Domosh, 1991; Rose 1993). As such, feminist glaciology has four aspects: (1) knowledge producers, to decipher how gender affects the individuals producing glacier-related knowledges; (2) gendered science and knowledge, to address how glacier science, perceptions, and claims to credibility are gendered; (3) systems of scientific domination, to analyze how power, domination, colonialism, and control—undergirded by and coincident with masculinist ideologies—have shaped glacier-related sciences and knowledges over time; and (4) alternative representations, to illustrate diverse methods and ways—beyond the natural sciences and including what we refer to as ‘folk glaciologies’—to portray glaciers and integrate counter-narratives into broader conceptions of the cryosphere. These four components of feminist glaciology not only help to critically uncover the under-examined history of glaciological knowledge and glacier-related sciences prominent in today’s climate change discussions. The framework also has important implications for understanding vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience—all central themes in global environmental change research and decision-making that have lacked such robust analysis of epistemologies and knowledge production (Conway et al., 2014; Castree et al., 2014).In return for the opportunity to resettle in Yellowknife or any other soon-to-be-tropical location north of the Arctic Circle, you need only write unprecedentedly good things about our eye-candy climate leaders as they travel round the world inviting one and all to immigrate to Canada, no questions asked.  That should be easy, because according to some of the world’s top climate scientists, Canada is just “so hot.”  Interestingly, when some of those scientists could not find the missing heat that was supposed to be hiding in the deep oceans, they realized that Canada had absorbed it all.  They now have a solid explanation for why all the climate models except that boring Russian one predicted way too much global warming.  One top scientist warns, however, that when Canadian climate catastrophe leaders leave this earthly domain to take a rightful place among the Masters of the Universe, wham… a nearly instantaneous and unprecedentedly unprecedented amount of warming will occur, so we MUST act now to stop all other forms of warming.To be eligible for the Climate Journalist’s Refugee Plan™, you must also have an unwavering commitment to ignoring the past. After all, how could you report things as unprecedented if you also have to report that they happened last year, the year before, in 1954, in 1931, in 1806, and in 1780?  (Shhhh… 1780 is the year of the Great Hurricane of the Antilles that killed between 20,000 and 24,000 people.  Don’t tell anyone!)  You have to be especially careful not to report that the Earth is presently close to the coldest, lowest-CO₂ state it has been in over the last billion years.SummaryNo matter who you are, if you’re worried about the horrors to be wrought by global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer, now’s your chance to put all those worries behind you.  So, sign up now and beat the rush!  Of course, as we just said, everything will be paid for by the Canadian taxpayer, because according to one of Canada’s Climate Catastrophe Leaders and heroes, taxpayers that are allowed to keep their money would only spend it on themselves and their families.Welcome to Canada, eh![1]     G.

While doing some historical studies in preparation for an article in Cato’s _Regulation_ magazine, we found that we once discovered the information equivalent of antimatter, namely, “anti‐​information”.   
  
  
This breakthrough came when we were reviewing the first “National Assessment” of climate change impacts in the United States in the 21st century, published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) in 2000. The _Assessments_ are mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. According to that law, they are, among other things, for “the Environmental Protection Agency for use in the formulation of a coordinated national policy on global climate change…”   
  
  
One cannot project future climate without some type of model for what it will be. In this case, the USGCRP examined a suite of nine climate models and selected two for the _Assessment_. One was the Canadian Climate Model, which forecast the most extreme warming for the 21st century of all models, and the other was from the Hadley Center at the U.K Met Office, which predicted the greatest changes in precipitation.   
  
  
We thought this odd and were told by the USGCRP that they wanted to examine the plausible limits of climate change. Fair enough, we said, but we also noted that there was no test of whether the models could simulate even of the most rudimentary climate behavior in past (20th) century.   
  
  
So, we tested them on ten‐​year running means of annual temperature over the lower 48 states.   
  
  
One standard method used to determine the utility of a model is to compare the “residuals”, or the differences between what is predicted and what is observed, to the original data. Specifically, if the variability of the residuals is less than that of the raw data, then the model has explained a portion of the behavior of the raw data and the model can continue to be tested and entertained.   
  
  
A model can’t do worse than explaining nothing, right?   
  
  
Not _these_ models! The differences between their predictions and the observed temperatures were significantly _greater_ (by a factor of two) than what one would get just applying random numbers.   
  
  
Ponder this: Suppose there is a multiple choice test, asking for the correct temperature forecast for 100 temperature observations, and there were four choices. Using random numbers, you would average one‐​in‐​four correct, or 25%. But the models in the _National Assessment_ somehow could only get 12.5%!   
  
  
“No information”—a random number simulation—yields 25% correct in this example, which means that anything less is _anti‐​information_. It seems impossible, but it happened.   
  
  
We informed the USGCRP of this problem when we discovered it, and they wrote back that we were right, and then they went on to publish their _Assessment_ , undisturbed that they were basing it models that had just done the impossible.

With fires raging in the Amazon, hurricanes ripping across the Atlantic, and typhoons flooding Japan, our planet and our climate are sending us a message: 



Yes and that message is that it is business as usual. Fires were happening every year in the Amazon long before the Climate Emergency became a fashionable left-wing cause, and they and the hurricanes and typhoons will continue to naturally occur long after this flat-earth type Climate Emergency nonsense has been put to bed.



We can no longer continue with business as usual.  
The week starting September 20th, 350.org is organizing a [Global Climate Strike](https://href.li/?https://globalclimatestrike.net/), in association with [Fridays For Future](https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/), to show global leaders that the time to act is now. 



Alongside the people walking out of workplaces, schools, and homes around the world, 350.org is organizing [**a digital climate strike**](https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net/) **.**



A digital climate strike? That has to be the LAZIEST form of protest I have ever come across. What’s next, a digital hunger strike where in solidarity you put up a photo of an empty plate? But wait there’s more…



Websites participating in the digital strike will promote the physical strikes in the lead-up to the date, and **partially block themselves** to users on September 20th itself. 



That’s right folks; in a world first, instead of striking in order to inconvenience ‘the man’ and to cost them money, this digital strike is all about websites taking a loaded gun and shooting themselves in the financial foot! Brilliant. I am sure that the government will give two whole hoots about that.

"**Seasonal lattes and hot chocolates being sold by some High Street coffee chains can contain up to 23 spoonfuls of sugar per cup, a study has found.**
Action on Sugar analysed more than 200 drinks and found ""shockingly"" large amounts of sugar in many of them.
Some were made using vegan-friendly alternatives to cow's milk.
The ""venti"" (a pint) Starbucks Signature Caramel Hot Chocolate made with oat milk but topped with whipped cream had the most.
It contains 23 teaspoons (93.7g) of sugar and 758 calories, which Action on Sugar says is as much as three cans of Coca-Cola or four white chocolate and strawberry muffins.
Next was Caffe Nero's Grande Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate made with skimmed milk - containing 15 teaspoons (nearly 60g) of sugar and 503 calories.
Third highest in sugar was a venti Starbucks Gingerbread Latte made with oat milk - containing 14 teaspoons (56.6g) of sugar and 523 calories - the same as 17 custard cream biscuits.
Some of the coffee chains included in the study say they offer a variety of low-sugar options to customers, as well as these more indulgent drinks.
Action on Sugar said consumers may be unknowingly opting for extra sugar because of a lack of labelling and the perception vegan options were healthier, when actually some shops used pre-sweetened alternatives to cow's milk.
Small substitutions can make a difference.
For example, if the Starbucks Gingerbread Latte is made with almond milk instead of oat milk, the sugar content goes down by 4.5 teaspoons (18g).
Action on Sugar assessed drinks from nine different chains; Caffe Nero, Starbucks, Costa, KFC, Greggs, McDonald's, Eat, Leon and Pret a Manger.
Nutritionist Holly Gabriel, from Action on Sugar, said the findings were ""shocking"".
""Coffee shops and cafes need to take much greater steps to reduce the levels of sugar and portion sizes, promote lower sugar alternatives and stop pushing indulgent extras at the till.""
A spokeswoman for Starbucks said that customers could customise the size of their drink, as well as asking for reduced fat milk and less or no cream.
""We are committed to reducing sugar in all our beverages and since 2015 we've delivered a 9% reduction in the sugar content of our gingerbread and core syrup range of vanilla, caramel and hazelnut,"" the spokeswoman added.
Sweetened milk-based drinks are currently exempt from the UK sugar tax - a levy on manufacturers introduced by government as part of the child obesity strategy.
Look for the ""carbohydrates (of which sugars)"" figure in the nutrition label to see how much sugar the product contains for every 100g:"

"**A rail firm has come in for a grilling for serving Lincolnshire sausages made by a butcher in Yorkshire.**
LNER said it introduced the breakfast banger to mark new train services between Lincoln and London.
Butchers in Lincolnshire described the move as ""absolutely crazy"", saying LNER should have worked with a local firm.
According to LNER, Ripon-based butcher Taste Tradition has created ""a great tasting Lincolnshire sausage using an authentic recipe"".
Linda Watkin, from Watkin & Sons butchers in Grantham, described the move as dreadful.
""And I'm originally from Yorkshire,"" she said.
""You can't make Lincolnshire sausages in Yorkshire - it's just not right.""
Jim Sutlcliffe, of Meridian Meats in Louth, said it was a shame not to celebrate Lincolnshire's butchers.
""It's absolutely crazy,"" he said.
""We have lots of producers of award-winning Lincolnshire sausages in the county.""
This tweet summed up the mood of disgruntled Lincolnshire sausage supporters.
An LNER spokesman said the Yorkshire-made banger followed an authentic traditional recipe, and the firm was ""proud to celebrate and showcase the products and produce from along the East Coast route onboard our trains"".
James Wright, a director at Taste Tradition, said the firm had a long-standing arrangement of supplying sausages and other meats to LNER, sourced from local farms.
He added: ""I do understand why Lincolnshire is quite rightly proud of its sausages.""
In 2012, The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) rejected an application for the Lincolnshire sausage to be granted protected status.
It would have meant only bangers made in the county using the correct recipe could be called Lincolnshire sausages.
Defra found there were ""many variations"" across the UK and no enduring link between the product and Lincolnshire.

"After Tom Casperson, a Republican state senator from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, began running for Congress in 2016, he assumed the family of Betsy DeVos,   Donald J. Trump’s nominee to be education secretary, would not oppose him. The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson’s earlier campaigns. But a week before his primary, family members sent $24, 000 to one of his opponents, then poured $125, 000 into a “super PAC,” Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him. The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support from organized labor. “Deceitful, dishonest and cowardly,” was how Mr. Casperson’s campaign described the ads, complaining that the groups running them “won’t say who they are or where their money is coming from. ” On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went down to defeat. In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr. Trump described her as “a brilliant and passionate education advocate. ” Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if misguided, activist for school reform. But that description understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos’s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination of wealth,   ideology and political hardball associated with a   family of billionaires: Charles and David Koch. “They have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New Deal, the welfare state,” Kim   a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement, said, describing the DeVoses. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article. Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like Michigan’s Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center. They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government, including the National Center for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security privatization and against environmental regulation) and the Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also received money from the Koch family. Indeed, the DeVoses’ education activism, which favors alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive from the same   views that inform their suspicion of government. And perhaps more than other   billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact. In the 2016 cycle alone, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, the family spent roughly $14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates, parties, PACs and super PACs. All of this would make Ms. DeVos  —   whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand  —   very different from past education secretaries. “She is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position,” said Jeffrey Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites. “What she and the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have. ” Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich. the daughter of a conservative auto parts magnate who was an early funder of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. When she married Dick DeVos in 1979, it was akin to a merger between two royal houses of western Michigan. Her husband’s father, Richard Sr.   of the multilevel marketing company Amway, was an active member of the Christian Reformed Church that preached a mix of social conservatism and  . He once told the church’s official magazine that Chicago’s poor dwelled in slums because that was “the way they choose to live,” according to a Washington Post story from the 1980s. A fan of   and pinkie rings, Richard Sr. wrote books with titles like “Ten Powerful Phrases for Positive People. ” A similar air hung over his business. Amway sales representatives, which the company calls “independent business owners,” make money both by selling the company’s products  —   everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner  —   and by recruiting other sales representatives. The Federal Trade Commission once investigated the company for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to earn. The flip side of the family’s proselytizing for capitalism, according to Professor   has been an effort to dismantle much “that would counterbalance the power of economic elites. ” Amway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s, protesting high taxes and regulations. Not long after, the company pleaded guilty to cheating the Canadian government out of more than $20 million in revenue. The family had a more winning public face in Dick DeVos, who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir, spending over $30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006. The Detroit Free Press described him that year as the wealthiest man to seek office in the state’s modern history. Betsy DeVos, who served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party for most of the decade between 1996 and 2005, has often played the role of strategist in the relationship. She was a key adviser in her husband’s run for governor and publicly brooded that he had been too gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent. “He’s very good with people, a retail politician who looks you in the eye, shakes your hand, listens to what you say,” said Randy Richardville, a former Republican leader of the Michigan Senate, describing the couple’s strengths. “I would never underestimate Betsy DeVos in a knife fight. ” Ms. DeVos has sometimes lacked her husband’s finesse, once famously blaming many of the state’s economic woes on “high wages. ” She has won detractors, by their account, by browbeating legislators into voting her way. “Betsy DeVos was like my    granddaughter at the time,” said Mike Pumford, a former Republican state representative who once clashed with her. “They were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word ‘yes.’ They turned into spoiled little brats when they were told ‘no. ’” But Ms. DeVos has often made up for what she lacks in tact through sheer force of will. Mr. Richardville said he and Ms. DeVos disagreed over term limits, which she supported as party chairwoman and he opposed: “I said, ‘I don’t think you should be setting policy. You should be supporting those of us who do make policy.’ But she never backed down. ” While Dick and Betsy DeVos appear to practice a more tolerant form of Christianity than their parents  —   Ms. DeVos has spoken out against   bigotry  —   as recently as the early 2000s they funded some groups like Focus on the Family, a large ministry that helps set the political agenda for conservative evangelicals. They have also backed groups that promote conservative values to students and Christian education, including one with ties to the Christian Reformed Church. Their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder Mr. DeVos’s. According to federal disclosures, Amway, which Dick DeVos ran between 1993 and 2002, has lobbied frequently over the last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax. Only the top 0. 2 percent wealthiest estates paid the tax in 2015. The company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters. Ms. DeVos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited contributions known as soft money, which she described in a 1997 editorial as “  American dollars that Big Brother has yet to find a way to control. ” After Congress later passed a major campaign finance reform bill, a nonprofit that Ms. DeVos helped to create and fund masterminded the strategy that produced Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision laying the groundwork for super PACs funded by corporations, unions and individuals to raise and spend unlimited amounts in elections. And then there are the family’s efforts to rein in the labor movement. Through their contributions to think tanks like the Mackinac Center, as well as Mr. DeVos’s direct prodding of Republican legislators, the family played a key role in helping pass Michigan’s      legislation in 2012. The legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment. Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full year the measure was in effect. Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. “Betsy and Dick see themselves as principled conservatives,” said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. “It kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in. ” But the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family’s most formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor’s traditional strongholds. The DeVos family’s roots as education activists date back at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an institute based at the company’s headquarters trained teachers to inject   principles into their curriculum. According to an interview Ms. DeVos gave to Philanthropy magazine, she and her husband became interested in education causes when they began visiting a Christian school that served   children in Grand Rapids in the 1980s. “If we could choose the right school for our kids”  —   by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools  —   “it only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs,” she told the magazine. The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools. Many critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public education and teachers’ unions. The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State has documented how conservative Christians have long supported vouchers, which could fund religious schools. After voters objected by more than a    ratio, Dick DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where groups backed by   donors could offer “a political consequence for opposition, and political reward for support of education reform issues. ” It is not unusual for the wealthy  —   who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education, according to the group    —   to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms. Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools. As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at Michigan State University, put it: “The DeVoses are like: ‘No, we know what we want. We don’t need to have all this window dressing. ’” Ms. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country. Matt Frendewey, a spokesman for one of the groups, said the efforts had frequently been bipartisan, and that the amount of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions from teachers’ unions opposed to reform. Yet in Michigan, at least, the family’s political strategy has not been subtle. After he defied Ms. DeVos on a key charter school vote, Mr. Pumford, the former Republican legislator, survived an effort by the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit the DeVoses bankrolled, to defeat him in his 2002 primary. But shortly after, the House speaker told him the Education Committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming. “I said, ‘Why? ’” Mr. Pumford recalled. “He said: ‘You know why. The DeVoses will walk away from us. ’” Mr. Pumford added: “She told me that was going to happen. ” (Rick Johnson, the House speaker, said he did not recall the conversation but also that he had not promised Mr. Pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his reasons for withholding it.) Over time, the Great Lakes Education Project helped elect Republican majorities sympathetic to the DeVoses’ agenda. But the DeVoses’ lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation. Late one night of their last workweek in 2015, the Michigan House and Senate were about to approve some uncontroversial changes to campaign finance law, when the bill abruptly grew by more than 40 pages. After the legislators discovered what they had voted for, many said they were horrified. Tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards to raise money through property tax increases. “Michigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter approval of local operating levy renewals for property taxes,” the ratings agency Moody’s wrote of the measure the following month. “I was fooled into voting for something I opposed,” said Dave Pagel, a Republican representative. “I consider it the worst vote I’ve made. ” The chief culprits, according to Mr. Pagel and others at the state Capitol when the bill passed, were lobbyists closely tied to the DeVoses. Tony Daunt, a spokesman for the Michigan Freedom Fund, a nonprofit headed by the DeVoses’ longtime political aide, and whose political spending arm they have funded generously, said the group was “part of the discussion process with people in the legislature” about the proposal and “had consistently expressed support for the policy. ” The law was later blocked by a federal judge, but the group has vowed to try again. Ms. DeVos’s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers. In promoting Ms. DeVos in The Washington Post, Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee, emphasized that her wealth gave her the independence to be “someone who isn’t financially biased shaping education. ” He added, “DeVos doesn’t need the job now, nor will she be looking for an education job later. ” But critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda. “The signs are there that she will do something radical,” said Jack Jennings, a former general counsel for the House education committee. “Trump wouldn’t have appointed this woman for this position if he didn’t intend something radical. ”"

One wonders how familiar the 240 authors of the 2013 draft _National Assessment_ are with Karl Popper’s famous essay on the nature of science and its distinction from “pseudoscience.” The essential difference is that science only explains some things and that its hypotheses forbid others, while a theory that is not refutable by any conceivable event — i.e., one that is universally and comprehensively explanatory — is pseudoscience. For Popper, science is characterized by risky predictions (such as gravitational lensing of light in relativity), while pseudoscience does not lend itself to such testing. His favorite examples of pseudoscience were Marxism and Freudian psychology.



This _National Assessment_ is much closer to pseudoscience than it is to science. It is as explanatory as Sigmund Freud. It clearly believes that virtually everything in our society is tremendously dependent the surface temperature, and, because of that, we are headed towards certain and inescapable destruction, unless we take its advice and decarbonize our economy, pronto. Unfortunately, the _Assessment_ can’t quite tell us how to accomplish that, because no one knows how.



In the _Assessment_’s 1200 horror‐​studded pages, almost everything that happens in our complex world — sex, birth, disease, death, hunger, and wars, to name a few — is somehow made worse by pernicious emissions of carbon dioxide and the joggling of surface average temperature by a mere two degrees.



Virtually every chapter in the _Assessment_ perseverates on extreme weather, despite the U.N.s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change statement that:



There is medium evidence and high agreement that long‐​term trends in normalized losses have not been attributed to natural or anthropogenic climate change



The _Assessment_ is woefully ignorant of humanity’s ability to adapt and prosper in response to challenges. The quintessence of this is the truly dreadful chapter on human health and climate change.



While death, disease, poverty and injustice are all conjured by warming, there is not one mention of the fact that life expectancy in the U.S. is approximately twice what it was in the year 1900, or that per‐​capita income in real dollars is over ten times what it was then. It emphasizes diseases that will somehow spread because of warming, neglecting the fact that many were largely endemic when it was colder and were eradicated as we warmed a bit.



Further, it conspicuously ignores the fact that doubling the life expectancy of some 200 million Americans who lived in the 20th century is the same as saving 100 million lives. The society that achieved this powered itself on the combustion of fossil fuels. Does this community of experts understand that the number of lives that it effectively saved is orders of magnitude above and beyond it could possibly cost? It seems, given the panoply of horrors due to start pronto, to prefer that we not have emitted carbon dioxide in the first place. Perhaps they ought to look a place that didn’t. Surely part of the $3.5 billion that the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) consumes per year could finance a field trip to Chad, so they can see the world without cheap and abundant energy.



And what is the purpose of this _Assessment_? The motto of the USGCRP says it all:



 _Thirteen Agencies, One Mission: Empower the Nation with Global Change Science._



The operative word is “empower,” which is the purpose of the _Assessment_. It is to provide cover for a massive regulatory intrusion, and concomitant enormous costs in resources and individual liberty. History tells us that when scientists willingly endorse sweeping governmental agendas fueled by dodgy science, bad things soon happen. To borrow the meter of Winston Churchill:



 _Never in the history of pseudoscientific consensus will so much be done to so many by so few._

By combining data from fossils and models of the ancient Earth, researchers can map where ancient species may have migrated. This method, called biogeographical network analysis, converts evolutionary relationships between species into geographical relationships. This method was used in research by Tai Kubo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the University Museum at the University of Tokyo.

One researcher at the University of Tokyo is in hot pursuit of dinosaurs, tracking extinct species around ancient Earth. Identifying the movements of extinct species from millions of years ago can provide insights into ancient migration routes, interaction between species, and the movement of continents.
“If we find fossils on different continents from closely related species, then we can guess that at some point there must have been a connection between those continents,” said Tai Kubo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the University Museum at the University of Tokyo.
A map of life – biogeography
Previous studies in biogeography — the geographic distribution of plants and animals — had not considered the evolutionary relationships between ancient species. The new method that Kubo designed, called biogeographical network analysis, converts evolutionary relationships into geographical relationships.
For example, cats and dogs are more closely related to each other than to kangaroos. Therefore, a geographical barrier must have separated the ancestors of kangaroos from the ancestors of cats and dogs well before cats and dogs became separate species.
Most fossils are found in just a few hot-spot locations around the world and many ancient species with backbones (vertebrates) are known from just one fossil of that species. These limitations mean that a species’ fossils cannot reveal the full area of where it was distributed around the world.
“Including evolutionary relationships allows us to make higher resolution maps for where species may have migrated,” said Kubo.
The analysis used details from evolutionary studies, the location of fossil dig sites, and the age of the fossils. Computer simulations calculated the most likely scenarios for the migration of species between continents on the Cretaceous-era Earth, 145 to 66 million years ago.
North and south divide
This new analysis verified what earlier studies suggested: nonavian dinosaurs were divided into a group that lived in the Northern Hemisphere and another that lived in the Southern Hemisphere, and that those two groups could still move back and forth between Europe and Africa during the Early Cretaceous period (145 to 100 million years ago), but became isolated in the Late Cretaceous period (100 to 66 million years ago).
During the Early Cretaceous period, there were three major supercontinents: North America-Europe-Asia, South America-Africa, and Antarctica-India-Australia.
By the Late Cretaceous period, only the North America-Europe-Asia supercontinent remained. The other supercontinents had separated into the continents we know today, although they had not yet drifted to their current locations.
“During the Late Cretaceous period, high sea levels meant that Europe was a series of isolated islands. It makes sense that nonavian dinosaur species differentiated between Africa and Europe during that time,” said Kubo.
Kubo plans to complete additional biogeographical analyses for different time periods to continue tracking extinct species around the world and through time.

" Contributed by Albert Jacobs © 2019It is said that Gravity is the primal force of the universe and that the rest are only derivatives thereof. That is now becoming clear to many involved in the Climate issue. UNEP may have had its own reasons for engaging the atmospheric meteorological expertise of the WMO as a partner in the UNFCCC: such expertise is useful for the study of short term atmospheric processes, i.e. “weather”, but is inadequate for the study of ”climate” which depends heavily on influences from within the solar system, both in astronomical space and geologic time. Gravitational forces of planetary orbits and the varying radiative and particle emissions from the sun influence atmosphere and oceans and are not part of the computerised scenario simulations of the IPCC.  Its objective had nothing to do with “solving” a scientific problem, but to support a base for a social-economic world turn-around.Jose (1965) got the solar-system ball rolling with the identification of the periodic behavioural changes of the sun’s movements around the system’s barycentre. This was followed through by others, in recent times by Ivanka Charvatova and Nicola Scafetta. Charvatova mapped the whirling solar pattern in a number of articles, starting in the beginning of this century in which the strict periodicity of the “ordered” course of the such solar movements contrasts with its non-restrained revolutions. The “ordered” periods are related to the Jupiter / Saturn orbits (and possibly some of the other heavier outer planets) and the disordered ones are not. What is important is that the starting points of the orderly inertial solar movement phase (SIM) are 178.7 years apart and that the chaotic ones correspond to solar / terrestrial phenomena of 14C, 10B and 18O for the phases of the Little Ice Age and for thousands of years back.At the same time, Kees de Jager and Silvia Duhau published their papers on the solar radiation phase changes (aam / Rmax) that show the same 178.7 year pattern. The relationship seems obvious: The long-term orbits of the large planets influence the behaviour of the sun and that of the solar dynamo. This is reflected in the amount and type of radiation as well as particle emissions from the sun into our atmosphere, and – importantly – as the formation of condensation initiators and amount of cloud cover.

Blades from a massive wind turbine crumpled to the ground Monday, smashing a car flat and damaging another piece of infrastructure, authorities said.
“This shouldn’t have been put up so hastily. A wind turbine should not be able to be taken down by the wind,” state Sen. Jamaal Bailey said during a press conference discussing the incident, which happened in the Bronx.
A car was smashed and a billboard was knocked down but nobody was injured, according to fire and police officials. (RELATED: Trump Mocks ‘Big Windmills’ In Pennsylvania While Cheering On His Pro-Coal Policies)
During the press conference, Bailey and Assemblyman Mike Benedetto called on the city Department of Buildings (DOB) to make “sure something like this doesn’t happen again.” Both men spoke at the site of the collapse and were struggling to project their voices over the sound of roaring wind.
DOB did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

New York has worked to transition the state away from fossil fuels and toward other forms of energy, namely solar power and wind turbines. The New York State Thruway Authority built five wind turbines in 2015 along the thruway in the western corner of the state to help in the transition.
The project was expensive, with the five windmills costing $4.8 million and another $500,000 for design expenditures. The authority believed the turbines would pay for themselves, saving as much as $420,000 annually on energy bills. Such forms of energy also have detractors.
President Donald Trump, for instance, often mocks turbines for not being as reliable as natural gas or crude oil.
“When the wind stops blowing, it doesn’t make any difference, does it? Unlike those big windmills that destroy everybody’s property values, kill all the birds,” Trump told a crowd who gathered to hear him speak at a chemical plant in August.
Trump added: “One day the environmentalists are going to tell us what’s going on with that. And then all of a sudden it stops.”

Last week, in fulfillment of a 2008 Act of Congress, our National Academies of Science published “America’s Climate Choices” [ACC], another in a numbing succession of groupthink reports predicting the end of the world unless the U.S. dramatically reduces its emissions of carbon dioxide. Pronto.



Documents like this aren’t really intended to change anyone’s mind. Rather, they are designed to be used by unelected regulators as scientific cover for what our legislature refuses to do, which is to enact expensive and intrusive restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide. The penultimate iteration of this was something called the “Synthesis Report” of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a 2009 screed that the Environmental Protection Agency used as a scientific cover for new rules on fuel economy and regulation of power plants.



ACC is by far the most blatantly political of these documents. Several authors are environmental activists, and the National Academies’ President, Ralph Cicerone, has been on a mission to demonize carbon dioxide for decades.



He is very influential and capable. He was instrumental in getting chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerant production banned because they accelerated the destruction of stratospheric ozone over and near Antarctica in early spring. This was an easy thing to do, as chemical giant DuPont was eager to replace its patent‐​expired CFC Freon, once it patented a substitute hydroclorflourocarbon.



Carbon dioxide, thought to be a significant cause of the warming of surface temperature since the mid‐​1970s, is currently the respiration of the world’s economic civilization. Getting rid of it isn’t as simple as banning CFCs and switching to another refrigerant.



Some big‐​time scientists are alarmed at the Academies’ activism. MIT atmospheric physicist (and member of the National Academies) Richard Lindzen says that Cicerone, as president of the Academies, feels that “regardless of the evidence the answer is predetermined. If the government wants carbon control, that is the answer that the Academies will provide. Nothing could better epitomize the notion of science in the service of politics — something that, unfortunately, has characterized so‐​called climate science.”



The strident rhetoric in ACC could further divide the electorate and the government on climate change. Pollsters tell us — I think rightly — that the best way to characterize the majority of public sentiment is that people indeed believe that global warming is real (correct), that humans have something to do with it (correct), and that scientists are exaggerating its effects (thank you for listening).



A corollary has also been noted: the more shrill the rhetoric, the more people turn off. They are just tired of being hectored by scientists proclaiming certain apocalypses that never pan out: Examples include acid rain and the death of the forest, asteroids, the population bomb, and a catastrophic extinction of species that has eluded detection.



While again calling down hell and brimstone, this time if we don’t immediately reduce our carbon dioxide emissions, ACC never gets to the most inconvenient truth: We are the rapidly shrinking into irrelevance on this issue.



Here’s a fact that is curiously absent. If, by 2050, the U.S. reduces its per‐​capita emission of carbon dioxide to what it was at the end of the Civil War, and the rest of the developed world does similarly, prospective global warming would drop by a grand total of 7%, 100 years from now. This assumes that the “sensitivity” of surface temperature to a doubling of atmospheric CO-2 is 5.4 degrees, a commonly used value that may be way too high (see below).



This is a vital piece of information for any policymaker or regulator. Why is it not in the report?



To its credit, ACC does note two “main sources of uncertainty in projecting climate change impacts.” (There are actually plenty more, but these two are quite important.)



The first is the uncertainty related to future emissions because of changes in technology, policy, and “other factors that are impossible to fully predict.”



Example: In 1982 the Academy (it only has recently become the Academies) produced “Energy in Transition, 1985–2010,” a document that, like ACC, received headline recognition and was cited as gospel by the policy community that it intended to influence. It predicted a general decline in domestic production of natural gas through 2010, with the ultimate possibility of its phase‐​out as a significant fuel. Since then, we discovered huge reservoirs that can be coaxed from common shale formations worldwide. The amount of shale gas now being burned is responsible (along with our economic miasma) for the record reduction in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 2009.



The second uncertainty is over the true value of the climate “sensitivity” to carbon dioxide. There are now multiple and independent strands of evidence — from the oceans, from clouds, and from thermometers — that our climate models assume a sensitivity that is about twice as large as it is in reality. Nonetheless, if evidence continues to accrue, there will be major resistance to accepting this for obvious scientific and behavioral reasons. “We goofed” doesn’t go down easy when trying to re‐​engineer the world’s energy economy.



Make no mistake, though. The new National Academies report is significant. It is the sound and the fury, signifying policy.

" Contributed by Kenneth B. Gregory, P. Eng.   © March 24, 2019Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is a major issue of our time.  There has been a great deal of research on both natural and anthropogenic climate change published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Unfortunately, governments and most news media rely on a political organization of the United Nations called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for information and assessments about climate science and policy options. The IPCC relies on climate models that assume all the warming recorded by instruments was caused by human activity despite the overwhelming evidence of large and rapid warming and cooling events before humans could have had any effect on global temperatures.  The sun’s activity and intensity has increased through the 20th century. Its magnetic flux in the 1990s was the greatest of the last 3000 years.[1] The IPCC falsely attributes natural warming and urban warming to greenhouse gas emission warming by ignoring the compelling evidence of natural climate change before 1950 that correlates well with indicators of solar activity.Current global temperatures are likely similar to that of the Roman Warm Period (1 – 200 AD) and the Medieval Warm Period (800-1100 AD), but much warmer than the Dark Age Cold Period and the Little Ice Age which ended about 1850. The temperature history shows an obvious millennium cycle, which strongly indicates that a large portion of the warming since 1850 was a natural recovery from the Little Ice Age[2].Several studies of urban warming show strong correlations between warming and indicators of economic development. McKitrick and Michaels 2017 estimate that about half of the warming over land since 1980 was due to urban warming.[3],[4] This urban heat island effect (UHIE)[5] is caused by several processes, including the direct heating by energy use in our cities, the change in the land cover by replacing natural vegetation with roads and buildings, which retains heat and prevents transpiration. Turbulent mixing the warm air aloft by high buildings with the near-surface air at nighttime which raises nighttime temperatures. These effects must be removed from the instrument temperature record to determine the warming effect of human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.the effect of CO2 emissions is projected to cause about 0.6 °C of warming from 2018 to 2100 … may be fully offset by natural cooling forces for the next 25 years.     The IPCC ignores the urban warming component of the temperature indexes they use. The IPCC acknowledges and agrees that there is a strong correlation between warming and economic development, but they dismissed the evidence by claiming natural atmospheric circulation  changes warmed the cities but not the surrounding country-side, a ludicrous claim.The most recent energy balance study of climate sensitivity to emissions by Lewis & Curry 2018[6] shows that if all the warming was due to GHG, the expected warming due to all emissions would cause 0.9 °C of warming from 2018 to 2100. Carbon dioxide (CO2) causes 90% of GHG warming. This forecast is based on an energy balance calculation that relates the total warming over the last 140 years to the GHG forcing estimates published by the IPCC. However, when the natural warming and the UHIE is accounted for, the effect of CO2 emissions is projected to cause about 0.6 °C of warming from 2018 to 2100. These estimate assume emissions continue to increase exponentially with no mitigation policies. However, the sun has entered a quiet, less active phase and the natural 65-year ocean cycle is changing to a cooling phase, so the projected CO2 warming may be fully offset by natural cooling forces for the next 25 years.The direct radiative warming effect of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use is well understood by climate scientists. An increase of CO2 in the air from 0.041% in 2018 to 0.064% in 2100 is expected to cause about 0.60 °C of warming[7] in that 82-year period assuming no other factors change, such as the amount of water vapor, clouds, snow and ice cover, and natural climate change.  The average of the climate models increases this warming to 1.2 °C by assuming water vapour, a strong greenhouse gas, increases in the upper atmosphere and clouds change to enhance warming. But the weather balloon measurements from NOAA show water vapour declining in the upper atmosphere, allowing heat to escape to outer space. News media stories and many official reports rely on a extremely high emissions IPCC scenario called RCP8.5. This scenario assumes coal use increases ten-fold and CO2 concentrations reach 0.094% (936 ppm) by 2100, which is way above an exponential extrapolation of the recent history. This is an near-impossible emissions scenario. It’s not going to happen. It is used only to scare people.The IPCC ignores natural climate change other than the change in the total solar irradiance (TSI), which is the heat output of the sun. This change is small, but the IPCC ignores the evidence that the sun’s impact on climate is much larger than what can be explained by the sun’s TSI change.  The conduct of the IPCC in this regard is contrary to fundamental scientific principles. Science requires that theory is tested against observational evidence, and where there is disagreement, the theory must be modified.The large solar effect may be due to the sun’s changing magnetic field carried by the solar wind which has a significant effect on cloud cover by affecting the creation of tiny aerosol particles that seed cloud formation, and large changes in the ultraviolet radiation that affects stratosphere temperatures, that eventually affects surface temperatures.[8] Natural climate change also includes long-term ocean oscillations, volcanic activity and other processes.The average of the climate models project a warming trend of the lowest part of the atmosphere from 1979 to 2018 that is 215% of the actual measurements, so the models are wrong. The model trend of the global bulk atmospheric temperature is 250% of the trends of the weather balloon and satellite data. This is because the models are far too sensitive to greenhouse gases. The bulk atmosphere warms more than the surface in the models because they increase water vapour in the upper atmosphere, while the measurements from weather balloons and satellites show declining water vapour.FUND is an economic model that simulates the welfare impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in various regions of the Earth.[9] It forecasts the wealth growth and the economic and social impacts of climate change and CO2 fertilization of plants.  It shows that Canada’s personal wealth, or gross domestic product per person (GDP/capita) is projected to increase from C$60,550 in 2018 to C$151,700 in 2100 despite climate change. This is an increase in personal wealth by a factor of 2.5.Dr. Richard Tol is an expert in climate economics and co-author of the FUND model. He wrote in his book “Climate Economics” published in 2014 “The impact [in Canada of climate change] is positive throughout the 21st century, as are incremental impacts”[10]. He shows the impact continually increases to 1.78% of GDP by 2100, equivalent to over C$100 billion benefit per year. The largest benefits for Canada are reduced space heating costs and higher agricultural production.The Alberta Government relied on a report produced by the US Government to develop their climate plan. That report utilized three economic models to estimate the social cost/benefit of CO2 emissions (SCC).  Two of those models have insignificant benefits of CO2 fertilization of plants and they fail to account for adaptation. They also assume that all warming is harmful, which clearly is untrue. The FUND model does include CO2 fertilization and attempt to account for adaptation, but the US Government report authors fudged the SCC higher in the model. They ran all three models using a distribution of possible climate sensitivities to GHG that are far above recent estimates. These factors vastly increases the SCC and makes the results inappropriate for climate policy. Correcting just the climate sensitivity to a recent estimate reduces the calculated SCC from the FUND model by 80%.[11]  The Alberta Government projects that their climate plan, which includes shutting down coal-fired power plants and imposing carbon taxes, would reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 2030 by 0.026 parts per million, thereby reducing global temperatures by 0.00007 °C, which is insignificant.[12]EDC Associates Ltd. published a study of the potential impact on Alberta’s electricity market of Alberta’s climate plan. The study finds that the cumulative cost of electricity from 2017 to 2030 is expected to increase by $3.3 to $5.9 billion depending on policy choices. The CO2 reduction would cost $420/tCO2, which is 14 times the current carbon price.[13]The Alberta government plans to replace inexpensive, reliable and dispatchable electricity from fossil fuels with extremely expensive and unreliable electricity from wind and solar electricity, which requires near 100% backup with natural gas fired power plants. The extreme variability of renewable power requires the backup power plants to rapidly ramp their power output up and down to offset the variable output of wind and solar power. This enormously increases the cost of the backup power and causes increased CO2 emissions per unit of electricity produced. In Europe, electricity prices are highly correlated with the amount of solar and wind on the grid, with prices in Denmark and Germany about 3 times higher than in Hungary, which has little wind and solar power. The relation implies that the cost of wind and solar power in Europe is 7.2 times the cost of power from fossil fuels.Warming and CO2 fertilization benefits the agriculture industry as CO2 is plant food and warming increases the area of arable lands and promotes growth. A study of CO2 fertilization on crops shows a global economic benefit of over the 50-year period 1961-2011 of US$4.0 trillion. The annual benefit in 2011 was US$176 billion (2018 dollars).[14]Studies of satellite imagery shows that the world has greened due to CO2 emissions. A study published in 2016 shows a widespread increase of growing-season leaf area, with the CO2 fertilization effect explaining 70% of the observed greening trend. The greening over 33 years is equivalent to adding a green continent 2/3 times the size of mainland USA.[15]The Canadian death rate in January is more than 100 deaths/day greater than in August. Similarly, the USA death rate in January and February is more than 1000 deaths per day greater than in July and August.[16]  Dr. Peiser wrote “Britain’s leading medical experts have calculated that a rise of the average temperature by two degrees Celsius over the next 50 years would increase heat-related deaths in Britain by about 2,000 – but would reduce cold-related deaths by about 20,000. In other words, the decrease in the number of cold-related deaths would be much more significant (by a factor of 10) than the heat-related deaths due to rising temperatures.” A major study published in 2015 examined 74 million deaths worldwide from 1985 to 2012 and found that the ratio of cold-related to heat-related deaths was a whopping 17 to 1.[17] It appears that much of these health benefits of warming are not included in economic models of climate change.On a global basis, the FUND model (Julia version) calculates that the net annual benefit of GHG emissions and warming from 1900 is around US$3 trillion/yr at 2100, or 0.85% of global GDP assuming an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.0 °C to a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere with 1.3 °C of warming from 2018. That is, global warming to 2100 is likely net beneficial.The annual global benefit of greenhouse gas emissions may be around US$3 trillion/year by 2100.So why are we putting a huge burden on ourselves to prevent a benefit to the extremely wealthy people of the future? If the economic forecasts are correct and future Canadians in 2100 will be 2.5 times wealthier than us today, they can afford to pay for adaptation measures if and when temperatures increase to levels that start to cause damages.[1] “A 3,000-Year Record of Solar Activity”, http://www.co2science.org/articles/V17/N32/C1.php[2] The natural warming is estimated at 0.084 °C/century, however, this is very uncertain.[3] Quantifying the Influence of the Urban Heat Island Effect,

"JERUSALEM  —   A Palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of Israeli soldiers as they were getting off a bus in Jerusalem on Sunday afternoon, killing four and injuring 17 others, according to the police and witnesses. The police called the episode an act of terrorism. Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said the attacker had been shot, and the police released images showing the truck’s windshield riddled with bullet holes. The dead included three female soldiers and one male soldier, the Israeli military confirmed. Several people were hospitalized, some with critical injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene of the attack and said the perpetrator was “by all indications a supporter of the Islamic State. ” “This is part of the same pattern inspired by Islamic State, by ISIS, that we saw first in France, then in Germany and now in Jerusalem. This is part of the same ongoing battle against this global scourge of the new terrorism,” he added. Mr. Netanyahu has often made the comparison between local attacks against Israelis and those in the rest of the world, though the attacks in Israel are more broadly viewed as being more connected to the   conflict. While the Israeli security services have described a few Palestinian attackers as having been inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State, no direct links have been established between them and the organization. The attack on Sunday occurred on the Armon Hanatziv Promenade, a popular tourist spot between East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem that offers sweeping views of the Old City. The four soldiers killed were Erez Orbach, 20, from Alon Shvut, in the West Bank Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim, near Tel Aviv Shir Hajaja, 22, from Maale Adumim in the West Bank and Shira Tzur, 20, from Haifa. The violence ended several months of relative calm in the contested city, after a period of frequent stabbings, shootings and car attacks. It also underlined the volatility of the situation at a time when   Donald J. Trump has promised to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a potentially explosive step that American administrations have avoided for decades. Palestinian officials say it would destroy the chances of any peace process by prejudging the outcome, and some have said it would constitute a declaration of war against Palestinians. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, said on Friday that the Palestinians would view any such change in the status quo in Jerusalem as the crossing of a red line. Mosque preachers addressed the proposed embassy move in their sermons during Friday prayers, apparently on the instruction of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel captured the area from Jordan in the 1967 war and claims sovereignty there. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds sway in Gaza, praised Sunday’s attack, without taking responsibility for it. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas official, described it as a “courageous and heroic operation. ” In Gaza City, people were handing out sweets to   in celebration. Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, condemned the attack in a statement. “It is reprehensible that some choose to glorify such acts, which undermine the possibility of a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis,” he said. “There is nothing heroic in such actions. ” The Palestinian official news agency, WAFA, identified the driver of the truck as Fadi Ahmad   28, a resident of the nearby Palestinian neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber in East Jerusalem. Ribhi Ewiysat, a resident of the neighborhood, said that a large number of Israeli security forces had entered the area and were at the attacker’s house. Chaim Newman, a tour guide who was accompanying the group of soldiers at the scene, told Israel Radio, “The soldiers got off the bus, and we were getting organized when suddenly the truck came with great speed and rammed into the group. ” “Civilians and soldiers began shooting, and this prevented a worse tragedy,” he added. “He rammed them a number of times, going into reverse and forward in order to hurt more people. ” Chen Lendi Sharon, a paramedic from the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said there was “chaos on the scene” when she arrived. “I saw a truck that rammed youngsters getting off the bus next to the Armon Hanatziv observation point. ” Ms. Lendi Sharon said that at least 10 people were trapped under the bus or were lying on the grass by the road. The attack occurred around 1:30 p. m. Dozens of soldiers were getting off buses at the site as part of a routine educational tour of Jerusalem. Aged 18 to 21, they were cadets from an officers’ course, Israel Radio reported. About two hours after the attack, the truck, a white flatbed with a crane on the back, remained at the scene and an ambulance was still removing bodies. Dovy Meyer, a spokesman for the United Hatzalah ambulance service who was at the scene, said that around 100 soldiers had been milling about when the attack occurred. A spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks began in October 2015 and quickly spread from Jerusalem and the West Bank to cities around Israel. More than 30 Israelis and two American visitors were among those killed in the attacks. More than 240 Palestinians have been killed during that period, many of them while carrying out or intending to carry out attacks, according to Israeli officials. Several attackers have come from the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood. Mr. Netanyahu said the neighborhood had been “encircled” by security forces on Sunday."

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
_\--------------------_   
  
The main idea, as it is portrayed, driving the Obama administration’s pursuit of carbon dioxide regulations is that climate change is leading to all manner of bad things. Pointing to concrete example of bad things that have resulted from human greenhouse gas emissions, however, is much more challenging than just saying it is the case. In fact, for most climate/weather events and their resulting effect, the bulk of the science contradicts the administration’s contentions.   
  
Roger Pielke Jr. makes it a habit to point out how White House proclamations concerning extreme weather events go awry. We have similar habits.   
  
An especially egregious example concerns heat-related mortality. It is true that extreme heat can lead to excess mortality. It is also true that global warming should lead to more heat waves. However, it is NOT true that global warming will lead to more heat-related mortality—the logic forwarded by the administration. Frequent readers of this blog are well aware of this.   
  
However, as not everyone (to his or her detriment) is a frequent reader of this blog, we presented our findings on climate change and heat-related mortality to the audience at a science policy conference held by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) this week. Our conclusions were:   




The cause of the observed decline in the sensitivity to extreme heat in the face of rising heat is likely found in a collection of adaptations including increased access to air-conditioning, better medical care, improved building design, community response programs, heat watch/warning systems, and biophysical changes. There is no reason to think that such response measures won’t continue to exist and be improved upon into the future.   
  
In our recent study summarizing the findings on declining heat-related mortality trends in both the U.S and Europe, we made this observation (Knappenberger et al., 2014):   
  
“Some portion of this response [the declining sensitivity to excessive heat events] probably reflects the temporal increase in the frequency of extreme-heat events, an increase that elevates public consciousness and spurs adaptive response. In this manner, climate change itself leads to adaptation.”   
  
It is insufficient and inappropriate to ignore this effect when compiling and discussing the impacts of climate change. If an increasing frequency of heat events raises public awareness and gives rise to an adaptive response that lowers the population’s relative risk due to extreme heat, this must be properly weighed against any increases in mortality that result from a greater number of mortality-inducing heat events.   
  
Our analysis highlights one of the many often overlooked intricacies of the human response to climate change.



Our full AGU poster, “Climate Change, Heat Waves, and Adaptation,” is available for viewing online here.   
  
Hopefully, it opened some eyes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online weekly FOCUS writes Germany is turning into “Europe’s economic sick man” – due in large part to high energy prices and fierce environmental radicalism.
The German weekly reports how German industrial production has been falling, citing figures from the automotive, chemicals and pharmaceutical industries, all of which need large quantities of energy.
German industrial production in freefall
German economic output, now bordering on a recession, has been slowing down markedly since early 2018 and is now lagging behind the Eurozone average.
FOCUS cites a chart provided by Global Insight, Commerzbank-Research, which shows the 3-month moving average for industrial production, with 2015 equaling 100:

While the Eurozone industrial production has been holding steady since 2015, Germany has been falling since the end of 2017. Source: Global Insight, Commerzbank-Research.
The same trend is observed for the automotive industry. Car production by German automakers has been cut back domestically while the rest of Europe has seen greater car production by German automakers. Germany is no longer a production friendly location to do business.
High energy prices, hostile environmentalism taking a toll
FOCUS reports that the quality of Germany as a industry-friendly location “is deteriorating” and that the country has been “moving environmentally burdensome production” beyond its borders and notes how “German companies pay the highest electricity prices in Europe by a wide margin.”
“That particularly burdens the chemical industry,” FOCUS writes.

Under attack by radical environmentalism
Recently Germany has come under massive fire from a concerted campaign by environmental groups for not taking the fight against climate change seriously enough and moving too slowly in converting its energy supply to one that is green.
The Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion protests have been widespread in Germany and spooked politicians.
Sights on combustion engines and conventional power plants
Now the pressure is mounting to ban internal combustion engines altogether and to shut down the remaining nuclear power plants and to exit coal fired power. Analysts warn, however, that such power plant shutdowns will only make German electricity even more expensive, and make the country even less attractive as a place to do business.
German farmers block streets nationwide
Environmentalists and government regulators have also targeted agriculture in Germany. Today, farmers shut down streets in a nationwide protest and “are calling on Federal Ministers Klöckner and Schulze to discuss current agricultural and climate plans with them so they can have their say.”
Juggernaut Turkey
Already Europe is in turmoil as at times violent protests rage in Spain, France, Netherlands and Belgium. In addition, Britain is pressing ahead with its exit out of the European Union while millions of refugees threaten to make their way to Europe from the war-ravaged Middle East, Turkey and North Africa. Refugee camps in Italy and Greece are horrendously overfilled.
The last thing Europe needs now are more insane, industry-destroying, jobs-killing policies. Hard economic times, energy poverty and millions of refugees would lead to a highly explosive situation in Europe.
It’s time for Europe’s leaders to finally sober the hell up and admit their policies are naive pipe dreams.

“Glaciers: climate witnesses of the ice age to the present”. A book review
By Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and Klaus-Eckart Puls
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne
(Translated by P. Gosselin
Prof. Gernot Patzelt is an internationally renowned glaciologist with numerous publications and lectures. Now he has, as it were, presented his life’s work with the book “Gletscher: Klimazeugen von der Eiszeit bis zur Gegenwart“ (Glaciers: Climate Witnesses from the Ice Age to the Present” (Hatje Cantz-Verlag, Berlin, 2019, 266 pages). It combines the overwhelming artistic aesthetics of Alpine glaciers in painting with scientific glaciology.

Gernot Patzelt, Professor of High Altitude Research at the University of Innsbruck and Head of the Alpine Research Centre Obergurgl in Tyrol, was not and is not retired after his retirement in 2004. His lectures, especially those at EIKE climate conferences (here, here) and his writings, which are listed here, bear witness to this. He was also co-author of the book “A. Fischer und G. Patzelt: Gletscher im Wandel: 125 Jahre Gletscher-Meßdienst des Alpenvereins, Springer, 2018″.
His book “Klimazeugen von der Eiszeit bis zur Gegenwart” (Climate Witnesses from the Ice Age to the Present), which is discussed here, breaks new ground by making the otherwise rarely attempted connection between natural aesthetics and scientific description. The Austrian glaciologist  has convincingly succeeded in this attempt, namely the connection of painting history with Ice Age history, glacier history, landscape history, vegetation history, climate history, cultural history … and more!
Almost the entire first half of the book is dedicated to the representation of glaciers in painting. The images by Thomas Ender and Ferdinand Runk, chamber painter to Archduke Johann of Austria (here), are shown here, and thus movingly beautiful paintings have been rescued from oblivion.
In addition to aesthetics, however, science is also not neglected in this first part of the book. In the chapter “The glaciological significance of the paintings” it is explained how the glaciers in question can be viewed from the paintings. Thus the paintings shown are at the same time scientific documents.
70% of last 10,000 years saw smaller glacier extent
In the second part of the book a wealth of details is given on different regions, altitudes and many individual glaciers. One learns the fact that today’s climate, vegetation and glacier situation is nothing “special” caused by industrial man, but is well within the “climate noise” of the last ten thousand years!
Moreover, a summary graph from the book on page 238 shows: For about 70% of the last 10,000 years (post-glacial period), the extent of the Alpine glaciers was smaller than today, while tree lines and temperatures were higher as well.

 Patzelt summarizes (on p. 235):
“Around 8500 BC (before Christ) the temperatures were lower, from 8200 BC they were already above the level of the present temperature conditions … the postglacial warm period reached a first peak shortly after 6000 BC, followed by a second peak around 4200 BC. During this time … the timberline was 100-130 meters higher than what is currently possible, which means that a summer temperature of 0.6-0.8 °C higher can be derived:
“The temperature increase of recent decades (note: 1980-2010) is within the postglacial range.”

Figure 1: Summer temperature, forest-/treeline, glacial retrest periods Westalpen, glacier advance Ostalpen, chart from p. 238 of the above mentioned book by G. Patzelt.
From the book, but also from the biography of Gernot Patzelt (here), the primary closeness to nature in his research work cannot be overlooked. His own exploration, hiking and the collection of scientifically interesting tree relics on site, as melting glaciers release them again and again, were his main and heart’s desire.
Only after that did his desk and laboratory follow. You can feel his love for the scientific subject and, inseparably connected with it, his never-ending admiration of the beauty of glaciers.
We wish his book every success, because there is hardly anything comparable to this object. And we are looking forward to welcoming Gernot Patzelt once again to give a lecture at future EIKE Climate Conferences.

"**My Money is a new series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here, Sunneva MarÃ­a SvÃ¶vudÃ³ttir from Reykjavik in Iceland, records her spending over a week and shares tips for saving.**
We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. We're particularly keen to hear from disabled people about the extra cash your disability costs you. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (World) Facebook group, or if you live in the UK, please join our My Money (UK) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you.
Sunneva is 20 and lives in Iceland. She works in a bakery part-time as she has just finished at school. Her hobbies are art, bullet journaling, music and make-up.
She recently went head-to-head with another My Money blogger, Chelsea Thomas from California, on World Business Report \- have a listen to hear Sunneva talk about what she spent her money on this week.
Today I went out to meet my friend for lunch. We met at a sushi place and I ended up getting some sushi as well as some gyoza dumplings, which cost around **1,700 krÃ³na** **($13.85, Â£10.60)**.
I didn't do much for the rest of the day besides walk around ReykjavÃ­k and talk. But on the night I met my best friend who lives far away from me and we got dinner together at Metro and that was **1,000 krÃ³na**.
Today I didn't really save any money as I had made plans to eat out with two people. I also dyed my hair at home but thankfully my mom offered to pay for the dye so I ended up not spending money on that.
**Total spend: 2,700 krÃ³na**
This day was full of stress, as I was doing last minute things for my graduation.
Early in the morning I took a bus, which I didn't have to pay for as I have a yearly season ticket, to get my nails done. Usually acrylic nails will cost around **8,000 krÃ³na** but I got them done for free as a gift.
After this I had to do some last minute shopping and went to a grocery store and I ended up getting some money from my dad to buy things for the graduation celebration.
I ended up spending **4,000 krÃ³na** on soda, coffee and things that still had to be bought. For lunch I had some pho noodles which cost around **1,700 krÃ³na**. I had to go help my mother after that so I was busy until dinner time.
For dinner I met my aunt, we ate food and went to the movies and that was about **4,000 krÃ³na**. The rest of the night was spent getting ready for the graduation celebration the next day.
**Total spend: 17,700 krÃ³na**
This was such a big day, so many amazing things happened today.
Let's start with this morning. I woke up at 8am, and the biggest reason for this is because there were concert tickets that went on sale at 9am.
It was for a concert in London, for a K-pop group called Seventeen, a group I have been following since 2015. So I knew I had to get tickets as they had never been to Europe before. I ended up getting the most expensive tickets for their show in the SSE Arena, it was a huge sum: **64,500 krÃ³na** **($519, Â£397)**. Yes, you read that correctly. It was go all out or don't bother so, I did it.
After this it was time to get ready for my GRADUATION! I saved money by doing my make-up myself, instead of getting some professional. I had my hair done for free, by a professional. The dress and the shoes I also got for free from Facebook!
In my school we have to wear a cap while we graduate, which costs around **15,000 krÃ³na** BUT instead of buying one I just ended up wearing my mother's cap that she had worn years ago, it looked the same so I saved a lot my doing that! I don't mind wearing things from other people, the dress, the shoes and the cap all looked new.
The ceremony went by fast and after that I went home to get everything ready for the small family gathering that was happening at 5pm. All the food was all figured out by my amazing mother so I didn't have to spend any money on that.
The night was so fun, I spent it with my friends and family, and I ended up getting a lot of money as gifts from my family. The last thing I did was go out for KFC with my best friend, and that was **1,200 krÃ³na**.
**Total spend: 65,700 krÃ³na**
I didn't do a lot on this day. I had work early that morning and the only thing I spent money on were two things for my mother. Those things cost about **4,800 krÃ³na** , a lip balm and a foam cleanser. I was happy to finally just get to relax at home.
I ate dinner with my family so I didn't spend any money on food that day,
**Total spend: 4,800 krÃ³na**
I didn't do that much today either. I just had work again this morning and then after such a long week of waking up early I had a very big nap.
When I woke up for dinner I got a phone call from my aunt and she asked me if I was interested to go see the new Star Wars movie - yes!
I took a bus, again I have a bus card so I didn't have to pay anything for that. She had already bought a ticket so I saved money on that because my aunt is amazing. I offered to buy popcorn for us so I got some snacks that were **1,200 krÃ³na**.
**Total spend: 1,200 krÃ³na**
On Saturday I just had a calm day at home so I didn't do anything special or spend any money.
**Total spend: 0 krÃ³na**
On Sunday I met my aunt, again. (Yes we are pretty close even though she is 11 years older than me!) We went to the mall, as she was trying to find some gifts. I bought a white pen that I needed that was **250 krÃ³na** but after this we drove to her place and we just spent the day watching horror movies.
**Total spend: 250 krÃ³na**
The week was a very busy one, I spent a bit more money on food than I would usually do but since I was rarely at home it just happened that way. I also spent a huge sum of money on something I have wanted to do for so long, go to a concert. I am excited for that, even though it was a huge amount of money. I think that's what I'm most happy about this week. I do also want to point out the amount of kind people online.
There are so many groups on Facebook that can help with all different occasions, you don't need to buy a very expensive dress to feel beautiful. Facebook has a bunch of places you can find free stuff, stuff for a low price and such. I highly recommend looking through some pages if you are ever in trouble.
**Total weekly spend: 92,350 krÃ³na**"
"Tilikum, the captive orca who killed a trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando, Fla. in 2010 and later became the subject of the documentary “Blackfish,”  died on Friday. The whale had been suffering from a persistent infection from a bacteria found in wild habitats and natural settings, but the exact cause of death will be determined by a necropsy, SeaWorld Parks  Entertainment said in a statement. The orca, a male estimated to be about 36 years old, had been kept by the organization for 25 years. “While today is a difficult day for the SeaWorld family, it’s important to remember that Tilikum lived a long and enriching life while at SeaWorld and inspired millions of people to care about this amazing species,” the statement said. “Tilikum had, and will continue to have, a special place in the hearts of the SeaWorld family, as well as the millions of people all over the world that he inspired,” said the president of SeaWorld, Joel Manby. Tilikum’s caretakers had said in March that the whale was afflicted with the infection that was likely to lead to his death. The whale was at the center of an orca breeding program that SeaWorld ended last year. The company also ended its killer whale performances in San Diego, where state lawmakers had brought intense pressure on the company after the documentary’s release. With the death of Tilikum, SeaWorld now holds 22 orcas at its three facilities in Orlando, San Antonio and San Diego. SeaWorld also noted that Tilikum was “inextricably connected” with the death of his trainer, Dawn Brancheau, in 2010. “While we all experienced profound sadness about that loss, we continued to offer Tilikum the best care possible, each and every day, from the country’s leading experts in marine mammals,” the SeaWorld statement said. Tilikum bit down on the ponytail of Ms. Brancheau, his    trainer, before dragging her underwater and killing her. After her death, SeaWorld conducted an extensive review that resulted in trainers further isolating themselves from the animals for safety. In 2013, the documentary “Blackfish” examined Ms. Brancheau’s death by looking at the mental state of whales that are taken from their pods in the wild and raised at marine parks. But SeaWorld pushed back against the film’s claims that the whales in captivity suffer physical and mental distress because of confinement. Tilikum has also been connected with the deaths of two other people: Keltie Byrne, a    student and   trainer who slipped into a pool containing Tilikum and two other orcas in 1991, and Daniel P. Dukes, a    man who slipped into SeaWorld after hours in 1999. Mr. Dukes was found dead, draped over Tilikum’s back. Tilikum came to SeaWorld in 1991 from Sealand of the Pacific in Canada, and the organization said it had not collected a whale from the wild in nearly 40 years."

__The_ _Current Wisdom _ _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. “Chip” Knappenberger, from Cato’s Center for the Study of Science, review interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.__   
  
  
  
_Question:_ How long will the fantasy that climate models are reliable indicators of the earth’s climate evolution persist in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary?   
  
_Answer:_ Probably for as long as there is a crusade against fossil fuels.   
  
Without the exaggerated alarm conjured from overly pessimistic climate model projections of climate change from carbon dioxide emissions, fossil fuels—coal, oil, gas—would regain their image as the celebrated agents of prosperity that they are, rather than being labeled as pernicious agents of our destruction.   
  
Just how credible are these climate models?   
  
In two words, “they’re not.”   
  
Everyone has read that over the past 10-15 years, most climate models’ forecasts of the rate of global warming have been wrong. Most predicted a hefty warming of the earth’s average surface temperature to have taken place, while there was no significant change in the real world.   
  
But very few people know that the same situation has persisted for 25, going on 35 years, or that over the past 50-60 years (since the middle of the 20th century), the same models expected about 33 percent more warming to have taken place than was observed.   




We can blame the lack of public awareness of this scientific farce squarely on the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the Summary for Policymakers, the most-read section of its brand new _Fifth Assessment Report_ (released back in late September), the IPCC had this to say about climate model performance:   




Climate models have improved since the [ _Fourth Assessment Report_ published in 2007]. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions ( _very_ _high confidence_ ).



Followed immediately by _this_ :   




The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend ( _very high confidence_ ). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012).



All in all, a rather glowing assessment.   
  
Glowing, but not so hot.   
  
We’ve calculated the trend in the global average surface temperature simulated to have occurred starting in every year since 1950 and ending in 2012 for every* run of every climate model used in the new IPCC report. In Figure 1, below, we compare the average (and spread) of these 108 model runs with the observed trend during each of the same periods.   






  
  
In every single case, the observed trend lies below the model average trend. For the trends of length 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 27 years, the observed trend lies outside (below) the range which includes 95 percent of all model runs (indicated by red in Figure 1). In statistics, this means that the observed trend is inconsistent with the collection of model trends. For trends of length 10, 11, 12, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 years, the observed trend lies outside (below) the range encompassing 90 percent of all model trends (indicated in yellow in Figure 1). We call this marginally inconsistent with the models. For trends of length 13, 14, 15, and all lengths greater than 34 years, the observed trend is consistent with the collection of model trends (indicated by green in Figure 1), although it lies pretty far out in the low end of model projections in every case.   
  
For what it’s worth, this same IPCC report has verbal descriptors of their published probability figures. When they say something has a 90 percent probability, it is “very likely,” and a 95 percent probability is “extremely likely.” So, analogously, one could apply those same words to our 90 and 95 percent probabilities of model failure over certain lengths of time. But because English is our primary language, we’re stating that the models are “marginally inconsistent” and “clearly inconsistent” with reality in these periods.   
  
This hardly seems to fit the IPCC description that “[m]odels reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades” or is grounds for having “ _very high confidence_ ” that the “model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend.”   
  
And things aren’t going to get better anytime soon (if ever). In fact, they are about to get much worse.   
  
That’s because the longer global temperatures just sort of plod along without rising much (new research suggests that such a period may extend for another 20 years or so), the more established (and entrenched) the observed/model mismatch becomes.   
  
In Figure 1, above, our analysis ended with the last full year of available data, 2012. With three-quarters of 2013 already in the books, we can make a pretty good guess as to what the global average temperature anomaly is going to be at years’ end, and perform the same analysis we described above, but ending in the year 2013 instead of 2012. By the looks of things, 2013 is going to continue the string of years (going on 17 now) during which there has been virtually no change in the global average temperature and thus making the model performance even worse.   
  
Figure 2, below, gives the updated result.   






For data ending in the year 2013, the category of marginal inconsistency extends out to 37 years and is now flirting with lengths exceeding 50 years, and trends of lengths 11-28, 31, 33, and 34 (!) are clearly inconsistent with the climate model simulations.   
  
In other words, over the past third of a century—the period with the greatest amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions—the behavior of the real world (i.e., reality) falls far below the average expectation of climate models and, in fact, is clearly _inconsistent_ with the range of model results. Less than 2.5 percent of model runs show that global warming is really global _luke_ warming to the degree that real-world observations indicate.   
  
_Basically, the models don’t work._   
  
This reality ought to be enough to stop the anti-fossil fuel (via carbon dioxide emission restrictions) crusaders in their tracks.   
  
But thus far, it hasn’t, aided in part by the obfuscations of the United Nations (through the IPCC reports) and our own federal government (via reports such as the National Assessment of Climate Change).   
  
If the people currently in charge of these organizations can’t face reality, then it is high time to replace them with others who can.   
  
………………………………….   
  
* We should say, every run that was available through the Climate Explorer website. Climate Explorer had 108 individual model runs, while the IPCC states it has 113 (we have been unable to identify the other 5 runs). The difference should have minimal impacts on our analysis.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
According to The Conversation, there is no point journalists frightening people into obedience if they don’t also include clear instructions on what they should do to alleviate that fear.
Climate change or climate crisis? To really engage people, the media should talk about solutionsMay 30, 2019 10.33pm AESTDimitrinka Atanasova Lecturer in Linguistics, Lancaster UniversityKjersti Fløttum Professor of Linguistics, University of BergenDays after the British parliament declared a “climate emergency”, The Guardian announced that it would start using “stronger” language to discuss the environment. Its updated style guide states that “climate change” no longer accurately reflects the seriousness of the situation and journalists are advised to use “climate emergency”, “climate crisis” or “climate breakdown” instead.…But the “strong” language of “breakdown”, “crisis”, “emergency” and “war” may have unintended consequences.…Fear appeals might also have the opposite effect to what is intended, causing indifference, apathy and feelings of powerlessness. When people see a problem as too big, they might stop believing that anything can be done to solve it. If fear is to motivate people, then studies suggest that a solution must also be presented to focus minds on action.…Informing people about wars, crises and emergencies is an important part of the media’s role, but we may have reached “peak negativity”, where the news is so full of serious crises that people are increasingly avoiding it. They are left feeling disengaged, demotivated and depressed about the state of the world and their role in it.Constructive journalism should take a solution-focused approach that covers problems with the appropriate seriousness, but also answers the inevitable “what now?”, by describing how similar problems have been addressed elsewhere in the world. Awareness of climate change is high and growing, but the potential solutions need more attention.…Read more: https://theconversation.com/climate-change-or-climate-crisis-to-really-engage-people-the-media-should-talk-about-solutions-118004
Leaving aside the in my opinion repugnantly casual academic acceptance of climate fear campaigns as a political tool, the real reason none of this is working is that climate scientists and greens don’t have any solutions to their fake emergency.
Greens won the battle. For decades greens held the upper hand. In some countries they still hold the upper hand. They successfully convinced Western and even some Asian governments to squander billions, maybe even trillions of dollars on their useless “solutions”.
The result has been less than impressive. All we have to show for all that money and sacrifice is unaffordable electricity bills in the places which spent the most money on green energy, and soaring global reliance on cheap fossil fuel (see the graph at the top of the page).
People aren’t fools. On some level I suspect most people are aware renewable energy is an utter failure. 
Unless greens think of something new, presenting more of the same failed green “solutions” to their fake emergency is going to create the very despair they claim they want to avoid, the kind of despair which keeps green voters at home on election day.

" Op-ed contributed by Michelle Stirling © July 2019On June 23, 2019, Markham Hislop did another deep dive interview on the Tar Sands Campaign, trying to demonstrate it is all a tin-foil hat conspiracy theory dreamt up by researcher Vivian Krause (@FairQuestions) .  He interviewed Joanna Kerr, new CEO of Tides Canada, who replaced Ross McMillan, who stepped down at the end of Dec. 2018.Hislop asked Kerr if Tides Canada ever participated in the Tar Sands Campaign.  Kerr answered: “For the record, Tides Canada was never a member of the Tar Sands Campaign…”  and claims “In much of the rhetoric of Vivian Krause and her supporters, there is a conflation between Tides Canada and Tides Foundation in the US. We believe this is intentional.”That answer does not jibe with the evidence.Hislop asked if Tides Canada ever participated in the Tar Sands Campaign.  Kerr responds that Tides Canada was never a member of the campaign.Kerr says that people confuse/conflate Tides Foundation in the US and Tides Canada.  However, reading this 2013 Counterpunch story (by a left-wing anti-oil, anti-capitalist fellow) entitled “How Tides Canada Controls the Secret North American Tar Sands Coalition”, one certainly gets the impression the author is speaking about Tides Canada, and not Tides Foundation in the US.If Hislop was doing his job as a journalist, why didn’t he read this Vivian Krause article from the Financial Post of Oct. 14, 2010 to Joanna Kerr and ask her to pick out where Vivian has erred or conflated?Surely the staff at Tides Canada could help with that. But he never presses Kerr on the claims of conflation, and never presents any of the following evidence to challenge her statements.Tides Canada is not some little upstart. The Canada Revenue Agency lists Tides Canada Initiatives Society as being founded in 1990, with the Tides Canada Foundation established in 1999.Hislop never challenges Kerr’s charming claim that Tides Canada was simply “inspired” by Tides Foundation in the USA, when the organizations also shared the same board and executive team for years, including listing US Tides founder Drummond Pike and board member Joel Solomon, even up to 2010.As this excerpt from Tides Foundation 2010 US IRS-990 filing shows, Drummond Pike was also a board member of the US Tides Foundation as was Joel Solomon. Based upon CRA T-3010 and IRS-990s, the principals, Joel Solomon and Drummond Pike, have been the principal executives of both organizations and populated as executives on board of directors in what is known as inter-corporate linkage, a practice frowned upon in most business circles.Source: https://www.canadiancharitylaw.ca/blog/tides_us_2010_form_990_-_an_example_of_transparency_in_actionIf one reviews this version of the Tides_US_2010_Form_990 w highlights one finds numerous grants for the Tar Sands Campaign listed (highlighted in yellow, added).  It seems quite disingenuous to suggest that key people would be on one board in the US, administering Tar Sands Campaign funding and activities, but on another board for Tides Canada and could claim to be non-participants in what is going on. Indeed, Tides Canada is even listed as a charity with the IRS.FORGN: “A foreign-addressed organization. These are generally organizations formed in the United States that conduct activities in foreign countries. Certain foreign organizations that receive charitable contributions deductible pursuant to treaty are also included, as are organizations created in U.S. possessions.”https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/displayAll.do?dispatchMethod=displayAllInfo&Id=12056861&ein=980404212&country=CA&deductibility=all&dispatchMethod=searchAll&isDescending=false&city=&ein1=&postDateFrom=&exemptTypeCode=al&submitName=Search&sortColumn=orgName&totalResults=1&names=Tides+Canada&resultsPerPage=25&indexOfFirstRow=0&postDateTo=&state=All+StatesIn 2010, the Oak Foundation granted Tides Canada Foundation a paltry $50,000 grant, with the objective of creating a $30 million-dollar fund ‘similar to the Energy Foundation, ‘to be sourced from high net worth Canadian and international donors.’  The US “Energy Foundation” was a forerunner to ClimateWorks. Energy Foundation was a funding a distribution house where foundations with interests in promoting cap and trade, carbon pricing and renewables, could deposit funds into the umbrella organization (redeveloped as ClimateWorks) for non-duplicated distribution to ENGO proxies who would then beat the drum for local policy change while appearing to be a grassroots movement. This is described in ClimateWorks “Design to Win” strategic plan, found online.  Interestingly, ClimateWorks global cap and trade plan includes an Energy Foundation that they set up in China…but I digress.Going back to Kerr’s claim that Tides Canada was never a member of the Tar Sands Campaign….or rather Hislop’s question if Tides Canada had ever participated in it, how would Kerr explain Tides Canada funding of author Andrew Nikiforuk – Mr. Anti-Tar Sands himself, or DeSmogBlog, or Tides Canada’s involvement in ForestEthics’ Blockadia of Northern Gateway? The following screenshots are from NEB filings on-line,( NEB File No.: OF‐Fac‐Oil‐N304‐2010‐01 01) a written request for information from Enbridge to ForestEthics, wherein ForestEthics is described as a Tides Canada Initiative, and Enbridge is seeking confirmation of ForestEthics role in the Tar Sands Campaign and funding.Source: ForestEthics Advocacy Response to Northern Gateway Information …https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/828724Now in some cases, it would be unfair to expect a new CEO to know any of this history off the top of their head.But Joanna Kerr is someone special. Kerr was the Executive Director of Greenpeace Canada for the past five years. Since 2007, when Greenpeace was funded by the Oak Foundation, it’s been clear what side of the fence they are on.“To initiate three distinct but interrelated efforts concerning tar sands in Alberta to enhance the ability of Greenpeace Canada to more effectively launch and deliver its ‘Phase Out Tar Sands Campaign’; secondly to leverage the growing interest of ranchers and landowners in limiting unbridled oil and gas exploration and production in southern Alberta; and thirdly to conduct specialised opinion research and media work to identify messaging for these and other efforts that will generate maximum information value among Albertans.”And to further connect the dots, Greenpeace contracted Andrew Nikiforuk in 2009 to write a report for them entitled: “Dirty Oil: How the Tar Sands are Fueling the Global Climate Crisis.”  That same year, through the auspices of Tides Canada fundee “RAVEN” (Respecting Aboriginal Values and Environmental Needs), Nikiforuk went on a cross-Canada tour of anti-oil sands speaking events.Source: https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/alberta-tar-sands-a-major-climate-and-economic-threat-greenpeace-report-538570241.html RAVEN has been funded by Tides Canada. Greenpeace featured the tar sands on the cover of their 2009 annual report.In 2011, numerous tar sands campaign fundees appeared in the CBC co-produced documentary “The Tipping Point: Age of the Oil Sands.” Indeed, the research papers contributed to PNAS by Schindler, coauthored with Kelly, that sparked the documentary were funded in part by Tides Foundation (US).https://www.pnas.org/content/106/52/22346 https://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16178However, some of the impact on changing a favorable investment climate for the oil sands to a negative one was done by the Toronto Star in this Tides Canada funded series.Source: https://tidescanada.org/climate-and-energy/tides-canada-partners-with-the-toronto-star-for-climate-and-economy-series/Since investment markets are run by human beings, they are subject to psychological tactics that work on people, too – like ostracization.In this article, “Dropping Oil and Investing in Green”, oil sands investment is made to sound like a failure.So much for ‘independent journalism.’ Of course, in the TO Star-Tides Canada funded article “Dropping Oil and Investing in Green,” there’s no mention of the global anti-oil sands Tar Sands Campaign, driven by >100 groups and Corporate Ethics strategy.Source: https://corpethics.org/about/ No mention that the UN Principles for Responsible Investment 2014 “Montreal Pledge,” encouraging its institutional investors (with some ~$100 trillion in Assets Under Management) to be activists with governments and corporations, to divest from fossil fuels, especially oil sands (on claim of being a ‘carbon risk’). No mention of UNPRI’s conflict of interest with ESG guru Al Gore as a public cheerleader against the oil sands and pipelines. No mention that World Resources Institute, a collaborator with Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management, also set three-quarters of the unattainable Paris Agreement targets. No mention of a decade of persistent Greenpeace attacks on investors, banks and governments, often operating behind the scenes with nasty attempts to intimidate corporate executives as ‘climate criminals.’https://www.ciel.org/news/executives-facing-climate-denial-related-claims-could-be-personally-liable-ngos/ Seems likely that Joanna Kerr, now of Tides Canada, was likely party to some of these efforts while Executive Director at Greenpeace.That drive-off from oil sands investing was made almost complete by the Rockefellers’ CDP Worldwide report of Nov. 2016, wherein all oil sands invested companies were rated at the bottom of the CDP’s subjective ‘preparing for the future’ scale. This CDP report resulted in many institutional investors and banks abandoning the oil sands, likely on threat by financial heavies that it presented a mythical ‘carbon risk.’ Robert Lyman’s present-day comparative analysis of oil sands emissions intensity, rebutting Keith Stewart of Greenpeace, shows these claims are distorted.Hislop writes:“At the very least, Kerr’s interview and the information provided by her organization demonstrate that a significant portion of Krause’s research is inaccurate, and her allegations are seriously flawed.”  I contend that since the information I present, which I found online with little effort, shows that Kerr and her staff don’t know their own history, which is out there in the public domain, or are reluctant to discuss these facts.  Hislop seem reluctant to press them, or do the little research I have done.This also raises the question, if Tides Canada wants to appear squeaky clean on the Tar Sands Campaign allegations, why would they hire someone like Kerr as CEO. She comes from Greenpeace, which has dedicated itself to destroying the Alberta oil sands, and it has largely succeeded in the objectives it described for this Oak Foundation grant of $424,373 provided in 2010 as described below.Certainly, this should have been the first question Hislop asked of Kerr.“To create awareness of the financial, regulatory and political uncertainty that surrounds investments in the tar sands so that prominent financial analysts, media, opinion leaders and Members of Parliament will publically express concern about the lack of government regulation of the tar sands industry. Greenpeace Canada aims to publicise the controversy around the tar sands both within and outside Canada. This will encourage the withdrawal of major institutional investors from the tar sands by 2012; the end of France’s tar sands subsidies; and the passage of a feed-in-tariff in Alberta utilised by farmers, ranchers, landowners and investors to develop the province’s huge wind power potential.”Interestingly, on Dec. 5, 2016, the Financial Post published a blistering commentary by Markham Hislop wherein he takes the Liberals to task for playing along with environmental groups in their denigration of the National Energy Board.  Hislop wrote:I would bet that not one Canadian in a hundred has an informed opinion of what the NEB does and how well it does that job — including many people who work in the oil and gas industry.The eco-activist strategy was to break the pipeline review process and demand a replacement. It worked.People formed their impressions of the NEB from news coverage of the Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain Expansion protests over the past five or six years.Eco-activists have systematically demonized the regulator, claiming the NEB is broken, in the pocket of industry, doesn’t include climate change in its assessment, etc.Hislop is referring to the ‘modernization’ of the NEB, which ended up with the ‘no more pipelines’ legislation Bill C-69. Hislop wraps up that article with these comments:[Minister] Carr has said it’s his government’s responsibility “to move our natural resources to market sustainably.”If so, why roll the dice and open up the Canadian environmental review process based not upon data or science but the political talking points of groups that for the most part oppose natural resources exports?Why risk having those very same groups try to hijack the NEB “modernization” the same way they did the Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain assessments?The Liberals are playing a very dangerous game. Given that the Canadian economy is still driven by natural resource extraction, let’s hope they play to win.Based on this, it is hard to understand Hislop’s present defence of Tides Canada when there is so much evidence of Tides Canada participation and funding of Tar Sands Campaign actors like Andrew Nikiforuk, RAVEN, and others. Even harder to understand when there is so much more evidence of Greenpeace Canada’s Tar Sands Campaign activity. With Greenpeace Canada being the environmental alma mater of Kerr, the new Tides Canada CEO, why wouldn’t Hislop ask some fair questions about that?  Hislop has made persistent efforts to delegitimize Vivian Krause as a conspiracy theorist when Krause references well-documented material (drawn from reliable public records and accounts like IRS and CRA filings).So, in my opinion, it is a fair question to ask why Markham Hislop is playing softball with Joanna Kerr of Tides Canada on the Tar Sands Campaign against Canada.  And in light of the economic and employment damage to Canada done by that largely foreign-funded campaign, everyone should be asking – “How is this charitable activity?”Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists, AAAS, and APS.~~~~Disclaimer: This is an opinion editorial independently researched by the author with no direction, funding or representation by or from any industry or party.  There was no communication with Vivian Krause about this article and the author and Friends of Science Society have no affiliation with Ms. Krause or any other body.  Tar Sands Campaign fundees use ‘climate crisis’ as the rationale for shutting down the oil sands – but this appears to be a manufactured crisis – as we discuss in this report.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Share this...FacebookTwitterA 12% drop in German electricity consumption is the difference between economic pain and prosperity. 
If you want to see a good example of how vital electricity and energy are to an economy, look no further than Germany. Since the country has imposed strict restrictions on people gathering, large parts of industry have been harshly impacted. The existence of millions of German people is now threatened.
Non-essential retailers, events and venues have been ordered closed. The halted demand has led to a braking of the economy. With the country already teetering on recession, economists agree that the new restrictions will now drive the country deep into recession territory. This will also be the case with many countries around the world as they scramble to contain the COVID-19 virus spread.
Not surprisingly, the economic drop has been reflected by Germany’s  electricity consumption since March 1:

German electricity consumption drops in the wake of economic restrictions. Source: Agora.
12% drop in electricity consumption
The data show that under normal conditions, peak German electricity consumption hovers near 72 GW on a given workday But since the German government announced the tough restrictions last Sunday, peak power consumption has fallen some 12%, to 64 GW.
While environmentalists like preach the need to save on energy, it just goes to show that a 10% drop is enough to break an economy and cause mass hardship for millions of people. Without reliable, affordable energy, a healthy economy and high standard of living is simply not possible. Activists pushing for a “green economy” should look seriously at the implications of what they are calling for.
In order for a country to become prosperous, it needs to consume energy in order to work and produce more goods and services. The last thing it should do is consume less. Less energy means less work, which means lower living standards. A green, unstable energy economy will not deliver prosperity, but rather will only bring hardship and pain.

"HOUSTON  —   Follow our live N. F. L. playoffs coverage here. Brock Osweiler redeemed himself after last month’s benching. Jadeveon Clowney established himself as a postseason force. And the Houston Texans got their first playoff victory since the 2012 season, beating the Oakland Raiders,   on Saturday. Osweiler threw for a touchdown and ran for another to lead the Texans to the win, in the   round. Clowney, erasing doubts that he deserved to be the top pick in the 2014 draft, got his first career interception, on the Raiders’ second drive. Osweiler, who got his job back last week after Tom Savage sustained a concussion, finished with only 168 passing yards but played his best game of the season. “It just goes back to having confidence in my teammates,” said Osweiler, who had never played in a playoff game, having been benched by the Denver Broncos last postseason in favor of Peyton Manning. “Believing in what you see, and just rip it. Cut it loose, and don’t have any hesitation. ” Houston ( ) and its   defense, led by Clowney and Whitney Mercilus, advanced to face either the Kansas City Chiefs or the New England Patriots in the divisional round. Clowney was roundly criticized in his first two   seasons before his star turn this season as he helped make up for the loss of J. J. Watt, who was placed on injured reserve in September. “Things didn’t go well earlier in my career, but I’m on the right track now,” Clowney said. The Raiders were making their first trip to the playoffs since the 2002 season, when they went to the Super Bowl, but it ended with a thud behind the struggles of their   quarterback, the rookie Connor Cook. He threw for 161 yards, with one touchdown and three interceptions. “It was his first start, on the road, in a playoff game, against the No.   defense,” Raiders Coach Jack Del Rio said. “It was a tough draw for him. We had hopes that we would be able to do enough around him so he wouldn’t have to do as much. ” Cook became the first quarterback in N. F. L. history to make his first start in a playoff game. The usual starter, Derek Carr, a contender for the Most Valuable Player Award, broke his leg two weeks ago, and Matt McGloin injured his shoulder last weekend. The Raiders were also missing their star left tackle, Donald Penn, whose streak of 160 straight starts ended because of a knee injury. The Raiders ( ) got touchdowns from Latavius Murray and Andre Holmes, but cornerback David Amerson said things would have been different if the team had fewer injuries. “I’ve got all the faith in Connor or Matt  —   any backups we’ve got,” he said. “But they know, at full strength, ain’t nobody in the league touching us, man. We’re going to take this loss on the chin, and we’re going to come back, for sure. ” Houston led by 13 at halftime after touchdowns by DeAndre Hopkins and Lamar Miller, who scored a play after Clowney’s interception. Houston increased its lead to   on a   run by Osweiler early in the fourth quarter."
"**A woman who relies on liquid food after having most of her intestines removed was left without supplies for 10 days after a safety alert.**
Jenny Evans, 31, from Grosmont near Abergavenny, is fed intravenously with a liquid that is tailored exactly to her needs.
She hooks up to it four nights a week, and while she sleeps it infuses into her blood over the course of 12 hours.
But she feared she would end up in hospital after the supply was delayed.
Supplier Calea UK said it was working to ""restore a reliable supply as soon as possible"".
Jenny only has 20cm of her small bowel left after her intestines twisted and they needed to be removed.
She had surgery in 2010 and what is left is not enough for her body to absorb the nutrients she needs from food.
Instead, she relies on a liquid, known as home parenteral nutrition (HPN), or total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which goes straight into her blood supply.
She is one of about 130 patients in Wales who can live at home and administer parenteral nutrition themselves or with the help of a nurse.
But in summer, the supply was drastically reduced, and Jenny first knew about it when her bags did not turn up on the usual delivery van in July.
""I went 10 days without a TPN delivery,"" she told BBC Eye on Wales.
""I was very tired, I was losing weight rapidly, and my hair began to fall out.
""It was really nerve wrecking thinking I'm going to end up in hospital because of malnutrition.
""It was the busiest time for my business and I couldn't afford for that to happen.""
Parenteral nutrition bags for home patients in Wales are supplied by Calea UK.
The bags are bespoke, and based on the patient's blood results, containing proteins, sugars, fats as well as electrolytes, vitamins and essential minerals.
In June, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) conducted a routine inspection of the Calea UK production plant in Runcorn, Cheshire.
As a result of the inspection, the MHRA requested that Calea UK make immediate changes to their production process to ensure the safety of the product.
In order to do so, Calea UK had to reduce its output.
Overnight, its capacity to supply HPN patients in Wales dropped by 40%, leaving the pan-Wales parenteral nutrition service, which is run by Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, in a state of shock.
""If you can imagine someone phoning you up saying you can't have any food or drink and we can't get you any for the next week or so, that's the analogy,"" said Dr Rhys Hewitt, who heads up the team.
""My patients are more or less dependent on this intravenous feed and if they don't get it, then worst case scenario, people could be very unwell and have to be admitted to hospital within a few days.""
The team risk assessed every patient in their care and then went through a process of prioritising who would continue to get the bespoke compounded bags and who would be given ""off the shelf"" bags, which don't contain all the nutrients that a patient needs and should only be used temporarily.
Meanwhile, desperate patients tried to get through to Calea UK to find out what was happening and when their usual deliveries would resume.
""The low point was when I spoke to Calea every day requesting to speak to a manager to find out what was going on,"" said Jenny.
""It was like they were speaking off a script.
""It took 10 days for me to get a manager's call and me threatening them with legal action before someone called me back.""
Calea UK said that patients have telephone access to a ""team of dedicated patient care co-ordinators in addition to an out-of-hours advice line, which is supported by Calea nurses"".
""We understand that the continued disruption is frustrating and this telephone service provides patients with the most accurate information available at the time,"" it added.
According to the latest figure from the parenteral nutrition service in Wales, 75 patients are now back on Calea UK's supply list.
But 48 patients still don't have a compounding place.
In north Wales, five people are under the care of Wrexham hospital and are back on their compounded bags.
Some patients are being cared for over the border at Salford Hospital.
Calea said it is working with the MHRA and NHS Action Group to ""restore a reliable supply as soon as possible"".
But it said that ""it is unlikely that our production capacity will have reached the required volume before the end of the year"".
Jenny is back on her compounded bags but she is aware that at any point she may be switched back over to 'off the shelf' bags.
""People need to realise how important this TPN is,"" she said.
""It's not just a case of giving someone a paracetamol when they have a headache. This keeps me alive.""

Claims of consensus are detrimental to open public debate.“Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.” ― Robert B. Cialdini, Influence: The Psychology of PersuasionAs you know, President Trump is developing a presidential review on climate change and many scientists and policy experts have recently publicly made it known to him that they hold strongly dissenting views on climate change from the alleged mainstream ‘consensus’.[1]  Though one can say there is agreement that climate change is real, as is evident over the ~4.5 billion years of earth’s existence, and clearly humans have some greater and lesser impacts on the earth, it is inaccurate to extrapolate these fundamental concepts into a claim that almost all scientists share a groupthink view of causes of climate change. We demonstrate the flaws in the claimed 97% consensus papers in this study.[2]We believe that the underlying reason for mass public alarm over climate change is due to the ClimateWorks billionaires and other commercial/investment interests in carbon trading, spending hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade, to fund environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) world-wide to push climate change hysteria in order to drive their global cap and trade plans and vested interests in renewables. The wind/solar renewables business case relies on the claim that fossil fuel use and power generation carbon dioxide emissions will cause global warming.[3]  NASA’s credibility is exploited by promoting a non-existent ‘97% consensus’ that misrepresents what scientists do agree upon.NASA holds a special place in the hearts of millions of people around the world. It was through the brilliant concepts and precision work of thousands of NASA employees and sub-contractors that so many exceptional space missions were successfully completed.  Indeed, all of these were only possible to bring into fruition using the energy from hydrocarbons and the many useful by-products.In the process of NASA’s space exploration, many long-held beliefs about earth, the moon, sun, and other extraterrestrial bodies were enlightened through discovery – only possible because scientists were willing to venture beyond initial perceptions and understandings.We believe this is the case with climate change science. Much excellent work has been done by thousands of scientists and this has enhanced our understanding of the climate. This work should have expanded our ability to discuss new findings. Instead, vested interests have made efforts to limit the public debate to name-calling of ‘denier’ to anyone with dissenting views or evidence, while demanding compliance to a ‘party line’ regarding human influence.The claim of ‘consensus’ is a powerful social proof – a psychological tactic that has been employed to shut down public debate and cost-benefit policy analysis.  NASA’s role in posting only the ‘97%’ consensus papers, without also posting dissenting papers or evidence, means that millions of people have been misled and meaningful questions on climate change or policy have been silenced.We request that you update the NASA Climate Change website to include the fact that there is no singular consensus on human influence on climate change.  If your site posts ‘consensus’ studies, it would be in keeping with the integrity of the scientific method, as outlined by Richard Feynman, to also post rebuttal studies to avoid supporting Cargo Cult Science.“It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty—a kind of leaning over backwards.  For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid—not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked—to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated….Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them.  You must do the best you can—if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to explain it. …In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.”[4]We look forward to seeing such updates on the NASA Climate Change website.Sincerely,Michelle StirlingCommunications ManagerCc:President Donald TrumpVice President Mike PenceDr. William Happer[1] https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/joint-letter-to-president-trump-in-support-of-proposed-presidents-commission-on-climate-security[2] https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf[3] ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeaks https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165Nisbet  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.524 Summary: https://web.northeastern.edu/matthewnisbet/2018/05/21/summary-of-strategic-philanthropy-in-the-post-cap-and-trade-years-reviewing-u-s-foundation-climate-and-energy-funding-at-wires-climate-change/[4] http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htmShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

If you listened to only the MSM and social media you’d think that 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg was Jesus Christ come down from heaven to save the world.



You may think I’m exaggerating for comedic effect, but sadly I’m not. Go on Twitter and search her name and you’ll see what I mean.



Fortunately, people are starting to see the truth and one is none other than Jeremy Corbyn’s brother, Piers Corbyn. quote.



Quote:Jeremy Corbyn’s brother today branded environmental activist Greta Thunberg an ‘ignorant brainwashed child’ who is being ‘abused by manipulative adults’. End of quote.



Piers Corbyn, 72, a “climate change denier” who runs forecasting firm WeatherAction, said the 16-year-old who is visiting Britain from her native Sweden is ‘wrong’.



Note the age gap. Intelligence you’re born with. Wisdom is earned with age. quote.



Quote:Reposting a BBC News article titled ‘Teen tells UK politicians ‘listen to climate scientists’, he tweeted: ‘Listening to an ignorant brainwashed child is deranged.End of quote.



The crazy part isn’t that the AGW movement is exploiting a young girl, it’s that politicians are listening to a teen. Virtue signalling Wombles is all I can say. quote.



Quote:‘I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong and suffers mental abuse by manipulative adults.’ 



[…]Piers runs WeatherAction, which has been questioned for its unusual methods of forecasting patterns, but he is adamant that man-made climate change is a hoax. End of quote.



I’d call it a fraud. quote.



Quote:Yesterday, Labour leader Jeremy, 69, met with Greta, who is visiting the UK to express her support for the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests in London.  
  
[…]The Swedish Nobel Peace Prize nominee has sparked a wave of youth climate protests around the world and yesterday met political leaders in the Commons.



[…]Greta also met Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Caroline Lucas from the Green Party and the Westminster leaders of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts.



[…]Speaking at an event in the Palace of Westminster, Miss Thunberg later said her future and those of her fellow children had been ‘sold’.



[…]Environment Secretary Michael Gove told Greta she had been heard and admitted ‘we have not done nearly enough’.  
  
He said: ‘Suddenly in the past few years it has become inescapable that we have to act. The time to act is now, the challenge could not be clearer, Greta you have been heard.’



Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott tweeted that Greta gave a ‘great speech’ and was ‘showing adults the way forward’. 



She added that the activist’s climate change message is ‘so powerful and important for all our futures, and especially for the youngest generations.’ End of quote.



  
The article then nose-dives into a short biography and history of climate crusader (their words) Greta Thunberg herself. Interestingly though, her mother has written a book about climate change – although I’m sure it was a coincidence it was launched on the same day as a school strike organised by her daughter. 



Piers Corbyn is right. This is exploitation and manipulation bordering on child abuse. Politics is a brutal, dishonest, and deceptive game where the most despicable rise to the top. The topic of man-made climate change is all about politics. Children should not be a part of it. The AGW movement should be ashamed of themselves.

Share this...FacebookTwitterExperts: polar bears and winter snow on the increase
The online Japanese Independent Web Journal (IWJ) reports on a leading figure in polar bear research, Dr. Susan Crockford, who says “polar bears will not become extinct due to climate change” and that “in fact, polar bears have increased rather than become extinct!”
Crockford’s findings contradict claims by environmental activists groups such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
For example the WWF Japan reported in 2009 (hat-tip Kirye) that the estimated population was 26,000 and that the polar bears escaped extinction due to intervention by international conservation activities, but then added: “it is believed that the population is decreasing due to the effects of global warming and the deterioration of the Arctic environment.”
Today, 10 years later, however, Crockford says the numbers “could easily exceed 40,000, up from a low point of 10,000 or fewer in the 1960s.” Clearly the WWF Japan’s 2009 claim that the “population is decreasing” was false.
440 papers from 2019 challenge climate “consensus”

The IWJ article, authored by Japanese blogger Kirye, also reports: “Over 440 scientific papers questioned the main causes of climate change CO2 in 2019 alone” and that “the theory of global warming caused by CO2 is still a hypothesis” and so in reality does not have the broad consensus among scientists that is often claimed in the media and by some vocal scientists.
Winter snow cover at highest levels since measurements began
The IWJ article also notes that snow has hardly become a thing of the past as reports of heavy wintertime snowfalls keep making the headlines. In fact northern hemisphere snow cover for fall shows high levels over the past decade and a rising trend:

Why is every proposal to develop an outback mine, dam, irrigation scheme or a real power station now labelled “controversial” by the ABC and opposed by the ALP/Greens?This coastal-city focus and the hostility to new outback industry (except for wind/solar toys) has surely reached its zenith with the recent state budget for Queensland.The population of coastal and metropolitan Queensland is surging with baby-boom retirees, welfare recipients, grey nomads, tourists, overseas students, migrants and winter refugees. But the outback is dying with lagging industry and many aging farmers retiring to the coast. We are creating a country with no heart.The growing urban and seaside population needs power, water and food.However two critical power-water-food infrastructure projects that have been on the drawing boards for decades did not even rate a mention in the state budget – an expansion of coal-fired power at Kogan Creek and a water supply dam at Nathan Gorge.The current policy of all major parties is cluttering the countryside with piddling subsidised intermittent power producers like solar panels and wind turbines plus their expensive network of roads and transmission lines. This is inflating electricity prices, and future generations will see this bi-partisan energy policy as a disastrous blunder. It is also a mistake to encourage or subsidise private electricity cartels and put politicians, not engineers, in charge of power generation.The Kogan Creek power station with its adjacent coal mine was opened in 2007. It is connected to the National Grid and integrated with local gas-fired and solar supplies. It was always planned to add another generating unit at Kogan Creek, but twelve long years have passed with no action.Kogan Creek is crucial to maintaining a stable power supply to eastern Australia. This was demonstrated recently when a fault temporarily shut down Kogan Creek. The National Grid was barely maintained for about 30 minutes by the battery in SA until other base load generators could be started. With the likely 7 month closure of one damaged generating unit at Loy Yang power station, East Australian electricity supplies are now even more precarious.Moreover, with the complete failure of the $105M Kogan solar booster and delays to other solar plants in this area which were to be connected to the grid, the duplication of Kogan Creek is urgently needed.(Here is a telling quote from one of the backers of the failed Kogan solar project:“Solar works extremely well when the sun’s out.”)Coal produces reliable low-cost electricity from a concentrated area with less real environmental damage than gas, wind or solar. These low density energy sources need much more land to collect equivalent continuous energy from a wide area of bores, pipelines, turbines and solar collectors plus their backup generators, connecting roads and transmission lines. Most CSG wells also need to pump salt water from each bore before the gas will flow. Even if costly processes are used to extract fresh water from this salt water, brines are left behind and must be stored safely. This evil-genie of salt should be left in its underground lair and disturbed as little as possible.It is becoming clear that that CO2 does NOT drive global warming. Even if it did, when careful life-of-project studies are done for all of Qld energy sources, coal and hydro look likely to have the lowest carbon footprint with the least environmental harm (and they do not slice, dice or fry birds and bats).The surface disruption from an open cut coal mine is 100% and it shocks the senses. However, it recovers 100% of concentrated energy from a small area of land – far less than is permanently sterilised by roads and schools, and there is no intention of restoring them. Even if the open cut was abandoned at the end of mine life, slow but relentless natural healing would immediately start. However, instead of treating the final void as an expensive liability to be refilled with overburden, it should be seen as an asset to be contoured as a pleasant lake or used for burial of the growing mountains of urban waste.The need for reliable economical electricity is urgent. However, if Kogan Coal Power is too-close-for-comfort for Jacki Trad, her Environment Minister and the greens of South Brisbane, the next real power station option is Collinsville.The need to conserve more water is also urgent. Nathan Gorge has been known as an ideal dam site for 50 years, but still nothing is done. The site and catchment make it likely to be a high-yielding, cost-efficient dam. It is vital to the continuing development of the Surat and southern Bowen Basins and its water could be used for irrigation, power generation or fed into the Condamine/Darling River in droughts.Kogan and Nathan are decentralising projects that could provide community insurance for blackouts, floods and droughts.It is the outback that produces most of Australia’s food, minerals, energy, water, exports and jobs. And it produces serious income for state governments addicted to ever-rising taxes and royalties.Anti-development policies, land-use sterilisation, climate alarmism and green law-fare are destroying the future for our kids and grandkids. Current policies will stack-and-pack the coasts and major cities leaving a depopulated outback to uncontrolled floods and droughts, lantana and woody-weeds, wild cats and dogs, wild fires, feral pigs and the occasional park ranger or tourist bus.(895 words)Viv ForbesWashpool   Qld       4306        AustraliaPhone 0409 2777 94forbes@saltbushclub.comSome reading:How they wasted millions on solar energy at Kogan:https://www.smh.com.au/business/fastmoving-clouds-how-cs-energys-kogan-creek-solar-boost-project-failed-20170516-gw5p2u.htmlSeven month outage at Loy Yang:https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/agl-energy-flags-seven-month-outage-at-victoria-s-loy-yang-power-plant-20190607-p51vq0.htmlViv Forbes is not a member of any political party, and has no vested interests in mining, energy or bio-fuels, except as a consumer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a recent interview with the online Berliner Zeitung (BZ) here, economist Björn Lomborg said that 16-year old Greta Thunberg’s demands “will put people in danger”.
Greta, the Swedish teenage activist is calling for radical cuts in CO2 emissions – on a scale that would have profound impacts on the world’s market system. Moreover, Lomborg calls the demands immoral. Lomborg says it would be far wiser to invest money in bringing the world’s poor out of grinding poverty rather than to try to mitigate climate change.
Fear based on 30 years of lies and exaggerations
“Rich countries that tell poor countries not to use fossil energy for the benefit of the environment are acting immorally,” Lomborg told the BZ.
Lomborg also sharply criticized Thunberg, telling BILD news daily: “Greta Thunberg fears the end of the world due to climate change. This fear is the result of three decades of alarmist rhetoric based on exaggerations and lies.”
€43 billion for 0.00001°C of temperature reduction yearly
Lomborg also called Germany’s “Energiewende” – transition to green energies – “the best example of a failed climate policy” which has proven to be “incredibly costly and ineffective.”
“Global warming will be reduced by 0.001 degrees at most by 2100 for 43 billion euros a year,” he told the BZ. Lomborg blames the adults for panicking Ms Thunberg and using her “to push through an agenda that costs trillions but brings almost no benefits.”
Rather, for the trillions we will likely get us far graver problems. What a deal.

President Obama will speak Tuesday, as world leaders assemble at the United Nations in New York for “Climate Summit 2014,” “to galvanize and catalyze climate action.” Environmentalists have taken note, organizing “the largest climate march in history,” to pressure governments to regulate “a world safe from the ravages of climate change.”



The message is clear: Pernicious global warming is upon us, and the government must act.



Bolstering this barrage of alarmism is last week’s finding from the federal government’s National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that the global average surface temperature for August 2014 was the highest ever recorded for the month.



But the anomalous warmth in August still fell short of the all‐​time record for all months. That record was set nearly _200 months ago_ in February 1998. And that’s the real news. In this era of human‐​caused global warming, what is taking so long to set a new global temperature record?



Global warming is not proceeding as planned. The climate appears less sensitive to our emissions of greenhouse gases than expected. The urgency to grant the government the authority to limit energy choice is not justified.



During the 1980s and 1990s, new all‐​time record‐​high anomalies were occurring about every 3–4 years. But then, we hit the “hiatus.” The rise in the Earth’s average surface temperature basically stopped, “global warming” morphed into “climate change,” and it has been 16.5 years since the last all‐​time all‐​month record monthly temperature anomaly was set.



Just‐​published research from University of Guelph’s Ross McKitrick pegs the length of the hiatus, or “pause”—the period of no statistically significant rise in the earth’s average temperature—at about 19 years. Looking back even further, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that since the mid‐​20th century, observed global warming has been less than expected.





In short, all those computerized climate models that predicted large, accelerating, and generally uninterrupted warming were wrong.



In short, all those computerized climate models that predicted large, accelerating, and generally uninterrupted warming were wrong. And it has the believers in those models scratching their heads.



Global warming is not proceeding as planned. The climate appears less sensitive to our emissions of greenhouse gases than expected. The urgency to grant the government the authority to limit energy choice is not justified.



That’s the real news.



Nevertheless, the scaremongers doggedly claim the world is still on course for a climate catastrophe of our own making. They point to the record high temperatures in August as proof that global warming remains a viable beast that will eventually strike us. Natural variability, they say, has just been holding the savage back. And its grip is slipping.



Climate models, apologists say, can’t possibly be expected to get the precise timing of all natural hiccups correct. Therefore, we shouldn’t get distracted by poor model performance over the short term (a decade or two) but rather rest assured that what the models predict over the long‐​term will be correct.



For this argument to work, natural variability, and not inadequacies in the climate models themselves, must be shown to be completely responsible for the two‐​decade hiatus. Otherwise, the jig is up and it will be plainly obvious that climate models are unreliable. And in that case, the foundations for climate alarm, for a carbon tax, and for the president’s Climate Action Plan crumble.



About five or six years ago, climate modelers and their supporters found it easier to claim the hiatus didn’t exist than to try to explain it. As more and more time passed and earth’s surface temperature failed to rise, the hiatus grew too noticeable to be swept under the rug. A chorus was rising that the length of the hiatus exceeded that foretold by climate models.



To combat this growing din of model criticism, a fabulous storyline has been cobbled together from bits and pieces of the dozens of speculative explanations that have been forwarded as a cause for the pause. Climate catastrophists have gone from hiatus deniers to hiatus embracers, even going as far as to perversely claim that the hiatus actually strengthens the case for dangerous global warming.



It doesn’t. 



At the very least, the lack of global temperature rise during the past two decades shows that climate models do not have a good handle on natural processes and the magnitude of their impact on the climate. More probably, it indicates that climate models predict too much warming from greenhouse gas emissions. Most likely, it is both.



A couple of recent warm months do not make up for a failed legacy that extends more than a half century.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The declassified version of the intelligence report on Russian hacking ordered by President Obama found that Russia’s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, “ordered an influence campaign” to sway the 2016 election. He turned from seeking to “denigrate” Hillary Clinton to developing “a clear preference” for Donald J. Trump, the report states. Mr. Trump was briefed on the report’s contents by the nation’s top intelligence and law enforcement officials. Afterward, the   acknowledged the possibility that Russia had hacked a variety of targets, but asserted that the hacking had not affected the outcome of the election. _____ 2. At least five people were killed and eight wounded in a shooting at Fort   International Airport in Florida. The gunman targeted people in the baggage claim area of a terminal used by Delta and Air Canada, and was quickly taken into custody. Senator Bill Nelson identified him as Esteban Santiago and said he was carrying a military identification. _____ 3.   Trump acknowledged that Mexico will not be paying for a wall at the border, at least now. Mr. Trump said the wall could be built faster with U. S. taxpayer money  —   but he still insisted that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States, probably through a renegotiated trade agreement. _____ 4. The last jobs report of the Obama administration showed tepid job growth but also a    rise in wages. Our economics reporter says that for all of Mr. Trump’s attacks on President Obama’s economic policies, he will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid, with consumer sentiment, corporate profits and the stock markets up. _____ 5. Much of the southeastern U. S. is bracing for harsh winter storms. Many schools and government offices in Arkansas and Oklahoma were closed on Friday. A state of emergency was declared in Alabama, North Carolina and northern Georgia, including Atlanta, above. _____ 6. Russia ordered its aircraft carrier to return home from the Syrian coast, part of a general drawdown of its forces involved in the conflict. The    carrier was sent on its first combat mission last fall to mount airstrikes in support of forces loyal to President Bashar  . _____ 7. A second prison riot in a week in Brazil left at least 33 inmates dead. Local news agencies reported a gruesome scene, including decapitations, days after 56 people were killed in another riot. Officials say the violence is linked to an intensifying war among drug gangs for control of Brazil’s cocaine trade. _____ 8. Here in the U. S. opioids  —   both heroin and prescription painkillers  —   have killed more than 33, 000 people since 2015. Public health officials say it is the worst drug crisis in American history. We sent a team of reporters around the country to examine how communities are searching for solutions. We also asked readers how opioid abuse has affected them. One man wrote in from Tucson, Ariz. about his son, who became addicted to OxyContin and then heroin. “Every time he lied to me about getting clean, I would believe him and try to help him out,” he wrote. “Now I just hope his bottom is not his death. ” _____ 9. Would Hillary Clinton run for mayor of New York? While the answer is almost certainly no, that’s not stopping political buffs  —   on the right and the left  —   from discussing the question. The Clintons live in the suburbs north of the city, but Mrs. Clinton would need only to move inside the city limits by Election Day to qualify for the job (which, again, there are no signs she wants). _____ 10.

"**As Russia enters its 20th year under the authoritarian leadership of Vladimir Putin, St Petersburg's vegan anarchist community thrives. Hated by the far right and out of tune with Russia's prevailing nationalist mood, the activists have created a version of what their ideal society would look like - and they're promoting this vision with delicious food. Could they be changing attitudes among other young Russians?**
Once a month, the eight people who work at the Horizontal takeaway hold a meeting in which they air any grievances, discuss updates to the menu, and vote on any changes they may want to make. The front of their restaurant, a hole-in-the-wall that serves vegan burgers, hot dogs and nuggets to go, is covered with stickers promoting anti-fascism, anarchism, and other vegan outlets in the city. Their meal deal offer, something commonly called a ""business lunch"" in Russia, is called ""the anti-business lunch"".
Lately, the group has been discussing whether or not to change location - the complex they're currently based in holds shows featuring captive animals, which they believe are cruel and exploitative.
Although some of them have been working there for longer than others, all eight members of the team have an equal say within the business. There are no managers and no hierarchies. Varya, 26, has been at the restaurant the longest.
""That's why we're called Horizontal - because every person who joins our restaurant is on the same level, and has the same rights and an equal position with all of the others,"" she says. The restaurant adheres to the principles of anti-racism, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, the abolition of borders, and animal liberation. In a country where people who are gender non-confirming or trans are shunned, and even sometimes attacked, Horizontal is a space where anyone's preferred pronouns will be respected.
The group is planning to compose a manifesto of sorts stating what its values are, to make sure any new starters are on the same page. ""For us, it's important that people who join us hold similar ideology, that they share our views, and that they understand what 'veganism' really means to us,"" Varya says.
Horizontal is one of about a dozen similar spaces across St Petersburg, promoting vegan anarchism - ""veganarchism"" - by cooking up delicious vegan food.
The term ""veganarchist"" was coined by the New York-based anarchist Brian Dominick in his 1997 essay, Animal Liberation and Social Revolution. In it, he writes that veganism is inherently intertwined with anti-fascism, human rights activism and anti-capitalism.
The animal slaughter that vegans and vegetarians are consciously opting out of, he says, relies on systematic exploitation of both humans and animals - and that only by fighting all injustices together can a vegan truly fight against any of them.
This fight, he suggests, can be waged through individual actions and radical lifestyle changes.
""The role of the revolutionist is simple,"" Dominick writes. ""Make your life into a miniature model of the alternative, revolutionary society you envision. You are a microcosm of the world around you, and even the most basic among your actions affect the social context of which you are a part. Make those effects positive and radical in their nature.""
But although the word ""veganarchism"" came from the US in the late 20th Century, both anarchism and meat-free diets have a long history in Russia.
The Russian Orthodox church prescribes a plant-based diet during Lent, and most traditional restaurants still offer a plant-based ""Lenten menu"". Ethical vegetarianism, meanwhile, was thriving in pre-revolutionary Russia - partly because of the example set by the novelist Leo Tolstoy in the late 19th Century.
But for much of the Soviet period vegetarianism fell out of favour, seen as a bourgeois indulgence. The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia went as far as to proclaim that ""vegetarianism, which is based on false hypotheses and ideas, does not have followers in the Soviet Union"".
Today, only 1% of Russians say they are vegetarian, according to a Vtsiom poll from 2018 \- roughly the proportion of British people who are vegan.
As for anarchism, the 19th Century Russian philosophers Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin are considered two of the most influential thinkers in anarchist history.
Kropotkin's radical 1892 text, The Conquest of Bread, continues to influence anarchists around the world to this day. In it, he says - among other things - that one of the first steps in any anarchist revolution would be for the people to seize food and the means of producing it.
""We have the temerity to declare that all have a right to bread, that there is bread enough for all, and that with this watchword of 'Bread for All' the revolution will triumph.""
Visitors to Llamas vegan grocery shop are greeted with a painting of a cow holding up two middle fingers.
Inside, rainbow-flag tote bags, feminist stickers and vegan condoms are sold alongside plant-based Napoleon cakes and reusable straws. In the freezer, there are _varenyky_ and _pel'meni_ dumplings made by She's Got A Knife, a ""feminist horizontalist culinary project"". In a back room, there's an unassuming hole-in-the-wall restaurant called Tempeh Time. It's dedicated to serving dishes made with tempeh - pronounced ""tem-pay"" - a protein made from fermented soya beans.
Llamas was opened last year by Anya, 30, and Igor, 33 - whom Anya describes affectionately as her ""husband and best friend"". When I speak to them, they're about to celebrate the shop's first anniversary.
Igor tells me that with veganism growing more popular in the city, they wanted to try and emulate similar spaces in cities like Berlin. At the time they hadn't been there, but they knew it was Europe's vegan activist capital.
""People come here for that feeling of Europe, of freedom, to feel for a couple of minutes like they're in Berlin or somewhere,"" he says. ""We're trying to create a space where vegans won't feel ashamed to come with their non-vegan friends, and they can say, 'That's a vegan place - it's not strange, it's not scary.'""
""We didn't just want Llamas to be a shop, but also a cafe and a meeting point for our community,"" Anya adds. ""We also had the idea to open a barbershop nearby, but that's still just an idea.""
Opening up their back room to vegan chefs was a big part of building this community space and putting their beliefs into practice, Anya says. The kitchen's first occupant was Danya, a friend of Anya and Igor's, who ran a pizzeria called Daner Pizza. When he moved out into a larger space, Iiuri Shilov, a tempeh maker, moved in. He had a soft launch of his restaurant Tempeh Time in early August, before officially opening on 7 September.
I order a large bowl of fried rice, tempeh and fresh cucumber for 180 rubles - Â£2.26. The other options on the menu, including sandwiches and soups, all hover around the 200 ruble mark. Iiuri explains that he wants to keep prices low in order to make vegan food - in particular, tempeh - accessible to as many people as possible.
""My mission is for more and more people to try tempeh,"" he says, beaming.
Iiuri first ate it two years ago while he and his wife were travelling across south-east Asia for their honeymoon. It was in Indonesia that he ordered a tempeh dish and, he says, it blew his mind. It had a flavour that was both mushroom-like and nutty, with a firm texture a bit like chicken. When fried in oil, with a small sprinkling of sea salt, the flavour was like nothing else he'd ever eaten.
It rapidly became an obsession. Every day, after surfing, he would go back to the same cafe and order exactly the same dish that he had eaten that first time, and that I had coincidentally just ordered for myself: fried rice, tempeh and cucumber.
But when the honeymoon was over and the newlyweds were back home, Iiuri couldn't find his new favourite food anywhere.
""When we came back to Russia, I wanted to eat tempeh. I kept looking around for a tempeh shop, or maybe even a tempeh cafe, but I couldn't find anything,"" Iiuri says.
So he decided to make it himself.
""I looked online and found an American book on tempeh production. It was old - a man called William Shurtleff had written it in the 1970s - but it was perfect,"" he says.
""After reading through the book, I ordered the starter [an ingredient for fermenting] all the way from Indonesia, made my own incubator at home, and bought enough soya beans to make about five or six packs of tempeh. At first I just made tempeh for myself and my friends. Then, once I figured out how to make bigger batches, I started selling to places like this,"" he says, gesturing to the grocery shop, Llamas, in which we are sitting.
Before long he was making about 10kg of tempeh per batch, with a hands-on process that would have him up in the early hours of the morning. ""My wife started getting fed upâ¦ At this point we had a three-month-old son. Imagine: my baby is crying, my wife is getting annoyed, and I'm there making tempeh at 2am.""
Eventually his wife lost patience. ""Iiura, go and find a proper kitchen,"" she told him. This turned out to be great advice, because once he did - it was a room lent to him by a friend of Danya the pizza-maker - he was able to make more tempeh than ever.
Outside Indonesia, tempeh is far less common than other vegan proteins, such as tofu and seitan, a meat substitute made from wheat gluten. Personally, I had never been a fan - but Iiuri's tempeh was delicious, unlike anything I'd ever tried before.
Iiuri tells me he went vegan six years ago, when he was working in the kitchen of a bar. He made himself a fried-egg sandwich, and a colleague asked him, ""Iiuri, why do you eat eggs?"" before using some choice words about the meat, dairy and egg industries. Intrigued, Iiuri watched an Austrian documentary about veganism.
""It was super-disgusting,"" he says. ""What I saw... it made my soul hurt. I felt so bad about all the time I had spent eating meat and eggs, and drinking milk.""
Now, he tries to spread a positive message about veganism through his cooking.
""Food can be its own form of activism,"" Iiuri tells me. ""I have customers who eat meat, but after trying tempeh they enjoy it just as much. Many of my friends have tried tempeh and liked it too - I have one friend who's non-vegetarian, but after eating tempeh he's realised that he doesn't really need meat.
""Now, he has at least one meat-free day a week. This is action.""
While Iiuri provides simple, hearty vegan food at low prices, another young vegan chef, 25-year-old Viktoria Mosina, is applying her vegan beliefs to haute-cuisine at her restaurant, Grun, and making vegan versions of traditional Georgian food at a nearby cafe, Dze Bistro.
When we meet, Viktoria has just been shortlisted for a St Petersburg culinary award - the only woman in the Best Chef category, and the only vegan among the 31 contenders. For Dze Bistro, she devised a menu of plant-based Adzharuli - a type of Georgian bread, usually filled with meat. Viktoria's versions, however, are made with plant-based ingredients - aubergine and pomegranate, for example, which are traditional in Georgian cooking.
As we speak, she shows me two deconstructed versions of traditional Russian soups from the Grun menu - one nettle soup and one _svekol'nik_ , a type of beetroot soup.
""I started to cook when I was 16, and ever since then my focus has been on promoting veganism and making it popular,"" she says. ""After a while I started to realise I could try to change the world through food - and now I've learned to cook food from plants that is so good, people won't have any need for meat.""
There were so few vegan eateries in St Petersburg when she first started cooking that there was nowhere for her to learn about the restaurant business. So she started her career in non-vegan kitchens, cooking only their vegan options - although she insisted that they weren't marked as vegan as on the menu.
""In Russia, if a person knows that something is vegan, they'll refuse it on principle because they have stereotypes in their mind,"" she explains.
When she then told her non-vegan customers what they had just eaten, they would often be surprised to learn that it hadn't been made with meat or dairy.
""At that moment, all those stereotypes would fall away. Because of my efforts and my mainstream popularity, vegans are not seen as grass-eaters or cultists as much as they used to be,"" she says.
Viktoria's focus is on using fresh, seasonal plant ingredients that she either grows in a wall-mounted allotment attached to the restaurant, or that she picks herself in the wild. Once a week she goes to the forest with her kitchen team, sees which plants she can find, and researches them in botanical textbooks to figure out the best way to cook with them. When she returns to the city she spends about a day or two developing new recipes, and by the following week they are on the menu.
""It's possible to change the world one person at a time. That's the form my activism takes - to change individuals,"" she says.
Sonia, 26, feels the same way. She runs a cake business called Run Rabbit Run, which she founded just over three years ago with another vegan baker called Slava, 31. After a while they parted ways amicably, and he opened his own cafe.
As well as running the bakery, Sonia is also making a name for herself as a feminist YouTuber, vlogging with friends on a channel called _Feministki Poyasnyayut_ \- ""Feminists Explain"" - in which they clarify ""things about feminism for ordinary people"". She has also collaborated in cooking tutorials with the popular vegan YouTuber, Mikhail Vegan.
The best way to get a message across, she says, is to ""lead by example"" - something she tries to do with Run Rabbit Run. ""If you're an ethical vegan and you're healthy, you're OK and you're not dying - you're just as normal as anyone else but you're vegan - in my experience that really is the best form of activism!""
Sonia shows me a few of her cakes, and explains why customers won't find unrefined sugar or superfoods in her recipes.
""Some people think being vegan is somehow automatically healthier,"" she says. ""I don't think so. I think it can be really healthy if you want it to be, but I don't think cakes _should be_ healthy. I think they are something you should indulge in and enjoy. They are sugary, they're fatty, they have a lot of carbohydrates - they're not healthy at all.""
Meanwhile, the cafe started earlier this year by Slava, Sonia's former business partner, is thriving too. He tells me he's inspired by Scandinavian culture, which is why he decided to name it Fika, the Swedish word for their afternoon tea.
""I really liked the concept of a salad bar, deli and bakery with a cafe - I've seen similar things in Scandinavia and Finland,"" he says. He used to have a cafe near the Fontanka river, but it was small space, and the food was so popular that there were almost always long queues. In his new location - which is less central, but more spacious - it is much easier to get served.
When St Petersburg's vegans say their philosophy is about more than food, it's not just empty words.
A week before I met them, Anya and Igor from Llamas had taken part in an annual festival in the city called _Znak Ravenstva_ \- meaning Equal Sign. It promotes not only veganism, but also feminism, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ rights and environmentalism, and tries to show how all of these movements are connected - as Brian Dominick himself believed.
As well as food stalls, there are lectures, workshops on blogging and zero-waste living, and bands performing live.
One of the festival's six co-organisers, Kostya, 24, tells me that Znak Ravenstva is now in its second year. Its predecessor, Vegan Fest, which focused more exclusively on veganism, ran for four years before the organisers decided to widen the scope.
""We're trying to say that everything is connected, and if you're vegan you have to also support all other movements for equality - so feminists, for example, are coming and learning about veganism, and vice-versa,"" Kostya says. But making this change hasn't been easy.
""Unfortunately, when we started including feminism and LGBT rights, the number of participants went down - because of prejudice."" He named a couple of restaurants that had pulled out of the festival because some staff members didn't want to openly support these causes.
But the festival's popularity is growing nonetheless, he says. This year they had about 5,000 visitors.
For Anya and Igor, events like Znak Ravenstva are vital both for helping to broaden their community, and for promoting equal rights in the city more widely.
""These four days of the festival felt even better than our last New Year holiday, because of the atmosphere, the feeling of freedom, the kindness, the toleranceâ¦ it was like a vision of our ideal Russia,"" Anya says. ""It is very hard for us as vegans to be open, but here we could come and see different projects, meet new people and make friends.""
Igor agrees, and adds that because vegans don't get much support from outside the community, spaces where they can be themselves are really important.
""The fact that this festival even happens, it's quite strange in itself,"" he says. ""This vegan festival, promoting tolerance and equality, is against the main ideology of our society.""
On the other hand, St Petersburg has a long-established tradition of activism. This goes back to the Soviet era, and it's why Kostya says this may be the best city in Russia to be vegan - and to be an activist generally. It's also why he moved to St Petersburg from his hometown in Russia's far north.
There's a feminist cafe called Simona, for example (named after Simone de Beauvoir) which made headlines in March when a group of pro-Kremlin men barged in armed with flowers for Women's Day. A confrontation ensued and one of the intruders ended up being pepper-sprayed.
Elsewhere, there is a community centre called Open Space for activists to use, free of charge - a simple concept, but a rarity in many cities globally.
Open Space's co-founder, Ilya, tells me that it is home to the city's only feminist library which, when I visit, is decorated with feminist anti-fascist posters and flyers calling for the release of political prisoners. It also regularly hosts events for independent electoral observers - a risky vocation in Russia - and marginalised groups, including the LGBT community, ""because it's unsafe to be openly gay here"". In total, he says, more than 80 independent activist groups have organised events at the space.
But if Znak Ravenstva and Open Space are microcosms of the ideal Russia for the vegan anarchist community, the real Russia is sometimes very different. It's possible to be prosecuted for the type of activism that many of them support and sometimes engage in.
Numerous Russian pride parades and LGBT youth groups have been shut down under the country's ""gay propaganda"" law, which bans the positive depiction of same-sex relationships in any media that can be consumed by children - including the internet. Recently, the authorities shut down two LGBT community groups on Russian-language social media. And while a growing number of young Russians seem ready to take to the streets to protest against the actions of local officials - against the exclusion of candidates in local elections, for example, against the destruction of a park, or the creation of a toxic dump close to a river - they may pay for it with arrest.
But there is one case in particular that has hit home for the veganarchists in St Petersburg.
In early November 2017, an anti-fascist vegan cafe owner called Arman Sagynbaev was arrested at his home in St Petersburg and charged with terrorism offences. He was one of about 10 activists from St Petersburg and the city of Penza, far away in the Volga region, accused by the authorities of being part of an ""anarchist terrorist group"" called ""the network"". Investigators accused them of trying to promote, through talks and meetings, ""further destabilisation of the political climate in the country"" during the presidential elections and the 2018 World Cup. The vegans I spoke to believe Sagynbaev is no terrorist, and that he was targeted because he was anti-fascist.
Sagynbaev initially confessed to the charges against him, but withdrew this confession in September last year, alleging - in a lengthy and detailed statement - that the FSB had extracted it by means of torture.
Two of his co-defendants have lodged complaints of torture with the European Court of Human Rights. Sagynbaev remains in custody, awaiting trial.
Sagynbaev's arrest, Igor says, felt like a warning to the rest of the community.
""The political situation in Russia prohibits us from being free as vegan activists,"" he says. ""In Europe it's easier to be openly vegan and support equal rights, but Russian politics is the politics of xenophobia, of the absence of free speech.""
When I ask Iiuri about politics, the smile quickly drains from his face.
""The political situation in Russia is worse than disgusting,"" he says. ""I hate our president, I hate our government. Policemen beat our guys, they break their legs.""
Iiuri is referring to a graphic designer in recent pro-democracy demonstrations in Moscow, who had his leg broken by officers at a time when he wasn't even protesting, just jogging past City Hall.
""Last year, my wife and I went to a protest. She was pregnant - and the police came up to us and threatened to beat her,"" Iiuri continues, looking visibly shaken at the memory. He tells me that he and his wife are even thinking about moving to another country, such as Canada. ""I'm 31, and I've lived almost my entire life under the Putin regime. I don't want to live here any more.""
But it's not just the authorities the vegan community worries about.
Several of the people I speak to describe confrontations with far-right groups. These range from neo-Nazis sticking far-right stickers on their doors, to being violently attacked - including beatings and stabbings.
In October 2017, a group of young, far-right activists went to a now-closed vegan anarchist restaurant called Animals and shot flares through the glass of the windows. Some staff were seriously injured.
Animals was run by the same group behind Horizontal, and was located just a few feet away. Like Horizontal it was an openly anarchist restaurant and a known meeting space for activists, says Horizontal worker Varya.
""It was the fash,"" she tells me, using a slang word for neo-fascists.
""We are politically active and we support different activist groups, we cover our walls with stickers, so they knew to target us. We all understand who was behind it, but no-one was fined or arrested.""
Kostya tells me that he first became consciously anti-fascist at the age of 15, growing up in a village in the far-northern Yamalo Nenets district. It was a multicultural area - including members of the indigenous Nenets ethnic group - but there was also a strong far-right, Russian nationalist movement. This disturbed Kostya, who believed that everyone was equal.
Even earlier, when Kostya was 10, he had been shocked by the murder of a 20-year-old rock musician and anti-racist activist, Timur Kacharava, who was stabbed to death by neo-Nazis outside a bookshop in St Petersburg. It stuck in his mind.
""We have a problem,"" he says. ""Unfortunately there has been no change in Russia for I don't know how long. A big part of the problem is our mass media, and the messages the government transmits through it. They say that the world is against us, they are homophobic and say that Europe is 'gay', for example."" He says many young people now ignore TV, and get their news online. Pollsters have noticed this trend, too - one recent poll found almost half of Russians aged 18-to-24 get their news from the largely uncensored internet.
After a moment of pause, Kostya adds: ""I don't think Russians are bad people. They're just not educated, and are taught that the rest of the world is against us. From this fear grows a hatred of all difference.""
So what does the future look like?
Despite everything St Petersburg's vegan anarchists come up against, they remain hopeful about the years to come.
""I want an equal society, I'd like people to respect animals, to respect each other and to respect the planet - and I would like to see a border-free world, with no borders between the countries,"" Varya says.
For many, a world without borders would be as unthinkable as a world without meat or cheese. But Varya is undaunted.
""I understand that, in reality, this will only be possible in several generations. But I just hope that we will bring up one generation, then another generation, and then another generation - then our descendants will finally be able to live in a much better society.""
Igor and Anya agree.
""Russia has had a very difficult history,"" Igor says. ""But it's all about the mentality of the people - about whether we see the inertia of a generation, or the conscience of a generation. So if we at least manage to build a liberal state, in 10 years or so, we can have another country.""
Kostya adds that veganism in St Petersburg is growing so rapidly, there was even an animal rights section at the city's May Day parade this year.
""We had more people than United Russia,"" he laughs, referring to President Putin's political party.
""The ideal Russia, and the ideal world, for me would see us living in harmony and equality, living alongside people where we are all different but we are all equal. Where there's direct democracy - where the people vote for or against policies directly through referendums, rather than through representative governments. And of course where we're all environmentally aware,"" he says.
""A world with no state, no police, no borders, no nations - where people can decide for themselves what they want and what they want to achieve.""

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis past weekend in Munich, the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) held its 13th annual climate and energy conference. According to EIKE, over 200 attended, making it the most successful so far.
But as reported earlier, the EIKE conference organizers were forced to scramble at the last minute to find another location to hold the event after leftist green extremists had bullied the NH Munich Conference Center into cancelling the booking, before booting EIKE and attending scientists out onto the street.
Worse, the German civil apparatus did nothing to protect EIKE’s rights, turning a blind eye to the highly dubious breach of contract and intimidation of free speech.
In the end, EIKE managed to move the conference to a new location, which they chose to keep secret in order to hinder further attempts by the leftwing activists to disrupt and stifle free speech.
Die 13. Internationale Klima- und Energiekonferenz wurde erfolgreich beendet! Antifa und Klimakrakeeler produzierten sich als Volltrottel!

“Living in a very tragic time”
At conference a number of speakers commented on the unusual events.
For example, Dr. Benny Peiser commented (30:35): “The conference naturally will go down in history as being the first science congress since Nazi times that was attempted to be obstructed. And the problem of course is, as is the case in all authoritarian history, how a small minority begins and eventuially spreads like a fire to others. […] We are living in a very tragic time.”
Having moved from Germany to Great Britain 30 years ago, Dr. Peiser told how today he “can hardly recognize Germany any more.”

“Thirty years ago, freedom was a great word. Today it’s a curse word. Like George Orwell once said, ‘Freedom is the right to say what others don’t want to hear,”‘ Peiser reminded.
German law fears the leftists
Lord Christopher Monckton, Viscount of Brenchly also spoke (4:27:55) on the attempted shut down of the EIKE climate conference “by fascists calling themselves anti-fascists” and how the NH Munich Conference Center abruptly canceled – at the last minute – the contract to accommodate the EIKE conference. Monckton called the judge who refused to enforce the contract law “a coward”.
“He allowed the fascist bullies to frighten him into cancelling that venue,” Monckton said. “These are the people from whom the judge was frightened,” said Monckton, showing a slide of the leftist bullies.

How did the German media respond to the EIKE climate conference? As expected, the mainstream media pretty much ignored it totally.
SZ: “deniers”…”non-transparent ultra-libertarians” …”almost only men”
But the center-left Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) published a commentary by Philipp Bovermann. And, as expected, it was hardly flattering – consisting of the same worn out, low-intellect, name-calling polemic that sadly has been earning German ‘journalists’ awards lately.
The SZ’s Bovermann even referred to Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv as “a climate change denier”. And as is usual for the vast majority of today’s German mainstream journalists, Bovermann totally ignored the science. He wasn’t there for real science journalism, after all. His SZ screed obviously makes that clear. Rather he was there to produce recycled-plastic-grade political propaganda. No wonder we live in “very tragic times” in Germany.

"**Some say it with flowers, others with chocolates - but it seems an increasing number of us are showing our affections with rings bought from Poundland.**
The discount retailer told the BBC it had sold almost 40,000 engagement rings ahead of Valentine's Day this year, nearly double last year's tally.
The Â£1 ""Bling Rings"" and ""Man Bands"" are meant to be used as ""placeholders"" for proper rings, it said.
But one analyst described such promotions as ""increasingly desperate"".
Spending on Valentine's Day reached around Â£853m last year, up 7.8% on 2018 figures, according to the research firm Savvy. And unsurprisingly retailers are looking to cash in again this year.
Poundland says its Valentine's range is its biggest yet, featuring more than 80 products ranging from fragrances to ""adults only"" gift cards.
And M&S has brought back its heart-shaped ""love sausages"" and introduced a new ""love cucumber"", which can be cut into heart-shaped slices.
Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle said events like Valentine's Day are really important for retailers because they drive customers into shops where they will often make impulse purchases.
She said this year's event would also mark the end of a ""long bleak winter"" for retailers, many of whom have been struggling with a slowdown on the High Street.
Restaurants, florists and gift card companies are particularly set to benefit, as 14 February can be one of their busiest days of the year.
Interflora, the flower-ordering service, told the BBC it will deliver 15 times as many bunches of flowers than on a typical day. That is about three bouquets every second.
Then there's online table booking platform Quandoo, which has seen a 160% increase in bookings for Valentine's Day this year, compared to the average Friday. However, it also expects more cancellations than usual.
Analyst Richard Hyman said retailers had long catered to Valentine's Day, although it is nowhere near as important as events such as Black Friday.
He also feels firms increasingly overplay events like Valentine's Day with ""desperate gimmicks"" in the hope of attracting consumers' attention.
""I think as the retail recession takes hold, desperation grows. And the industry is going to be looking for events more and more that they can use as a tool to build a promotion around.
""The reality is that most retailers these days are on promotion most of the time. And giving a name to that promotion is quite handy.
""You know Valentine's Day sounds a bit more meaningful than 'here comes spring'.""
Despite the reservations, retailers continue to find new ways of making money out of the day.
Card company Moonpig, for example, told the BBC it had seen an increase in the number of cards bought for favourite pets.
And its rival Card Factory said people were increasingly celebrating Valentine's Day with friends and family members, not just significant others.
Poundland meanwhile has been looking to capitalise on consumers' growing reluctance to go out, as evidenced by the slowdown in pub and restaurant sales over the last few years.
It said it would be selling romantic decorations this year to help couples capture the same mood at home. ""Many Brits prefer cosy, romantic nights in to spending a fortune on dining in over-priced over crowded restaurants on Valentine's day,"" a spokeswoman said."

On Tuesday, President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing greenhouse‐​gas emissions, with hopes of mitigating climate changes. His “Climate Action Plan” is neither necessary nor effective, but it will be costly.



By promoting limits on greenhouse‐​gas emissions from U.S. power plants while increasing “green”-energy incentives, the president is trying to steer our energy choices away from the free‐​market course and toward the direction of his liking.





Americans will pay more to make clean energy cleaner.



This is a dangerous undertaking, and one with a far‐​from‐​certain outcome. Government intervention in financial markets was the root of the Great Recession. Government intervention in the energy market carries an even greater risk, as energy drives everything.



The justification for this risk is just not there.



U.S. greenhouse‐​gas emissions are already on the decline and have been for about a decade now. The majority of this downward trend is not the result of government regulations restricting greenhouse‐​gas emissions, but rather technological innovations in the energy industry. Techniques such has horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, have opened expansive natural gas and oil reserves that were considered unrecoverable only a few years ago.



Consequently, cheap, reliable electricity produced by coal is being replaced by even cheaper, reliable electricity from natural gas.



Because of its chemical makeup, natural gas, when burned, produces about half the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as burning coal. Therefore, as natural gas replaces coal as fuel for generating electricity, our greenhouse‐​gas emissions fall.



Granted, this is an unforeseen outcome. Natural gas fracking was developed to produce a cheaper fuel and outperform the competition, not to produce less greenhouse‐​gas emissions. The net result, though, is exactly the type of outcome that Mr. Obama wants to happen — a reduction of greenhouse‐​gas emissions — and it has been achieved without government incentives, taxes, or restrictions.



All the government had to do was stay out of the way.



In fact, it is arguable that had the government imposed regulations handicapping fossil fuels, these production techniques — now a cornerstone of Mr. Obama’s Climate Action Plan — may never have been fully developed as research efforts could have been diverted elsewhere.



Greenhouse‐​gas emissions in the U.S. are falling at a rate that is greater than the one laid out in the president’s plan. So why get involved at all?



When it comes to significantly slowing human‐​caused climate change — the reason for the Climate Action Plan in the first place — none of this matters anyway.



Scientific research suggests that global warming is proceeding, and will continue, at a slower pace, with fewer negative impacts than current projections indicate, including those underlying the president’s plan. On top of this, the U.S. relative contribution to climate change is declining year after year as greenhouse‐​gas emissions from developing nations, such as China, expand rapidly.



Together, this means that the president’s plan for reducing emissions in the United States effectively will have no impact on the local, regional or global climate. Domestic reductions will not produce any demonstrable change in the weather; there will be not be verifiably fewer tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, floods, wildfires, heat waves or any other manner of extreme weather. The rise in the number of billion‐​dollar weather disasters highlighted by the president will continue — driven by the fact that there are more people with more stuff in harm’s way, not by human‐​caused climate change.



The president recognizes that actions in the United States alone will be insufficient to change the course of the climate. A global effort is required. Therefore, what the president really hopes to achieve is not direct climate‐​change mitigation from reducing U.S. greenhouse‐​gas emissions, but to gain bargaining power at international talks to address climate change and, ultimately, that low‐​emitting energy technologies will be developed and deployed rapidly and safely around the world.



Yet there is no guarantee of these outcomes.



Nevertheless, our own president is pursuing actions that are akin to holding Americans hostage to limited energy choices — and probably higher energy prices — while hoping that the rest of the world someday will pay the ransom in the form of a reduction in greenhouse emissions.



Rather than this wait‐​and‐​hope attitude, the president ought to encourage actions that would enable us to better fend for ourselves no matter what the future brings — actions aimed at expanding our energy resources, increasing our wealth and improving our resilience for the climate challenges that lie ahead. This path would be paved with less government interference, not more.

"Times Insider delivers    insights into life at The New York Times. In a large newsroom, the collaboration between a reporter and a photographer often depends on the whims of their respective assigning editors, who calculate strengths, weaknesses, and, most of all, availability. Who’s up to cover that fire? Who’s up to shoot it? The resulting slapdash teamwork between writer and photographer can end as quickly as it began they may work together the next day, or never again. But for many years now, I have been fortunate to work with exceptional New York Times photographers for extended periods of time while writing a national column called “This Land. ” Lately, I have been collaborating with Todd Heisler, a stunningly gifted photographer and a great companion. Before Todd, I traveled for several years beside the recently retired Nicole Bengiveno, whose profound empathy comes through in her camera’s every click, and who deserves some formal commendation for having put up with a certain hack  —   me  —   for so long. And before Nicole, there was Ángel Franco, who retired last month to end a storied Times career  —   and who began the “This Land” column with me 10 years ago this month. The template for our relationship  —   indeed, for “This Land”  —   was established in early 2007, as we headed out to do our inaugural column, one on Logan, a small West Virginia city struggling with a fatal mine disaster and the decline of King Coal. Mr. Franco and I began by walking the streets, noticing: the coal train running through the city’s core the dust settling on buildings along the tracks and the Jesus Christ carved from anthracite, prominent in a store’s window display. Noticing  —   that was the word for it. At one point we went to a small diner, and engaged in a brief exchange with the waitress. After she had taken our order, I asked, “Did you hear what she said?” And Mr. Franco repeated her words exactly: “‘Are we ready yet, children? ’” There it was. As with Todd and Nicole, as with so many other photographers  —   and may God forgive any reporter who uses the term “my photographer”  —   Mr. Franco is an attentive observer, witnessing and listening always. In that   diner, I knew that my Times colleague embraced the storytelling worth of the small and quiet moment. This is going to be fun, I thought. For the next two years, Mr. Franco and I produced a column a week, just about, and wound up filing    dispatches from each of the 50 states. This, of course, was madness. Our weeks would often begin on Monday at Newark Liberty International Airport, and end on Friday, or Saturday, even Sunday, with frantic efforts to figure out where to go to next. Louisiana? Montana? Maine? (The only way we were able to maintain some semblance of sanity, by the way, was by having the great Cate Doty help us with possible story ideas, travel logistics and dinner recommendations she was a full partner in this misbegotten venture. I also owe a debt of gratitude to then National desk editor, Suzanne Daley, and then deputy national editor, David Firestone, both of whom were integral in allowing “This Land” to begin.) You can look it up. We went to a retirement home in  Penney Farms, Fla. to visit the coroner in “The Wizard of Oz. ” To Havana, Ill. to report on the Asian carp infesting the Illinois River. To Kalaupapa, Hawaii, to meet the last residents of a colony to which those with leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, were once relegated. To Nashville to witness an execution by electric chair. To Bethel, Alaska, to explore the    games of bootleggers. To Bill, Wyo.  —   population five, maybe  —   to stay in a new hotel catering to railway workers. To Cottage Grove, Wis. to meet the pastor who baptized Jeffrey Dahmer in a prison whirlpool. To Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, to uncover the    intrigue at a county fair’s  . To Denver, to cover the annual convention of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (where we felt perfectly at home). Kalispell, Mont. Lake Mead, Nev. Ainsworth, Neb. Newport, Ind. Pascagoula, Miss. Greensburg, Kan. Hollywood, Md. Sylva, N. C. The datelines blur into one American story, captured in all its breadth by Mr. Franco and his camera. I often had no idea what to do for the next column. One Saturday morning, while scanning online newspapers for ideas, I noticed a news brief about a farewell breakfast in a V. F. W. hall in Mohave Valley, Ariz. for a high school graduate named Resha Kane. After the meal, she was to be taken by motorcycle escort to Las Vegas, to catch a flight to Fort Hood, where she would begin her Army career in exchange for college tuition. I called my good friend Mr. Franco  —   who, of course, got it immediately. We flew out the next day, and were present when Ms. Kane, who looked much younger than her 18 years, said her goodbyes. Mr. Franco’s memorable photograph of this young woman in fatigues, saying goodbye to her father  —   the fear of her unknown, of our unknown, conveyed in her eyes  —   hangs in the newsroom. Once again he had noticed, and captured, that small and quiet moment. Working closely with Mr. Franco for two years, I could not help but be blown away by his fierce dedication to his art, by his determination to capture a moment’s essence  —   and by his unflagging reportorial curiosity, which led to my favorite moments on assignment: the evening debriefing. Sitting in a booth at a Chili’s or Texas Roadhouse hard against some interstate, Mr. Franco and I would pore over what we had just seen and heard, comparing notes, dissecting motives, framing The Story to come. One modest testament to Mr. Franco’s art is in how I remember our travels. It’s not my opening paragraphs or closing kickers that I recall, but rather Mr. Franco’s photographs, which return me so completely to the Mississippi despair of a   FEMA trailer, to the   joy of a small Maine amusement park, to the expansive wonder of a remote South Dakota spot known as the Center of the Nation. It is a rare privilege to see this great country, in all its heartbreaking,   wonder, on the dime of your employer. A rarer privilege, still, to have also seen it through the   eyes of Ángel Franco."

Here are TEN REASONS to EXIT PARIS NOW:The science is NOT settled – hundreds of scientists in Australia and thousands more throughout the world reject the theory that human production of carbon dioxide is driving dangerous global warming. And the 102 computerised climate models have always predicted more warming than has occurred. (They got it right once, 39 years ago.)Source: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/06/28/173948/2. There is no unusual global warming. Since the last ice age ended there have been warm eras hotter than today’s modern warming – the warm peaks are getting lower, not higher. Climate has always changed in response to forces far greater than human activities. The endless procession of man-made scare campaigns about cooling, warming, ice melting, sea levels, ocean acidity, cyclones and droughts have all proved false.3. Carbon dioxide is NOT a pollutant – it is an invisible natural gas that supplies the whole food chain. More carbon dioxide is beneficial to the biosphere – forests, grasses and crops grow better thus benefitting all animal life that relies on plants.4. The populous world nations are unlikely to curb their CO2 emissions – China, India, Russia, Brazil, USA, Japan, SE Asia, Indonesia, Africa and the Arab world will ignore Paris limits.5. Despite 20 years of favourable promotion, subsidies, taxes, targets and propaganda the contribution of the intermittent energy producers (wind and solar) to world energy supplies is trivial – about 3% (see if you can find “solar” in the graph below.)Source: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/09/12/highlights-from-the-2018-bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy/6. Australian energy policies, taxes and targets are making electricity more costly and less reliable, hurting consumers and driving industry off-shore. And once they have ruined electricity and coal their next targets will be agriculture and motorists.7. With no nuclear power, no geothermal power, limited hydro potential and increasing barriers to gas exploration, Australia has few options except coal for cheap reliable grid power, and oil products for transport.8. With a huge continent, a small population and heavy reliance on exports, each Australian will be heavily penalised by the Paris Agreement for the emissions associated with exports consumed by others.9. Compliance with the Paris Agreement will destroy industries and jobs, encourage bureaucracy and transfer controls and money to affiliates of the United Nations.10. Should the world experience even modest cooling in the decades ahead Australia will urgently need increased supply of reliable power for homes and industry and the global atmosphere will need more carbon dioxide plant food.Viv ForbesExecutive Directorwww.saltbushclub.comforbes@saltbushclub.comhttps://saltbushclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/saltbush-members.pdfThis is the first Saltbush Chain Letter entitled Exit Paris Now.Make sure you pass it on to at least FIVE recipients within 48 hours or the fleas of one thousand camels from the Saltbush country will infect your armpits. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Each IPCC report seems to be required to conclude that the case for an international agreement to curb carbon dioxide has grown stronger. That is to say the IPCC report (and especially the press release accompanying the summary) is a political document, and as George Orwell noted, political language “is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.”   
  
  
With respect to climate, we have had 17 years without warming; all models show greater tropical warming than has been observed since 1978; and arctic sea ice is suddenly showing surprising growth. And yet, as the discrepancies between models and observations increase, the IPCC insists that its confidence in the model predictions is greater than ever.   
  
  
Referring to the 17 year ‘pause,’ the IPCC allows for two possibilities: that the sensitivity of the climate to increasing greenhouse gases is less than models project and that the heat added by increasing CO2 is ‘hiding’ in the deep ocean. Both possibilities contradict alarming claims.   
  
  
With low sensitivity, economic analyses suggest that warming under 2C would likely be beneficial to the earth. Heat ‘hiding’ in the deep ocean would mean that current IPCC models fail to describe heat exchange between surface waters and the deep ocean. Such exchanges are essential features of natural climate variability, and all IPCC claims of attribution of warming to mans activities depend on the assumption that the models accurately portray this natural variability.   
  
  
In attempting to convince the public to accept the need to for the environmental movement’s agenda, continual reference is made to consensus. This is dishonest not because of the absence of a consensus, but because the consensus concerning such things as the existence of irregular (and small compared to normal regional variability) net warming since about 1850, the existence of climate change (which has occurred over the earths entire existence), the fact that added greenhouse gases should have some impact (though small unless the climate system acts so as to greatly amplify this effect) over the past 60 years with little impact before then, and the fact that greenhouse gases have increased over the past 200 years or so, and that their greenhouse impact is already about 80% of what one expects from a doubling of CO2 are all perfectly consistent with there being no serious problem. Even the text of the IPCC Scientific Assessment agrees that catastrophic consequences are highly unlikely, and that connections of warming to extreme weather have not been found. The IPCC iconic statement that there is a high degree of certainty that most of the warming of the past 50 years is due to man’s emissions is, whether true or not, completely consistent with there being no problem. To say that most of a small change is due to man is hardly an argument for the likelihood of large changes.   
  
  
Carbon restriction policies, to have any effect on climate, would require that the most extreme projections of dangerous climate actually be correct, and would require massive reductions in the use of energy to be universally adopted. There is little question that such reductions would have negative impacts on income, development, the environment, and food availability and cost – especially for the poor. This would clearly be immoral.   
  
  
By contrast, the reasonable and moral policy would be to foster economic growth, poverty reduction and well being in order that societies be better able to deal with climate change regardless of its origin. Mitigation policies appear to have the opposite effect without significantly reducing the hypothetical risk of any changes in climate. While reducing vulnerability to climate change is a worthy goal, blind support for mitigation measures – regardless of the invalidity of the claims – constitutes what might be called bankrupt morality.   
  
  
It is not sufficient for actions to artificially fulfill people’s need for transcendent aspirations in order for the actions to be considered moral. Needless to add, support of global warming alarm hardly constitutes intelligent respect for science.

We are constantly exposed to extended forecasts in the media and online, with predictions extending through the next month and more.
Can you rely on such predictions?    Are they really worth paying attention to?
Quite honestly, probably not–and if you do consider them, do so with the knowledge that their skill is marginal at best.
Take this month (October) for example.  The official NOAA Climate Prediction Forecast for October temperatures, made on Sept. 19th, was for warmer than normal conditions over the west and MUCH above normal over the southwest U.S.

What actually happened?  Nearly the entire west was much colder than normal, with the northern parts MUCH, MUCH colder than normal.  A miss.  In fact, a big miss.

Or the official 3-4 week forecast, made on October 4th?   Warmer than normal over the west.

Such poor forecasts even a month out are not unusual.   UW graduate student Nick Weber and I evaluated the skill of the main U.S. long-term forecasting model (the CFSv2) and found that skill is typically lost after roughly 2 weeks (see below and published in the peer-reviewed literature).  This figure shows the forecast error (root mean square error) at 500 hPa—about 18,000 ft, a good level to view atmospheric predictability.  The situation is the same over Washington, the western U.S., the continental U.S. or global.  Skill is rapidly lost the second week out.

While meteorologists struggle to produce improved forecast skill past two weeks, we have gained a great deal of skill at the shorter time ranges, particularly for days 3-8.
So why is our skill improving rapidly for the shorter periods, but not the longer ones?
Because the forecasting problem is very different at the different temporal scales.
For the short periods, forecasting  is an initial value problem.  We start with a good description of the 3D atmosphere and our models simulate how things evolve.   Because of weather satellites and other new data sources, our initial description of the atmospheric has gotten MUCH better.  And our models are much better:  higher resolution, much better description of key physical processes, and more.  That is why a plot of the skill of  skill of the 1-10 day forecasts of the European Center has improved greatly over the past decades (see below)

But small errors in the initial description of the atmosphere and deficiencies in our models inevitably lead to growing errors, and by 2 weeks such errors swamp the forecast.  The forecasts are not much better than simply using the average conditions (or climatology).
There is hope for some skill beyond two weeks, by taking advantage of the forecast skill available from aspects of the environment that are changing slowly (such as sea surface temperatures, sea ice extent, snow extend, soil moisture).    These aspects influence the atmosphere and potentially can torque the atmosphere one way or the other.  Essentially, the forecast problem has changed from an initial values problem to a boundary-forced problem (the boundary being the surface characteristics that can influence weather).
But the skill that might be available from the boundary conditions is different—not about the conditions at a specific time, but for the average conditions over a month or season.   A good example of such skill is the relationship of the warmer (El Nino) or colder (La Nina) temperatures of the tropic Pacific sea surface and weather around the world.    There is some skill there, but it is relatively modest.

Unfortunately, our models still have key deficiencies (such as poor description of thunderstorms) that make it difficult for us to derive all the potential skill that should be available from the slowly changing boundary conditions.   A lot of work is needed, but I am hopeful that eventually forecast skill beyond two weeks will improve.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a vast cyberattack aimed at denying Hillary Clinton the presidency and installing Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office, the nation’s top intelligence agencies said in an extraordinary report they delivered on Friday to Mr. Trump. The officials presented their unanimous conclusions to Mr. Trump in a   briefing at Trump Tower in New York that brought the leaders of America’s intelligence agencies face to face with their most vocal skeptic, the   who has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia’s role. The meeting came just two weeks before Mr. Trump’s inauguration and was underway even as the electoral votes from his victory were being formally counted in a joint session of Congress. Soon after leaving the meeting, intelligence officials released the declassified,  damning report that described the sophisticated cybercampaign as part of a continuing Russian effort to weaken the United States government and its democratic institutions. The report  —   a virtually     revelation by the American intelligence agencies that undermined the legitimacy of the president who is about to direct them  —   made the case that Mr. Trump was the favored candidate of Mr. Putin. The Russian leader, the report said, sought to denigrate Mrs. Clinton, and the report detailed what the officials had revealed to President Obama a day earlier: Mr. Trump’s victory followed a complicated, multipart cyberinformation attack whose goal had evolved to help the Republican win. The   report did not conclude that Russian involvement tipped the election to Mr. Trump. The public report lacked the evidence that intelligence officials said was included in a classified version, which they described as information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates. Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from “implants” that the United States and its allies have put in Russian computer networks. Much of the unclassified report focused instead on an overt Kremlin propaganda campaign that would be unlikely to convince skeptics of the report’s more serious conclusions. The report may be a political blow to Mr. Trump. But it is also a risky moment for the intelligence agencies that have become more powerful since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but have had to fend off allegations that they exaggerated intelligence during the buildup to the Iraq war. The declassified report did describe in detail the efforts of Mr. Putin and his security services, including the creation of the online Guccifer 2. 0 persona and DCLeaks. com to release information gained from the hacks to the public. “Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help   Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” the report by the nation’s intelligence agencies concluded. Mr. Trump, whose resistance to that very conclusion has led him to repeatedly mock the country’s intelligence services on Twitter since Election Day, issued a written statement that appeared to concede some Russian involvement. But Mr. Trump said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin had sought to aid his candidacy, other than insisting that he still believes the Russian attacks had no effect on the outcome. The  ’s written statement came just hours after Mr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview that the storm surrounding Russian hacking was nothing more than a “political witch hunt” carried out by his adversaries, who he said were embarrassed by their loss to him in the 2016 election. Speaking by telephone three hours before the intelligence briefing, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intense focus on Russia. “China, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names,” he said, referring to the breach of computers at the Office of Personnel Management in late 2014 and early 2015. “How come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt. ” Later, Mr. Trump sought to blame the Democrats for any cyberattacks that might have occurred. “Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place,” he said in a Twitter message posted about 11 p. m. “The Republican National Committee had strong defense!” Vice   Mike Pence told reporters that he and Mr. Trump had “appreciated the presentation” by the intelligence officials and described the conversation as “respectful. ” Mr. Pence said the new administration would take aggressive action “to combat cyberattacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future. ” Mr. Trump, who has consistently questioned the evidence of Russian hacking during the election, did so again Friday before he met with the intelligence officials. Asked why he thought there was so much attention on the Russian cyberattacks, the   said the motivation was political. He also repeated his criticism of the American intelligence agencies, saying that “a lot of mistakes were made” in the past, noting in particular the attacks on the World Trade Center and saying, as he has repeatedly, that “weapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time. ” But after meeting with the intelligence officials, Mr. Trump appeared to moderate his position, conceding that “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyberinfrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee. ” The report described a broad campaign of covert operations, including the “trolling” on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia’s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining “access to elements of multiple U. S. state or local electoral boards,” it concluded  —   as officials have publicly  —   that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8. The report, reflecting the assessments of the C. I. A. the F. B. I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election. “We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,” the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American “political processes” or public opinion. The intelligence agencies also concluded “with high confidence” that Russia’s main military intelligence unit, the G. R. U. created a “persona” called Guccifer 2. 0 and a website, DCLeaks. com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta. When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G. R. U. “relayed material it acquired from the D. N. C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. ” The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published. The role of RT  —   the Russian   news organization that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation  —   in the Kremlin’s effort to influence the election is covered in far more detail by the report than any other aspect of the Russian campaign. An annex in the report on RT, which was first written in 2012 but not previously made public, takes up eight pages of the report’s   main section. The report’s unequivocal assessment of RT presents an awkward development for Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who is Mr. Trump’s choice to serve as national security adviser. Mr. Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RT’s news programs and in December 2015 was paid by the network to give a speech in Russia and attend its lavish anniversary party, where he sat at the elbow of Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn has since defended his speech, insisting that RT is no different from CNN or MSNBC. The report also stated that Russia collected data “on some   targets,” but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested. Intelligence officials who prepared the classified report have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions. The British role, which has been closely held, is a critical part of the timeline because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or informants outside the United States, as emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee flowed out of the country. The conclusions in the report were described on Thursday to President Obama and on Friday to Mr. Trump by James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence John O. Brennan, the director of the C. I. A. Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. The key to the public report’s assessment is that Russia’s motives “evolved over the course of the campaign. ” When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused “on undermining her future presidency,” with   bloggers preparing a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #DemocracyRIP. It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011. Yet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the Democratic National Committee’s networks. Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until “at least June 2016,” the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks."

What could go wrong? ~cr
From Nature
Feat could turn bacteria into biological factories for energy and even food.

The bacterium Escherichia coli has been engineered to grow by consuming carbon dioxide.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL
E. coli is on a diet. Researchers have created a strain of the lab workhorse bacterium — full name Escherichia coli — that grows by consuming carbon dioxide instead of sugars or other organic molecules.
The achievement is a milestone, say scientists, because it drastically alters the inner workings of one of biology’s most popular model organisms. And in the future, CO2-eating E. coli could be used to make organic carbon molecules that could be used as biofuels or to produce food. Products made in this way would have lower emissions compared with conventional production methods, and could potentially remove the gas from the air. The work is published in Cell1 on 27 November.
“It’s like a metabolic heart transplantation,” says Tobias Erb, a biochemist and synthetic biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg, Germany, who wasn’t involved in the study.
Plants and photosynthetic cyanobacteria — aquatic microbes that produce oxygen — use the energy from light to transform, or fix, CO2 into the carbon-containing building blocks of life, including DNA, proteins and fats. But these organisms can be hard to genetically modify, which has slowed efforts to turn them into biological factories.
By contrast, E. coli is relatively easy to engineer, and its fast growth means that changes can be quickly tested and tweaked to optimize genetic alterations. But the bacterium prefers to grow on sugars such as glucose — and instead of consuming CO2, it emits the gas as waste.
Ron Milo, a systems biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and his team have spent the past decade overhauling E. coli’s diet. In 2016, they created2 a strain that consumed CO2, but the compound accounted for only a fraction of the organism’s carbon intake — the rest was an organic compound that the bacteria were fed, called pyruvate.
Full proof of concept paper here.

Every December since 1995, the United Nations has held a meeting of the countries that signed onto its 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change. This year, the 20th “Conference of the Parties” (“COP-20”) is another iteration, with officials (and anyone who wants to influence them) spewing countless tons of carbon dioxide into the air to meet, posture, disagree, agree, and declare a breakthrough on global warming. This movie has played more times than _A Christmas Story_ airs during the holidays. Ho, ho, ho!



Sometime during this year’s conference, various governments will breathlessly pronounce that 2014’s global temperatures will set an all‐​time record. Make that _some_ temperatures, as not all the global records agree, and it’s also unclear what the previous record‐​warm year was. Some histories give it as 1998, while others say 2010. And make that “all‐​time” going back to the late 19th century. Before then, there was still a climate, and sometimes it was warmer.





Lima matters because of the charade of global agreement that will be foisted upon the world and repeated by the UN’s green allies everywhere and anywhere.



So what’s with the cricket sounds emanating from Lima?



Climate hype is definitely on the down‐​low in Lima because the meeting is specifically designed to be a preparatory step for the great Paris climatefest of 2015, where leaders hope to (finally) ink a “legally binding” agreement to replace the failed and expired Kyoto Protocol on global warming.



That treaty never bound the U.S., because it was never ratified by a two‐​thirds vote of the Senate. The Constitution is clear that this needs to be done for a treaty to have the force of law. It’s therefore rather odd that the Obama administration floated a trial balloon last summer suggesting that the Paris agreement will not have to be ratified. Damn the Constitution! Full speed ahead!



As has been shown repeatedly, the president can, via the Environmental Protection Agency, command any reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that Tom Steyer desires, thanks to a 2007 5–4 Supreme Court decision, _Massachusetts v. EPA_.



Unfortunately, this president will veto any attempt that Congress may pass to restrict necessary funds to the EPA’s enforcement apparatus. But some other president, without the Senate’s ratification, may do much less, especially with a Congress of the same stripe.



So why does Lima matter? It matters because of the charade of global agreement that will be foisted upon the world and repeated by the UN’s green allies everywhere and anywhere.



That charade emanates from China’s putative “commitment” to cap its carbon dioxide emissions some 16 years from now. In fact, they “agreed” to no such thing. The communiqué that came out of Peking’s meeting with President Obama in October says that China “intends” to cap its emissions “around” 2030.



It’s funny that so few people have noted China’s purposeful ambiguity, but that’s just history repeating itself. In November 2009, in the hype‐​up to the last great attempt to replace Kyoto, we also read that “China has finally agreed on a timetable to reduce emissions.” They hadn’t. Instead, they said their goal was to lower the amount of carbon dioxide emitted _per unit of economic output_ (the so‐​called “intensity” of carbon dioxide production).



While both of China’s announcements, in 2009 and 2014, generated much sound and fury, they signified little, if anything. In the years before the 2009 Copenhagen meeting, which itself was a spectacular failure, China was wildly inefficient with energy, so it was inevitable that its “intensity” would soon decline. It is also obvious that China’s developmental trajectory will result in a substantial slowdown or stabilization of emissions somewhere “around” 2030.



The only difference between Copenhagen and Lima is timing. The anticipated result is the same: that the world will come together and sign a breakthrough climate agreement, first in 2009, and now next year in Paris. And, as was the case in Copenhagen and will be the case in Lima, a spectacular victory will be announced in France in 2015 that will turn out to be meaningless because of Chinese (in)action.

In the wake of lengthy delays, cheap oil, and the U.S. elections, the climate of the Keystone XL pipeline is changing.



The midterm elections brought pro‐​pipeline Republicans into control of the Senate and along with a few remaining pro‐​pipeline Democrats there, the stage is set for a filibuster‐​proof Keystone proposal. Some sort of measure to approve the pipeline and supersede a State Department’s decision to scrap it could pass both the House and the Senate and end up on President Obama’s desk sooner rather than later.





While approval of pipeline is not imminent, it may be inching closer.



According to North Dakota Republican Sen. Jon Hoeven, “I think you’re going to see us bring up energy legislation right away and Keystone will be one of the first things we pass.” What the president would do with such legislation it is anyone’s guess, but, there are probably not enough votes in the Senate to overcome a veto.



During the more than six years of political wrangling as the State Department considered TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline proposal, the economics of the project have changed significantly. TransCanada’s president, Russ Girling, in a recent conference call, reported that the estimated cost of building the pipeline will nearly double from $5.4 billion to the most recent estimate of $8 billion. Costs may even reach $10 billion, Girling warned. There is also a shifting responsibility for cost sharing between the shippers and TransCanada, with a greater burden placed on TransCanada if the cost does exceed $8 billion.



In the meantime, TransCanada has been exploring several alternative ways of getting oil from Alberta’s tar sands to market. They have recently proposed an $10.5 billon “Energy East” pipeline—a combination of new pipeline and the conversion of an existing natural gas pipeline to carry heavy crude— that would send the tar sands oil from Alberta to Canada’s Atlantic Coast and then by tanker to the U.S. Gulf refineries, negating the need of State Department approval.



On top of this, the price of a barrel of oil has plummeted in recent months. This sends a mixed message for the Keystone XL. On one hand, a low price is a disincentive to develop new oil projects, while on the other, extraction of a lot of the surface Alberta tar sands oil is pretty cheap, so a low price may favor further development there.



And one last thing—there is still an ongoing case before the Nebraska Supreme Court concerning who had the authority to approve the routing of the Keystone XL pipeline through Nebraska, whether it is the state’s governor or the Public Service Commission. It is not expected to be decided until 2015.



And while the political and economic climate of the pipeline has certainly been changing, one aspect that hasn’t changed is the pipeline’s impact on global climate change. It remains as insignificant as it ever was. A year‐​and‐​a‐​half ago, at the request of Congress, I calculated that the oil that would flow through the Keystone XL pipeline would add less that 1/​100th of a degree to whatever global warming is to come over the course of the rest of this century, and that “Keystone XL’s impact on the climate would be inconsequential and unmeasurable,” I wrote at the time. That conclusion remains true.



So, while approval of pipeline is not imminent, it may be inching closer. But by the time the approval is granted, it may end up being too late, as TransCanada might ship the oil east, or decide that the original pipeline is just too expensive.

Modern industrial society commenced with the use of coal and oil to power factories, trains,
ships and agriculture and to generate electricity. With abundant energy, prosperity increased,
and people could save enough to support leisure, education, culture and environmental
concerns.
But the dark greens have a dream to dismantle all this, and return society to the hunter/gatherer
era.
In an unguarded moment Maurice Strong, a leader of the international green movement, said:
“Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn’t it our
responsibility to bring that about?”
Greens have thus gleefully spread the global warming scare to justify a massive political war on
hydro-carbon fuels. Timothy Wirth, ex-President of the UN Foundation, spilt the beans:
“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is
wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.”
http://carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/exposing-the-green-agenda.pdf
To mask their real aim of de-energising modern industry, they continually promote “alternative
energy”.
The only alternatives to coal, oil and gas for stable, reliable and economical grid power are
nuclear energy, and in favourable locations, hydro or geothermal.
Nuclear power could be one of our cheapest and safest energy sources. However greens have
opposed and denigrated it for decades, and erected such bureaucratic and financial hurdles that
it is seldom considered in most pampered western societies.
They are in favour of hydro, providing it does not disturb one fish or frog on their favourite river.
But they continually spruik the benefits of wind and solar power.
Wind/solar can be useful in some mobile or remote locations, and for some people with deep
pockets who wish to become independent of the grid. But being totally unable to supply 24/7
grid power, they need reliable backup (or massive batteries) for about 75% of their rated
capacity. Once we subtract the energy and resources needed to build and maintain the
towers/panels, plus the roads and transmission lines, plus backup/batteries and then run it all
intermittently, the whole-of-life net-contribution of wind/solar to energy supply or emission
reduction is negligible or negative.
Another dark green leader, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountains Institute, said:
“It would be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap,
abundant energy, because of what we might do with it.”
Green energy policy promotes this dictum by supporting “Nothing that Works”.
The world focus on carbon dioxide is simply a useful tool in a much larger political agenda:

guest post by Jim Steele
published in the Pacific Tribune July 24th 
What’s Natural? 

California’s spectacular coastline attracts tourists from around the world. Headlands of granite or basalt resist erosion, defiantly jutting out into the sea. Pocket beaches form where focused wave energy bites into softer sandstones and uncemented stream sediments. Relentless waves undermine and steepen cliffs bordering 70% of California’s shoreline. Over hundreds and thousands of years, natural erosion sculpted our awe-inspiring undulating coast.
But beauty is in the eye of the beholder – likewise the magnitude of a “coastal crisis”. The Los Angeles Times recently published ‘California coast is disappearing under the rising sea. Our choices are grim’. They inaccurately painted natural erosion as a recent crisis due to CO2 induced climate change. However, California’s erosion “crisis” must be understood within a greater timeframe.
Since the end of the last ice age, sea level has risen 400 feet. Over 18,000 years, San Francisco’s regional coastline marched 25 miles inland, advancing 7 feet a year – more than twice California’s average. My beautiful home town of Pacifica was featured in that Times’ article because it lost several homes unfortunately built on loosely cemented sand and gravel deposited 100,000 years ago when sea level was 20 feet higher. Although the ocean’s landward march has slowed over the past 5000 years, northern Pacifica’s fragile coastline still retreated by over 7 feet per year between 1929 and 1943. Despite a warming world, the average rate of cliff retreat then markedly declined since 1943.

The ill-fated Ocean Shore Railway, initiated in 1905, foreshadowed California’s erosion problems. To give tourists awesome views, tracks were laid on a ledge dug into steep coastal cliffs. But landslides were common, and costly repairs forced the railway to close. Today, only 25% of the railway ledge built by 1928 still exists. Undeterred, designers of California’s scenic Pacific Coast Highway hoped to give automobile travelers similar breath-taking views. Again, landslides were common. Only 38% of the highway constructed by 1956 still remains. Geologists tell us such landslides constantly altered California’s modern coastline for hundreds of years.
There are few straight lines in nature. Our coastlines undulate. Likewise, our climate oscillates, and coasts erode episodically. Between 1976 and 1999 (the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation), California experienced more frequent El Niños. Over 70% of California’s 20th century disappearing coastline eroded during El Niño events. El Niños bring more storms and more destructive waves. El Niños bring more rains that saturate soils and promote landslides. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation then switched to its cool phase. It brought more La Niñas and more drought, but fewer winter storms and less erosion. In 1949, also a time of less erosion, Pacifica’s government believed homes setback 65 feet from the edge of a bluff would be safe. They never suspected a single El Niño event would move the cliff edge 30 feet landward 50 years later.
There are some who see human structures as a blight on California’s natural coastline. In response to natural erosion, they suggest we abandon the coast. They argue California’s only choice is “managed retreat” versus “unmanaged retreat”. Although well engineered seawalls can protect homes and businesses, some environmentalists called seawalls a coastal “crisis”. California’s Coastal Commission recently pledged seawalls will “only be permitted if absolutely necessary”. But the Commission’s policy only fosters a mishmash of emergency fixes. Randomly armored properties deflect destructive waves downstream, accelerating erosion in a neighbor’s unprotected property. Coastal cities must construct well-engineered sea walls, without any gaps.
Because sea walls prevent erosion, the Commission ill-advisedly fears local beaches will be lost if denied locally eroded sand. The Times parroted that belief writing, ‘for every constructed seawall, a beach is sacrificed’. But is that true? San Francisco’s O’Shaughnessy sea wall built in 1929 prevents erosion of the fragile sand dunes supporting Golden Gate Park. Yet SF’s north ocean beach continues to grow. Without a seawall, San Francisco’s south ocean beach rapidly eroded, and threatened infrastructure now requires a sea wall.
Sources of beach sand fluctuate, and simplistic sea wall analyses are very misleading. Sand is stored and transported to beaches in many ways. Streams and rivers supply the most sand needed to nourish a beach, but mining SF bay’s sand has deprived nearby coastal beaches. Furthermore, ocean oscillations shift winds and the direction of currents that transport sand. Beaches grow for decades then suddenly shrink. Although some argue our beaches face a rising sea level “crisis”, archaeologist determined that despite more rapidly rising sea levels 5000 years ago, many California beaches grew when supplied with adequate sand.
Lastly, it’s interesting to note scientists suggested Pacific islands also face an erosion crisis due to rising sea levels. But the latest scientific surveys determined 43% of those islands remained stable while land extent of another 43% has grown. Only 14% of the islands lost land. So, I fear exaggerated crises only erode our trust in science.

There are numerous possible reasons for UN climate chief Yvo de Boer’s decision to resign—from his inability to cobble together a new climate treaty last December in Copenhagen (where he wept on the podium), to recent revelations of his agency’s mishandling of climate change data.   
  
  
What the climate science community and the public should focus on now are the ramifications of de Boer’s resignation. For one thing, it signals that hope is dead for a UN‐​brokered global treaty that would have any meaningful effect on global temperatures. It also means that the UN intends to keep its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pretty much intact under the leadership of the scientifically compromised Rajenda Pauchari, who should have resigned along with de Boer.   
  
  
This development guarantees that the Obama administration will have an unmitigated mess on its hands when signatories to the Framework Convention sit down in Mexico City this November in yet another meeting intended to produce a climate treaty. The Mexico City meeting convenes six days after U.S. midterm elections, in which American voters are fully expected to rebuke Obama for policies including economy‐​crippling proposals to combat climate change.   
  
  
In short, Mexico City is about as likely to produce substantive policy decisions as the TV show ‘The View.’ Backers of radical climate change measures are now paying the price for over two decades of telling the public—in this case literally—that the sky is falling.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
A new paper just hit the scientific literature that argues that the apparent pause in the rise in global average surface temperatures during the past 16 years was really just a slowdown.   
  
  
As you may imagine, this paper, by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way is being hotly discussed in the global warming blogs, with reaction ranging from a warm embrace by the global‐​warming‐​is‐​going‐​to‐​be‐​bad‐​for‐​us crowd to revulsion from the human‐​activities‐​have‐​no‐​effect‐​on‐​the‐​climate claque.   
  
  
The lukewarmers (a school we take some credit for establishing) seem to be taking the results in stride. After all, the “pause” as curious as it is/​was, is not central to the primary argument that, yes, human activities are pressuring the planet to warm, but that the rate of warming is going to be much slower than is being projected by the collection of global climate models (upon which mainstream projections of future climate change—and the resulting climate alarm (i.e., calls for emission regulations, etc.)—are based).   
  
  
Under the adjustments to the observed global temperature history put together by Cowtan and Way, the models fare a bit better than they do with the unadjusted temperature record. That is, the observed temperature trend over the past 34 years (the period of record analyzed by Cowtan and Way) is a tiny bit closer to the average trend from the collection of climate models used in the new report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) than is the old temperature record.   
  
  
Specifically, while the trend in observed global temperatures from 1979–2012 as calculated by Cowtan and Way is 0.17°C/decade, it is 0.16°C/decade in the temperature record compiled by the U.K. Hadley Center (the record that Cowtan and Way adjusted). Because of the sampling errors associated with trend estimation, these values are not significantly different from one another. Whether the 0.17°C/decade is significantly different from the climate model average simulated trend during that period of 0.23°C/decade is discussed extensively below.   
  
  
But, suffice it to say that an insignificant difference of 0.01°C/decade in the global trend measured over more than 30 years is pretty small beer and doesn’t give model apologists very much to get happy over.   
  
  
Instead, the attention is being deflected to “The Pause”—the leveling off of global surface temperatures during the past 16 years (give or take). Here, the new results from Cowtan and Way show that during the period 1997–2012, instead of a statistically insignificant rise at a rate of 0.05°C/decade as is contained in the “old” temperature record, the rise becomes a statistically significant 0.12°C/decade. “The Pause” is transformed into “The Slowdown” and alarmists rejoice because global warming hasn’t stopped after all. (If the logic sounds backwards, it does to us as well, if you were worried about catastrophic global warming, wouldn’t you rejoice at findings that indicate that future climate change was going to be only modest, more so than results to the contrary?)   
  
  
The science behind the new Cowtan and Way research is still being digested by the community of climate scientists and other interested parties alike. The main idea is that the existing compilations of the global average temperature are very data‐​sparse in the high latitudes. And since the Arctic (more so than the Antarctic) is warming faster than the global average, the lack of data there may mean that the global average temperature trend may be underestimated. Cowtan and Way developed a methodology which relied on other limited sources of temperature information from the Arctic (such as floating buoys and satellite observations) to try to make an estimate of how the surface temperature was behaving in regions lacking more traditional temperature observations (the authors released an informative video explaining their research which may better help you understand what they did). They found that the warming in the data‐​sparse regions was progressing faster than the global average (especially during the past couple of years) and that when they included the data that they derived for these regions in the computation of the global average temperature, they found the global trend was higher than previously reported—just how much higher depended on the period over which the trend was calculated. As we showed, the trend more than doubled over the period from 1997–2012, but barely increased at all over the longer period 1979–2012.   
  
  
Figure 1 shows the impact on the global average temperature trend for all trend lengths between 10 and 35 years (incorporating our educated guess as to what the 2013 temperature anomaly will be), and compares that to the distribution of climate model simulations of the same period. Statistically speaking, instead of there being a clear inconsistency (i.e., the observed trend value falls outside of the range which encompasses 95% of all modeled trends) between the observations and the climate mode simulations for lengths ranging generally from 11 to 28 years and a marginal inconsistency (i.e., the observed trend value falls outside of the range which encompasses 90% of all modeled trends) for most of the other lengths, now the observations track closely the marginal inconsistency line, although trends of length 17, 19, 20, 21 remain clearly inconsistent with the collection of modeled trends. Still, throughout the _entirely_ of the 35‐​yr period (ending in 2013), the observed trend lies far below the model average simulated trend (additional information on the impact of the new Cowtan and Way adjustments on modeled/​observed temperature comparison can be found here).   






  
  
  
_Figure 1. Temperature trends ranging in length from 10 to 35 years (ending in a preliminary 2013) calculated using the data from the U.K. Hadley Center (blue dots), the adjustments to the U.K. Hadley Center data made by Cowtan and Way (red dots) extrapolated through 2013, and the average of climate model simulations (black dots). The range that encompasses 90% (light grey lines) and 95% (dotted black lines) of climate model trends is also included._   
  
  
The Cowtan and Way analysis is an attempt at using additional types of temperature information, or extracting “information” from records that have already told their stories, to fill in the missing data in the Arctic. There are concerns about the appropriateness of both the data sources and the methodologies applied to them.   
  
  
A major one is in the applicability of satellite data at such high latitudes. The nature of the satellite’s orbit forces it to look “sideways” in order to sample polar regions. In fact, the orbit is such that the highest latitude areas cannot be seen at all. This is compounded by the fact that cold regions can develop substantial “inversions” of near‐​ground temperature, in which temperature actually rises with height such that there is not a straightforward relationship between the surface temperature and the temperature of the lower atmosphere where the satellites measure the temperature. If the nature of this complex relationship is not constant in time, an error is introduced into the Cowtan and Way analysis.   
  
  
Another unresolved problem comes up when extrapolating land‐​based weather station data far into the Arctic Ocean. While land temperatures can bounce around a lot, the fact that much of the ocean is partially ice‐​covered for many months. Under “well‐​mixed” conditions, this forces the near‐​surface temperature to be constrained to values near the freezing point of salt water, whether or not the associated land station is much warmer or colder.   
  
  
You can run this experiment yourself by filling a glass with a mix of ice and water and then making sure it is well mixed. The water surface temperature must hover around 33°F until all the ice melts. Given that the near‐​surface temperature is close to the water temperature, the limitations of land data become obvious.   
  
  
Considering all of the above, we advise caution with regard to Cowtan and Way’s findings. While adding high arctic data should increase the observed trend, the nature of the data means that the amount of additional rise is subject to further revision. As they themselves note, there’s quite a bit more work to be done this area.   
  
  
In the meantime, their results have tentatively breathed a small hint of life back into the climate models, basically buying them a bit more time—time for either the observed temperatures to start rising rapidly as current models expect, or, time for the modelers to try to fix/​improve cloud processes, oceanic processes, and other process of variability (both natural and anthropogenic) that lie behind what would be the clearly overheated projections.   
  
  
We’ve also taken a look at how “sensitive” the results are to the length of the ongoing pause/​slowdown. Our educated guess is that the “bit” of time that the Cowtan and Way findings bought the models is only a few years long, and it is a fact, not a guess, that each additional year at the current rate of lukewarming increases the disconnection between the models and reality.

From CFACT
By CFACT |August 27th, 2019|Environment
How does the United Nations convince people that they are super serious in their outrage about fossil fuels? How about flying 4,000 people from all over the world in fossil-fueled jet airplanes to isolated Salt Lake City to whine about it? Sounds like a good plan to the United Nations bureaucracy, which is sponsoring a sustainability and climate change conference this week in Salt Lake City.
The UN brags that up to 4,000 people are likely to attend, representing more 300 nongovernmental organizations (read, environmental activist groups) and more than 80 countries. There is no compelling agenda, no compelling actions items, and no expected meaningful outcome from the conference. It is simply an opportunity for leftist global activists to get together and express outrage about economic freedom and the existential global climate disruption that is the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced – surpassing Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, the Black Plague, smallpox, AIDS, and the threat of nuclear war combined.
Salt Lake City is an isolated, medium-sized city with little national or international media impact. Most people flying to Salt Lake City for the UN conference will have to make at least one or two connecting flights to get there, exacerbating their carbon footprint for the conference. Why didn’t the UN choose New York or Brussels for such a conference? Because, silly, UN bureaucrats get tired of New York and Brussels and want to go someplace really cool and fun for their events. Carbon footprint, shmarbon footprint.
Seriously, now, if global warming is the greatest existential threat facing humanity, as the UN and Democratic presidential hopefuls claim, why would the UN induce 4,000 people to carbon-bomb the atmosphere with 4,000 multi-leg, roundtrip flights to whine about it? Almost nobody (other than us wonks here at CFACT) really cares or will be paying attention to the conference. Couldn’t they hold the conference at UN facilities in New York or Brussels? Or better yet, couldn’t the conference can be held online for a much lower carbon footprint?
The truth is, Salt Lake City is a beautiful place. There are breathtaking mountains all around. Posh Park City is just a 20-minute drive away. Environmental leftists may even catch a glimpse of part-time nearby resident Robert Redford. Holding the conference in Salt Lake City is an opportunity for the self-righteous environmental left to travel to a gorgeous city, take a nice vacation at taxpayer or employer expense, and all the while compliment each other on how they really CARE about climate change. All while carbon-bombing the atmosphere in order to travel there.
Makes you wonder just how existential they believe their contrived climate crisis truly is….

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is  here.On September 4,  2019, the CBC posted an online article written by Andrew Leach that claimed that “some politicians and industry representatives” are misrepresenting the real issues facing the oil sands sector. I have seen no public response from the real experts in the Canadian oil industry, leading me to wonder (for the thousandth time) why the industry  refuses publicly to defend itself against its detractors. Failing that, and acknowledging that my knowledge is that of an outsider (like Mr. Leach), I would like to provide some factual and contextual information that calls some of his conclusions into question. Andrew Leach argued that the Canadian oil sands are affected by four main “issues”: The sustained decline in global crude oil price outlooks since 2014Constrained market access and the related uncertaintyThe global reduction in oil investment and the shift toward short-cycle investmentsClimate change “pressures”; specifically, the alleged movement to global decarbonization Let us examine each one of these. Crude Oil OutlookLeach observes, correctly, that oil sands investment is based less on what oil prices are today than on what they are expected to be over the life of the project. He notes that international oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and that the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has reduced its long-term forecast of crude oil prices in 2040 from US $230 per barrel to US $165 per barrel. So far, so good, except that he forgot to mention a few things about crude oil markets. One is that global crude oil demand is rising. In fact, since 2012, global crude oil demand has risen at the annual average rate of over one million barrels per day per year. This is the fastest and most sustained period of growth in history. In 2019, global oil demand is over 100 million barrels per day, its highest level in history. According to the EIA and other major sources of oil market analysis, that growth will not end any time soon, although it may slow due to global economic trends. Second, no one knows or ever has known with any confidence where international crude oil prices are heading. This much must be obvious to anyone who has followed trends in prices since 1973.  Too much is unknown on both the supply and demand sides. Since 2015, there has been a decline in global investment in upstream oil and gas. According to the International Energy Agency[1], actual investment declined from about US $820 billion in 2014 to about US $450 billion in 2016, before slightly increasing to about US $480 billion in 2018. Even though upstream industry costs have also declined, the reduction in prices has very much affected investment in both conventional and unconventional oil and gas exploration and development, except for oil shale development, and that mainly in the United States. The reduced investment in conventional and unconventional supply development, however, carries a risk, also noted by the IEA. The risk (or opportunity, depending on one’s perspective) is that, with continuing rapid growth in oil and natural gas demand, the world may well enter a period in the 2020’s when demand exceeds the available supply, and the imbalance causes a sharp upward spike in oil prices. Prices will almost certainly rise from today’s levels, but no one knows how far or how fast. Volatility breeds volatility. Constrained Market AccessAndrew Leach acknowledges that lack of pipeline access has affected confidence in Canadian oil sands investments. He neglects to mention that it has also sharply reduced the returns to producers and to provincial governments. Both the Fraser Institute and the Royal Bank of Canada estimated that lack of pipeline access cost Canadian oil producers over $20 billion in 2018. He wrote that, “It’s an open question what industry or political leaders can do to get pipeline built.” Really? Does he forget that the Trudeau government, through its political and regulatory decisions, killed the Northern Gateway Pipeline Project and the Energy East Pipeline Project and has added years of delay to the review of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project? Has he not heard of Bill C-69, that ended the longstanding independent and professional review of pipeline proposals by the National Energy Board and instituted in its place a two-part review, the first element of which will be a “review in principle” based on partisan considerations? Did he miss the statement by the Commission that recommended the changes to the NEB Act that, during the first phase review, climate policy and aboriginal “reconciliation” considerations should be preeminent? Perhaps he forgot to read the recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, in Raincoast Conservation Foundation v. Canada (Attorney General). Faced with claims that, among other things, the federal government had failed to consult adequately, the Government of Canada took no position for or against the motions of the project opponents, and offered no evidence, leaving Justice Stratas with no option but to conclude that the legal analysis could proceed no further.[2] If Andrew Leach had been paying attention, he would know very well that there is much that the Trudeau government could have done to get pipelines built, and it has consistently failed to do so. In passing, Andrew Leach casts doubt on claims that carbon prices are “at fault” in the declining investment rates in oil sands. For this, he offers as evidence that Suncor had average costs of 20 cents per barrel from “carbon policies in Alberta”, and that under the Alberta regime an oil sands plant could potentially “see revenues, not costs” from the sale of carbon credits. There are a few points he neglected to mention, the most important of which is that, as he noted at the start, it is long-term costs as well as prices that determine investment intentions. The carbon tax rate in Alberta is now $30 per tonne, but it will rise to $50 per tonne by 2022 under the federal backstop regime, and (contrary to Minister McKenna’s statements) is almost certainly going to rise to over $100 per tonne by 2030, assuming a continuation of present policies. Oil producers in other countries will not face those costs. Further, the potential to earn carbon credits, under the federal output-based pricing system, depends on a plant having the ability to reduce emissions intensity to lower than the rate prescribed by Environment and Climate Chance Canada; there are no guarantees that oil sands firms will benefit from such credits. Global Investment TrendsAndrew Leach notes correctly that, as oil prices have declined, investment has shifted towards projects with shorter life cycles, and this is bad news for capital intensive and long-cycle oil sands projects. Unfortunately, he does not add much context. That context is provided by the previously-referenced IEA World Energy Investment 2019 report. Notably, it found: “Energy supply spending has shifted broadly towards projects with shorter lead times, partly reflecting investor preferences for better managing capital at risk amid uncertainties over the future direction of the energy system.”In 2018, “a 4% rise in upstream oil and gas spending was underpinned by a higher oil price, and a shift to shorter-cycle projects and shale. Spending plans for 2019 point to a potential new wave of conventional projects; for the moment, project approvals are below the level needed to match robust demand.”Capital costs in upstream oil and gas are about 19% below where they were in 2010, on an inflation-adjusted basis.The main upstream investment trend since 2014 has been a shift in spending towards shale (tight oil and shale gas) in the United States. The signs in 2019 are that the fastest growth in upstream investment will be in conventional projects rather than in shale.“The oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on assets that generate cash flow more quickly but also that deplete at a more rapid pace. This could increase the possibility of market volatility.”Since mid-2016, the majors have enhanced their financial conditions due to a combination of higher oil prices, improvements in operational efficiency and cost reductions. In 2018, free cash flow reached almost US $90 billion, a level not seen since 2008. Thus, while there has been a shift towards shorter-cycle investments, the oil industry is sitting on a very large cash balance available to invest once the “future direction of the energy system” becomes clearer. Climate Policy “Pressures” and DecarbonizationAndrew Leach quotes from Shell’s 2018 Sustainability Report as though it were indicative of the intentions of the international petroleum industry. He also cites the views of the Carbon Disclosure Project, an environmental group that seeks, in effect, to bully institutional investors and shareholders in fossil fuel companies to change their investment habits. There is no question that there is a well-funded international campaign, partly backed by influential financial institutions, to discourage investment in the oil and gas industry. Is it working? I recently wrote an article on this subject, which interested readers can see here: https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/03/bullying-institutional-investors-does-it-work/ The more fundamental and empirically-testable thesis is whether the world is “decarbonizing” at the rate advocated by those who claim that humans are causing catastrophic global warming. Using the data from the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 2019 and the United Nations, we know that: In 2018, fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) constituted 84% of global primary energy demand.The share held by fossil fuels has declined at the rate of 1% per decade since 1990.Despite trillions of dollars in government subsidies and mandated ratepayer costs, renewable energy constitutes only 4% of global primary energy demand.Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy use rose by 3.4 billion tonnes per year from 2008 to 2018. Emissions grew by 2% in 2018, double the annual average rate of the previous decade.The non-OECD (i.e. developing) countries produced all of the emissions growth. By 2018, they produced 63% of the global total.The ten largest emitters in the world, in order, are: China, the United States, the European Union, India, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. None of the largest emitters, except the EU, is on track to meet the emissions targets they set for themselves for 2030.  This makes it highly likely that global emissions in 2030 will be well above, not below, those today. In other words, based on current trends, the UN’s goals will not be met. There is no “global decarbonization transition” occurring, at least not in the timeframe that the advocates favour. ConclusionThe “uncertainties about the future direction of the global energy system’ that are impairing investment in Canada’s oil sands are not primarily driven by market trends. They are driven by the undue political influence of decarbonization advocates, who are prepared to sacrifice economic prosperity to suit their vision of how fast the world’s energy system should change. The facts show that the energy consumers of the world are not following that vision, but it does not prevent the advocates from doing great harm to one of Canada’s most important resource industries. It is unfortunate when Canadian journalists, and the national broadcaster, act as apologists for decarbonization advocates, rather than supporters of Canada’s economy.~~~~[1] World Energy Investment 2019, International Energy Agency, Paris.[2] Arend Hoekstra and Thomas Isaac, Was Canada’s Defence in Raincoast Conservation v.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo European professors recently wrote that the IPCC projections of future warming are based on huge unknowns, and do not take the past properly into account.
This means that projections of the future of the world’s climate are unreliable, according to Samuel Furfari, Professor at the Free University of Brussels,
and Henri Masson, Professor (Emeritus), University of Antwerpen.
According to the two professors, the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) is an estimate of global surface temperature change (one that is often used by climate scientists for their reports to the media). 

This estimate is computed using data files from NOAA GHCN v4 (meteorological stations), and ERSST v5 (ocean areas). In June 2019, the number of terrestrial stations was 8781 in the GHCNv4 unadjusted dataset; but in June 1880, that figure was a mere 281 stations, the two professors write.
Scientists ignoring climate’s cyclic features
Professors Furfari and Masson write: “The climate system, and the way IPCC represents it, is highly sensitive to tiny changes in the value of parameters or initial conditions and these must be known with high accuracy. But this is not the case.”
In other words, the IPCC method is fraught with great uncertainties and much guesswork.
“This puts serious doubt on whatever conclusion that could be drawn from model projections,” the two professors write.
Open door to “fake conclusions”… “manipulations”

Masson and Furfari say that IPCC scientists ignore that climate change occurs with cyclic behavior and that linear trend lines applied to (poly-)cyclic data of period similar to the length of the time window considered, open the door to any kind of fake conclusions, if not manipulations aimed to push one political agenda or another.
Sea surface temperature incomplete
Other factors also cast doubt over the reliability of climate models, among them the lack of data on sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The oceans represent about 70% of the Earth surface.

Sea surface temperature measurement and their (non) representativity. 
“Until very recently, these temperatures have been only scarcely reported, as the data for SST (Sea Surface Temperature) came from vessels following a limited number of commercial routes,” report Masson and Furfari.
Such gaping data holes make it impossible to correctly calibrate models, and so that they are able to project the future climate. Scientists in many cases are simply free to guess whatever they want.
Masson’s and Furfari’s conclusions follow:

IPCC projections result from mathematical models which need to be calibrated by making use of data from the past. The accuracy of the calibration data is of paramount importance, as the climate system is highly non-linear, and this is also the case for the (Navier-Stokes) equations and (Runge-Kutta integration) algorithms used in the IPCC computer models. Consequently, the system and also the way IPCC represent it, are highly sensitive to tiny changes in the value of parameters or initial conditions (the calibration data in the present case), that must be known with high accuracy. This is not the case, putting serious doubt on whatever conclusion that could be drawn from model projections.
Most of the mainstream climate related data used by IPCC are indeed generated from meteo data collected at land meteo stations. This has two consequences:
(i) The spatial coverage of the data is highly questionable, as the temperature over the oceans, representing 70% of the Earth surface, is mostly neglected or “guestimated” by interpolation;
(ii) The number and location of theses land meteo stations has considerably changed over time, inducing biases and fake trends.
The key indicator used by IPCC is the global temperature anomaly, obtained by spatially averaging, as well as possible, local anomalies. Local anomalies are the comparison of present local temperature to the averaged local temperature calculated over a previous fixed reference period of 30 years, changing each 30 years (1930-1960, 1960-1990, etc.). The concept of local anomaly is highly questionable, due to the presence of poly-cyclic components in the temperature data, inducing considerable biases and false trends when the “measurement window” is shorter than at least 6 times the longest period detectable in the data; which is unfortunately the case with temperature data
Linear trend lines applied to (poly-)cyclic data of period similar to the length of the time window considered, open the door to any kind of fake conclusions, if not manipulations aimed to push one political agenda or another.
Consequently, it is highly recommended to abandon the concept of global temperature anomaly and to focus on unbiased local meteo data to detect an eventual change in the local climate, which is a physically meaningful concept, and which is after all what is really of importance for local people, agriculture, industry, services, business, health and welfare in general.

A few days ago we looked at the Antarctic peninsula stations and saw that over the past 2 decades 13 of 13 of these stations showed cooling trends.
Today we look at 12 stations located at the eastern side of Antarctica, where temperatures are colder:

Below the stations’ data from NASA are plotted going back 2 decades, to 1998:

As the data reveals, 7 of 12 stations have a cooling or no warming trend at all.
Once again NASA’s own data show there’s nothing to be alarmed about in Antarctica.
My hometown has been cooling in January
In Tokyo, where I live, the mean temperature for January, 2020, has just been released by the JMA: 7.1°C. Tokyo has seen a cooling trend from 1985 to 2020 for January.

Darling Jacinda. She has never met a high horse she cannot preach from, and she never misses an opportunity to insult our closest neighbours. Doing her bit for the planet by wearing the same dreadful boots that she has worn for the past 2 years has given Jacinda the right to lecture the Australians about climate change, even though her own carbon footprint has been truly woeful lately. Our record on climate change is not that great, Jacinda and in case you didn’t know, we still sell coal to China.



But there is nothing like the hypocrisy of the left, is there?



Foreign Minister Winston Peters has moved to take the heat out of [Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s challenge to Australia on climate change](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/115010777/australia-has-to-answer-to-the-pacific-on-climate-change-pm-ardern), and says Pacific nations which seek Chinese investment should remember it comes on the back of “coal-fired everything”.



Peters said calls for Australia to step-up on climate change were a “bit of a paradox” because many Pacific countries were not openly challenging China’s reliance on coal.



Australia has come under fire from some leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum for what they say is a lack of [action on climate change](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/114945676/new-zealand-must-listen-to-pacific-voice-on-the-climate-crisis) and tardiness to shift away coal-fired power.



It is amazing how easy targets are always hit. Scott Morrison is the first Australian premier to go to the Pacific Islands Forum for 35 years. He will probably be the last for the next 200 years. But nobody ever tackles China, who are the biggest emitters in the world by a country mile because everyone is too afraid to go there.



The New Zealand prime minister said **on Wednesday**[ **every nation needed to “do its bit” in the fight against climate change**](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/115010777/australia-has-to-answer-to-the-pacific-on-climate-change-pm-ardern) **, and Australia would have to “answer to the Pacific” for its own role.**



Just a thought, but if you want Australia to stop sending our criminals home might you not consider being slightly more diplomatic?



No. Of course not.



Speaking on ABC radio on Thursday morning, Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, said there was “a big picture we have to contemplate” to act with consistency and integrity.



He said while island nations were worried about their long-term future amid rising sea levels and more fierce weather events, China’s high emissions also had to be part of the conversation.



“ **You need to look at everybody, not just Australia, but also who is getting that coal and what things they are doing with it,” Peters said.**



 **Finally, someone has said it.** Let us stop picking on those countries who will probably keep footing the bill anyway and point out the bleeding obvious. Unless emissions from China and India are reduced dramatically, the world will go to hell in a handcart (if it is actually going to hell in a handcart, but for the purposes of this discussion.. it is) regardless of anything that either New Zealand or Australia manages to do.



“What I’m sadly hearing is variations on a theme … that they’re all attacking the Australian Prime Minister or that they’ve all taken the view, including New Zealand’s Prime Minister, that the Australians are somehow acting incorrectly when that is not the proper picture or the real picture at all.”



Australia has pushed back on attempts from smaller island states to include a strong statement urging the world to speed up its transition away from coal towards renewable energy.



 **Peters said leaders meeting in Tuvalu must “look at all the details” and defended Australia’s stance on climate change.**



Most of you know that **I am no Winston Peters fan, but he is completely right on this.** He is bringing a harsh dose of reality into the game, and he is also trying to pour oil on the rapidly becoming very troubled waters of the Pacific Islands. If they upset the Australians too much, then they just might tell all the other Pacific nations to go… find themselves. That includes New Zealand, in case you didn’t know.



He said the island countries should remember Australia was a “great neighbour” to the Pacific.



 **“They should remember who has been their long-term and short-term friends,” he said.**



I completely agree, Winston. As Foreign Minister, you are absolutely right to make this call. I just wish you had not brought this bunch of amateurs into government because I am almost certain that even you did not expect them to be as incompetent as they obviously are.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNormally the UN General Assembly is no place for hysterical activists to blow off their anger, aggression, threats  and doomsday fantasies. 
In a letter to Secretary General Guterres, 500 scientists are now requesting that the UN end the hysteria and return to rational dialogue.
===============================================================
There is no climate crisis
An open letter to the UN Secretary General

António Guterres, Secretary-General. Photo: UN.
More than 500 prominent scientists from all over the world, among them distinguished MIT climate scientist Prof. Richard Lindzen, are urging the Secretary-General of the United Nations for a further, de-politicised discussion of the climate issue, in which alternative scientific views are also given a voice.
A UN climate meeting will be held in New York on 23 September. To this end, CLINTEL has sent two registered letters, one to the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, and one to the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, together with the text of the European Climate Declaration (see below).
This also includes the explicit request to organise a joint meeting with world-class scientists. The letter follows:


Your Excellencies,
There is no climate emergency
A global network of more than 500 knowledgeable and experienced scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have the honor to address to Your Excellencies the attached European Climate Declaration, for which the signatories to this letter are the national ambassadors.
The general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is at present founded are unfit for their purpose. Therefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models. Current climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power.
We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation.
We ask you to place the Declaration on the agenda of your imminent New York session.
We also invite you to organize with us a constructive high-level meeting between world-class scientists on both sides of the climate debate early in 2020. The meeting will give effect to the sound and ancient principle no less of sound science than of natural justice that both sides should be fully and fairly heard. Audiatur et altera pars!
Please let us know your thoughts about such a joint meeting.
There is no climate emergency
A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message. Climate science should be less political, while climate polities should be more scientific. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.
Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming
The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming. Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.
Warming is far slower than predicted
The world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance. It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change.
Climate policy relies on inadequate models

Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools. Moreover, they most likely exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial.
CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth
CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crop worldwide.
Global warming has not increased natural disasters
There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.
Policy must respect scientific and economic realities
There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world.
Our advice to political leaders is that science should strive for a significantly better understanding of the climate system, while politics should focus on minimizing potential climate damage by prioritizing adaptation strategies based on proven and affordable technologies.

The definition of climate is the weather conditions prevailing in an area in general or over a long period. The definition of an emergency is a sudden, urgent, usually unexpected occurrence or occasion requiring immediate action.



The synergy produced from putting climate and emergency together creates a whole new beast, rather like breeding a domestic cat with a wild cat to produce a lion – it’s nonsense.  




The BBC fails to define climate emergency saying, “ **there is no single definition** , but many areas say **[they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47570654)”.**



Scientists computer-modelled future man-made carbon dioxide levels and predicted life would be unsustainable in 2, 10, 12 or 20 years. Because they keep changing the drop-dead date you can take your pick, but the damage was done and worldwide panic and hysteria ensued. 



But are the global warming scientists right? Or, to steal a phrase from Uncle Joe Biden, did climate change zealots “choose truth over facts” when scientists disagree over man-made global warming? 



“Most people were taken in by the **false story of human-caused global warming**. We can include all the students participating in the classroom walkout to demand governments stop climate change, organized by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. Her goal is to keep global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Apparently, she has no idea that the temperature was near or above that level for most of the last 10,000-years in a period known as the Holocene Optimum. 



They are taken in by the **false claim that a minute amount of human-produced CO2 is effectively controlling the entire atmospheric system since 1950** and causing environmental collapse through global warming. 



They don’t know that there is an upper limit to the amount that CO2 can increase temperature. They don’t know that the average level of CO2 over the last 250 million years is 1200 ppm. **They don’t know that every projection of temperature by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 1990 was wrong.** To paraphrase Winston Churchill, how did so few, fool so many, to such an extent, for so long?”



Our virtue-signalling government went one better than Greta Thunberg by setting our goal to keep temperatures no more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and it didn’t take long for local bodies to jump on board. The Otago Regional Council is the latest. 



**“The Otago Regional Council will today decide whether to declare a climate emergency.**



**However, the decision was unlikely to affect its work programme, staff said**.



Councillors will vote on the declaration at a meeting in Dunedin, **after members of the public asked it to at a public forum last month.**



If it did declare an emergency, it would follow the examples of other councils including the **DUNEDIN** **City Council, Auckland Council, Wellington City Council, Whangarei District Council, Nelson City Council and Environment Canterbury.** “



But how can this be a climate emergency if there is no urgent need for the council to change their work programmes?



We get one shot every four years to get rid of virtue-signalling councillors and instead vote in sensible people who want to work for their community. We need to use these elections to weed out the troughers and bring in new blood who will stand up to this nonsense.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
We hear that there is looming banana crisis in Costa Rica—the world’s 2nd leading exporter of the fruit—as this year’s crop is being threatened by an infestation of mealybugs, scale insects, and fungal infection.   
  
  
Petulance, plagues, disease? It must be climate change, of course!   
  
  
The Director of the Costa Rican Agriculture and Livestock Ministry’s State Phytosanitary Services, Magda González, told the San José _Tico Times_, “Climate change, by affecting temperature, favors the conditions under which [the insects] reproduce.” González estimated that the rising temperature and concomitant changes in precipitation patterns could shorten the reproduction cycle of the insect pests by a third. “I can tell you with near certainty that climate change is behind these pests.”   
  
  
This _is_ bananas.   
  
  
But there’s a method to Gonzalez’ madness. In it’s recent Warsaw confab on climate change, the UN has made it abundantly clear that one of its endgames is compelling “reparations” for climate damages cost by dreaded emissions of carbon dioxide. The more that poorer nations make these claims—however fatuously—the more momentum builds to extract capital from me and thee.   
  
  
May we humbly suggest that calling Ms. Gonzalez’ claim “fatuous” is really being too nice. She should actually propose compensating the United States for all the excess bananas that are associated with warmer temperatures.   
  
  
Figure 1 shows banana production in Costa Rica from 1961–2011. Figure 2 shows the temperatures there over the same period. We hate to burst anyone’s climate‐​change‐​is bad‐​bubble, but the correlation between these two variables is _positive_. That is, higher temperatures are associated with greater banana production (and yield).   
  
  
  




  
  
  
_Figure 1. Annual production (tonnes) and yield (Hg/​Ha) of bananas in Costa Rica (data fromFAOSTAT)_   






  
  
  
_Figure 2. Annual temperature anomalies in Costa Rica, 1961–2011 (data from Berkeley Earth)._   
  
  
And as far as precipitation goes, the trends down there are all over the place—some stations show trends towards increasing rainfall amounts, while others nearby, towards decreasing amounts. The geography of the country, along with all sorts of external influences including tropical cyclone activity, sea surface temperature patterns, and larger‐​scale circulation systems in both the Pacific and Atlantic makes for a very complex pattern precipitation variability, both temporally and spatially, across Costa Rica. It is virtually impossible to assess the influence of recent human‐​caused climate change in such a complicated and highly variable natural system.   
  
  
So you have a situation where annual precipitation variability is high and where warmer conditions seem to be associated with greater banana yields.   
  
  
While it is probably not out completely out of the question that some sort of weather influence may, in part, play some role in the current affliction of the Costa Rica banana crop, to implicate human‐​caused global warming, you’d have to have gone completely…, well, you know.   
  
  
But climate policy has always functioned best in a data‐​free environment, about the only way a cheap hustle like that of the Costa Rican National Phytosanitariest merits any attention at all.

"  Donald J. Trump arrived at 1 World Trade Center a little before 10 a. m. on Friday to face some of his harshest critics in New York: top editors and digital directors of Condé Nast’s stable of magazines, among them Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and Vogue. According to a tweet by Mr. Trump, he had been invited by Anna Wintour, Condé Nast’s artistic director and the editor of Vogue. Also in attendance were Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, who has sparred with Mr. Trump since his days as an editor at Spy magazine in the 1980s, and David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, who is an expert on Russia. They have been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal detractors, along with the writers at Teen Vogue. The meeting, held in a conference room on the 42nd floor with a view of New Jersey, lasted barely an hour. In answering questions from editors, Mr. Trump addressed health care, climate change, relations with Russia, women’s issues and abortion rights. Mr. Trump mostly reiterated plans or policies he has discussed publicly for months, according to two people who were apprised of the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to talk. When asked about health care, for instance, he told the group that he did not want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act until he had another plan in place, one of the people said. Several editors contacted declined to discuss the meeting, which was off the record. “Not my preference,” Mr. Carter wrote in an email. “But I will abide by that. ” A Condé Nast spokesman declined to comment. Ms. Wintour visited Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in   after she had criticized the Trump Foundation and suggested that Mr. Trump and his family would personally profit from his time in the White House. Ms. Wintour, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, later apologized for the comments. Mr. Trump was photographed entering Condé Nast’s headquarters alongside Michael Flynn, his choice to be national security adviser. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, and Kellyanne Conway, his incoming counselor, were also there. Hilary Rosen, a political strategist for SKD Knickerbocker in Washington, said all of Condé Nast’s brands have had a relationship with presidential families over the years. “It is a rich opportunity for content,” she said. Michelle Obama has been on the cover of Vogue, for example. At the same, Ms. Rosen added, “It’s not like their progressive agenda is going to have an impact on Trump. ” Ms. Rosen, who had close ties to the Clinton campaign, characterized Mr. Trump’s meetings with media outlets as “nothing more than an attempt by his team’s part to take the horns off. ” In a phone interview on Friday night, Ms. Conway declined to discuss the substance of the meeting, but said it was an opportunity for Mr. Trump to “connect with the media. ” She added that “no consideration was given to image. ” In December, Mr. Trump criticized Vanity Fair on Twitter after the magazine gave the restaurant in Trump Tower a bad review. Subscription sales have soared in the wake of Mr. Trump’s criticism, the magazine said. And Vanity Fair printed his tweet on its latest cover."

Politico struggling valiantly to see the bad side of longer growing seasons, more abundant crops and a vast wealth of newly accessible resources.
How Russia and China are preparing to exploit a warming planetPOLITICO’s latest Global Translations podcast explores how climate change is reshaping power dynamics among America’s adversaries.By LUIZA CH. SAVAGE 08/29/2019 05:11 AM EDTHurricanes, floods, and wildfires aside, climate change is delivering another threat: a remaking of geopolitics that stands to empower some of America’s adversaries and rivals.As Arctic ice melts, Russia stands to gain access to oil and gas fields historically locked beneath northern ice — and is building up capability to launch cruise missiles from newly navigable waters to threaten America’s coastlines.As polar seaways open up, China is eyeing a new “Polar Silk Road” — shorter shipping routes that could cut weeks off of shipping times from Asia to Europe.And as drought drives more farmers and herders off their lands, extremist groups in Africa and the Middle East are finding fresh recruits.…A global quest for resources is already underway in the Arctic, said Goodman, now a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center Polar Institute. “There are thought to be vast stores of fossil fuels, oil and gas and minerals across the Arctic that have not yet been tapped. Russia is doing so today across its vast Arctic coastline with the help of China,” she said.Russia is vying for control of Arctic seaways and has built some 40 icebreakers — ships that can channel through ice. “Russia envisions under Putin a northern sea route that is essentially a toll road that requires Russian Arctic escorts in the form of icebreakers or other patrol boats, escorting not only the Chinese but others who want to ship across the Arctic,” she said. By contrast, the U.S. has only two icebreakers, she said. Meanwhile, China, which is not a polar country, has launched aggressive Arctic diplomacy and gained non-voting observer status for itself at the Arctic Council, the international forum that addresses policy in the Arctic. Last year, China issued its first arctic policy.…Read more: https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/29/russia-china-climate-change-1691698
The Politico article goes on to rehash old CO2 bogeymen like “reduced nutrition” in faster growing CO2 enhanced crops (tell that to all the greenhouse growers who use enhanced CO2 right now).
But the question which really struck me when reading the Politico article – why isn’t the USA in this picture?
By my rough estimate Russia has around 40 icebreakers, around 13 which are nuclear powered. 
The USA has around three icebreakers in service or about to go into service.
With this level of Arctic commitment, the USA might as well erect a big sign in Chinese and Russian which says “all yours, help yourselves”. Any reasonable reading of the situation would be that the USA doesn’t care about what happens in the Arctic.
A share of all this treasure is there for the taking; all USA has to do is demonstrate they take the Arctic seriously.
Correction: (h/t Bear) replaced “shorter growing seasons” with “longer growing seasons” in the first paragraph.

"**Christmas celebrations in the UK often centre on food, drink and family gatherings, but campaigners warn that the party season can place additional strain on those living with eating disorders.**
""It's tricky even years down the line to watch the happiness and festivities at Christmas,"" says Katie Scott, 21, who is in recovery from an eating disorder.
""I have always loved [the time of year] - I love the food, I love being with my family. But now it's difficult because of the eating disorder.""
She adds: ""No matter how hard I try or want it to be carefree or eating-disorder free I know that it can't be - it's bittersweet.""
Her comments come as new guidance is published to help those living with eating disorders over the festive season.
Katie first became unwell at the age of 14, restricting her food intake and falling into depression. She was initially diagnosed with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), and later with anorexia aged 16.
She describes her first diagnosis as the beginning of a ""long and ongoing struggle"" with eating and her weight, mood and self-harm, straining her relationships with her family and friends.
""It left me feeling desperate and isolated,"" she says. ""It was a life-threatening situation.""
Katie dropped out of school for periods of time, undergoing inpatient treatment. She was finally discharged from hospital aged 18, joining the year below her at school to finish her education before going to university.
""I had to rebuild my life from rock bottom,"" she says.
Katie explains that she has found Christmas ""an especially difficult time"" both while unwell and in recovery, often feeling unable to get fully involved with the festivities.
""The celebrations are obviously very focused around food,"" she says. ""I love food, but I'm scared of it so I have this contradiction - the fear factor.
""I've found Christmas quite hard to deal with in the past because I wanted to look forward to it, but all of the elements that I love [about it] became stressful and scary.""
She adds: ""I think anorexia might be an extreme version of losing the magic of Christmas. It's still a lovely time of year but it's not quite the same.
""I kid myself each year that it will be but it's never as easy as it was before. It can be disappointing.""
The charity Beat estimates 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder, with anorexia known to have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.
The NHS and eating disorder charity Beat have published new guidance on how to support people with eating disorders and their families at Christmas.
The advice aims to help friends and family of those of any age with such an illness navigate the festive period - while continuing to manage a condition.
Some of the suggested techniques, based on experience from clinicians, patients and parents, include:
For Katie, planning the structure of the day is key, including what she will do if she is feeling stressed - whether that is stepping outside or going for a walk.
She also advises finding someone to confide in. ""Try and have one person who is at least aware that you might struggle,"" she says.
Beat has also published advice on how to spot the signs of an eating disorder on its website.
Katie says the Christmas period can also be a hard time for her mother, who, she notices, is focused on keeping her safe and feeling OK amid the celebrations.
""She's had a few very difficult Christmases with me,"" Katie says. ""It's almost worse for mum because she has to deal with me and can't anticipate how I'm going to react.""
Dr Prathiba Chitsabesan, NHS associate clinical director for children and young people's mental health, says supporting families to manage eating disorders at home is ""crucial"".
She adds that the ""added pressure of New Year's resolutions and the bombardment of weight loss messaging"" so close to Christmas can prove challenging for those living with an eating disorder.
""Hopefully these tips will really make a difference,"" she says.
Caroline Price, Beat's director of services, has warned that the pressure to eat large amounts at Christmas ""can be triggering"" for people with binge-eating disorder and bulimia, as well as causing anxiety for people with anorexia.
She says: ""People with eating disorders often try to hide their illness and at Christmas when eating is a social occasion - often with people who they do not see frequently - they may feel ashamed and want to isolate themselves from others.
""At the same time, Christmas can be a source of distress for families who are caring for someone with an eating disorder.
""All these pressures can be made more difficult as the normal support networks are often not available at Christmas, as friends may be away, and regular social activities close for the holidays.""
Anyone worried about their own or someone else's health is urged to contact Beat's helplines, which are open year-round and every day from 16:00 to 20:00 GMT from 24 December to 1 January.
Those in need of support can get in contact via phone, email, anonymous one-to-one webchat or social media messaging."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the last 35 months, 350 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published containing documented evidence that undermines the popularized conception of a slowly-cooling Earth followed by a dramatic hockey-stick-shaped recent uptick, or an especially unusual global-scale warming during modern times.

During 2017 and 2018, there were over 250 papers published in scientific journals documenting the lack of any unusual warming in the modern era.
253 Non-Global Warming Papers (2017 & 2018)
Though research is still ongoing, there have been 100 more papers added thus far in 2019.
100 Non-Global Warming Papers (2019)
To clarify, some regions of the Earth have been warming in recent decades or at some point in the last 150 years.
Some regions have also been cooling for decades at a time.
And many regions have shown no significant net changes or trends in either direction relative to the last few decades to hundreds to thousands of years.
Succinctly, then, scientists publishing in peer-reviewed journals have increasingly provided documentation that there is nothing historically unprecedented or remarkable about today’s climate when viewed in the context of long-term natural variability.
A tiny sample of the 2019 list is shown below.

Klippel et al., 2019
“[A]n analysis of instrumental temperatures for the period 1955–2013 shows that in northwestern Greece, statistically significant trends in summer temperature are absent (Feidas, 2016). The cooling trend from 1950–1976, previously reported throughout the Mediterranean basin, was followed by an, so far, insignificant warming (Piervitali et al., 1997; del Río et al., 2011). Our reconstruction mirrors this absence of a clear positive trend at decadal scale. … In total, 110 cold and 48 warm extremes appear in the 100SP reconstruction, and 105 cold and 57 warm extremes in the 10SP reconstruction (Figure 5 and Table S1). The year 1240 was the warmest summer, with reconstructed anomalies of +3.13 °C and +2.64 °C in the 100SP and 10SP reconstructions, respectively. The two coldest summers in the 100SP reconstruction are 1217 and 1884 with anomalies of –3.71 °C and –3.61 °C, respectively. The two coldest summers in the 10SP reconstruction occurred in different years, 1035 and 1117, with anomalies of –3.11 °C and -3.14°C, respectively. The third coldest summer in the 100SP and fourth coldest summer in the 10SP reconstructions, is 1959, which is the second coldest year in the instrumental EOBS v.15 record. The coldest decade is 1811–1820 (–0.73°C) and the warmest decade 1481–1490 (+0.88°C; calculated only for 100SP reconstruction). The elimination of decadal trends in the 10SP reconstruction causes events to appear more evenly distributed. However, over the past 450 years the occurrence of warm temperature extremes is substantially less frequent compared to preceding centuries.”



Booker et al., 2019
“Warm Period 1 (~1924–2006 CE) was characterized by Tcal from 23 to 34°C (average 28.3 ± 0.96 °C), which is similar to the current seawater temperature for Grand Cayman and significantly warmer than CP 2. During this period there were two warm intervals (WI 2: ~1924–1932, WI 3: ~1972–1993) and two cool intervals (CI 3: ~1960–1972, CI 4: ~1993–2006). The warm intervals are characterized by an increase in Tcal of ~5–7 °C. The cool intervals are characterized by a decrease of ~4–5 °C. … • Mild Period 1 (~2006–2014 CE) was characterized by Tcal of 25 to 33 °C (average 27.5 ± 0.96 °C) which is similar to the current average seawater temperature for Grand Cayman (t-test: p b 0.01; Fig. 14).”


Fröb et al., 2019
“The container vessel M/V Nuka Arctica, owned by Royal Arctic Line, operates between Ilulissaat, Greenland and Aalborg, Denmark. … The SST measurements on Nuka Arctica show a substantial cooling during winters between 2004 and 2017 (Figures 2c and S6). From the IRM-W through the ICE-W box, the SST trend varies between -0.084±0.020 and -0.096±0.018 ◦C yr−1. Towards the east, thecooling is less pronounced, and in the FB box, the SST trend is only -0.045±0.016 ◦C yr−1. Averaged over all boxes, SST decreased by 0.78±0.19◦C per decade.”


Watanabe et al., 2019
“[P]revious studies have observed that global surface air-temperatures remained relatively constant between the late-1990s and 2015, although climate models predicted continued anthropogenic warming. This so-called global-warming hiatus has received considerable attention [Kosaka et al., 2013]. Satellite-based SST data suggest that the main cause of the global-warming hiatus is the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which is the dominant mode of atmosphere-ocean interactions in the subtropical Pacific. The IPO reversed from a positive to a negative phase in the late 1990s, i.e. the timing of the IPO phase change coincides with the onset of the global-warming hiatus. The negative IPO led to anomalous cooling in the eastern Pacific and this is thought to be a major cause of the global-warming hiatus. … The 26-year SSTanom record shows a significant regime shift in October 1996 (peak: 0.202; P < 0.01: Fig. 2b). The mean (range) of SSTanom is 0.73 ± 2.59 °C (10.96 °C) before 1996 and −0.46 ± 2.71 °C (11.72 °C) after 1996 (Fig. 2b). SST anom (δ18OSW-anom) shows a gradual cooling (decrease) over the past-26 years (−0.03 ± 0.01 °C/year and −0.02 ± 0.00‰VSMOW/year, respectively).”

Buckley et al., 2019


Gan et al., 2019
“Daily Minimum temperature (Tmin) is an important variable in both global and regional climate changes, and its variability can greatly affect the ecological system. In the early 21st century, warming slowdown is seen over the North Hemisphere and North America is one of the major cooling centers. … In this study, we found that Tmin experienced an obvious decline in North America during warming slowdown period. Such Tmin decline is closely related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the correlation between the decadal components of Tmin and AMO reached 0.71 during 1950-2014.”



Zhang et al., 2019
“Natural variability of Southern Ocean convection as a driver of observed climate trends … Observed Southern Ocean surface cooling and sea-ice expansion over the past several decades are inconsistent with many historical simulations from climate models. Here we show that natural multidecadal variability involving Southern Ocean convection may have contributed strongly to the observed temperature and sea-ice trends.”


Eck et al., 2019
“A majority (12/14) of the regions within the SAM [southern Appalachian Mountains] have experienced a long‐term decline in mean winter temperatures since 1910.”


Kutta and Hubbart, 2019
“Between 1900 and 2016, climatic trends were characterized by significant reductions in the maximum temperatures (−0.78°C/century; p = 0.001), significant increases in minimum temperatures (0.44 °C/century; p = 0.017) [overall -0.34°C per century], and increased annual precipitation (25.4 mm/century) indicative of a wetter and more temperate WV climate. Despite increasing trends of growing degree days during the first (p ≤ 0.015) and second half of the period of record, the long-term trend indicated a decrease in GDD [warm growing degree days] of approximately 100 °C/days.”


He et al., 2019


Kuzmina et al., 2019
“Even during coldest time of the Pleistocene, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), summer temperatures were higher here than they are today (Alfimov, Berman, 2001, Alfimov et al., 2003). … The Pleistocene megafauna of the North Slope was dominated by mostly horses … There are depressions in the main Pleistocene unit filled by early Holocene sediments containing well-preserved leaves, logs and stumps of Populus balsamifera. Since the modern limit of this tree species is south of the North Slope, the presence of fossil poplar indicates warmer than present climate during the early Holocene. … The second warming (around 9–8 ka), which corresponds with Boreal Period of the BlyttSernander scheme, was probably the warmest interval of the Holocene in Beringia (Kaufman et al., 2004). Trees spread north to coastal areas in Siberia (Kaplina, Lozhkin, 1982; Kuzmina, Sher, 2006), spruce forest reached the central Brooks Range (Anderson, Brubaker, 1994), and beaver occupied formerly treeless landscapes in Alaska (Robinson et al., 2007). Climate on the North Slope was about 2 to 3°C warmer than today; and moisture was lower (Nelson, Carter, 1987).”


Lüning et al., 2019
“The main MCA warming phase coincides with a higher SAM, more El Niño-dominated ENSO, more positive IPO and higher solar activity (Abram et al., 2014; Conroy et al., 2008; Steinhilber et al., 2012; Vance et al., 2015) (Fig. 5). Spectral analysis of the classical Mt Read tree rings series (site 5), yields characteristic cycle periods associated with the solar Gleissberg (80 years) and Suess-de Vries (210 years) cycles (Cook et al., 1995; Cook et al., 2000). … An alternation of well-defined multicentennial warm and cold phases has been reconstructed for Grotto of Oddities in SE Australia (site 3). Temperatures oscillated with an amplitude of more than 1°C during the past 1500 years (McGowan et al., 2018).”


Salvatteci et al., 2019
“[O]tolith δ18O data from Peruvian catfish (Galeichthys peruvianus) excavated from archeological sites in northern Peru suggest SST ~4 °C warmer than present‐day SST (Andrus et al., 2002).”


Fletcher et al., 2019
“The Pliocene is an intriguing climatic interval that offers important insights into climate feedbacks. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were, at times, as high as modern ones (Fig. 1), but generally show a decreasing trend throughout the Pliocene (Haywood et al., 2016; Pagani et al., 2010; Royer et al., 2007; Stap et al., 2016), Although CO2 estimates from different methods do not converge, the modeled direct effects of these CO2 discrepancies appear to be small (Feng et al., 2017). Of additional importance for comparability to the modern climate system, continental configurations were similar to present (Dowsett et al., 2016). While global mean annual temperatures (MATs) during the Pliocene were only ∼ 3°C warmer than in the present day, Arctic land surface MATs may have been as much as 15 to 22°C warmer (Ballantyne et al., 2010; Csank et al., 2011a, b; Fletcher et al., 2017). Further, Arctic sea surface temperatures may have been as much as 10 to 15°C warmer than modern ones (Robinson, 2009), and sea levels were approximately 25 m higher than present (Dowsett et al., 2016). As a result, the Arctic terrestrial environment was significantly different from today, with boreal ecosystems at much higher latitudes (Salzmann et al., 2008).”

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



What did the climate models predict? From [CEI.org](https://cei.org/blog/manufacturing-alarm-dana-nuccitellis-critique-john-christys-climate-science-testimony)



The average of 102 climate models says that the temperature anomaly in 2019 should be +0.9°C.

Theselected “author teams, drawn from the hundreds of excellent nominations the IPCC was fortunate to receive, provide us withthe necessary expertise across a range of disciplines to conduct the assessment” … but in truth …… the author statistics (below) show that the “necessary expertise” is lacking, as geologists are again excluded, rendering thecollective authorship incompetent for their stated mission of reviewing the literature to assess climate change. By thisomission, IPCC ignores Earth’s history and the copious geological evidence, latterly backed by archaeology, that sea level(barometer of global temperature, via ocean-water expansion & polar ice melt) undergoes a rapid (100-500 year) & large (1-3metres) oscillation every 500-2000 years, caused by volcanism and solar fluctuations, certainly not by industrial CO2.AR6 author statistics:Working Group I (WGI), ‘The Physical Science Basis’, 232 authors, including meteorologists,oceanographers, climate scientists, glaciologists, physicists, geographers and computer modellers, but no geologists.WGII, ‘Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, 323 authors, no geologists.WGIII, Mitigation of Climate Change, 229 authors, no geologists. Grand total 784 authors, no geologists.Exemplifying IPCC’s chronic lack of impartiality (see my Technical Note 2018-2), one WGI author’s new (2018) book,‘Sunburnt Country’, aims to convince the public that man is making Australia hotter; another’s frequent mainstream-mediaarticles likewise aim to scare people into accepting that manmade warming is fact, not mere belief, and he criticizes Trump.IPCC’s Lee again, in true UN egalitarian style: “Of the selected experts, 44% come from developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition, 53% are new to the IPCC process and 33% are women.” How lovely: no geologists, but at leastwe have politically correct quotas of women, third worlders and youngsters! Worse: the 53% “new” people are doubtlessnearly all younger than 50, i.e. indoctrinated through school and university with the ‘CO2 = pollutant’ fallacy.Be appalled that this biased, underskilled, political organization, having judged the imperceptible & geologicallytrivial 1°C of warming since 1900 (not a provably unprecedented rate) to be manmade, despite copious evidence ofCO2’s innocence (Technical Note 2019-11), has unleashed multi-trillion-dollar expenditure, relentlessly raising yourfamily’s taxes and energy bills, and destined to cripple the global economy and downgrade human living standards.Previous post n this topic:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331928229Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
" Contributed by Michelle Stirling © 2019Friends of Science Society has re-issued our 2016 report: “Geothermal for Alberta? A Case for Caution” to help inform the debate on the potential benefits and pitfalls of this novel form of heating and power generation for Canada.  Though the document takes a specific look at Alberta, it includes a global overview of geothermal. This is a plain language document.LINK TO FULL REPORT: Geothermal Alberta A Case for Caution Aug 12 2019 REV2The Green Party “Mission Possible: The Green Climate Action Fund” platform advocates for the use of geothermal energy as a replacement for hydrocarbon/fossil fuel-based electricity and heat generation for Canada.  The Green Party platform assumes that we can ‘harness abandoned deep oil wells, wherever feasible, for geothermal energy, using workers who drilled the wells to manage the renewable energy generation.’  On the surface, this appears to be a sensible ‘repurposing’ of similar drilling skills, by simply transferring these workers into geothermal as energy generation experts.But things are not so simple when it comes to geothermal.Like many forms of power generation, geothermal is location specific.  To further confuse the public, geothermal is a term that is attached to two different forms of energy supply.  One form is that of direct heat, where bore holes into the earth at a relatively nominal depth, capitalize on extant heat as a means of providing stable heat source.  This heat source can be best used with a system of electrical pumps, where the earth becomes a storehouse of hot and cold air, cycled by electrical pumps to act as an HVAC system.  In some geographic locations, this set-up has benefits and, depending on the cost of electricity (to run the pumps that cycle the air) and depending on the stability and ambient temperature differential fluctuations, this can be a cost-efficient form of heating/cooling.At first glance, parts of Alberta have excellent geothermal heating potential.  However, a complicating factor is the often wildly fluctuating ambient temperatures due to Chinook winds, where temperatures can go from minus 20°C to plus 20°C in the space of a few hours.  The response time of geothermal heating systems can be slow to keep up with this instability; likewise, the electrical energy required to pump the geothermal heat can be very expensive.Another application for geothermal is that of electrical generation.  Here, the Green Party ‘makes hay’ by claiming that using existing deep wells for geothermal would be an easy way to put lots of unemployed oil and gas workers back to work.  The assumption is that these workers have similar skills used in drilling, that can easily be transferred to managing deep oil wells for geothermal electrical generation.  This is a questionable assumption because electrical generation is quite different than oil well drilling – and to date, there is no assurance that such deep oil geothermal electricity generation potential exists anywhere but a few places in Alberta, BC and NWT, and some possible spots in Quebec. (Smart Prosperity just posted a blog on the first such initiative in Saskatchewan. A pilot project is in development at Swan Hills)The Green Party’s “Mission Possible” also states in point 7 that it will ‘ban fracking’ with no exceptions.  However, deep well geothermal electrical generation relies on fracking in order to expose the ‘hot rocks’ to the cold water that is pumped down into the borehole. When the cold water hits the hot rocks, steam is produced, and this steam is pumped up to the surface to drive power generation turbines.There is a new, untested, alternative method proposed by geothermal proponents in Canada – but the problem is that this form is untested.  There is no large scale geothermal in operation in Canada at present and no pilot project of this alternative method. Therefore, it is not reasonable to set a nation’s energy generation and employment policy based on something that does not exist, and that requires a process that the Green Party election platform strictly forbids, that being fracking.Furthermore, as with many ‘nature-driven’ power generation proposals like wind and solar, proponents often say geothermal will tap into ‘free’ energy from the earth.  A study by Majorowicz and Grasby (2019) indicates that geothermal energy simply cannot compete with the power generation provided by conventional fossil fuels, and the costs are exorbitant, except in certain unique geographic situations.As with all forms of power and heat generation, there are potential applications for geothermal in Canada – but there are serious limitations as well.  It is extremely unlikely that the mass of ~100,000 unemployed oil workers could be put back to work in a geothermal industry, nor do their skills directly transfer to geothermal power generation.  Likewise, the temperature differentials in Canada make geothermal only a potential provider of supplementary power, not a main provider.I reached out to Dr. Majorowicz by email, a specialist in the field of geothermal, to ask for additional insights. He wrote that:“… the real potential for geothermal based power production is only in the western and northwestern deep part of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) basin where temperatures most suitable for that purpose can be found >150°C. [Temperatures of] >120°C can also be considered if very large flow rates secured.The difference [between geothermal and oil/gas] is in energy density and, in order to compare apples to apples, exergy (which is discussed it in our paper) is couple orders of magnitude and therefore it will take several doublet geothermal well systems to replace one average producing oil and gas energy in the WCSB.We also need to remember that pumping and reinjecting [to geothermal wells] all take large amounts of [electrical] power.Also, thermal efficiency of geothermal power plants is some 10% +/- 4% depending on temperature of running fluid used.It is at least 3 times that or more in coal power plants….”(Wikipedia reports: Typical thermal efficiency for utility-scale electrical generators is around 37% for coal and oil-fired plants, and 56 – 60% (LEV) for combined-cycle gas-fired plants.)Aside from these energy density and location issues, it is unclear how the Green Party can reconcile their absolute rejection of fracking with their demand for geothermal.To further the public understanding of geothermal power generation, we have reissued our 2016 report – “Geothermal for Alberta? A Case for Caution.” (Download link at the top of the page)Also, posted below is a plain language “Speakers’ Corner” debate between Thana Boonlert (now Green Party candidate for Calgary Centre @Thana4yyc ) and me, Michelle Stirling (Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society @stirlingmg @FriendsOScience), on the topic of geothermal as a replacement or complement to coal-fired power generation in Alberta.

h/t Breitbart; Facebook has agreed to comply with Chinese health authority requests to delete “misinformation” about the Corona Virus outbreak.
Facebook to remove coronavirus misinformation after WHO declares global emergencyKatie PaulTECHNOLOGY NEWS JANUARY 31, 2020 / 6:56 PMSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) – Facebook Inc said on Thursday it will take down misinformation about China’s fast-spreading coronavirus in a rare departure from its approach to health content, after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency. The world’s biggest social network said in a blog post that it would remove content about the virus “with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,” saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to “physical harm.”…Read more: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-facebook/facebook-to-remove-coronavirus-misinformation-after-who-declares-global-emergency-idUSKBN1ZU0X7
This kind of heavy handed censorship is the main reason nobody trusts the Chinese Government to tell the truth. Facebook allowing the Chinese government to control Facebook content will not stop the rumours spreading, with the TOR network and plain old telephone calls, there is no longer a way to stop the flow of information and rumours other than to shut down everything – and shutting down all communication would send its own message. 
Are there plenty of lies flying about regarding the Corona Virus? Almost certainly. Could some of the lies lead to harm? Very likely. But I suspect the Chinese Government is doing its own share of lying, just as they allegedly lied and attempted to cover up the severity of the SARS outbreak.
In the Information Age, the way to respond to wild rumours is to answer them, to provide evidence the rumours are untrue, to invite trusted third parties to corroborate official statements, not to try to silence critics. Unless the official statements are lies, in which case this is not an option.
Facebook accepting direction from Chinese censors just means people have no reason to trust Facebook.

From The Daily Caller

Chris White Tech Reporter
October 30, 2019 1:43 PM ET
Former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson will take the stand Wednesday in a trial New York’s attorney general orchestrated to hold the Texas-based oil company responsible for climate change.
New York Attorney General Letitia James argues Exxon duped shareholders into believing the company accounted for the potential costs of climate regulations. Exxon is dismissing the accusations, arguing the state doesn’t understand how the company calculates its economic outlooks.
Exxon’s alleged deception “exposed the company to greater risk from climate change regulation than investors were led to believe,” according to the lawsuit, which was filed in October 2018 after the state spent nearly four years investigating the company.
New York’s probe took several different routes before landing on a path leading it to focus on Exxon’s so-called proxy costs. (RELATED: NY Sues Exxon For Allegedly Defrauding Shareholders On Climate Change Risks)
The suit focuses on Exxon’s use of an internal “proxy” price for global warming regulations, which was lower than prices put forward in reports to investors and the public. Exxon said it’s been internally pricing carbon dioxide emissions since 2007. Tillerson was the CEO during that time.
The ploy “in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate change regulation,” the lawsuit stated. New York’s initial probe stems from research conducted by Inside Climate News, which reported in 2015 that the company downplays whatever role it contributes to man-made global warming.
Barbara Underwood, the state’s former interim attorney general, brought the lawsuit under the Martin Act, a state law giving the state broad authority to prosecute securities fraud. The suit demands Exxon turn over any profits the company made through the alleged fraud and make restitution to investors.
James wants to question Tillerson, who served as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state in 2017, about statements he made at a 2016 shareholder meeting in which he said the cost of climate rules “gets put into all our economic models when we make investment decisions as well.”
Tillerson’s private email account, labeled “Wayne Tracker,” is expected to be front and center during the trial. New York’s attorney general’s staff discovered that the former executive primarily used an email account for company business, wayne.tracker@exxonmobil.com. Wayne is Tillerson’s middle name. The company destroyed emails from the account before August 2015.
The purpose of the side account “was efficiency, not secrecy,” Ted Wells Jr., the lead lawyer representing Exxon in the case, wrote in a 2017 letter to Judge Barry Ostrager, who is presiding over the current case. The older emails were nixed “due to the manner in which email accounts had been configured years earlier,” Wells added.
Neither Exxon nor New York’s attorney general’s office have responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Guest “picking a fight with both sides” by David Middleton
 JUL 15, 2019EPA Drilling Regulations Remain Underrated Obstacle to Solving Global Warming William MurrayManager, Energy Meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming will be impossible unless the United States leads the way. […]What remains is CCS technology, which the oil and gas industry has used to enhance the recovery of oil for the past nearly 50 years. Each year, this technology already traps more than 60 million tons of carbon dioxide permanently underground, preventing it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global temperature increases. Congress has incentivized industrial companies to invest in this kind of CCS technology through tax breaks, but companies still are running into problems. Of paramount concern is the Environmental Protection Agency’s oversight of the well-drilling that is the necessary prerequisite for storing CO2 underground.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has oversight authority over the Safe Drinking Water Act’s rules that protect the country’s 151,000 public water systems. In general, this oversight works pretty well, permitting thousands of industrial wells to be drilled every year with virtually no damage to underground sources of drinking water.In 2010, the EPA created a new class of drilling category especially for geologic storage of CO2 on the presumption that there would be demand for the technology. Instead of streamlining the practice, however, the EPA created overly prescriptive rules, onerous reporting requirements, and unintended liability issues — all of which have led to costly lag times in project development. In nearly a decade since the EPA initiated these Class VI permits, fewer than 10 have been licensed, even though tax breaks were supposed to lower the investment risk for companies.In 2011, Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland applied for an EPA well permit to place 1 million tons of carbon dioxide into an underground saline aquifer. But the newness of the permit-type, combined with disagreements over long-term liability issues, meant the project took roughly six years to finalize. The Illinois project remains the only major attempt to sequester carbon deep underground; two other efforts in Montana and Kansas were derailed due to permit issues.[…]In the decade-plus since passage of the fracking exemption, U.S. oil and gas production has exploded well beyond what was originally thought possible — from 5 million barrels a day to almost 13 million barrels a day — while the country could become a net exporter of crude oil and oil products by 2020. Meanwhile, the boost in natural gas production has displaced coal use for electricity, causing U.S. emissions to fall more than 10 percent from their peak in 2005.Under the right circumstances, a similar change can occur in carbon capture and storage. […]R Street
Irony can be so ironic… EPA regulations designed to facilitate carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) are actually inhibiting CCS projects.
R Street? 
R Street is basically a RINO think tank; former South Carolina Representative Bob Inglis is on their Board of Directors.
R Street is partly good…
 R Street is a free-market think tank with a pragmatic approach to public policy challenges. We draw inspiration from such thinkers as Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, Ronald H. Coase, James M. Buchanan and Arthur C. Pigou.We favor consumer choice; low, flat taxes; regulation that is transparent and applied equitably and systems that rely on price signals rather than central planning. Thus, it is fair to say we are on the political right. 
Figure 1.  Milton Friedman rocks!!! Well… rocked when he was alive.
Partly bad…
 At the same time, we recognize that public goods, natural monopolies and externalities are real concerns that governments must address. 
So much for being inspired by Milton Friedman.
Partly sort of realistic…
We also understand that life in a democratic society sometimes means reaching a compromise that doesn’t necessarily represent a first, best solution.We offer research and analysis that advance the goals of a more market-oriented society and an effective, efficient government, with the full realization that progress on the ground tends to be made one inch at a time. In other words, we look for free-market victories on the margin.   R Street
Figure 2.  Sometimes stated as, “Don’t let the perfect become the enemy of the good.”
R Street’s energy “expert,”  William Murray is the former editor of  RealClearPolitics‘ energy page, “has a bachelor’s degree in American and British literature from Whitman College and master’s degrees in journalism and security studies from Columbia and Georgetown University, respectively.”   
Firstly, you have to filter out all of the alarmist nonsense.   “Solving global warming” is not an urgent matter.  It’s not even something that can be “solved.”  Mr. Murray is not a scientist, certainly not a geologist… Nor is he an energy industry professional.  Like most of the R Street RINO’s, he appears to totally buy into the “climate crisis” horst schist.  But he does have a point about CCS.
Secondly, for any of this to make sense, you have to accept the  real probability that each doubling of atmospheric CO2 increases the bulk temperature of the atmosphere by anywhere from 0.5 to 1.5 °C and that a rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 beyond 1,000 ppmv could yield some unpredictable changes in marine geochemistry.   Clearly a doubling of the assumed pre-industrial CO2 concentration of 280 ppmv, will not lead to a climate crisis, catastrophe or emergency… But, could a tripling or quadrupling of that 280 ppmv pose a potential problem in a couple of hundred years?  Maybe.
If you accept these parameters of what may become somewhat of a problem over the next few hundred years, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a logical part of the solution… Particularly since it can be implemented slowly.
It’s a fossil fueled world!
Figure 3. It’s a fossil fueled world. (BP Statistical Review of World Energy)
It’s a fossil fueled world and that’s not going to significantly change over the next 50 years, not even if little Greta stomps her feet and holds her breath until she’s blue in the face.
Figure 4.  Gas will continue to kick @$$… Sorry Greta. (EIA AEO 2019)
You can actually get there from here: Drill, baby, drill!
This paper from the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) website is an excellent summary of CCS and CCSU, once you get past the standard recitation of IPCC horst schist.
Carbon Capture and SequestrationMichael Sheppard[…]Geological Sequestration of Carbon DioxideIn all cases where fossil fuels are the source of energy, CO2 is inevitably produced; if we are to prevent this CO2reaching the atmosphere, CCS will be absolutely essential. CCS lends itself most readily to applications in which power is produced centrally (as in the case of coal-powered electricity stations). CO2 can be stripped from power-station emissions by a number of means, and these captured emissions can be compressed, transported, and stored. […]The volumes of CO2 that need to be dealt with, however, are large. Emissions of CO2 currently run at over 30 billion tons a year, and sequestering just a tenth of this would entail pumping about 75 million barrels of supercritical CO2per day into geological formations. At the level of an individual power plant, sequestering CO2 from a 500-MW coal-fired power station would require pumping around 75,000 B/D1 of supercritical CO2 into a suitable formation. The expertise and the technologies needed to sequester such volumes already exist to a large degree within the oil and gas industry. Several demonstrations of CO2 sequestration already are underway, including the In Salah saline formation project in Algeria (Riddiford et al. 2004) and the Sleipner project in the Norwegian North Sea. […]Society of Petroleum Engineers
Figure 5. Putting it back in the ground.  (Society of Petroleum Engineers) 
EOR: The win-win aspect
 Enhanced Oil Recovery Using CO2CO2 is already pumped into oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), although most of the CO2 currently used for EOR comes from natural sources, and existing EOR practices are not implemented with a view to storing CO2. However, it would be possible to modify CO2 EOR to emphasize CO2 storage while at the same time improving oil recovery. Although CO2 EOR would not provide accommodation for more than a very small fraction of the volume of CO2 currently emitted, it does provide a laboratory for technologies required for routine sequestration that is driven by the commercial incentive to improve recovery of the oil from older reservoirs. Moreover, in a world where CO2 is much more readily and cheaply available, there will be an incentive to use CO2 earlier in the oil-recovery stage to better exploit dwindling resources.  Society of Petroleum Engineers 
Currently, about 300,000 bbl/d of US oil production is due to CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR).  As recently as EIA’s 2014 Annual Energy Outlook, this was projected to significantly increase due to high oil prices.
Figure 6. Putting it back in the ground to get more oil out of the ground. (US EIA) 
 The US Department of Rick Perry, I mean Energy, estimates that CO2 EOR could recover about 85 billion barrels of oil from existing U.S. oil fields: 
Figure 7. Don’t leave it in the ground! Make room for more CO2!  (US DOE) 
 Figure 8.  It’s just a matter of economics. (US DOE)   
How can we know it will work safely?
 This is what CO2 EOR has safely done since 1972: 
SACROCDiscovered in 1948, the SACROC unit is one of the largest and oldest oil fields in the United States using carbon dioxide flooding technology. The field is comprised of approximately 50,000 acres located in the Permian Basin in Scurry County, Texas. Kinder Morgan owns an approximate 97 percent working interest in SACROC and has expanded the development of the carbon dioxide project initiated by previous owners and increased production over the last several years. In 2016, SACROC produced approximately 29,300 barrels of oil per day, and NGL production averaged approximately 20,900 barrels per day. Kinder Morgan continues to effectively develop this mature field through innovative use of seismic data, lateral drilling and advanced conformance techniques.  Kinder Morgan 
Since 1972, over 175 million metric tons of CO2 have been injected into the SACROC reservoir; there has never been any evidence of leakage.
 SACROC was discovered in 1948.  When the injection began, total recovery was less than 20% of the original oil in place (OOIP). The CO2 EOR has led to nearly a 50% recovery of the OOIP and the field is still going strong.
Figure 9.  With over 50% of the OOIP recovered, SACROC is still producing almost 30,000 bbl of oil and 21,000 bbl of natural gas liquids per day.  
Are there hazards? 
There are always drilling hazards and these are very similar to those of drilling oil & gas wells and operating wastewater injection wells.
CO2 injection wells can experience well control incidents (kicks, blowouts, etc.), in much the same manner as oil & gas wells do.  These are rare, relative to the numbers of wells drilled and the industry goes to great lengths to prevent and/or mitigate well control incidents, but no human industry is perfect.  
Depleted oil & gas fields are the ideal repositories because there is little or no risk of induced seismicity and the fact that there was oil and/or gas trapped there means that there is a competent geologic seal.   The main risk here is that the old wells weren’t properly plugged and abandoned (P&A’ed).  There would have to be close monitoring for leakage in the vicinity of the old wells.  Improperly P&A’ed wells might have to be drilled out and properly P&A’ed.
Saline aquifers have the advantage of having few, if any, old wellbores.  They also have the disadvantage of being at virgin pressure.  The main risk here is induced seismicity.  Detailed geotechnical analyses would have to be conducted prior to drilling injection wells and the area would have to be carefully  monitored for seismicity during injection.
CO2 injection operations have been safely conducted for decades.  The safety record is on par with that of drilling and producing oil & gas wells, excellent, but not perfect.
If oil companies are doing this anyway, why should it be subsidized?
Oil companies are doing this where it makes economic sense under current economic conditions and about 80% of the CO2 comes from natural reservoirs, where it is sufficiently concentrated for economic extraction.  Taking CO2 out of natural reservoirs for EOR operations does not address the problem, to the extent there is one.
Figure 10. Current sources of CO2 for EOR operations.  (US DOE)  
CO2 EOR operations are expensive and rarely justified with oil prices below $85/bbl.
Implementing a CO2 EOR project is a capital-intensive undertaking. It involves drilling or reworking wells to serve as both injectors and producers, installing a CO2 recycle plant and corrosion resistant field production infrastructure, and laying CO2 gathering and transportation pipelines. Generally, however, the single largest project cost is the purchase of CO2. As such, operators strive to optimize and reduce the cost of its purchase and injection wherever possible.Higher oil prices in recent years have significantly improve the economics of CO2 EOR. However, oil field costs have also increased sharply, reducing the economic margin essential for justifying this oil recovery option to operators who still see it as bearing significant risk. Both capital and operating costs for an EOR project can vary over arange, and the value of CO2 behaves as a commodity, priced at pressure, pipeline quality, and accessibility, so it is important for an operator to understand how these factors might change. Total CO2 costs (both purchase price and recycle costs) can amount to 25 to 50 percent of the cost per barrel of oil produced. In addition to the high up-front capital costs of a CO2 supply/injection/recycling scheme, the initial CO2 injection volume must be purchased well in advance of the onset of incremental production. Hence, the return on investment for CO2 EOR tends to be low, with a gradual, long-term payout.Given the significant front-end investment in wells, recycle equipment, and CO2, the time delay in achieving an incremental oil production response, and the potential risk of unexpected geologic heterogeneity significantly reducing the expected response, CO2 EOR is still considered to be a risky investment by many operators, particularly in areas and reservoirs where it has not been implemented previously. Oil reservoirs with higher capital cost requirements and less favorable ratios of CO2-injected-to-incremental-oil produced will not achieve an economically justifiable return on investment without advanced, high-efficiency CO2 EOR technology and/or fiscal/tax incentives for storing CO2.  US DOE 
 If the government wants oil companies to spend more of their money on CO2 EOR operations than would be supported by current economics, they need to provide an incentive.  So… they devised a tax credit to encourage oil companies to spend more of their money on CO2 EOR operations. 
Subsidizing something that works makes a helluva lot more sense than subsidizing green schist that doesn’t work.  The Section 45Q tax credit was established in 2008, it was enhanced in 2018 in an unusually bipartisan fashion. 
A bipartisan group of Senators, spearheaded by Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), John Barrasso (R-WY), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), led the effort to enhance the 45Q credit. Their bill, S. 1535, the Furthering carbon capture, Utilization, Technology, Underground storage, and Reduced Emissions Act (FUTURE Act), was included in Senate Finance Committee Chairperson Orrin Hatch’s (R-UT) larger tax extenders bill, S. 2256, before finally gaining inclusion in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  The Nickel Report 
Time is actually on our side
The good thing is that we have decades, if not centuries, to address this potential problem and improve the technology.  Just sequestering 10% of fossil fuel CO2 emissions would require an injection rate almost equal to the current global crude oil production rate.  However, as natural gas advanced combined cycle and, hopefully, nuclear power plants replace retiring coal-fired plants, the volume of CO2 requiring sequestration will rapidly shrink.  And there are promising technological advances that could drastically and economically reduce CO2 emissions from natural gas-fired power plants.
Experimental Texas power plant aims to make electricity cheaper, cleaner Erin Douglas March 1, 2019LA PORTE — Just off of Highway 225 past the refineries and coal stacks that line the freeway, one small plant is proving that generators can make electricity without emissions. Nothing that turns into acid rain. Nothing that makes it hard to breathe. Nothing that contributes to climate change.Distinguished from the other industrial sites only by a green leaf on its sign, the demonstration plant has been testing operations for just under a year to prove a power technology that, instead of emitting carbon dioxide, heats it to drive the turbines that make electricity. All but 3 percent of the carbon dioxide is recycled to produce more electricity; the rest can be captured and stored,ready for pipelines to customers in the oil and gas and other industrial industries.[…]NET Power, backed by a North Carolina investment firm 8 Rivers Capital and other investors, such as the Houston oil company Occidental Petroleum, uses a technology called the Allam power cycle, which heats up carbon dioxide in a combustion chamber to an extremely high temperature — a point known as supercritical carbon dioxide, at which the CO2 gas becomes like a liquid. The process uses the heat and mass of supercritical carbon dioxide to turn the turbines. The carbon dioxide, still very hot, then cools and is recycled through the plant.The excess carbon dioxide generated by the process could be captured at the correct pressure and quality to be easily transported via pipeline. Normally, in air combustion, sequestration of carbon dioxide is difficult because it is expensive to separate the carbon from the air, and then bring it to the correct pipeline pressure. The Allam power cycle removes the need for this separation.This is potentially a big deal for Texas, where carbon dioxide that can be transported via pipeline is in demand from its energy and chemical industries. Oil and gas companies can pump carbon dioxide into aging oil wells to increase production, a process known as enhanced oil recovery. It can also be used to make cement.The $140 million demonstration plant, on West Fairmont Parkway in La Porte, will have the capacity to produce 25 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 5,000 Texas homes on a hot summer day. Construction on the plant began in March of 2016; it began testing operations in May.[…]NET Power estimates that commercial versions of the plant, which would have a generating capacity of about 300 megawatts, could produce power for $20 per megawatt hour, assuming the federal tax credits that provide incentives for storing carbon dioxide stay in place. That prices also assumes the company can sell their pipeline-ready carbon dioxide for $15 per ton, as well as the nitrogen and argon they produce.NET Power estimates a combined natural gas cycle produces power at about $44 per megawatt hour, assuming a price of about $2.96 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas. NET Power estimates that 450 of its power plants could replace all the new fossil fuel power plants needed from now until 2040 in the U.S. […]Houston Chronicle
This is a rarity, a well-written article from the Houston Chronicle.
How is this different from solar & wind tax credits?
In principle, it isn’t different.  In practice, it is subsidizing low-carbon emissions energy production that actually works.  While, as a philosophical libertarian, I wish government would not intervene at all, I know that they will and the best we can do is to nudge that intervention in the right direction.  Call it a Milton Friedman-Voltaire hybrid philosophy.
Is this a solution in search of a problem?
Maybe.  But it’s fairly clear that the U.S. government will eventually impose stricter carbon emissions regulations on fossil fuel consumption.  President Trump can only hold the line until January 21, 2025, if we’re lucky.  And there are few among Republican Party leadership who would hold the line as well as he has.   Apart from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Democrats are 100% on the climate “crisis” bandwagon because they see it as the fast track to socialism, if not outright Marxism.  
The political reality is that tighter carbon regulations and/or taxes are very likely in the not to distant future.   CCS and CCSU are the least economically harmful path forward.
A note on comments
I fully realize that this post will be disagreed with by both sides of the climate debate.  One side will say I am being a denier for minimizing the severity of the “climate crisis” and the other will literally deny the possibility of a problem in the comfortably distant future.  I won’t engage in debate either way in the comments section of this post.  My responses will be limited to the geological and economic feasibility of carbon capture, sequestration and utilization. 
Another Note on comments
Any comments made by people who clearly didn’t read the post, in its entirety, will be ignored by me.  How will I know you haven’t read the entire post?  It’s usually fairly easy.  But, just to be sure… Start you comment with the phrase, Delta House, and that way, I’ll know you read the post.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Those who know me are aware that I’m a tropical boy, a hopeless addict of warm blue seas and coconut-laden islands with white sand beaches. Here’s where I used to live and work, Liapari Island in the Solomon Islands. 

That is how I like my water to behave, soft, warm, and inviting. But when the ice jumps out of my tropical-type adult beverage and starts running around the countryside covering everything in white and floating in giant chunks all over the ocean, well, I call that “water behaving badly”. 
And as you might imagine, other than brief visits I tend to avoid places where water behaves badly.
However, thinking about such icy climes when I’m someplace warm, that’s a more pleasant matter. So I got to considering ice, in particular, sea ice. And as is my wont, when I consider something I go get the longest dataset that I can find. In this case, that was the HadCRUT ice and sea surface temperature dataset. It claims to go back to 1870 … but that doesn’t mean that it’s good back to 1870. Figure 1 shows why. 
(As an aside, Figure 1 also shows the importance of starting by running the old Mark I Eyeball over your data before subjecting it to any mathematical gymnastics … but I digress.)
Figure 1. Hadley Centre HadISST Ice data, 1870-2019.  Top panel shows global data, middle panel shows southern hemisphere data, and the bottom panel shows northern hemisphere data. Note that the three panels are all at different scales. Units in this and all graphs are percentages of the total surface area of the globe.
Notice the very regular signal in the early days of both the northern and southern hemisphere data, and as a result in the global data. This is obviously just a perfectly regular repeating signal added to the later actual observations. We can get a better idea of when the real observations start (and stop) by removing the regular repeating seasonal signal from our dataset. Figure 2 below is the same as Figure 1, but with the regular repeating average seasonal variation removed.
Figure 2. Global and hemispheric ice areas, HadISST Ice data. Note that the three panels are all at different scales. Units in this and all graphs are percentages of the total surface area of the globe.
The regular signal in the earlier parts of the record is an artifact. It is an interference pattern resulting from the removal of the seasonal signal. Only the latter part of the datasets contain valid observations.
In Figure 2 above we can see that Arctic measurements (northern hemisphere, blue above) are only good since about 1960. Note the odd lack of data (with missing data replaced by a regular signal) from about 1940 to 1952.
Antarctic ice area (southern hemisphere, red above) actual measurements are more recent. The Antarctic record is only good since 1973. As a result, we can only look at global data since 1973. However, that’s approaching a half-century, so it is still of interest. Here’s the global ice area since 1973, the period where we have actual observations. It’s worth noting that since 1979 we have full satellite observations of ice areas.
Figure 3. Global ice areas, HadISST Ice data, Jan 1973 to July 2019. Units in this and all graphs are percentages of the total surface area of the globe.
Now, I was surprised by Figure 3. Surprise is the very best part of science to me. I love the first sight of the graphics, turning what before was just a bunch of numbers into a record of the past.
There were a couple of surprises in Figure 3. First, from 1980 through 2004, a quarter-century during which there was general global warming, there was no trend at all in global ice area. None. Well, to be accurate, the trend 1980 through 2004 is -0.0000000000000001% per decade … and as you imagine, not statistically significant.
After 2005 the global ice area went down, but by 2010 it had recovered. From there to 2015, it was above average. And since 2015 global ice area has dropped precipitously but then recovered back to average. Finally, there is no statistically significant trend in the full 1973 – 2019 dataset.
So … lots of things of interest in Figure 3. However, I gotta say, I’m not seeing the evil hand of steadily increasing atmospheric CO2 in that record. Nor am I seeing any “anthropogenic fingerprint”. Perhaps most importantly, I am unable to detect any sign of any “climate emergency” in that record.
The final surprise was the recent several-year deep drop and then recovery of the ice area. I figured it must be from what alarmists have termed the “Arctic death spiral”, the widely trumpeted decrease in Arctic sea ice. So I added the separate Arctic and the Antarctic records to Figure 3 above. Figure 4 below shows those records.
Curiously, the amount of ice at the two poles is just about the same, at ~2% of the globe. But that makes it hard to compare the Arctic and Antarctic ice. So in Figure 4 below, I’ve offset the northern hemisphere (blue line) by 1% for clarity. You’ll need to add 1% to the northern hemisphere ice areas to get the actual values. Figure 4 shows the globe as well as the two halves of the planet separately. Note that in this graphic they are all to the same scale.
Figure 4. Global, northern hemisphere (Arctic) and southern hemisphere (Antarctic) ice areas. Northern hemisphere values have been offset downwards by 1% for clarity. Add 1% to the values shown to get the actual values.  Units in this and all graphs are percentages of the total surface area of the globe
And for my final surprise, it turns out that the recent variations in global ice area are largely the result of variations in the Antarctic ice area, and not in the Arctic ice area that we spend so many electrons discussing …
So what I found out regarding the global ice areas was that I didn’t know all that much about global ice areas … and speaking of which, just what the heck did cause the drop and subsequent recovery in Antarctic sea ice area from 2015 to the present?
Here on the north coast of California, it’s the leading edge of autumn. We had our first rain this week, which left the forest full of the damp dark green smell of life, decay, and rebirth. And when I just looked outside, the rain had come again. What a joy it is to investigate the mysteries of this endless universe, even the vagaries of water behaving badly!
Best to everyone,
w.

"**The Italian restaurant chain ASK has been fined for misleading customers about a lobster dish.**
The Aragosta e Gamberoni (lobster and king prawns) dish contained a mixture of 35% lobster and 34% white fish, plus other ingredients, formed to look like lobster meat, an investigation found.
The dish, the most expensive on the menu, retailed at Â£14.95 while the cost of the raw ingredients was only Â£2.84.
The chain was fined Â£40,000 on Tuesday for misleadingly describing food.
Azzuri Restaurants Limited, which trades as ASK Italian, admitted the charge at Swansea Magistrates' Court last November.
This came after the lack of lobster in the dish was spotted by a Trading Standards officer during a routine visit to a branch in the city.
Sales of the dish amounted to Â£3m across the UK since it was launched in 2014, though the charge spanned the period between 1 December 2016 and 20 March 2019 - when Swansea Trading Standards alerted ASK and it removed the dish from its menu.
ASK apologised for what it described as an error, and accepted that without reference to white fish, the menu description was incomplete and likely to mislead.
It denied having a financial motivation and said the item had the lowest profit margin of all the restaurant's pasta dishes, adding there was no health and safety risk associated with this case."
" Op-ed contributed by Michelle Stirling © 2019On May 21, 2019, Andrew Nikiforuk wrote an article in The Tyee mocking Albertans and presenting his perspective on what he calls ‘false claims’ by Albertans about the situation we find ourselves in. Alberta has faced a decade long coordinated effort by anti-oil activists who have successfully enacted pipeline “Blockadia” in all directions.  Investors have fled the province. The Bank of Canada Governor Steve Poloz is afraid of a ‘fire sale’ of ‘stranded carbon assets.’Who stranded them?  The Tar Sands Campaign and the powers behind it and similar climate change hysteria movements.I say ‘hysteria’ because anyone who has been to Alberta has heard of Big Rock beer – and many have been to the Big Rock – Okotoks – one of the largest known glacial erratic in the world that was pushed by glacial movement 400 km south all the way from the mountain region where Jasper is today, to where it sits near the town of Okotoks, some 54 km south of Calgary.By Coaxial at English Wikipedia, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7753012The power of natural climate change is self-evident to Albertans, and especially the cadre of ~70,000 Professional Geologists and Geophysicists and Professional Engineers of APEGA who have made Western Canada a global SuperCluster in oil and oil sands.Thousands of people work in the extended oil, gas and oil sands R&D, operations and supply chain-related industry in Canada.So, maybe that’s why newly elected Premier Jason Kenney is vowing to call out a foreign-funded Tar Sands Campaign against the Alberta oil sands, and Alberta in general.Kenney cites the findings of researcher Vivian Krause.NIkiforuk mocks Vivian Krause for reporting on the land-locking of the Alberta oil sands (which he calls ‘tar sands’) by foreign-funded activists.  At the outset of his article, he calls the notion of such a campaign against Alberta a “wild and silly conspiracy theory.”And that’s rich. Let’s go down that rabbit hole with Nikiforuk and see where it leads.The Tar Sands Campaign is well-documented in public records, specifically the Corporate Ethics International (CEI, now called CorpEthics) website where it has its own page.[1]  In the bio of team member Michael Marx, Senior Strategic Advisor, he notes that “Michael advised the International Tar Sands Oil Campaign, which included over 100 groups working in the U.S., Europe and Canada….” [2]As noted in the Tar Sands Campaign document,[3] the objective was to:a) raise the negatives;b) raise the costs of doing business;c) slow-down infrastructure expansion;d) enroll key decision-makers while isolating opponents.If there was any question about the ultimate goal:“The long-term goal of this campaign is to accelerate the shift in Canada and the U.S. towards clean energy and lower energy consumption. We believe this can be achieved through a combination of cap and trade legislation to internalize carbon costs, carbon taxes, large government investments in clean energy technology development, incentives for energy conservation, and rapid deceleration of deforestation. With regards to tar sands specifically, our long-term goal is to stop the production of this fuel. “http://www.offsettingresistance.ca/TarSandsCoalition-StrategyPaper2008.pdf  pg 6According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the American use of the term ‘conspiracy’ refers to:“a secret plan made by two or more people to do something bad, illegal, or against someone’s wishes.”Indeed, until the work of researcher Vivian Krause and others like those reported on by Counterpunch (where the leaked Tar Sands Campaign document is posted), the project was a secret.[1]  It’s not clear what legalities might be involved, if any, but the #TarSandsCampaign was certainly against the wishes of Alberta’s workers and the Canadian supply chain to the oil sands, to the government of Alberta, to the oil sands developers, and to investors who have lost share value.  And, it was bad.  Bad because lots of people lost their jobs, some lost their investment, some lost their lives in despair.  Bad because it didn’t stop global emissions anyway and despite trying to paint Canada as some kind of Boy Scout leader on climate change, we have no followers, just lots of competitors making hay while we stupidly trip ourselves up and slap ourselves in the face.What makes Andrew Nikiforuk’s claim that this is a “wild and silly conspiracy theory” so curious is that there is so much evidence.  It seems pretty clear that both the party behind the Tar Sands Campaign, the strategy document, many confirming pieces of evidence, and the outcomes show that the Tar Sands Campaign was originally secret, it was funded by foreign parties, it was enacted pretty much according to plan and by the parties referred to in the Tar Sands Campaign document, the funding and many of the specific activities are found in public records, and the Tar Sands Campaign has been largely successful!This graph from the Alberta Economic Dashboard shows investment in Alberta has completely dived since 2014.And look who came to the party!Source: Raven 2010 annual report. Both Raven and Sierra Club have been funded by TIDES. Greystone books and Andrew Nikiforuk have been funded by TIDES. David Suzuki Fund has reportedly been funded by foundations associated with the Tar Sands Campaign.How is Andrew Nikiforuk a charitable cause?   Funded by Tides Canada Initiatives for $36,446.00.The Tyee and DeSmog also funded by Tides Canada Initiatives.And who can forget “Canada’s Highway to Hell” of Sept. 1, 2007, written for NRDC ?  Guess who wrote it?http://large.stanford.edu/publications/coal/references/nikiforuk/Though Nikiforuk’s article works hard to make the case that no one in the world would ever want Alberta oil even if we could build a pipeline to get it to market, that is nonsense, as explained in this post debunking a similar take in Yahoo Finance of a few weeks ago; debunked by Robert Lyman, an Ottawa energy policy consultant who worked these files as a public servant for most of his 27 years.  Aside from being a critic of the oil sands, why would anyone turn to Nikiforuk as an unbiased source of information on an industry in which he has little to no direct experience?Nikiforuk’s May 21, 2019  article in The Tyee opens with this summary statement: “Alberta’s major exports these days seem to be piles of misinformation, denial, blame, and propaganda on the state-owned Trans Mountain pipeline.”Really?  Look in the mirror, sir.

Earth has ice in its veins and nations like New Zealand are wasting resources and energy needlessly panicking over fossil fuels and so-called “climate emergencies”, says a New Zealand geologist once dubbed by _Stuff_ as one of the“intellectual heavyweights of the Canterbury geological sciences department”.



Over the years, I’ve noticed two obvious patterns: firstly, geologists, who are used to dealing with deep time and big pictures, tend to be remarkably sceptical about climate alarmism. Secondly, older and retired scientists even more so. As no less than David Suzuki argues, scientists who no longer have to toe the line of academic conventional wisdom in order to chase down grant money – or risk outright career destruction, like Peter Ridd – are dangerous to scientific groupthink, simply because they’re freer to say what they **really** think.



Professor David Shelley argues that the key assumptions of the climate alarmists are simply untrue, or of no concern.



Activists, with some success, are demanding climate emergencies be declared around the world, making those demands on the basis that temperatures are at record highs, glaciers and sea ice are melting at unprecedented rates, and sea levels rising dangerously.



A cursory examination of the geological literature shows that the first two assertions are simply not true, and that rising sea levels are par for the course.



Earth has been much hotter (up to 10C hotter) for the vast majority of geological time. Jurassic Park was very hot, and when the dinosaurs suddenly died out 65 million years ago, the succeeding age of mammals was similarly very hot. The last million years (a mere heartbeat on the geological time-scale) has been atypically cold, with extraordinarily large fluctuations in temperature…the record would suggest we might soon descend into another dangerously cold glaciation.



I grew up in a beachside suburb. Not far away was a spit with a hill at its end. I later learned that, at one time, that hill had been an island. Before that, the entire bay was a vast, shallow valley. **Sea levels rise and fall constantly.**



Sea levels are rising, but just 12,000 years ago, at the end of the last glaciation, sea levels were as much as 140m lower than today, and they then rose dramatically as we entered this interglacial. Sea levels were significantly higher than today just a very short time ago.



Sea levels were also significantly higher in the last interglacial 125,000 years ago; Florida Keys, for example, is the remains of a coral reef that grew then.



The really major ice melt was during the transition from the last glaciation to today. Canada was covered entirely by a massive sheet of ice with no vegetation and New Zealand’s South Island lakes were 1km-thick glaciers — so today’s reductions in sea ice and glacier volumes are quite trivial.



But what about those dangerous greenhouse gases?



Alarmists assert that despite all that, CO2 is a greenhouse gas and we are pumping large quantities of it into the atmosphere, causing catastrophic warming. But the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does not know how potent CO2 is as a greenhouse gas…if climate sensitivity is low (close to one) then our emissions will never dangerously warm Earth. Climate sensitivity due to CO2 alone is actually just one, but climate scientists add all sorts of uncertain feedback effects to make it higher.



Which sounds suspiciously like massaging data to fit the theory, a key characteristic of pseudoscience.



It is an indictment of our education system that students are convinced today’s climate change is extraordinary when it falls well within the bounds of natural climate change. They should be told, too, that we do not know how potent CO2 is as a greenhouse gas.



None of this means we should treat our world with cavalier disregard. But surely we should concentrate on real problems, which we can fix, rather than fretting about scary sky dragons.



We must stop polluting the oceans, stop overfishing, find more sustainable sources of electricity and control population growth. Given the present reality that large nations such as China dominate global emissions and are increasing them, nations such as Australia and New Zealand need not panic over the use of fossil fuels…I suggest to the activists that the clarion call for action should be “managing the environment and sustainability”, not “stopping climate change”.



The very idea that we can stop climate change is barking mad. **Climate change is inevitable, as geology has always shown.**



  
In fact, the favourite slogans of the climate alarmists are all-but nonsensical: “climate change is real”? Who actually imagines that Earth is naturally a stable system? Climate alarmists, apparently.

"**Healthier white bread could be available on supermarket shelves within five years after scientists discovered how to double its fibre content.**
A group of scientists has pinpointed the genes responsible for the dietary content of flour.
They say the new flour offers a range of health benefits such as a reduced risk of cancer, diabetes and obesity.
Study lead author Dr Alison Lovegrove said the high-fibre loaf would taste the same as normal white bread.
The research was carried out by the University of Bristol, Rothamsted Research Institute in Hertfordshire and the John Innes Centre in Norwich.
The team's work identified the parts of the wheat genome controlling fibre content of white flour.
""Using conventional breeding techniques, we crossed this high-fibre trait into several other varieties,"" Dr Lovegrove said.
""This allowed us to narrow down where in its genome the genes for high fibre are.
""We've developed genetic markers that can easily be used by plant breeders to identify which individual wheat plants have the high-fibre genes.""
A slice of typical white bread has about 1g of fibre, whereas a slice from a high-fibre white loaf could contain up to 2g. Wholemeal has about 3g.
Wholemeal bread is widely regarded as being healthier but white bread still outsells it, making up three-quarters of the roughly 12 million loaves sold in the UK each day.
Dr Lovegrove said: ""We made some bread from our high fibre wheat and it tastes exactly the same.
""We have to get this high-fibre trait into commercial wheat lines. We think it will take five to six years as a best case scenario."""
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who spent 27 years as a public servant in senior policy advisory roles related to Kyoto and GHG reductions; prior to that, he was a diplomat for 10 years.  This article is one of a continuing series in which I report on and analyse trends in global personal light duty vehicles sales, with a special focus on the role that plug-in electric vehicles play in total sales and vehicle stock and the potential consequences for global oil demand. In previous reports, I have described the International Energy Agency’s projections, as part of its Energy Technology Perspectives reports, that the global electric light duty vehicle (i.e. cars and SUVs) stock would increase from two million in 2017 to 56 million in 2030. In its recent World Energy Outlook 2019 report, British Petroleum projected (under its “Evolving Transition” scenario) that all-electric light duty passenger vehicle on the roads might increase to 300 million by 2040 and constitute 15 per cent of the global passenger vehicle stock. I previously proposed a scorecard by which one might assess whether plug-in electric vehicles are on track to meet the expectations of their proponents. I suggested that if, by 2020, the global inventory of EVs is three million or less, this would demonstrate conclusively that the technology is facing serious market barriers that might limit its growth for decades. A 2020 EV population of 20 million would align with the more optimistic claims. A stock in the range of 7.4 million to 13 million is consistent with growth trends seen to mid-2018, and while impressive, would not substantiate promoters’ more optimistic claims. What Has Happened? In keeping with past reports, I have used the best online sources of data available concerning plug-in electric light duty vehicle sales. These include InsideEVs, which provides data on monthly and annual sales for the United States and the world, and the International Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) for national and global sales of all light duty vehicles. I also use the reports of the U.S. Energy Information administration to document current and projected global oil demand trends. The following table shows EV sales since the beginning of 2014.Table 1Sales of Electric Plug-In Light Duty VehiclesYear     U.S.World2014122,938320,7132015116,099550,2972016158,614777,4972017199,8261,227,1172018361,3072,018,247201982,500*495,344** Source: InsideEVs*January-April, 2019**January-March, 2019 Both U.S. and global sales showed strong growth in from 2017 to 2018, rising 80 per cent and 64 per cent respectively. This has been supported by continuation of substantial subsidy programs in most countries. The sales data for the early months of 2019 are somewhat less robust. For the first four months of 2019, U.S. sales are only 10 per cent higher than in 2018. Global sales during the first three months of 2019 are 63 per cent higher than the comparable period of 2018, showing perhaps that the global trends are stronger. The highest vehicle sales usually occur later in the year. What Does This Mean for the Global Vehicle Fleet? The following table provides some context by comparing plug-in vehicle sales to the sales of all light duty vehicles.Table 2Sales of All Light Duty Vehicles (million)YearU.S.World20147.765.720157.566.320166.969.520176.170.82018n/an/a Source: OICA As you will note, light duty vehicle sales in the United States have declined for the past four years, while global sales have increased. In 2018, there were almost 71 million light duty vehicle sales globally. The following graph, also from OICA, shows how global personal vehicle sales have increased since 2005.Table 3 compares EV sales to total personal vehicle sales globally and in the U.S.Table 3Plug-In EV Sales as a Share of Total Sales (%)YearU.S.World20141.60.4920151.50.8320162.31.1220173.31.7320185.52.84 So EVs are increasing their percentage share of light duty vehicle sales, with one out of every 20 cars sold in the U.S being a plug-in and but only 3 out of every 100 cars sold worldwide. . The picture is even more striking if one views it in terms of the total vehicle stock (i.e. all the light duty vehicles now on the roads). There are no authoritative estimates of this, but a 2014 study by Navigant Research estimated the total to be almost 1.2 billion then, and more recent vehicle industry reports project that this total will reach 1.3 billion by 2020. OICA’s published figures only go to 2015, and indicate a stock of 947 million personal vehicles then. Inside EV’s estimates of the total stock of plug-in vehicles is shown in Table 4.Table 4Global Stock of EVs 2014 – 2017Year     Vehicles (thousand)2014703.620151,239.420161,982.020173,109.020185,600.0 If we assume that the total personal vehicle stock is now at least 1.2 billion vehicles, then EVs constitute five one-thousandths of the present stock. At present rates of growth, a total EV stock in the range of 7.4 to 13 million EVs in the world by 2020 is probable, but the high end of the range looks like a stretch. If EVs attained that milestone, they would constitute just over one per cent of the total personal vehicle fleet. World Oil Demand According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the world’s consumers used 98.2 million barrels of crude oil in 2017. While the number varies depending upon the characteristic of the crude oil, on average somewhere between 50% and 55% of a barrel is used to produce gasoline and diesel fuel for light duty vehicles and trucks. Road vehicles are more than 97% dependent on oil for motive power. Global oil demand has been rising at the rate of over one million barrels per day per year since 2012. This is the fastest rate of demand growth in history. Over the past decade of 2009 to 2018, global crude oil demand has risen from 84.3 million barrels per day to 99.3 million barrels per day, an average of 1.5 million barrels per day per year. https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/ According to the most recent short-term energy outlook report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, global oil demand will rise by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2019 and by another 1.5 million barrels per day in 2020, to reach a total of over 103 million barrels per day, a level many forecasters had thought would not be reached until 2030 at the earliest.Conclusion In summary, EV sales continue to grow at a fast pace from a low starting point and have carved out a niche, especially in markets where governments can afford the large subsidies that underpin sales. The pace of future sales growth remains uncertain but the growth that has occurred so far shows that plug-in vehicles have passed the first hurdle in terms of being a viable alternative to internal combustion engines in some markets. Unless present trends accelerate, however, it seems unlikely that the size of the total EV stock will reach the 13 million figure globally by 2020. Where sales go after that is anyone’s guess. While impressive, EVs are still a small part of the total vehicle stock, and even rapid growth in EV sales seems likely to have little impact on the growth of oil demand, or global carbon emissions, for some years to come.  ~~~~Related:Electric Vehicle Considerations for CanadaShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Three items appeared last week that make me wonder if _The Onion_ is surreptitiously acquiring science journals and trade publications. Here’s what one, “ _ScienceNordic_ ” says it does on its home page:



Our team of experienced science reporters and editors follow the regional scientific communities closely, and report constantly and relentlessly on the latest and greatest discoveries.



 **NEWS FLASH #1** : According to _ScienceNordic_ , global obesity is caused by eating too much. Eating too much is caused by increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide.



Surely one of the “latest and greatest discoveries” of our time! To wit: a Danish researcher, Lars‐​Georg Hersoug and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen put six—count em’—six volunteers into rooms either with ambient carbon dioxide or elevated concentrations. After seven hours, they could eat whatever they wanted. Those who breathed higher CO2 ate six percent more. Call ScienceNordic!!



Yeah. This is what masquerades as environmental science these days. Allowing for an equal number of controls means that only three individuals were in each group. There is simply no way that these results have any statistical validity, but, hey, we’re talking about carbon dioxide, the death gas. Forget suing McDonald’s for obesity, Exxon‐​Mobil has a lot more dough!



Furthering my hypotheses about _The Onion_ , you have to wonder if it has bought Geophysical Research Letters from the American Geophysical Union.



 **NEWS FLASH #2** : Models that don’t work provide “useful estimates” for engineers.



Huh? But, indeed, a recent edition of GRL contains a paper by Francina Dominguez of the University of Arizona (with three co‐​authors) on changes in winter precipitation for the western U.S. predicted by regional climate models. They compared the observed average and historical 50‐​year record daily rainfall to values simulated by eight climate models. Gaze and weep:





Area‐​averaged mean (left) and 50‐​year maximum expected daily rainfall (right) for four western regions plus the entire area (“all”). The black marks are the models and the red dots are reality. This is what climate model failure looks like.



Damn the data! Full speed ahead!! Despite the fact that the models don’t work, they go on to generate estimates of the differences in daily and extreme precipitation projected for the middle of this century compared to the recent past. This is not “useful” information. It is bad information.



 **NEWS FLASH #3** : A great idea: “1984” in 2084.



People were horrified that the socialist dystopia in George Orwell’s _1984_ employed sophisticated “science” for behavioral modification and social integration. S. Matthew Liao of New York University and two colleagues think such things in fact should be considered because global warming is so horrible.



They write in the journal _Ethics, Policy and Environment_ , “our central aim here is to show that human engineering deserves consideration alongside other solutions in the debate about how to solve the problem of climate change”, they then propose some examples that they think are feasible, including



• a pill or a patch that would induce nausea when people eat meat



• embryo selection or hormonal modification to make people smaller



• drugs to enhance empathy and altruism, because “higher empathy levels correlate with stronger environmental behaviors”



• a fixed allocation of greenhouse gas emissions per family to limit the number of children



In an interview in _The Atlantic_ , Liao vociferously asserted that he does not think that these changes should be mandated, rather he says they should be “modifications borne of individual choices”. In his paper he is a bit more specific:



As we envisage it, human engineering would be a _voluntary activity_ — possibly supported by incentives such as tax breaks or sponsored health care — rather than a _coerced, mandatory activity_.



Excuse me, but charging people higher taxes for not taking a pill that makes them sick, for not aborting embryos that may become tall children, for not taking drugs to care about global warming, and for not limiting progeny is nothing but coercive.



Astoundingly, Mr. Liao argues that the nausea pill enhances liberty because people who want a steak will make decisions based upon that desire, rather than “truly deciding” to be coerced by a state‐​incentivized drug. In Mr. Liao’s world, like George Orwell’s, freedom is slavery.



Count me out on this one. Hopefully, _The Onion_ or whoever will stop publishing papers providing “useful estimates” for engineers based on models that do not work. And while we are at it, we could actually take a little responsibility for our weight, instead of blaming Exxon‐​Mobile.

We have students wagging school. We have councils and even whole countries declaring climate emergencies when, for the most part, the weather is still behaving pretty much as it normally does. I mean – it is winter, so it is cold, right? Yes, it is. Jacinda claimed that climate change was her generation’s ‘nuclear moment’, without even a touch of irony, as that ‘nuclear moment’ never actually happened, and there has not been a nuclear attack since World War II.



Speaking of World War II:



Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter has declared climate change “our generation’s WWII” in her defence of proposed car price hikes.



Genter, also Minister for Women, made the declaration on Twitter while defending the Government’s [proposed fees](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/07/the-popular-vehicles-tipped-for-discounts-and-fees-in-2021.html) for cars being imported that don’t meet a ‘clean car’ policy tipped for 2021.



Vehicles that emit over 250 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre (CO2/km) would be considered heavy polluters so importing those vehicles would come with a financial penalty of up to $3000.



**“The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our time. It’s our generation’s WWII. We are the first generation to feel its impacts,” Genter said.**



What an absolute disgrace. I don’t know where to begin with this.



“New Zealand was too small to win WWII. But that didn’t stop many of our forebears from putting their hand up. They put their lives on hold, and travelled far away, to be part of a larger effort, because it was the right thing to do.” 



  
People went to war to defend their way of life against an evil regime that was racist (particularly anti-Semitic), that tortured and murdered literally millions of people for no good reason, and that intended to take over the whole of Europe and subject all British and European citizens to a similar fate. People didn’t just ‘put their lives on hold’. Many died fighting to give future generations the continued freedoms that they themselves had enjoyed. To say anything else is an insult to the sacrifices of our parents and grandparents generation, who did not just roll over in the face of an evil threat but stood up against it… sometimes paying the ultimate price.



12,000 New Zealanders lost their lives in World War II. Actually, so did a large number of Americans, so I do not intend to denigrate the US effort in the war either. This woman, with her childish, blinkered view of the world just managed to insult the efforts of millions of ordinary people who went to war, not because they wanted to, but because they refused to submit to living under Nazi (or Japanese) rule.



How can you compare that with a bit of weather? Even if climate change is true (oh, sorry, it is an ’emergency’ now) it may mean more storms, it may mean gradual sea level rises, it may mean hotter temperatures. It will also mean that those countries flagrantly ignoring the situation, such as China and India, will be the hardest hit, and life in places like New Zealand will be likely to continue much as it does now, possibly with some adjustments, particularly in low lying areas. It does not mean anyone is likely to have their skin turned into lampshades, or have ink injected into their veins just to see what the results are. Nor does it mean trainloads of people sent off to concentration camps, or killed in the gas chambers.



Climate change is not this generation’s World War II moment, and the fact that Genter could ever liken climate change to a terrible war where millions of people were killed just shows how ignorant, disrespectful and hollow she really is.



When people start comparing gradual weather changes to a global massacre and full-scale war, someone has lost the plot. Who is the climate change enemy? Well, we all know the answer to that, of course. It is the climate change deniers as opposed to the climate Nazis. 



All this has come about because Genter received some well-deserved criticism for her proposed taxes on non-electric vehicles. 



There is something fundamentally wrong with an electorate system that allows people like Julie-Anne Genter and Golriz Gharaman, who are not elected anywhere, into government. We are being held to ransom by these dangerous fools and we didn’t even vote them in.



Maybe it really is time for another war. I don’t wish for it, but people like Genter need to understand that there is no possible comparison between landing on the beaches of Normandy and a slightly warmer summer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warming crazies keep insisting that weather has become more extreme, but whenever a study looks at the past weather, it finds the opposite to be true.
The latest is a new study titled “Historical extreme rainfall events in southeastern Australia” authored by Ashcroft et al appearing in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes.
It finds no trend in NSW Australia extreme rainfall events, and oceanic cycles play a major role in the longer term, decadal scale variability.
Hat-tip: Reader Mary Brown
Looking back 178 years
The new paper describes rainfall in three of Australia’s largest cities for the last 178 years using several mean and extreme rainfall indices.
The paper also found several extreme daily rainfall events in the pre-1900 period in Sydney and Melbourne which “appear to be more extreme than anything in the modern record”.
Abstract
The cities of Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide are home to almost half of the Australian population, and are often exposed to extreme rainfall events and high year-to-year rainfall variability. However the majority of studies into rainfall in these cities, and southeastern Australia in general, are limited to the 20th century due to data availability. In this study we use rainfall data from a range of sources to examine four rainfall indices for Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide for 1839–2017. We derive the total rainfall, number of raindays, wettest day of the month and the simple daily intensity index for each city over the past 178 years, and find relatively consistent relationships between all indices despite potential data quality issues associated with the historical data. We identify several extreme daily rainfall events in the pre-1900 period in Sydney and Melbourne that warrant further examination as they appear to be more extreme than anything in the modern record. We find a moderate and relatively stable relationship between El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and annual variations of total rainfall and the number of raindays at all three cities over the research period, but no relationship between ENSO and the annual wettest day, in agreement with other studies using shorter time series.”

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019. Lyman’s bio can be read here.The figures in this paper are drawn from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019, and relate to the emissions, in carbon dioxide equivalent, from the combustion of energy. These are about 80% of greenhouse gas emissions.The prevailing fiction about climate change in Canada and much of the world is that people must make major changes in their use of energy in order to join a global movement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One of the reasons why it is a fiction is that global greenhouse gas emissions are, in fact, increasing, just as they have been for most of the last 29 years since claims of human-caused global warming first gained public attention.The last decade, from 2008 to 2018, has witnessed a 12 per cent growth in global emissions, according to the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 2019. This occurred in spite of the worst and most prolonged economic recession since the Great Depression. During the last year, 2017-2018, emissions grew two per cent, twice their annual average rate over the previous decade. Wikipedia Somewhat obscured by these global averages is that the growth in emissions has been driven by a large wave of growth in China’s economy. That growth was so significant, and China’s reliance on fossil fuels for energy so important, that China’s emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent grew from 7.4 billion tonnes in 2008 to 9.4 billion tonnes in 2018, by far the highest in the world. China’s emissions growth alone accounted for almost 58% of the world’s emissions growth over the decade. That was the first wave of a large series of increases in emissions by the developing countries as they seek to increase their economic growth and living standards so as to move closer to the standards enjoyed by the wealthier countries. China’s wave is far from finished. In fact, by 2030 China’s emissions will probably be over three times those of the United States, the second largest emitter.Somewhat less obvious from the statistics, however, is that we are soon likely to see three more waves of emissions increases that will shape the future.The next wave will be the ever-increasing emissions growth in India. India is already the fourth largest emitter in the world. Its emissions grew from 1,467 million tonnes in 2008 to 2,479 million tonnes in 2018, an amazing 69 per cent. Despite government commitments to reduce its emissions intensity and to increase the share of renewable energy in its electricity generation, India’s fast-growing use of coal-fired power plants and its efforts to grow its economy in every way will continue the emissions growth. This is largely driven by population growth. By 2028, India’s population will reach 1.5 billion and exceed that of China.There are two more waves coming right behind India. The first wave is the growth of emissions from the countries of south and southeast Asia.Table 1 shows the present and projected growth of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from these countries, under the assumption that their emissions growth from 2018 to 2030 is at the same rate as their growth over the last decade.Table 1 Emissions from Selected Countries in South and Southeast Asia
      (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent)Country2018 Emissions2030 EmissionsIndonesia543 831Vietnam224533Thailand302399Singapore230 343Malaysia250328Taiwan286320Philippines134264Bangladesh90208Total18593142Under these assumptions, by 2030 the emissions of the countries of South and Southeast Asia, not counting China and India, would exceed those of the European Union.The fourth wave of global emissions growth will be from the countries of the Middle East. The western public generally thinks of the Middle East as a desert area with high oil and natural gas production and low population. Instead, the population there is one of the fastest growing in the world. Table 2 shows the present and projected growth in emissions from the five largest emitters there, using the same assumptions as in Table 1.Table 2    Emissions from Selected Countries in the Middle East
          (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent)Country2008 Emissions2030 EmissionsIran656 892Saudi Arabia571811Turkey390542UAE 277379Egypt224309Total21182933The most recent authoritative projections of global emissions were published by the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) in September 2019. In its International Energy Outlook, the EIA projected that in the period to 2050, world energy consumption will rise nearly 50% and carbon dioxide emissions will grow from 2018 levels to about 43 billion tonnes per year by 2050, with almost all the growth occurring in the non-OECD (i.e. developing) countries.In short, there is overwhelming evidence that global emissions are increasing and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This is the context in which Canadians should view calls for costly emissions reductions here.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
" Contributed byFRANCIS TUCKER MANNS, PH.D., P.GEO (ONTARIO)©2019ARTESIAN GEOLOGICAL RESEARCH Contrary to popular media and urban mythology the global warming we have experienced since the Little Ice Age is likely finished. A review of 10 temperature time series from US cities ranging from the hottest in Death Valley, CA, to possible the most isolated and remote at Key West, FL, show rebound from the Little Ice Age (which ended in the Alps by 1840) by 1870. The United States reached temperatures like modern temperatures (1950 – 2000) by about 1870, then declined precipitously principally caused by Krakatoa, and a series of other violent eruptions. Nine of these time series started when instrumental measurement was in its infancy and the world was cooled by volcanic dust and sulphate spewed into the atmosphere and distributed by the jet streams. These ten cities represent a sample of the millions of temperature measurements used in climate models. The average annual temperatures are useful because they account for seasonal fluctuations. In addition, time series from these cities are punctuated by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).As should be expected, temperature at each city reacted differently to differing events. Several cities measured the effects of Krakatoa in 1883 while only Death Valley, CA and Berkeley CA sensed the minor new volcano Paricutin in Michoacán, Mexico. The Key West time series shows rapid rebound from the Little Ice Age as do Albany, NY, Harrisburg, PA, and Chicago. IL long before the petroleum-industrial revolution got into full swing. Recording at most sites started during a volcanic induced temperature minimum thus giving an impression of global warming to which industrial carbon dioxide is persuasively held responsible. Carbon dioxide, however, cannot be proven responsible for these temperatures. These and likely subsequent temperatures could be the result of regression to the normal equilibrium temperatures of the earth (for now). If one were to remove the volcanic punctuation and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) input many would display very little alarming warming from 1815 to 2000. This review illustrates the weakness of linear regression as a measure of change. If there is a systemic reason for the global warming hypothesis, it is an anthropogenic error in both origin and termination. ENSO compliments and confirms the validity of NOAA temperature data. Temperatures since 2000 during the current hiatus are not available because NOAA has closed the public website.LINK TO FULL PAPER: Volcanoes ENSO and Carbon Dioxide (1)Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



From [The Guardian, February 21, 2004](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/feb/22/usnews.theobserver)



Only four years after saying there would be no snow, the Brits were promised Siberia! 



[…] Britain is plunged into a ‘Siberian’ climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world. 



Only a couple of months left, folks; mega-droughts, widespread rioting, famine. Get your prepper pack ready now.



The article continues:



An imminent scenario of catastrophic climate change is ‘plausible and would challenge United States national security in ways that should be considered immediately’, they conclude. **As early as next year widespread flooding by a rise in sea levels will create major upheaval for millions.**



Did you notice the widespread flooding in 2005 due to rising sea levels? Nah, me neither.



Current score: Experts 0 – Reality 19.

Liberal activist Naomi Klein has a new book out provocatively subtitled “Capitalism vs. the Climate.” (For those of you who don’t want to buy her book, an essay she wrote a couple years ago with the same title is here.)   
  
  
What amuses me about her attempt to pit capitalism and the climate against each other is that I came across an excerpt from the book in the Toronto _Globe and Mail_ in which, unwittingly, she advocated policies that, even accepting the debate on her terms, can’t be good for the climate.   
  
  
Not surprisingly, she supports subsidies for renewable energy. It’s hard to have renewable energy without those. But what struck me was that she also argued for tying those subsidies to the use of local content. For example, there is a government program in Ontario that subsidizes solar energy, _but only if the energy suppliers use a certain percentage of labor and materials that are made in Ontario_.   
  
  
There are two obvious and related problems with such a requirement. First, by requiring local inputs, you make your product more expensive (especially when local means high‐​cost Canada). If your goal is cheaper renewable energy, raising the price of inputs doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.   
  
  
Second, the idea that each sub‐​federal government should promote local production of a particular product is absurd. Imagine if that happened worldwide: there would be thousands of producers of these products! I can’t think of a more inefficient and energy‐​wasting approach to manufacturing.   
  
  
Just to be clear, I know many strong supporters of taking action against climate change who do not believe in this kind of protectionist approach. They recognize that local content requirements are economically harmful and shouldn’t be part of these policies. For reasons that are difficult to understand, Klein seems to have missed this pretty obvious point. (I did tweet it at her, but I’m not expecting much from that!)

"Everyone has theories for why     professionals are moving back into parts of cities shunned by their parents’ generation. Perhaps their living preferences have shifted. Or the demands of the labor market have, and young adults with less leisure time are loath to waste it commuting. Maybe the tendency to postpone marriage and children has made city living more alluring. Or the benefits of cities themselves have improved. “There are all sorts of potential other amenities, whether it’s cafes, restaurants, bars, nicer parks, better schools,” said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. “But a huge piece of it,” she said, “I think is crime. ” New research that she has conducted alongside Keren Mertens Horn, an economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and Davin Reed, a doctoral student at N. Y. U. finds that when violent crime falls sharply, wealthier and educated people are more likely to move into   and predominantly minority urban neighborhoods. Their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities, falling crime has a comparable effect, spurring gentrification. And it highlights how, even if many Americans  —   including, by his own words,   Donald Trump  —   inaccurately believe urban violence is soaring, the opposite   trend has brought   change to cities. “We’re trying to help people understand what a dramatic difference the reduction in violent crime in particular has made in our environment,” Ms. Ellen said. “That has repercussions far beyond what we think of. The homicide rate has gone down  —   that’s directly the most important consequence. But there are all sorts of repercussions as well. This really has been a sea change. ” Nationally, violent crime peaked in 1991. It fell precipitously for the next decade, then more slowly through the 2000s (and there’s a whole other set of theories about why that has happened). While homicides have increased recently in some cities, rates remain far below what they were 25 years ago, including in Chicago. (Another    reality check, while we’re at it: Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that homicides in his new home in Washington were rising by 50 percent, apparently citing the previous year’s crime statistics. At that time in July, though, the rate in the city was already falling compared with 2015, and by year’s end, it was down by 17 percent.) The new research looked at confidential geocoded data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses, and more recent American Community Surveys, to identify the neighborhoods where more than four million households moved. Using citywide violent crime data from the F. B. I. the scholars tracked the changing probability of different demographic groups moving into central cities, as opposed to suburbs, as crime fell.   and   movers  —   and to a lesser degree, whites  —   appeared significantly more sensitive to changing crime levels in their housing decisions than other groups.   and minority households, for instance, didn’t become more likely to move to cities as they grew safer. That may reflect the fact, Ms. Ellen suggested, that   families have more experience or confidence in their ability to navigate crime. Or it may suggest that attention to violence is a luxury in housing decisions that the poor and minorities may not have. A household facing racial discrimination, high housing costs or the need to be near supportive family members simply has fewer options  —   and less leeway to be choosy  —   than the     households that this research identifies. “When cities feel safer, that opens people’s eyes,” Ms. Ellen said of the willingness of new groups to consider these neighborhoods. It’s entirely likely that the arrival of more affluent residents affected crime, too  —   either by increasing opportunities for property crime in the short term, or by adding eyes on the street and pressure on the police in the long run. Because this research looked at moves that occurred after crime was already falling, the authors believe the movers were reacting to changes in crime and not simply causing it themselves. But the relationship between crime and gentrification in particular is complex. Wealthier residents may bring new tensions to neighborhoods, fearing  —   and reporting  —   criminal activity where none exists. And such demographic change in cities could play a role in pressuring the police to pursue tactics that feel unduly aggressive to the people who preceded the newcomers. This study also doesn’t offer evidence that existing residents were displaced by the new arrivals. Many of the urban neighborhoods studied had lost population, so they had room to grow again without pushing existing residents out. But the possibility that these trends portend higher housing costs and more housing demand in the future in poorer, minority neighborhoods adds a cautionary note, Ms. Ellen said, to the declining crime trend."
"She skipped almost every class her sophomore year and still maintained perfect attendance. The trick was to drop in for the start of third period, wait for attendance to be recorded for the day and then leave with a bathroom pass. By the time her mother found out about the scheme, Skylynn Vazquez was failing every subject. Most days, Saquan Bright did not bother to show up at Boys and Girls High School in   Brooklyn. He chose to roam the streets with his friends. But then Ms. Vazquez and Mr. Bright found a school designed for students like them: Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service in Clinton Hill, which is operated by Brooklyn Community Services, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Leadership, one of 57 transfer schools in New York City  —   established to help students struggling in traditional schools  —   has 202 students ages 16 to 21. By the time students reach Leadership, they have either dropped out of their regular schools or neared that point because of low grades or poor attendance. Many come from unstable homes, living with single parents in shelters and temporary housing, and have spent time in the criminal justice system. And 82 percent of the students qualify for free lunch because of their family’s income. The flexible school schedule  —   which allows for free periods  —   enables students to concentrate on courses required to graduate. And the school provides an optional paid internship program, which is appealing to students, some of whom help support their families or who are legally emancipated and support themselves. Before Leadership, Mr. Bright could not keep up with the demands at Boys and Girls High School. He struggled to pay attention in class, and could not finish tests in time. Still, he was not tested for a learning disability until he was enrolled at Leadership. Now he receives services at Leadership and extended time for tests, and his grades have improved. At her previous school, in Bushwick, Ms. Vazquez purposefully broke the rules. She wore hats at school every day, even though they were forbidden, and each one was taken away. “There was a point where I didn’t have any of my hats,” she said. “All 30 of my hats were locked in the dean’s office. ” She enrolled at that school midway through her freshman year, after moving from Florida. She recalled skipping classes and darting off to play basketball and video games with a handful of friends, most of whom have since dropped out, she said. “We were a bad influence on each other,” she said. “If one of us wasn’t in the mood to go to class, we’d all leave. We pushed each other to do the wrong thing. ” In March 2014, Ms. Vazquez’s mother  —   enraged by the discovery of what her daughter had been doing  —   spoke with administrators at the school, who suggested that her daughter enroll at Leadership. Ms. Vasquez, nervous about again switching schools, did not want to go, but when she arrived, she immediately found a support system there. Classes were small, with 20 to 25 students, allowing a nurturing,   learning environment. Students are on a   basis with all the teachers, including the principal. “Respect can be calling someone by their last name, but sometimes when you call someone by their first name, you feel like maybe you’re on a different level,” Stacey Fischler, the school’s program director, said. Students have access to advocate counselors, who are similar to social workers and help them with issues beyond academics, sometimes referring them to mental health services or youth shelters. Each counselor, assigned to 40 to 50 students, is tasked  —   to the point of pestering  —   with making sure they all go to school. “My priority is to make sure you get your education,” said Heather Hansen, a counselor. “Whether that is going to your house and knocking down your door or calling you like a lunatic all day or bothering your parents. That’s my goal. ” Ms. Vazquez smiled as she scrolled through those daily morning texts. At 6:25 a. m. on Nov. 2: “Rise  Shine Scholars. The grind continues. ” Two days later, at 6:44 a. m.: “Rise  Shine #TGIF. ” “I don’t think they sleep,” Ms. Vazquez said, laughing. “It’s a very supportive school. ” More than 14, 000 students attended transfer schools in New York City as of the   school year, the latest for which the Department of Education provided data.   graduation rates for the schools are much lower than the overall rate for New York City public schools, which increased in recent years to 70. 5 percent in 2015. Although the class of 2015 at Leadership had a 5. 6 percent   graduation rate, that rate improves over additional years  —   typical of many transfer schools. About a quarter of students graduate within six years, according to Department of Education data. Despite lower rates, the schools are serving students who may have otherwise dropped out, never receiving a diploma. “You’re working with a population that can be changed, that does need help and doesn’t get targeted often,” Ms. Hansen said. “You’re working with a population that is getting a second chance. And it’s nice to be able to give that. At the end of the day, it can be frustrating and taxing, but you get to see them walk across the stage, and that’s the main goal. ” For Mr. Bright, graduation day seemed unlikely two years ago. In spring 2014, he fell behind again, started ditching classes and almost dropped out. That August, when he was standing on a street corner in   a car passed by. Shots rang out, hitting him in the abdomen. Members of his family and of the Leadership staff surrounded his hospital bed. “There’s a lot of love there,” he said. He returned to school with renewed commitment. The Leadership family also kept Ms. Vazquez in school. “I have good friends and a good support system when I get to school every morning,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d get this far. But now I see a difference in myself, in how I react and how I say and do things. I’ve become a totally different person, and a lot of it comes from this school. ” Both Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez are looking forward to graduation. Mr. Bright, who will turn 22 this month, is allowed to finish this school year before he ages out of the public school system. He needs to pass one more Regents exam, for algebra, his most dreaded subject. So Brooklyn Community Services has allocated $500 in Neediest Cases funds to provide him with    tutoring. More than   of Leadership students, including Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez, participate in an     program. They have paid internships at places including Burlington Coat Factory, child care centers and the Brooklyn Veterinary Group. Last semester, Ms. Vazquez, 20, received an internship at 3 Black Cats Café and Cakery in Brooklyn, where she worked in the kitchen. It was the first job, Ms. Vazquez said, that she took pride in. “To bake something from scratch and perfect it,” she said. “Knowing that it represents your work, that is new for me. ” The internship ended in November, but she hopes to work at another restaurant. Her love for cooking started in her grandmother’s kitchen. They followed traditional Puerto Rican recipes, including pasteles, a dish of plantains, meat and olives. Now she cooks to remember her grandmother, who died last spring. After graduation in March, she hopes to continue her passion and has applied to culinary schools in upstate New York. When she talked to her grandmother about graduation, her grandmother would say, “Vamos a ver”  —   she would believe it when she saw it. “And now she’ll see,” Ms. Vazquez said with a smile."
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who worked as a public servant for 27 years and as a diplomat for ten years prior to that service. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThis is the third and final in a series of articles on the funding and activities of large environmental organizations in Canada, many of which play major political roles in opposing resource industry development and pipeline construction based on the thesis that this will address global warming.LINK to report: Green Titanic FINAL RevA April 29 2019This article describes how recent changes in the Income Tax Act and regulations governing charities and a recent court decision have freed activist environmental organizations with charity status from previous constraints on their ability to conduct and fund political activities.Federal and provincial governments in Canada now provide $170 billion per year in grants and contributions to registered charities.Charities then raise an additional $80 billion per year based on private contributions, some of which are stimulated by their registered charity status; the cost to the federal treasury alone of this is $5 billion per year; the cost to provincial government treasuries is unknown.Until recently, the Income Tax Act barred registered charities from spending more than 10 per cent of their revenues on political activities, which were defined narrowly to include only partisan support for candidates or political parties seeking election. They allowed charities to spend more on other political activities such as lobbying of politicians, publishing information, launching public advertising campaigns to oppose energy developments, mobilizing supporters to oppose certain laws, or organizing public demonstrations and blockades. Today, only about 5,000 charities, or 5 per cent of those in Canada, report being involved in political activities.The Trudeau government passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Budget bill in 2018 authorizing charities to carry on unlimited “public policy dialogue and development activities” to influence laws and policies. In July 2018 Justice Edward Morgan of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the Income Tax Act’s 10 per cent limitation on partisan political activity was unconstitutional. The Trudeau government decided to not appeal the ruling.As a result of this legislative change and court decision, registered charity status now gives an organization, including activist environmental organizations, the freedom to spend up to 100% of its revenues on political activities, so long as these are consistent with its “charity” objectives.The Trudeau government has directed CRA to stop requiring charities to report on how they spend on political activities, so it is unclear how anyone will be able to judge in future whether the activities carried out are consistent with charity status.These developments open the door wide to potential abuses of political spending by radical ENGOs and other organizations that want to get heavily into political funding and can afford to do so.The impact on the alignment of forces supporting and opposing resource development in Canada could be profound. The environmental organizations opposing development have enormous and probably permanent funding advantages, far greater than any political party could match. The long-term economic effects of this funding advantage could be especially damaging for provinces and regions whose prosperity depends on resource-based development.Previous Reports in this series:Dark Green Moneyhttps://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Dark-Green-Money-Foundation-Funding-Jan-11-2019.pdf  Big Green Moneyhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-1.pdf Money Matters – The ENGO Political Advantage Money Matters: The ENGO Political Advantage Related:Manufacturing a Climate Crisis  https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manufacturing-A-Climate-Crisis-2A-FINAL.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn recent decades, the Earth’s seas have been rising at a rate of under 0.8 mm/year (8 cm per century) according to estimations of the sum of contributions to sea level rise. In contrast, sea levels rose at rates of more than 40 mm/year ~10,000 years ago.
Relative sea level rise can be calculated using observations from the sum of contributing sources: 1) terrestrial water storage, 2) thermal expansion (warming), and 3) glacier and ice sheet melt.

As the above image illustrates, the peer-reviewed scientific literature suggests the total contribution to sea level rise for recent decades can be calculated as about 0.8 mm/yr, or 8 cm (~3 inches) per century.

Terrestrial water storage: -0.55 to -0.71 mm/yr (Chao et al., 2008, Reager et al., 2016)
Thermal expansion: 0.64 mm/yr (Llovel et al., 2014)
Glacier and ice sheet melt: 0.76 mm/yr (Frederikse et al., 2018)

In contrast, results from a new paper (Nirgi et al., 2019) suggest Baltic sea levels were as much as 10 m higher than they are now about 7,300 years ago; regional seas had risen by about 21 to 22 m between 10,800 and 10,300 years ago, which is 4.3 m per century (43 mm/yr).

Image Source: Nirgi et al., 2019
To put this sea level rise rate (40+ mm/yr) into perspective, shorelines retreated at rates of 40 m per year and 75 cm per week (Donoghue, 2011) earlier in the Holocene.

For other regions, sea levels naturally rose at rates of 6 meters per century (60 mm/yr) at the end of the last glacial maximum (Zecchin et al., 2015).

Image Source: Zecchin et al., 2015
These explosive sea level rise rates were not just local or regional in scope, but hemispheric (at least).
About 14,500 years ago, the Northern Hemisphere warmed up by 4°C to 5°C within a span of “just a few decades” as sea levels subsequently rose 12 to 22 m in less than 340 years (Ivanovic et al., 2017).
That’s 3.5 to 6.5 m per century, or 35 to 65 mm/yr for the Northern Hemisphere.
This abrupt change occurred without significant changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, undercutting attempts to link CO2 concentration changes to abrupt climate change in the paleoclimate record.

"**The government is relaxing restrictions on delivery hours for shops to make sure shops remain stocked with basic items amid stockpiling concerns.**
The environment department, Defra said it would work with local councils to increase the frequency of deliveries.
Environment Secretary George Eustice said by allowing night-time deliveries, stock would be able to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.
Deliveries are currently restricted overnight to avoid disturbing locals.
The temporary measures have been brought in after a meeting on Friday between leading supermarkets and Mr Eustice. It saw firms call for help from the government to deal with increased demand from customers amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Mr Eustice said: ""We have listened to our leading supermarkets and representatives from across the industry, and we are taking action to support their preparations.""
The government earlier said there was ""no need"" for coronavirus stockpiling, as worried shoppers clear shelves.
Tesco and Waitrose are among retailers restricting sales of essential food and household items, in-store or online.
Shoppers have reported shortages of items such as toilet roll and hand soap at their local stores.
Several shops have introduced sales restrictions on certain items, to ease the flow of supply.
At Tesco, shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables.
Waitrose has brought in a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes.
Meanwhile, Boots and Asda are restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person.
According to a survey from Retail Economics, as many as one in 10 UK consumers is stockpiling, based on a sample of 2,000 shoppers, leading to reports of bare shelves.
Retailers have reassured the government they have contingency plans in place and are monitoring supply chains to minimise disruption.
Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the new measures to relax delivery hours.
He said: ""While there is plenty of stock available, the challenge for retailers has been to make sure all of it reaches shelves at the earliest opportunity.""
He added that it was ""essential that government continues to engage on other ways to alleviate the challenges for retailers.""
On Friday, retailers asked the government to scrap curfews on lorries delivering to supermarkets. Defra has moved quickly to help.
A significant number of supermarkets in residential areas are affected by delivery curfews. Late night or early morning restrictions are commonplace. With these new, temporary, measures, retailers will be able to deliver food and other products to stores in the middle of the night.
This will give supermarkets a lot more flexibility to keep the shelves full. The spike in demand last week has yet to tail off. They also want an extension to the maximum number of driving hours for delivery drivers. The government will waive these restrictions too, if necessary.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said the government was in constant contact with the big retailers.
""There is absolutely no need for anybody to stockpile or anything like that,"" he told the BBC.
""We are confident that supermarkets have the supply chains necessary to keep shelves stocked for people.
""The number one thing is to ensure we work with the supermarkets and others to ensure that their supply chains are there, that the shelves keep being restocked as people purchase things.""
""And secondly, to reassure people that there is really no need to [stockpile]. We are confident the supermarket supply chains can keep refilling the shelves.
""I understand people's concerns if they go to the supermarket and see thatâ¦ products are not there. There really is no need to buy things in volume."""

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
In a remarkable example of scientific malfeasance, it has become apparent that the IPCC knew a lot more than it revealed in its 2013 climate compendium about how low the earth’s climate sensitivity is likely to be.   
  
The importance of this revelation cannot be overstated. If the UN had played it straight, the “urgency” of global warming would have evaporated, but, recognizing that this might cause problems, they preferred to mislead the world’s policymakers.   
  
Strong words? Judge for yourself.   
  
The report “Oversensitive—how the IPCC hid the good news on global warming,” was released today by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF)—a U.K. think-tank which is “concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated” regarding climate change (disclosure: our Dick Lindzen is a member of the GWPF Academic Advisory Council).   
  
The new GWPF report concluded:   




We believe that, due largely to the constraints the climate model-orientated IPCC process imposed, the Fifth Assessment Report failed to provide an adequate assessment of climate sensitivity – either ECS [equilibrium climate sensitivity] or TCR [transient climate response] – arguably the most important parameters in the climate discussion. In particular, it did not draw out the divergence that has emerged between ECS and TCR estimates based on the best observational evidence and those embodied in GCMs. Policymakers have thus been inadequately informed about the state of the science.



The study was authored by Nicholas Lewis and Marcel Crok. Crok is a freelance science writer from The Netherlands and Lewis, an independent climate scientist, was an author on two recent important papers regarding the determination of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)—that is, how much the earth’s average surface temperature will rise as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide.   
  
The earth’s climate sensitivity is the most important climate factor in determining how much global warming will result from our greenhouse gas emissions (primarily from burning of fossil fuels to produce, reliable, cheap energy). But, the problem is, is that we don’t know what the value of the climate sensitivity is—this makes projections of future climate change--how should we say this?--a bit speculative.



Unsurprisingly, there has been a lot of recent scientific research aimed at gaining a better understanding of what the climate sensitivity may be. We have detailed much of this research in our ongoing series of articles highlighting new findings on the topic. Collectively, the new research indicates an ECS value a bit below 2°C. The latest in our series is here.   
  
But in its _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) finalized this past January, the IPCC gave short shrift to the major implication of this collection of new research results—that the climate sensitivity is much lower than what the IPCC assessed it to be in its collection of previous assessment reports (issued every 6-7 years) and that the rate of climate change is going to be much less.   
  
For example, formerly, in its _Fourth Assessment Report_ (AR4), released in 2007, the IPCC had this to say regarding the equilibrium climate sensitivity:   




It [the equilibrium climate sensitivity] is _likely_ to be in the range 2°C to 4.5°C with a best estimate of about 3°C, and _is very unlikely_ to be less than 1.5°C. Values substantial higher than 4.5°C cannot be excluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good for those values. [emphasis in original]



In its new AR5, the IPCC wrote this:   




Equilibrium climate sensitivity is _likely_ in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C ( _high confidence_ ), _extremely unlikely_ less than 1°C ( _high confidence_ ), and _very unlikely_ greater than 6°C ( _medium confidence_ )16. The lower temperature limit of the assessed _likely_ range is thus less than the 2°C in the AR4, but the upper limit is the same. This assessment reflects improved understanding, the extended temperature record in the atmosphere and ocean, and new estimates of radiative forcing. [emphasis in original]



And IPCC AR5 footnote 16 states:   




No best estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity can now be given because of a lack of agreement on values across assessed lines of evidence and studies.



So, facing mounting scientific for a substantially lower climate sensitivity, the best the IPCC could bring itself to do was to reduce the low end of its “likely” range by one-half degree, refuse to put a value on its best guess, and still cling to its high end number. Big deal.   
  
The reason that the IPCC could only make these meager changes was that the collection of climate models that the IPCC employs to make the bulk of its projections of future climate change (and future climate change impacts) has an average ECS value of 3.2°C. The IPCC couldn’t very well conclude from the scientific evidence that the real value was somewhere south of 2°C—if it were to do so, it would invalidate the climate models and, for that matter the meat of its entire report (that is, its climate change projections).   
  
We described the situation the IPCC faced last summer (prior to releasing the final copy of the AR5) this way:   




The IPCC has three options:   






We’re betting on door number 3.



As predicted, the IPCC chose option number 3.   
  
The new GWPF report confirms, in detail, the IPCC’s choice and how it came to make it—by confusing the reader with a collection of evidence that was outdated, already disproven, based upon flimsy assumptions, not directly applicable, or flat-out wrong.   
  
Putting it nicely, Lewis and Crok describe the situation thus:   




The AR5 authors might not have wanted to declare that some studies are better than others or to adjudicate between observational and model-based lines of evidence, but we believe that this is exactly what an assessment is all about: using expert knowledge to weigh different sources of evidence. In this section we present reasoned arguments for a different assessment to that in AR5.



Lewis and Crok go, in detail, through each climate sensitivity paper considered (and relied upon) by the IPCC and identify its shortcomings. At the end, they are left with a collection of five papers that, while still containing uncertainties, are built upon the most robust set of assumptions and measurements.   
  
From those papers the Lewis and Crok conclude the following:   




A new ‘best observational’ estimate of ECS can now be calculated by taking a simple average of the different observationally-based estimates….This gives a best estimate for ECS of 1.75°C and a likely range of about 1.3–2.4°C. However, recognizing that error and uncertainty may be greater than allowed for in the underlying studies, and will predominantly affect the upper of the range, we conservatively assess the likely range as 1.25–3.0°C.   
  
Now compare these figures with those in AR4 and AR5….Our new ‘best observational’ ECS estimate of 1.75°C is more than 40% lower than both the best estimate in AR4 of 3°C and the 3.2°C average of GCMs used in AR5. At least as importantly, the top of the likely range for ECS of 3.0°C is a third lower than that given in AR5 (4.5°C) – even after making it much more conservative than is implied by averaging the ranges for each of the observational estimates.



And as to what this means about the IPCC global warming projections, Lewis and Crok write:   




The [climate models] overestimate future warming by 1.7–2 times relative to an estimate based on the best observational evidence.



This is a powerful and important conclusion.   
  
We recommend that you read the full report. Not only is it a comprehendible and comprehensive description of the current science as it relates to the climate sensitivity, but it is an illumination of how the IPCC process does, or rather doesn’t, work.   
  
The Obama Administration and its EPA will ignore this reality at their peril.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
The British tabloid “The Guardian” has a new scare story about what is wrongly called “ocean acidification”. It opens as follows:


Pacific Ocean’s rising acidity causes Dungeness crabs’ shells to dissolve
Acidity is making shells of crab larvae more vulnerable to predators and limiting effectiveness in supporting muscle growth
 
The Pacific Ocean is becoming so acidic it is starting to dissolve the shells of a key species of crab, according to a new US study.


Sounds like the end of times, right? So let me start with a simple fact. The ocean is NOT acidic. Nor will it ever become acidic, except in a few isolated locations. It is alkaline, also called “basic”. The level of acidity/alkalinity is expressed on the “pH” scale, where neutral is 7.0, alkaline is from 7 to 14, and acidic is from 0 to 7.

Figure 1. The pH scale, running from the most acid at the bottom, through neutral in the middle, and up to the most alkaline at the top.
From the chart, the ocean has a pH of around 8 (although as we’ll see, that conceals great variation). 
And from my high school chemistry class in titration, I know that adding a small amount of an acid to a basic solution, or adding a small amount of a base to an acidic solution, is called “neutralization” for a simple reason. It moves the solution toward neutral.
When carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolves in rainwater or in the ocean, it makes a weak acid. And adding that weak acid to the ocean will slightly neutralize the ocean. How much? Well, by the year 2100, if you believe the models, it is supposed to move the pH of the ocean from around 8 all the way down to around … wait for it … a pH of 7.92. In other words, a slight neutralization.
So why is it called “ocean acidification” rather than “ocean neutralization”? Sadly, because “acidification” sounds scary. We see this in the story above, where the opening line is:
“The Pacific Ocean is becoming so acidic it is starting to dissolve the shells of a key species of crab, according to a new US study.” 
Well, no, that’s not true at all. The ocean is not acidic in the slightest. It is slightly less alkaline. Using “acidification” rather than “neutralization” lets us convince people that impossible things are happening. Consider the following restatement of their opening sentence.
“The Pacific Ocean is becoming so neutral it is starting to dissolve the shells of a key species of crab, according to a new US study.” 
Huh? The Pacific Ocean is becoming so neutral that it’s starting to dissolve things? Say what?
Alarmism run wild.
Here’s another important and counterintuitive fact about pH. Living creatures deal with acidic substances much better than we do with alkaline substances. Look at Figure 1 above. We regularly consume quite acidic things. Grapes and orange juice are at a pH of three. Lemon juice has a pH of two, very acidic, five pH units below neutral. And at six pH units below neutral, with a pH of just one is … our own stomach acid.
But we don’t eat many things that are more alkaline than a pH of about 10, things like cabbage, broccoli, and artichoke. And while our stomachs happily tolerate a pH of one, we are badly burned by bleach, at the opposite end of the pH scale. 
Next, the required disclaimer. I have a personal stake and a personal passion regarding this subject. I live on the West Coast of the US in the very area they’re discussing, and I fished commercially in these waters for many years. So I know a few things about the local oceanic ecosystems.

With that as prologue, the new Guardian scare story is based on a scientific study called “Exoskeleton dissolution with mechanoreceptor damage in larval Dungeness crab related to severity of present-day ocean acidification vertical gradients“ … the “ocean acidification” BS strikes again. Heck, it gets its own cute little acronym, “OA”, as in the portion of the abstract below:
AbstractOcean acidification (OA) along the US West Coast is intensifying faster than observed in the global ocean. This is particularly true in nearshore regions (<200 m) that experience a lower buffering capacity while at the same time providing important habitats for ecologically and economically significant species. 
Now, I can’t find any reference in the study for the idea that somehow the US West Coast is acidifying faster than the global ocean. In fact, we have very little pH data for the global ocean. 
But we do have some data. One most informative graphic gives us a look at a slice of the ocean from top to bottom and from Hawaii to Alaska. Over a 15-year period, scientists traveled that route, periodically stopping and sampling the pH from the surface to the seafloor. I discussed that “transect” in my post “The Electric Oceanic Acid Test“. Here’s the ocean cross-section with its original caption.

Inset at lower left shows the area studied. Click to expand. Graphic Source
Now, there are several fascinating things about this graphic. The first is the wide range of pH in the ocean. We tend to think of it as all having about the same pH, but that’s far from true. Around Hawaii (top left of the chart), the pH is about 8.05. But at a couple of hundred metres under the surface off the coast of Alaska (top right), the ocean is at a pH of 7.25. This pH is what hysterical scientists and the Guardian would call “MUCH MORE ACIDIC!!”, but is properly called “approaching neutral”.
Next, where is the most sea life in this chart? Why, it’s off the coast of Alaska, my old fishing grounds, which is replete with plankton, herring, salmon, sharks, flounders, whales, and every kind of marine creature. They flourish in those “MUCH MORE ACIDIC”, aka “more neutral”, ocean waters.
Finally, sea life thrives at every pH in the graphic. There are fish and marine creatures of all kinds at every pH level and every area in the graphic, top to bottom and Hawaii to Alaska. They are not tied to some narrow band where they will die if the pH changes by a tenth of a pH unit over a hundred years.
So please, can we get past this idea that a slight, slow neutralization is going to kill every poor creature in the ocean? Alkalinity is a problem for sea creatures, not acidity. It’s why so many of them are covered by a coating of slime or mucus—to protect them from the alkaline seawater. Fun Fact—if you want to dissolve a fish (or a human), use lye (pH 14), not sulfuric acid (pH 1) … but I digress.
Moving on, I wrote before about the pH measurements at the intake pipe of the Monterey Bay Aquarium in a post entitled “A Neutral View of Oceanic pH“. In that post, it was obvious that the long-term trend in pH at the Monterey Bay Aquarium was smaller than the trend at the “H.O.T.” deepwater location off of Hawaii. Here’s the graph from that post showing the difference:

Figure 2. Surface pH measurements from HOT open ocean and Monterey Bay upwelling coastline. The Hawaii data shows both measured pH (black) and pH calculated from other measurements, e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity, and salinity. You can see the higher pH around Hawaii that was visible in the previous Figure.
Sadly, the web page containing the Monterey Bay pH dataset has become some kind of unknown Japanese web-page. Fortunately, I kept the data. And I was also able to find further pH data which starts just after my old data, although it appears that the calibration of the pH sensors is slightly changed in the new set. In any case, I’ve put both datasets in one graph, with separate linear trendlines for the two datasets.

Figure 3. Twenty-five years of monthly average pH measurements at the inlet pipe that delivers 2.5 million gallons (9.5 million liters) of seawater per day to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Two separate datasets were used. The entrance of the pipe is at a depth of 50 feet (15 metres). The size of the projected pH drop by the year 2100 using RCP6.0 is shown by the top-to-bottom size of the “whiskers” in white at the upper right.
The neutral pH of 7.0 is down at the bottom, a ways below the data. Note that the long-term trend of the average pH value of the water is about the same in both datasets, and that the trend is quite small compared to the projected slight neutralization by the year 2100.
And more to the point, that projected pH decrease by 2100 of 0.08 pH units is dwarfed by the daily change in the pH. Heck, it’s smaller than the size of the monthly change in the pH. The standard deviation of the daily change in pH is 0.6 pH units, and the standard deviation of the monthly change is 0.1 pH units.
Why is the pH changing so fast on the West Coast of the US? It all has to do with coastal upwelling. Varying winds along the coast cause deep, cold, CO2-rich, more neutral water to come to the surface in varying amounts, changing the pH literally overnight. 

Figure 4. The mechanical action of the winds blowing southward along the West Coast of the US causes the upwelling of CO2-rich more neutral water from the ocean depths. Image Source NOAA
And that constantly-changing pH is why I find these claims about oceanic creatures here on the West Coast of the US being killed off or badly injured by some trivially small slow change in pH to be totally unbelievable. Every living being in the ocean along this coast undergoes much, much larger pH changes from one day to the next than they will see over the next century.
There’s one more dataset that I have to add to this before turning to the study itself. The study actually takes place up in the area near Seattle. So what is the oceanic pH up there doing?
Turns out it is very hard to find long-term pH measurements in that area. The best that I’ve been able to find are an intermittent series of measurements from an offshore buoy on the coast of Washington near the Strait of Juan de Fuca, a lovely part of the planet that I battled through a while back. Here’s where the La Push buoy is located:

Figure 5. The yellow square shows the location of the “La Push” offshore buoy. The Strait of Juan De Fuca is the blue channel leading into the land. Seattle and Tacoma, Washington are below the inner end of the Strait. Vancouver Island, Canada, is on the north side of the Strait.
It appears that the buoy is brought in when the weather gets very rough, because there is a gap in the data each winter. Here’s the La Push buoy data, to the same scale as the Monterey data above.

Figure 6. Daily surface pH records at the La Push, Washington offshore buoy. The background is an offshore island near La Push.
Once again, we see the same situation. The pH changes are much larger than the size of the projected change between now and the year 2100. And while I wouldn’t put much weight on the trend line because of the gaps in the data, it’s quite possible that the trend is actually becoming slightly more alkaline.
How can it become more alkaline? Remember that along this coast, the swings in the pH, and the average pH itself, are not direct functions of CO2 levels. Instead, they are determined by the instantaneous and average strength of the wind. If there is more wind, more of the deeper, more neutral waters come to the surface to lower the surface pH, and vice versa. 
And lest you think that such swings in pH are limited to this coast, here’s some data from around the planet.

Figure 7. pH values and variations from different oceanic ecosystems. Horizontal black “whiskers” show the range of the pH values. The size of the expected slight neutralization by the year 2100 according to RCP6.0 is shown by the red whiskers at the top. Ischia South Zone, the site that goes the lowest in pH, is on the side of a volcano that is constantly bubbling CO2 through the water. DATA
Let me close by looking at the study itself, at least as much as I can bear. I’ll discuss a few quotes. The first line of their “Highlights” says:
Coastal habitats with the steepest [vertical] ocean acidification gradients are most detrimental for larval Dungeness crabs.
There’s no such thing as a “vertical ocean acidification gradient”. There is a vertical pH gradient, as you would expect with upwelling deeper CO2-rich water hitting the more alkaline surface waters with less CO2. But this is a natural condition that has existed forever and has nothing to do with “OA”. And they present no evidence to show that the gradient will change significantly in the future.
Next, in their conclusions they say:
Like dissolution in pteropods, larval dissolution observed in Dungeness crab is clear evidence that marine invertebrates are damaged by extended exposure to strong present-day OA-related vertical gradients in their natural environment.
However, they present no evidence that past “OA”, or mild oceanic neutralization, has had any effect on the “vertical gradients in the natural environment”. The vertical gradients in pH off of the coast are a function of the upwelling, which in turn is a function of the wind, which is constantly changing. They don’t have long-term data for the vertical pH gradient. Instead, they went on a two-month cruise, took some samples, and extrapolated heavily. We don’t even know if they’d have found the exact same “dissolution” a hundred, fifty, or twenty-five years ago. Or perhaps the dissolution was particularly bad during that particular two-month period in that particular small location. This should not surprise us. One reason that so many marine creatures spawn hundreds of thousands of larvae is that many, perhaps most, of them will drift into inhospitable conditions and die for any one of a host of reasons—problems with salinity, turbidity, pH, predators, temperature, the list is long.
Finally, this paper does prove one thing—that Neptune, the trident-wielding god of the ocean, definitely has a sense of humor. Here’s the ultimate irony. 
They couldn’t see the parts of the crab larvae that they wanted to examine because those parts are covered by the “epicuticle”, the outer layer of the hard carapace that surrounds the larva. So they first had to dissolve the epicuticle in order to get access to what they wanted to study. Here’s their description of the problem and the solution. (The “megalopa” are a stage of the larval form of the crabs).
The carapace epicuticle, which otherwise overlies the crystalline layer and makes dissolution observations impossible, was removed from each megalopa prior to analysis. This was accomplished using sodium hypochlorite, which efficiently removes the epicuticle but does not damage the crystalline layers underneath, even at high concentrations.
Care to take a guess at the pH of the 6% solution of sodium hypochlorite, which is what they used to dissolve the carapace epicuticle? 
It has a pH of 11 or more, almost at the very top of the scale in Figure 1, very strongly alkaline. 
So it no wonder that Neptune is laughing—they’re all up in arms about “acidification” dissolving the crab carapaces … but in the event, they’re using an alkaline solution to actually dissolve the crab carapaces.
Ain’t science wonderful?

It’s clear today, and from my house perched high up on a hill six miles (ten km) from the coast, I can see a small bit of the very part of the ocean that we’re discussing. It’s foggy down there and it’s clear up here, as is often the case. And right out there, millions of marine creatures are happily going about their lives as the pH gyrates up and down every hour, every day, and every month. 
If a slight oceanic neutralization were going to injure them as we are franticosolemnly assured at every opportunity by the bad boffin boys and the popular press, those oceanic inhabitants would all have died long ago.
My very best to everyone on a sunny winter day,
w.
PS: After early years of having to point out that “No, I didn’t say that, I said nothing like that”, I’ve taken to asking those who comment to quote someone’s exact words that you are going to discuss. This avoids endless misunderstandings and arguments.

"**Burger King chief executive Alasdair Murdoch has said that the fast food chain will not be paying rent due on its UK restaurants this week.**
Hundreds of High Street businesses are set to withhold their quarterly rent payments, which are due on Wednesday, so they can afford to pay their staff.
The government has said shops will not forfeit leases if they do not pay, but will have to pay arrears in the future.
Mr Murdoch told the Today programme: ""We are not intending to pay our rent.""
He added: ""Most landlords have been reasonable about this. I do think there are a number of creative solutions as well.
""We could add three months on to the end of the lease for those people who are unable to pay in the short-term at the end of these three months.""
Restaurants are still allowed to offer a takeaway or delivery service, but Mr Murdoch added: ""We took the decision last night [Monday], after what the prime minister said, to close all of our UK restaurants.
""If there are any trailing on, they will all be closed this morning, but we closed 500 last night.""
Richard Hodgson, chief executive of Yo! Sushi, told the Financial Times that non-payment of rent was ""not really a choice. It's just a basic piece of economics"".
Landlords told the BBC that they would not be evicting businesses and that their tenants were looking for different solutions.
Some want rent holidays, others want to pay monthly and some do not want to pay at all at the moment.
Landlords, via industry group Revo, have written to the government saying that rents need to be covered. Banks have been told to be supportive as long as landlords act responsibly.
The government has launched a Â£350bn package of support for businesses to deal with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
It included a new interest-free Business Interruption Loan Scheme for small and medium-sized firms and a Bank of England finance option for bigger businesses.
But Jonathan Downey, founder of Street Feast food markets, told the BBC's Today programme that it may not help the hospitality industry.
""The sad reality is that any business operating hospitality now is insolvent, so any right-minded lender using normal rules is not going to lend,"" he said.
""We estimate that 95% of hospitality businesses will not qualify for one of these loans."""

At most, global average sea level is rising at a rate equivalent to 2-3 inches per century. It is probably not rising at all.
Sea level is measured both by tide gauges and, since 1992, by satellite altimetry. One of the keepers of the satellite record told Professor Mörner that the record had been interfered with to show sea level rising, because the raw data from the satellites showed no increase in global sea level at all.
The raw data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON sea-level satellites, which operated from 1993-2000, shows a slight uptrend in sea level. However, after exclusion of the distorting effects of the Great El Niño Southern Oscillation of 1997/1998, a naturally-occurring event, the sea-level trend is zero.
The GRACE gravitational-anomaly satellites are able to measure ocean mass, from which sea-level change can be directly calculated. The GRACE data show that sea level fell slightly from 2002-2007.
These two distinct satellite systems, using very different measurement methods, produced raw data reaching identical conclusions: sea level is barely rising, if at all.
Sea level is not rising at all in the Maldives, the Laccadives, Tuvalu, India, Bangladesh, French Guyana, Venice, Cuxhaven, Korsør, Saint Paul Island, Qatar, etc.
In the Maldives, a group of Australian environmental scientists uprooted a 50-year-old tree by the shoreline, aiming to conceal the fact that its location indicated that sea level had not been rising. This is a further indication of political tampering with scientific evidence about sea level.
Modelling is not a suitable method of determining global sea-level changes, since a proper evaluation depends upon detailed research in multiple locations with widely-differing characteristics. The true facts are to be found in nature itself.
Since sea level is not rising, the chief ground of concern at the potential effects of anthropogenic “global warming” – that millions of shore-dwellers the world over may be displaced as the oceans expand – is baseless.
We are facing a very grave, unethical “sea-level-gate”.

The Bradford-based retailer, which typically serves more than 12 million customers every week, said it also wanted to encourage customers to make donations by lifting purchase limits to four items and removing limits on some items altogether.
The supermarket has already revamped its in-store cafes as donation hubs.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Monday, Mr Potts said the store was providing the food so that local community champions could help restock the nation's food banks.
""For many people who use the food banks that's their only store,"" he said.
Other big chains have also donated large sums to food banks and community charities.
Last week, the Co-op said it would donate Â£1.5m worth of food to the UK's largest food redistribution charity, FareShare, to help boost stocks and support local communities struggling because of the coronavirus outbreak."

It is a phenomenon of modern life that as membership in the old established religions wane, cults continue to sprout up like toadstools. Most of them have a very limited number of adherents and unless 75 people are killed at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, or 900 are killed or commit suicide at Jonestown, Guyana, we don’t hear about cult leaders like David Koresh or Jim Jones.



Occasionally, a smaller cult manages to make the news when they commit mass suicide in order to board a spaceship that will take them to Cloud Cuckooland.



But when it comes to sheer numbers and influence, there’s nothing to match the doomsday cult that has sprung up in the wake of Al Gore’s warning us about the imminent threat of global extinction. What makes the longevity of this cult so remarkable is that Gore’s “imminent” has turned into “eventual” and none of the true believers is questioning the ever-changing timetable. The cause of addressing climate change has become the modern world’s version of a secular religion.



There has long been **a church of environmentalism** having many of the characteristics of its ecclesiastical forerunners. One of course is the apocalypse that will consume us all if we do not follow the rules. The rules involve making penance for our original sin of unleashing the earth’s carbon dioxide emitting fuels from the Earth’s crust, and more recent transgressions involving plastic straws and cross country airline flights. But repentance is near. Salvation lies in eliminating our “carbon footprint”, using reusable shopping bags, and supporting MacDonald’ new meatless hamburgers.



The folks who espouse the climate change gospel know little more about the science of climatology and the greenhouse effect, than the average medieval villager knew why crops may fail or the sun and moon become eclipsed. And in complete symmetry of past religions, **children are being used as effective role models in propagating faith.** Millions left school to urge adults to battle this modern scourge, or perhaps they just enjoyed a day off school to speak the lines they were taught.



Writing in the Wall Street Journal on September 21, 2019, Gerald Baker wrote:”the testimony of a guileless child is a powerful weapon against skepticism.” Sixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg has become the poster child for the religious fervour among climate change activists growing fanaticism.



Recently, A O-C and a few of the dimwits running for the Democratic nomination warned us that 2030 is absolutely the last day that this planet will be able to sustain human life. We bet confidently that by 2025, they’ll move the deadline to 2040.



Even Gore was something of a late bloomer. Starting around 1974, all the experts at the U.N., NASA, the New York Times, the AP, Time and Newsweek, were warning us of a coming Ice Age or fretting about a disappearing ozone layer or something really scary-sounding they called acid rain.



But, then, almost overnight, they regrouped and started keeping us up nights by screaming that the planet was in immediate danger of being incinerated.



When neither of those calamitous changes in the weather took place, the same folks decided to settle for a changing climate. The fact that they never explained what would be so terrible about things cooling down a little in the San Fernando Valley in California in July or warming up a bit in Fargo North Dakota in December should tell people all they really need to know about these cheap hustlers, who are in it for money, power and attention



Gore warned of melting icebergs and rising ocean levels, which simply proved that he didn’t even remember his high school science. If you fill a glass with water and ice to the very top, when the ice melts, not a drop of water will rise above the rim.



It’s now twenty years later, the ice at the North Pole and South Poles haven’t vanished. If anything, they have expanded. As has Al Gore, if you’ve seen him lately.

A carbon tax will not achieve the goal of substantially mitigating global climate change.



There is one, and only one, reason for instituting a carbon tax: to attempt to mitigate the impacts of climate change induced by humankind’s use of fossil fuels for the production of energy. And about the only thing that a carbon tax in the United States will not do is mitigate global climate change in any meaningful—scientifically, or otherwise—manner.



Why? Because, based on mainstream estimates, of the approximately 3°C of global warming that is being projected to occur between now and the end of the century as a result of anthropogenic carbon (dioxide) emissions, the U.S. contribution will only be about 0.2°C, or about 7 percent of the total warming. And this is assuming that no carbon tax is put in place. Carbon dioxide emissions from the rest of the world—primarily driven by rapid emissions growth in developing countries like China and India—will be responsible for the other 93 percent of temperature rise.



The best that any carbon tax in the United States could ever hope to achieve would be to reduce the amount of global warming across the 21st century from about 3.0°C down to about 2.8°C. And that tiny, inconsequential reduction would only occur if all greenhouse gas emissions from the United States were halted forever, starting tomorrow, which isn’t the plan.



The emissions reductions under any sort of carbon tax will be realized slowly, reducing the magnitude of the global temperature rise that the tax would avert. For example, a carbon tax designed to smoothly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from their current level to zero by the year 2100 would result in only about 0.1°C of global temperature “savings”—an amount, on its own, not worth pursuing.



Any perceived utility of a carbon tax does not lie in domestic reductions, but in the hope that it will spur technological innovations for cheap, reliable, nondangerous, environmentally friendly, zero‐​emissions energy production which would then be freely shared with, and quickly adopted by, the rest of the world. That seems wishful thinking on the time scales that matter.

"Once again, the high priests of the UN/IPCC have forecast world starvation unless we mend our wicked ways.
According to them, unless we curb our use of oil, gas, coal and meat, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will soar, the globe will heat up, and food production will plummet.
This is just a rerun of their previous failed forecasts based on academic theories and computer models.
They should have asked practical nurserymen, farmers and meteorologists.
Nurserymen would tell them that if you pump carbon dioxide into a greenhouse the plants grow faster, bigger, more drought-tolerant and more heat-tolerant. Therefore more carbon dioxide will produce more food.

The missing context: Climate change in the Mediterranean region
By the Kalte Sonne


(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
On October 11, 2019, Spiegel Online once again shined brilliantly parroting climate alarm. The German weekly news magazine could certainly now use their former science editor, Axel Bojanowski, who looked at climate science objectively.
The topic this time was climate change in the Mediterranean region.
With reference to a study by the MedECC network (pdf here), it is claimed that the Mediterranean region is warming up faster than other regions. Oh my. But not a word about the fact that the AMO ocean cycle has been a major driver of warming here for the last three decades. We have recently shown the graph here in the blog. As AMO’s cycle starts to go down, the Mediterranean will warm less in the coming decades, and may cool. Spiegel Online will certainly suppress this headline headline.
Interestingly, the AMO gets no mention in the MedECC report, although its authors also included ocean cycle specialists (Tsimplis, Xoplaki). They probably preferred to keep their mouths shut because the lead author is Wolfgang Cramer from the PIK climate alarm hatchery.
Preindustrial climate past concealed
It is also noticeable that the new Mediterranean climate report – like many of its related reports – does not begin its reporting until 1850. The eventful climate history before that time goes unmentioned. Please recall how the history of mankind in the Mediterranean region played a very special role during the last thousands of years: Egyptians, Greeks, Romans. The associated climate history, however, is concealed by Cramer. The latter is not only active at the PIK, but also at the IPCC.

This perhaps explains the desire to leave readers in the pre-industrial climate dark.
Ocean cycles play major role
Fortunately, there’s another way. In September 2019, a research group led by Sebastian Lüning published a summary study on the Medieval Warm Period in the Mediterranean region. Most of the Mediterranean was warm at that time. However, the scientists also found regions where it became colder during the Middle Ages. The corresponding warm-cold patterns corresponded to well-known ocean cycle patterns, namely those of the NAO, the North Atlantic Oscillation.
Overall, however, the AMO also seems to have played a major role in the climatic changes of recent centuries. Here is the abstract of the study published in the journal Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology:
The Medieval Climate Anomaly in the Mediterranean region
The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is a pre‐industrial phase of pronounced natural climate variability with a core period from 1000 to 1200 CE. The paper presents a synthesis that integrates palaeotemperature records from the Greater Mediterranean Region encompassing the past 1500 years based on multiproxy data from 79 published land and marine sites. MCA warming dominated the Western Mediterranean (Iberia, NW Africa) as well as the northern land areas of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean region. MCA cooling prevailed in the Canary Current Upwelling System, southern Levant and some sea areas of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean. Previous palaeoreconstructions suggest persistent positive Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO+) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO+) conditions during the MCA, whilst the LIA was dominated by an AMO‐ and NAO‐ regime. During the past 150 years, AMO+ conditions are typically associated with warming episodes in the Mediterranean area. A similar relationship appears to have also been established during the MCA as the majority of all Mediterranean land sites experienced warm climate conditions. In contrast, the NAO typically leads to a characteristic west‐east temperature dipole pattern in the basin, as documented for the last decades. During NAO+ conditions the Western Mediterranean is generally warm (and dry), whilst large parts of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean are cold. Similar trends seem to have been developed during the MCA when the NAO+ regime led to consistent warming in the Western Mediterranean, whilst a significant number of sites with MCA cooling existed in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean.
And here’s the summary in plain language:
Mediterranean climate has been warming significantly over the past 100 years with anthropogenic climate change having become a key issue. In order to better understand modern climatic change, developments need to be placed into a longer‐term pre‐industrial context to compare with times when human CO2 emissions did not yet play a major role for climate. This paper integrates data on Medieval temperature trends from 79 published Mediterranean land and marine sites. Our synthesis shows that the Western Mediterranean (Iberia, Northwest Africa) as well as the northern land areas of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean region have experienced a warm phase 1000‐1200 CE, corresponding to the so‐called ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’. Contemporaneous cooling occurred in other parts of the Greater Mediterranean region, namely in the southern Levant, some sea areas of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean and the Canary Current Upwelling System. The regional differences in Medieval Mediterranean temperature trends show a pattern, that partly resembles modern multidecadal temperature variability in the area. The main drivers of these patterns appear to be Atlantic ocean cycles (AMO, NAO) which episodically shift between positive and negative phases and lead to characteristic temperature effects in the region.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is a former public servant of 27 years and was a diplomat for 10 years prior to that. His full biography is here. In a comment published in the Financial Post on July 17, 2019, Greenpeace Canada strategic Keith Stewart argued that Canada must “stop oil expansion”.  He rejected the view that oil sands are being unfairly singled out and claimed that crudes from the oil sands were “among some of the highest carbon oil in the planet”. He thus defended the environmental group campaigns to discourage investment, block pipeline infrastructure, and turn public opinion against the oil sands.  Statements like those made by Mr. Stewart depend for their credibility on a public that is generally uninformed about energy matters, and specifically uninformed about the science that underlies debates about climate change. They are aided by the extraordinary refusal of the Canadian petroleum industry publicly to defend itself against false claims. This blog post is thus intended to do a double service. It will provide the facts about the comparative carbon intensity of several crude oils and it will provide a free (i.e. no compensation received or expected) service to the sleepwalking Canadian oil firms. Because concerns about the alleged adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions has reached the status of a state religion in California, the state government, in the form of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), annually produces a report in which it calculates the “carbon intensity value” of the crude oils refined in the state. While these are only a small subset of the wide range of crude oils produced and refined in the world, the data provided offers a good source for assessing comparative carbon intensities of the crude oils refined in North America. The latest report can be found here: https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/crude-oil/2017_crude_average_ci_value_final.pdf For 2017, the most recent year reported, the average carbon intensity value of crude oil refined in California was 11.93 in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ). As 11.93 was the average, half the crude oils refined had carbon intensities above that level. Some crude oil from Canada, such as Mixed Sweet (8.27) and Canadian Conventional Heavy (9.27) were well below the average, but these were some crude oils produced by mining and in situ production that had higher carbon intensities, including these: Crude OilCarbon IntensityAlbion Heavy Synthetic19.90Cold Lake18.40Shell Synthetic21.39Suncor Synthetic23.71Surmont Heavy Blend18.26Source: CARB What about the carbon intensity of other crude oils that fall above the average in terms of carbon intensity? As might be expected, they include several sources and fall into a wide range. These examples, however, illustrate an interesting point. Crude OilSourceCarbon IntensityPlaceritaCalifornia31.20Arroyo GrandeCalifornia29.33Poso CreekCalifornia28.15CoalingaCalifornia27.85San Ardo California27.26Round MountainCalifornia25.99BurrelCalifornia25.23Kern FrontCalifornia25.10Montalvo WestCalifornia25.05McKitrickCalifornia24.64Wyoming SweetWyoming24.11MagdalenaColumbia21.01LompocCalifornia19.65CymricCalifornia19.23Antelope Hills NorthCalifornia19.14 Source: CARB If the CARB analysis had included crude oil supplies from all countries, there is no doubt that oil produced in Venezuela, Algeria and Nigeria would rank among those with very high carbon dioxide intensity, largely due to production practices that involve a large amount of gas flaring, As it is, the figures demonstrate that there are plenty of crude oil sources in North America with emissions intensities as high or higher than Canadian oil sands production.  Given this, why do you suppose that Greenpeace and other environmental organizations consistently only target Canadian oil in their opposition campaigns? How are we to react to his claims that they are being “fair”?  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn “unusual greening of the planet,” reports German science magazine Wissenschaft. “A paradox.”
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne
Dem seltsamen Ergrünen der Welt auf der Spur

Has been greening for 3 decades
While it is widely reported how the world’s rainforests are being chopped down, Wissenschaft reports, “Vegetation on earth has been expanding for decades, satellite data show.”
Yes, the planet is in fact greening, and this is embarrassing climate alarmists, who over the years managed to mislead much of the media and public into believing the planet has been “browning” and thirsting to death.
Confirmed by IPCC
“The opposite is the case: according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, satellite observations show a greening of vegetation over the past three decades in parts of Asia, Europe, South America, Central North America and Southeast Australia,” reports Wissenschaft magazine. “Although there are regions that would become browner, the bottom line is that there is a larger area on our planet that is greened than browned.”

Thanks to CO2 fertilization
For the welcome trend, scientists attribute the surprising development on “a mixture of factors”, foremost the recent increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, which plants thrive on and humans have been mislead into believing is a “pollutant”.
“It is often forgotten that CO2 is not only a ‘problem’, but also a plant nutrient” that forms a crucial part of the “basis of the food chain,” reported Wissenschaft. In short: More atmospheric CO2 means more plant growth, and thus more food for more life.”
That has become an inconvenient fact for alarmists and climate activists, who insist life on the planet is dying.
Rainforests still threatened
Other suspected contributing factors include: nitrogen deposition, land-use changes and reforestation projects. But Wissenschaft warns that man-made greenery through agriculture and reforestation falls far short in terms of biotope quality, and so destruction of virgin rainforests remains a huge problem that requires real action.
Wissenschaft summarizes: “The bottom line, most experts say, is that from an ecological point of view the phenomenon of greening cannot replace the losses.”
CO2 lending a huge hand of support
The good thing: More CO2 in the atmosphere will certainly make the job of protecting vegetation and life far easier.

"**Overfishing has depleted numbers of wild fish, and fish farms meet much of the growing demand. Could we one day be eating ""fish"" grown from cells in a factory, as a number of start-ups are planning?**
Business is booming says David Shenson, the President of Sterling Caviar, which owns four fish farms in Sacramento, California, raising sturgeon for their eggs, better known as caviar.
He's not just being self-promotional: The global caviar market reached Â£670m ($854m) in 2018 and is expected to expand by close to 10% by 2025, according to market research firm Androit Market.
Sturgeon is one of the fish that has come under pressure in the wild, the number of wild sturgeon in major river basins has declined by 70% over the last century, according to figures from the World Wildlife Fund.
Overfishing and global warming have long wreaked havoc on fish stocks, and a third of marine fish stocks are still being fished at biologically unsustainable levels, according to the UN.
""Simply put, we are running out of fish,"" says Daniel Pauly, a professor of fisheries at the Institute of Oceans and Fisheries at the University of British Columbia. ""And the situation, the trend line, is getting worse every year.""
""Maybe centuries ago we could live off hunting for our food but we can't live off hunting today and fishing is hunting. The notion of hunting in the 21st century to feed 10 billion people is absurd.""
Fish farms like Sterling Caviar are helping take pressure off wild stocks, but a handful of start-up firms think they might have another answer.
They are experimenting with growing fish ""meat"" in the lab.
Mainly based in Silicon Valley with a couple in Europe and Asia, they have developed techniques to extract fish stem cells and grow them into commercial quantities of edible flesh.
Stem cells are a type of cell, found in embryos or adult creatures - which can grow into a number of different specialised cells. They can grow into the muscle cells which make up most the parts of fish people like to eat.
""Picture it like 3D printing, but we're 3D printing fish,"" explains Michael Selden, chief executive and co-founder of lab-grown fish start-up Finless Foods.
His company's faux fish will come out as ground fish as opposed to whole fillets because developing, from scratch, skin and bone and blood isn't yet feasible.
More Technology of Business
Finless Foods and similar start-ups haven't yet commercialised their products and they still require approval from regulators, so their fish might not be on the market for two or three years.
Wild Type, based in San Francisco, has similar ambitions, but it is focused on Pacific salmon. Making fish in a lab sounds like it could be pricey for both producer and consumer, but chief executive Justin Kolbeck hopes to make the fish affordable at some point.
""Our goal is to eventually drive down the price of our salmon to have its price run lower than conventionally-harvested salmon.""
Shiok Meats in Singapore has trained its eyes on lab-grown crustaceans such as shrimp.
It creates lab-grown fish by taking a small sample of stem cells from a real shrimp and growing them in large quantities in a large bioreactor chamber, similar to the huge stainless steel tanks brewers use to manufacture beer.
The tanks maintain a constant pressure and temperature and bathe the cells in gases and a nutrient-rich liquid. After a couple weeks the meat is ready.
""[It's] the same meat that would have come from a slaughtered animal but with no animal slaughter in this case,"" say Sandhya Sriram, chief executive and co-founder of Shiok Meats.
The company plans to launch its minced shrimp product in 2021, distributing it first in Singapore and then across East Asia.
She is excited about dubbing his firm's product ""clean meat"" due to the lack of antibiotics and lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to traditional farming.
However, the environmental claims have yet to be fully verified.
While cell-based meats have a smaller carbon footprint than traditional protein sources, they will still require ""a lot"" of electricity, says Simon Somogyi, a professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.
""Where is that energy is coming from? Are they using carbonized or renewable energy?"" he asks.
Still, Mr Somogyi thinks lab-grown fish is perhaps an even more promising market than lab-grown beef.
""Fish has a better business case going forward than red meat because much of the volume of finned fish is turned into minced fish, and put into food such as fish fingers and fish burgers. Cell-based fish fits perfectly into that category.""
Wild Type's Mr Kolbeck envisions a future where fish lovers will have similar options to meat (and meat-alternative) eaters.
""From real meat to plant-based substitutes to cell-based meat... one company won't be the winner, but rather the winner will be increased choice and transparency in our food systems."""

I woke up at 6:45 today to get ready for work. I am already in a good mood because I normally have to wake up at 6:00 for work, but due to the holidays my daily rush-hour commute to work is cut down by 45 minutes. I work on the other side of LA, so on a normal day it takes me about one hour and 15 minutes to make the 10-mile journey to my job.
However, today the city is almost empty so it takes me under 30 minutes to arrive at work. I would love to live closer to my job, but my crippling student loan debt doesn't allow me the luxury of living near my office, which happens to be situated in one of the most expensive neighbourhoods in the United States.
I arrive a bit early today, so I walk across the street to a coffee shop and get an iced coffee for **$3.78** (Â£2.90). I bring my lunch with me to work and don't spend anything else the rest of my work day.
On my way home from work I need to stop and charge my car since it is fully electric. I charge at a public charger for one hour to get 20 miles which costs me **$1.38**.
When I get home my boyfriend and I celebrate the fact that neither one of us has to work the next two days by forgetting about our healthy food-only diet and ordering a bunch of pizza. We alternate who pays for meals and today is my turn - **$21.75**.
After eating enough pizza to make even yoga pants feel too tight, I decide I cannot do anything other than lay on the couch and watch Netflix all night. We make it half way through an hour-long episode, before I pass out asleep for the evening.
**Total spend: $26.91**
Today is New Year's Eve and I have the entire day off as well as tomorrow - woohoo! My boyfriend and I sleep in and have a light breakfast at home since we both still feel full from our pizza party last night.
We are planning on celebrating New Year's at a friend's house who is throwing a small party. We decide to go to Costco to pick up a bottle of alcohol and hostess gift since they typically have the best prices on items in my area. We decide on a bottle of Japanese whisky **$32.84** and a box of liquor filled chocolates **$18.60**. We also get a bag of dog food while we are there since we are running low **$43.57**.
We decide to eat leftovers at home versus grabbing a bite somewhere since we are now running behind.
At 8:45 we leave to our friend's party. We call an Uber car and the 24-minute drive to her house costs **$26.85**. We spend the next few hours drinking cocktails, eating appetizers, and listening to music with friends. At around 1:30 we decide to call it a night and head home. We check the Uber app and the cost to call a car home has now skyrocketed to over **$100**! There has been a fare surge due to the holiday so we decide to hang out longer and wait for prices to drop.
At around 2:15 we check transportation prices again and they have been cut in half, still not what we want to spend but we are tired and eager to get home at this point. We call the car and spend **$50.45** to get back home. Spending the car ride dreaming of getting into warm pyjamas and out of my uncomfortable heels and dress justifies the awful price for just a moment.
My boyfriend and I split the cost of everything 50/50 today so I'm fine with what I've spent, considering it's a holiday.
**Total spend: $86.16**
Today is New Year's day! A day where it is socially acceptable to lounge around and practice the art of doing positively nothing. I am off work today and because we stayed out so late last night I end up waking up after 11:00am - oops, half the day is already gone.
After complaining I am hungry for 30 minutes but not doing anything about it, my boyfriend agrees to go out and track us down some mid-afternoon breakfast bagels. He returns 30 minutes later with breakfast as well as additional food for dinner later. Both my stomach and my wallet are very happy.
After we eat we spend the rest of the day uneventfully playing video games and watching movies on Netflix, and congratulating ourselves on being adults and not getting drunk last night just because it's a holiday.
I remember my college days of spending an entire paycheck on dresses and drinking just because it was a holiday. Thanks but no thanks - welcome to adulthood. Normally my student loans come out of my account on the first of each month, but the banks are closed today so the withdrawal will not happen until tomorrow. I somehow made it through the day without spending a dollar - a New Year's miracle!
**Total spend: $0**
Back to work today. I wake up a little late this morning and struggle to get out of bed. My sleeping schedule is messed up from my days off. I eventually get out of bed and realize I wasted so much time I now don't have time to make breakfast.
I grab a protein bar and rush out the door. I get to work and realise I forget to bring my lunch. Ugh, I hate when this happens. When lunch time rolls around I walk down the street from my work to a local juice shop and get an acai bowl **$10.90**.
Today my student loans also come out of my account **$859**. I put a big portion of any extra income I get during the year towards my student loans so I can hopefully get them paid off quicker and not have the interest pile up. Sometimes seeing my friends spend their extra income on vacations and travelling I can feel down, thinking that this mountainous black hole of debt will never go away.
However, for the most part I always try to remain positive about the situation. I should feel grateful that I have a job that pays me enough to always pay my bills on time, something that hundreds of thousands of people in America who are plagued with monumental student loan debt struggle to do while also carrying the burden of keeping their families afloat. Thinking of this today is a great reminder to always be thankful and grateful for what I have.
**Total spend: $869.90**
I wake up early enough today to do a quick meditation. I've been trying to meditate more and more the last few months. I would love to join a local class but the costs in my area are outrageous for something I can do at home.
I pack some berries and chia seed pudding I made for lunch and make my way to work.
At lunchtime I notice I have a notification on my phone to put in my produce delivery order today. I subscribe to a wonderful food delivery service that focuses on the elimination of food waste. Weekly or bi-weekly I log onto my account to shop a list of ""imperfect"" food items that are perfectly fine but cannot be sold in stores due to being too small, an odd shape, or there is simply a surplus of an item.
We are able to buy an abundance of fresh organic fruits and vegetables this way at highly discounted prices. I have saved so much money using this service over the past few years since I am a vegetarian and my main food staples are fruits and vegetables. The order I place today comes to **$16.82** for 10lbs of organic produce. I don't order too much because I still have a little left from last week's order.
My car lease payment has also been automatically deducted from my account today **$146.59** as well as my car insurance **$142.04** and home insurance **$32.01**.
On my way home from work I stop and pick up a caprese sandwich and green salad for dinner **$13.14**. I get home and catch up on some Real Housewives shows since my boyfriend is working late tonight.
**Total spend: $350.60**
Even though it's Saturday I wake up early. I listen to a podcast and clean up the house a bit while simultaneously drinking coffee and a protein shake. While I am cleaning I notice some stains on the walls that are not coming off. I actually noticed it a few weeks ago but now feel as though they are getting worse and it's driving me crazy!
I don't have any plans today so I make the impromptu decision to paint the walls. My boyfriend tries to talk me out of it saying we should have it done professionally. I briefly look online and see prices of several hundred dollars to have a room painted. No thanks, I'll figure it out.
I drive 10 minutes to a home improvement store and spend an hour picking out brushes and other accessories, and deciding between egg white and ultra pure white. Before admitting to myself I have no idea what I'm doing, and putting everything back in exchange for a pre-assembled painting kit, and googling the best brand of white wall paint to buy. I make it out of the store with probably not everything I need at **$83.08**.
I rush home and down some leftovers so I can quickly begin painting. Before I know it it's dark out and time to eat dinner. I am only half way done with my painting project so my boyfriend offers to go pick us up some food for dinner (anything to get out of the possibility of painting I suppose).
After eating I spend the rest of the evening painting, scrubbing spilled paint... and thinking about how I should have just paid a professional. However, with the cheap cost of DIY plus spitting the cost of supplies with my boyfriend it was ultimately worth it.
**Total spend: $41.54**
After spending the entire day inside yesterday painting I wake up feeling like I immediately need to get out of the house. I throw on some clothes and take my dog for a walk to a nearby juice shop. I get a green juice **$8.75** and slice of zucchini bread **$2.75** for breakfast and a quinoa veggie bowl to go for lunch later **$11.99**.
After breakfast we walk past a nearby pet shop. My only two money vices in life - makeup/skincare and dog anything. After a three-hour shopper's blackout in Sephora six months ago I actually forbid myself from buying any cosmetics until I run out of what I currently have. Dog stuff is still fair game since he's my one and only child.
I find a bag of treats, a chew toy, lavender-scented waste bags, senior vitamins and a mommy's best buddy t-shirt all on sale totalling **$33.95**. On the way out I also give a **$15** donation to a local dog and cat fundraising team outside.
After lunch I meet a friend for coffee **$4.85** and charge my car at a nearby public charger for an hour and 10 minutes while I'm there **$1.17**.
This evening my boyfriend and I go to a friend's house for dinner, who insists we do not bring anything at all along with us. Afterwards we head home to relax and get ourselves ready for the week ahead.
**Total spend: $78.46**
I spent a little spontaneously this week which is alright because of a handful of monetary gifts I received from family members for the holidays. A lot of my spending this week also went towards food and a few of my monthly bills.
Overall I am fine with my spending this week when looking it over. I try to balance responsible spending while I'm working to pay off my student loans while also allowing myself occasional frivolous spending without guilt or thinking about it since I work hard for my money!
**Total weekly spend:** **$** **1,453.57 (Â£1,107)**"

This is an age in which some aspects of science have completely reversed. Despite the planet remaining exactly the same, plus the sun, moon, stars, and people, nevertheless what we learned in school appears now to be irrelevant and replaced by concepts empirical physicists like Newton would have had difficulty comprehending. In this new age, new science is driven by funding rather than facts, and ideology rather than ideas. They are interesting times, because the future of science itself may be at stake. If the new trend of politically-directed science is to completely replace the scientific method, which called for rigorous standards of evidence and proof, then it will be entirely up to the politicians of the future to decide what is true or false. What follows is a brief description of some aspects of this new science.

We now have far more earthquakes, according to studies, than ever before, and the planet is being described as almost at the point of breaking apart. Previously, earthquakes were natural, and formed hills and valleys over time. But now, due to oil drilling, fracking and the impact of civilization, new science tells us that the continental plates are moving more violently against each other, the impact then diving down to epicentres 500kms below the earth’s crust, then bouncing back up,firefox for Mac in time to be detected at the plate boundaries by strategically-placed sensors. The earthquakes then form fault lines, which we are told by geologists were responsible for causing the earthquake in the first place. It means earthquakes create themselves retrospectively, which before did not happen under the rules of old science. We have lucrative research grants to thank for these new ideas.
How wondrous, too, to live in an age where heat no longer just goes up – it goes down now as well. We were always taught in school that heat only rises, but in the new science, from an invisible greenhouse ceiling in the high altitudes of the atmosphere, heat can flow downwards to warm the earth, which in the days before global warming was the prerogative solely of the sun. In the olden days the sun warmed the ground and the ground then warmed the air just above the ground, meaning the air cooled the earth. But now it is the air warming the earth (because of planet-harming greenhouse gases contained in it) and not the sun.
Although the sun has apparently retired from its former global heating job, it can still burn freckled people, and of late it has turned into a public menace. Any exposure to it leads directly to fatal skin cancer. Fortunately new science has invented skin cover products to combat this but the whole body must be covered all the time. Even ten minutes of exposure to the Sun now will lead to grave harm. Whereas before, sunshine was healthy, now, only the application of extensive (and expensive) skin cream is healthy.
Then we have the moon, that huge lump of rock between a quarter and a third the size of Planet Earth, which according to new science, has zero effect on the air. If everyone who goes to the beach looks out they will notice that the bottom of the air is joined to the sea, yet this makes no difference, because the moon can differentiate between the two. Also the moon has zero effect on the land that is holding the sea up, even though land and sea are joined beneath the oceans throughout the globe. Despite land, sea and air being joined and forming a joined system, the moon has 100% effect only on the sea, which sits squarely in the middle of the land and the air, this effect being called ‘tides’. Yet the moon’s forces have to find a way of getting past air and land to find the sea, in order to have this 100% effect on it, without disturbing the other two. Without a brain or eyes to see, the way the moon is so successfully selective is mysterious, nevertheless it constitutes the new science. And that means anyone who claims the moon can also affect land and air must be a charlatan.
There are a handful of little islands, with names like Tuvalu, Kiribati and Marshalls, and we learn in the media how they are the only ones in the world which the sea is bullying by attempting to rise over them. That does not happen anywhere around bigger countries like Australia or New Zealand, where there are far more people but no one seems to have noticed this to be any problem; neither swimmers, boaties, fishermen nor beach combers. Old photos and paintings show no sea-level changes. It is why overcrowded Bangladesh which is on the coast, also downtown Manhattan, also Greater London and all of Holland, about a billion people, are not concerned about any sea level rising. But then new science tells us that sea-level rising is not widespread, in fact only a tiny handful of Pacific island families are really affected. According to new science the sea changes its level around these island locations because not enough people in NZ, Australia, UK, US, India, China etc, are looking after the planet by riding bicycles to work.
You may also have heard about the Poles and how they are melting so fast that soon there will be no ice left. Al Gore in 2005 said all polar ice would be gone by 2013. He just missed mentioning the left-over ice that ships still get icebound in and have to wait several months to break free of. Today’s temperature at the South Pole is -60°C. New science says that Antarctic ice is melting at a rapid rate. It means that whereas ice used to only melt at 0°C, now it all melts at -60°C. That must mean that at -60°C, it can no longer exist as ice. This in turn means that our ice-blocks will stay permanently frozen now in our drinks, because room temperature will have to reach Antarctic’s winter temperatures for the ice-blocks to even start to diminish. But even then we’ll have to wait, because Antarctic still ices up in winter, and gets down to about -89°C, and still doesn’t all melt away. New science again, completely changing what we once knew as physics.
Equally intriguing is the ‘global temperature’ which is rapidly rising so much that whole species of life are becoming extinct which never happened before, according to the IPCC. Despite requests, scientists won’t disclose where their global thermometer is standing. But new science measures the whole temperature of the whole world in any one moment such that it can tell if the world is warming, despite that at any moment half the population of the world is in the freezing icy grip of winter while the other half are sweating it out on beaches. Also, one half are fast asleep in night time and the other half are running around with the hot sun shining on them. Fairly irrelevant, though, because scientists have worked out that all ground, sea and air temperatures are now rising at exactly the same time. No one knows by exactly how much, but the latest figure is 0.7 of a degree over a century, or 0.00002°C per day, which is something we cannot ever hope to adjust to and need to take very seriously for the sake of coming generations. Although we don’t know what decimalised temperatures were before digital thermometers were invented about 30 years ago – we know they must be rising because 97% of government-paid scientists receiving research funding to study them are in absolute agreement.
And what is making the planet’s temperature rise? Well, if you have to ask (because that is not very polite), scientists say it is obvious, because we are running engines that were not invented 200 years ago, and they get warm. So do bedside lamps, kettles, electric blankets, cigarettes, rubbing hands together and the top of your head when you eat curry. These all add up. Also humans are now breathing out a warm polluting atmosphere-wrecking gas called carbon dioxide, which is now lethal to the environment in a way it has not been in all past centuries of civilization. All this heats the earth more than it ever did before and our fragile planet has not worked out how it can adjust to these new warming factors. Although the Earth is 4.5 billion years old and in that time has experienced the violent impacts of meteors, the cataclysms of earthquakes and destructive tsunamis causing whole cities to topple, huge shifts of continental plates, devastating floods and relentless tides, drought-causing famines, desertification of continents over several centuries, islands erupting out of the ocean to form new countries, glaciations that last 50,000 years and catastrophic volcanoes, the plant’s biggest challenge yet is how to brace itself against the farts and belches of cows, and car fumes. But new science is again aware of this and knows what to do. It is a wondrous coincidence that humans, the only true caretakers of the planet, have come along at exactly the right time to save it.
By paying more taxes to politicians, this problem can be sorted, because the planet-destroying warmth will then stop. About a billion dollars per day is being paid now towards fixing these issues but more is needed because the warming is continuing unabated. According to Barack Obama and ex-Prime Minister of NZ, Helen Clark, global warming is a far worse problem than global terrorism. We would all agree that a slightly warmer-than-normal afternoon is far more terrifying than having snipers on your roof. How wonderful that such caring and levelheaded leaders are/were in charge of our countries. It is to be remembered that PM Clark signed a deal with China to supply them with all our Southland coal, so the Chinese could pollute their skies which are far, far away from our own.
So just look at how we as a society have progressed. In the old days people believed that the sun warmed the ground and the seasons came and went in cycles. They thought that storms and floods and droughts were all normal things that occasionally arrived. These events even received regular mention in the Bible. People of the past also assumed that all around the house and even the different rooms of the house had different temperatures, some warm and some cool, and you put heaters in the cool areas and fans in the hot ones. They didn’t know that everything would one day be all warming up at once.
In the past they also thought that sometimes tides were higher than others when the moon came closer, and that earthquakes happened which formed mountains, and not vice versa. They thought that forests grew only where lots of rain fell. It just demonstrates how misguided the science was back then. Now, new science informs us that it is the mountains and Alpine Faults that will cause future earthquakes, and the trees that cause the rain, and when all the rain forests in Brazil are finally cut down all world weather will be forever changed.
And then there are the polar bears. If you don’t know what they are it is because they are extinct. Despite being all white with four legs and identical in appearance, through new science a way was found to count them all. It was not easy – they covered a quarter of a million square miles, are only at the North Pole in winter time in conditions of pitch black Arctic winter darkness, and are all asleep in hibernation beneath it, and yet an accurate count was possible (due to a $10,000 research fund) in 1995. The count revealed (because no polar bears were seen) that there were none left. Using similar methods we know there are 7 Maui dolphins in all the oceans (because they were seen), and only 15 killer whales remaining.
It is a problem for administrators when a minority choose to be skeptical of new science, ask to be left alone, try to stay happy for their children’s well-being and wish to ignore gloom and doom. They are made to feel they are letting the side down because their skepticism makes taxes harder to gather, and there is less money available for essentials like electoral advertising, which is more necessary than houses and jobs, because choosing the right political party tops our list of priorities. In the days before new science men and women could work and have houses and feed young families which could grow up not being hungry. Now, machines perform much of the manual tasks that previously were done by working people, and wages do not have to be provided. It means the unemployed poor can now stay in bed and relax, freed from the responsibility of decision-making and from the trappings of wealth and having to own houses.
What a successful, caring and interesting civilization we have become. For that we can thank the new science and those who advance it.

" The overall scientific credibility of the Climate Feedback critique is extremely low.  The CLINTEL European Climate Declaration – “There is No Climate Emergency” is a plain language statement of views for the UN and the general public to consider.  Climate Feedback attempts to offer a scientific critique of general points rather than simply asking the signatories to provide their evidence to back up the summarized statements. The Poynter Institute for journalists has ‘certified’ Climate Feedback, but most journalists do not even know the name of the complex differential equations integral to climate change. How can they certify who is or is not a climate scientist, an expert or accurate, in a field they know nothing about?  This absurdity is laid out in Prof. Christopher Essex’ memorable essay: “Cavemen, Computers and Climate.”That said, let us critique the Climate Feedback response. Climate Feedback states:Similar letters have sought to establish credibility with large numbers of co-signers in the past, but evidence is what counts in science. (bold added)The signatories agree that evidence is what counts in science.  This is why they have signed this EU Climate Declaration.The Climate Feedback respondents are clearly not up to date with the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scientific findings.  At that time, the IPCC, reported that there had been no statistically significant warming for the 15 years prior (dating back to before Kyoto was ratified) despite a very significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration. Excerpt of Sept. 2013 IPCC WGI AR5 ReportThe (above) graph showing the global temperature anomaly versus the atmospheric CO2 concentration, illustrates a clear divergence between the rising ratio of CO2 concentration and the near flatline trend of temperatures for almost 2 decades.  The temperature spikes indicate El Nino years (a naturally occurring phenomenon).A similar graph above, using 5 datasets, (produced in 2015), shows a similar phenomenon – wide divergence between CO2 concentration and temperature.  This is contrary to the radiative forcing theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming.  While this evidence does not suggest that humans or CO2 from human industry have no effect on earth’s climate, it does show no correlation as theorized, and therefore questionable causation in respect to CO2 driving warming – especially ‘catastrophic’ warming.  Correlation of warming and CO2 rise, as was the case during the 1970’s-mid 1990’s was assumed as evidence of causation; the divergence of temperature and CO2 means no correlation is evidence of lack of causation.  This is a fundamental scientific principle. Dr. Hans von Storch, Lead author of the IPCC WGI (Physical sciences) of AR3, and WGII (Impacts, Adaptation, Vulnerability) of AR5 made public statements about this anomaly, prior to the issuing of the 2013 IPCC report, noting that not a single model forecast this pause. An excerpt from his interview with Der Spiegel:SPIEGEL: Just since the turn of the millennium, humanity has emitted another 400 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, yet temperatures haven’t risen in nearly 15 years. What can explain this?Storch: So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break. We’re facing a puzzle. Recent CO2 emissions have actually risen even more steeply than we feared. As a result, according to most climate models, we should have seen temperatures rise by around 0.25 degrees Celsius (0.45 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 10 years. That hasn’t happened. In fact, the increase over the last 15 years was just 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.11 degrees Fahrenheit) — a value very close to zero. This is a serious scientific problem that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have to confront when it presents its next Assessment Report late next year. (bold and underline added)SPIEGEL: Do the computer models with which physicists simulate the future climate ever show the sort of long standstill in temperature change that we’re observing right now?Storch: Yes, but only extremely rarely. At my institute, we analyzed how often such a 15-year stagnation in global warming occurred in the simulations. The answer was: in under 2 percent of all the times we ran the simulation. In other words, over 98 percent of forecasts show CO2 emissions as high as we have had in recent years leading to more of a temperature increase.Contrary to statements in the Climate Feedback critique, Dr. von Storch states that the models were not suitably predictive, not even close.He goes on to acknowledge that science is a process, subject to new findings all the time.SPIEGEL: What could be wrong with the models?Storch: There are two conceivable explanations — and neither is very pleasant for us. The first possibility is that less global warming is occurring than expected because greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have less of an effect than we have assumed. This wouldn’t mean that there is no man-made greenhouse effect, but simply that our effect on climate events is not as great as we have believed. The other possibility is that, in our simulations, we have underestimated how much the climate fluctuates owing to natural causes. (bold added)SPIEGEL: That sounds quite embarrassing for your profession, if you have to go back and adjust your models to fit with reality…Storch: Why? That’s how the process of scientific discovery works. There is no last word in research, and that includes climate research. It’s never the truth that we offer, but only our best possible approximation of reality. But that often gets forgotten in the way the public perceives and describes our work. (bold added) Note that the interviewer refers to “which physicists simulate the future climate” – yet Climate Feedback critics suggest that anyone who is not a ‘climate scientist’ has nothing to say on the issue of climate.  Climate Feedback authors denigrate the signatories as not being ‘climate scientists’ because many signatories are geophysicists or geologists. Earth sciences is the original home of climate science, dating back three hundred years to James Hutton, father of modern geology. https://www.academicinvest.com/science-careers/environmental-science-careers/how-to-become-a-climatologistGoogle search records reveal that the term ‘climate science’ and ‘climate scientist’ only became unique terminology about 2005. Are we to believe Climate Feedback’s position on ‘who is a climate scientist’ that only scientists qualified in the past 15 years or self-identified as ‘climate scientist’ are the experts? All understanding of earth’s complex climate system rely on the works of hundreds of thousands of earth scientists, atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, volcanologists, astrophysicists, chemists, biologists, and physicists dating back hundreds of years; yes, we stand on the shoulders of giants and the Climate Feedback critics actually mock the work of many of these emeritus professors.Evidence Over IdeologyEU Climate Declaration signatory physicist and Professor Emeritus Francois Gervais has published a paper showing that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation 60-year cycle has more to do with climate change and temperature, than carbon dioxide. Gervais also did a presentation at the Porto Climate Conference in 2018 at the Porto University (Faculdade de Letras, Universidade do Porto)  showing that the ‘consensus’ view has now shifted dramatically – scientists see carbon dioxide as a nominal contributor to global warming and nothing catastrophic.  While the Climate Feedback critics may hold a different scientific view, the proper approach is to invite discussion and open debate.  Clearly there is a disparity between what Climate Feedback critics say, and what the evidence shows.https://youtu.be/wU1PKa0W8Gc English and French versions of this material, videos, transcripts and the peer-reviewed paper are posted for convenience on this blog Climate Feedback Critics Dismiss IPCC Stance on Human InfluenceOne Climate Feedback critic claims that the natural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800’s and human influence prevailed thereafter, while the IPCC states that human influence only stems from 1950, and everything prior was natural.  Likewise, the IPCC only claims that more than 50% of the warming after 1950 was human caused (but not 100%). A review of the graph of the Holocene (above) shows cyclical warming and cooling is the historical norm and that current warming is within the range of previous warm cycles.Timothy Osborn, Professor,University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit:The current period of warming is not because the Little Ice Age ended by 1850. Climate scientists study the causes of warming and cooling period and calculate their effects on our climate. These studies show that natural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800s. The warming from the late 1800s to the present is all due to human-caused climate change, because natural factors have changed little since then and even would have caused a slight cooling over the last 70 years rather than the warming we have observed. (italics added)Osborn confidently states that ‘natural factors have changed little since then’ without any evidence to support his claim.  In fact, natural factors are highly variable, most are not even documented or quantified and some, as noted in the APS document referred to below, are on very long-time scales for which we have no data.https://www.aps.org/policy/statements/upload/climate-seminar-transcript.pdf The foregoing shows that we are ‘far from understanding the climate system.’  Climate Feedback critics claim to be experts on the topic of climate, they claim that the greenhouse effect has been understood for well over a century, citing this about Svante Arrhenius:1896 – SvanteArrhenius publishes first calculation of global warming from human emissions ofCO2: doubling the CO2 in the atmosphere would raiseglobal temp some 5-6°C (9-11°F) In fact, in 1906, Arrhenius published a paper in German in which he drastically amended his view (based on additional scientific insights) and affirmed that warming would top out around 1.5 °C and would be beneficial.  This is effectively what we see today.  Indeed, temperatures have been drastically dropping for the past 3 years, despite a continuing rise in CO2 concentration.  Whether this trend continues or not, we will have to see.  In any event, due to the cyclical nature of climate change, earth’s populations should be prepared for either warming or cooling and implement relevant adaptations where possible.https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/While Climate Feedback critics and Poynter Institute journalists confidently state claims about earth’s temperatures, the experts at NASA GISS are much more circumspect.GISS Surface Temperature AnalysisThe Elusive Absolute Surface AirTemperature (SAT)The GISTEMP analysis concerns only temperature anomalies, not absolute temperature. Temperature anomalies are computed relative to the base period 1951-1980. The reason to work with anomalies, rather than absolute temperature is that absolute temperature varies markedly in short distances, while monthly or annual temperature anomalies are representative of a much larger region. Indeed, we have shown (Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987) that temperature anomalies are strongly correlated out to distances of the order of 1000 km.Q. What exactly do we mean by SAT? A. I doubt that there is a general agreement how to answer this question. Even at the same location, the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 ft above the ground and different again from 10 ft or 50 ft above the ground. Particularly in the presence of vegetation (say in a rain forest), the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation. A reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 ft of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation. To measure SAT we have to agree on what it is and, as far as I know, no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted. Even if the 50 ft standard were adopted, I cannot imagine that a weather station would build a 50 ft stack of thermometers to be able to find the true SAT at its location.Q. What do we mean by daily mean SAT? A. Again, there is no universally accepted correct answer. Should we note the temperature every 6 hours and report the mean, should we do it every 2 hours, hourly, have a machine record it every second, or simply take the average of the highest and lowest temperature of the day? On some days the various methods may lead to drastically different results.Q. What SAT do the local media report? A. The media report the reading of 1 particular thermometer of a nearby weather station. This temperature may be very different from the true SAT even at that location and has certainly nothing to do with the true regional SAT. To measure the true regional SAT, we would have to use many 50 ft stacks of thermometers distributed evenly over the whole region, an obvious practical impossibility. In light of these insights, clearly no one should be claiming absolute certainty about global warming or ‘hottest year ever.’  As well, many scientists and citizens were deeply disturbed by the revelations of the ClimateGate emails which showed that scientists holding dissenting views on the effect of CO2 or who ascribed other factors to climate change (i.e. solar or ocean cycles, subliminal geothermal activity in the ocean, etc.) were systematically blocked from publication by a clique of climate insiders.  Other serious issues of scientific integrity and breach of ethics were exposed, as was the fact that sea surface temperatures in a large part of the world had been ‘made up.’  Some emails revealed that ENGOs like WWF were apparently directing preferred ‘results’.  WWF has been extensively funded by the ClimateWorks green billionaires. One of the Climate Feedback critics is the director of the climate research unit at one of the facilities most implicated in the ClimateGate scandal (not to suggest this person bears any responsibility; simply pointing out that this facility’s overall scientific integrity was put in question).In addition, a grad student’s 2016 report found thousands of errors in the HadCRUT (Hadley Climate Research Unit) Temperature datasets.  Some of these included embarrassing, nonsensical items like temperatures of 80 °C for months for Caribbean Islands or apparent sea surface monitored temperatures actually taken from a site that is miles inland. As pointed out by science writer Joanne Nova, “…it begs the question of why a PhD student working from home can find mistakes that the £226 million institute with 2,100 employees could not.”Climate Feedback was critical of the fact that the EU Climate Declaration also includes business people, as if business people need a climate science degree to see such errors and breaches of integrity in climate science – yet still be required to pay millions in carbon taxes or to address GHG regulations that impose severe burdens on their business.  Obviously, business people understand math better than many climate scientists do, and they understand that such breaches of integrity and accuracy, in their world, would result in severe financial or even criminal penalties (if related to air/water quality monitoring/regulatory issues or related to securities fraud), loss of customers, and collapse of their business operations.  The climate science world gets a pass on all these real-world consequences. This must not be allowed to continue. Type Two Scientific Misconduct by Climate Feedback, Sanctioned by PoynterThe participants in Climate Feedback review engage in Type Two Scientific Misconduct “‘type two scientific misconduct’ is other-harming and leads to falsely negative conclusions about someone else’s work‘ by referring to scientists in a defamatory manner by stating that signatories who hold rational, dissenting views on the alleged ‘consensus’ are ‘well-known climate deniers‘ when not a single person on the EU Climate Declaration signatory list denies that climate changes, and they all agree that humans affect climate change, but that the effect is nominal and not catastrophic.  Name calling like this is contrary to responsible conduct in research, as set out in the NAS handbook “On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research.”“Science has progressed through a uniquely productive marriage of human creativity and hard-nosed skepticism, of openness to new scientific contributions and persistent questioning of those contributions and the existing scientific consensus.” (underline emphasis added)Those who question are engaging in responsible conduct in research. Those who close ranks are preventing scientific progress.On a personal note, it is particularly offensive to see scientists attempting to denigrate scientific colleagues through the use of the term ‘denier,’ especially when many of the scientists of the European Climate Declaration live in EU countries where the horrors of the Holocaust still reverberate.The term ‘denier’ seems to have emanated from a PR man and Al Gore acolyte, who set up DeSmogBlog, a site that is a fundee of members of the massive ClimateWorks Foundation green billionaire network which funds most academics, non-profit journals, and local environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) as proxies to push the ClimateWorks plan to establish global cap and trade, carbon pricing and to put trillions of their vested interest renewables on the grid worldwide. Curiously, neither DeSmogBlog founder James Hoggan nor Al Gore are ‘climate scientists’ either, but they feel free to hurl the epithet ‘denier’ about and it is even more curious that respectable scientists, like those engaged in Climate Feedback commentaries, bring dishonor to the realm of science with such Type Two Scientific Misconduct tactics.  Discounting Expertise of Working ProfessionalsClimate Feedback claim many of the signatories work or have worked in fossil fuel industries, as if this automatically discounts their expert professional insights.  Earth scientists who have worked in oil, gas or coal must provide accurate assessments of the risk, access to and value of these precious resources.  To this end, they have studied 4.5 billion years of earth’s climate change history in order to make reliable judgements, upon which billions of dollars of investment rest, and from which society benefits with modern conveniences, modern medicine, and our many freedoms – especially that of world travel.Expert geoscientists and Professional Engineers work with models all the time and their works require exacting outcomes – both for public safety, and to meet investor and securities regulations. They are rightly critical of the climate modelling community which pumps out projections that are far from reality. Millions of people are being frightened by faulty climate models and related media hype, billions of dollars in public funds are being wasted on unreliable infrastructure (like wind and solar/electric vehicles) yet the climate modelled outcomes and claims would never meet basic industry standards. A disturbing revelation from the American Physical Society (APS) workshop of 2014 revealed that climate modellers found a 30% scaling error which they corrected on ten year forecasts….but not on 100 year projections! DR. KOONIN: But if the model tells you that you got the response to the forcing wrong by 30 percent, you should use that same 30-percent factor when you project out a century. DR. COLLINS: Yes. And one of the reasons we are not doing that is that we are not using the models as statistical projection tool.DR. KOONIN: What are you using them as? DR. COLLINS: Well, we took exactly the same models that got the forcing wrong and which got sort of the projections wrong up to 2100. DR. KOONIN: So, why do we even show centennial-scale projections? DR. COLLINS: Well, I mean, it is part of the assessment process. And the uncertainty, I think there is a point not to get confused about what the driving uncertainties there are. By the year 2100, it’s not – DR. KOONIN: If you calibrated the model against historical data, discovered you needed .7 to be applied to the greenhouse gas, you should keep that same .7 when you run it forward, no? Climate and investment policies are being set based on these long-range model projections which apparently include a significant, known scaling error.  In the context of a geoscientist or Professional Engineer working in any industry, (but particularly fossil fuel industries where reserve assessments and project development work decades in advance) such improprieties and lack of scientific integrity would result in firing and professional misconduct penalties.  In the climate world, such improprieties are only discovered ‘by accident’ in an APS workshop and then passed off as ‘…it is part of the assessment process.’ What is being assessed if the model is rife with scaling errors?Philosophers in Climate ScienceClimate Feedback critics are fixed on the notion that only ‘climate scientists’ can know anything about climate change and as critics they appear to claim some superior knowledge themselves.  Climate Feedback critics are critical of the inclusion of philosophers, despite the fact that the IPCC itself has two ‘moral’ philosophers – and look what this one has to say: “To fight climate change, the IPCC finds it necessary to hold meetings in remote corners of the world.” The IPCC philosopher seems to think that buying offsets will mitigate impacts of fossil fuel use. We will let readers draw their own conclusions about this unscientific theory and whether public funds should finance travel junkets and make carbon traders rich on your tax dollars http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0060/pdf/Philosopher%20at%20the%20IPCC.pdf Institutionalizing Climate LysenkoismSadly, Climate Feedback and Poynter Institute (which has certified Climate Feedback as an ‘accurate’ fact checking organization) are institutionalizing Climate Lysenkoism through group think and denigration of this cadre of 500 excellent scholars and professionals, many of whom have been awarded their nations’ highest honors for science and public policy work. This type of bullying and harassment is contrary to Poynter’s own core values:FairnessWe strive to act justly, to respect people and their privacy, to present different points of view and to minimize harm. (emphasis added)Expected BehaviorFirst and foremost, treat everyone with respectUnacceptable BehaviorUnacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, intimidating, threatening, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, demeaning or disorderly conduct;  EU Climate Declaration French Ambassador, Benoit Rittaud, gave a presentation on the Lysenkoism theme at the Porto Conference. Earth is in the Meghalayan, Not the Anthropocene In July of 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences issued a statement concerning the latest stratigraphic designation – stating that we are in the Meghalayan stage of the Holocene.  Many had been expecting that the Anthropocene would be announced as confirmation that humans have greater influence on climate change than nature.The people most qualified to comment on earth’s climate are geologists, yet curiously they are left out of the IPCC list of scientists.  While one Climate Feedback critic decries the lack of biologists and women in the EU Climate Declaration, Roger Higgs has reviewed the IPCC AR6 list of experts and finds:IPCC’s next report, AR6, supposedly “will update our knowledge on climate change, its impacts and risks, and possible response options, and play an important role in implementing the Paris Agreement” said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. The selected “author teams, drawn from the hundreds of excellent nominations the IPCC was fortunate to receive, provide us with the necessary expertise across a range of disciplines to conduct the assessment” … but in truth …the author statistics (below) show that the “necessary expertise” is lacking, as geologists are again excluded, rendering the collective authorship incompetent for their stated mission of reviewing the literature to assess climate change. By this omission, IPCC ignores Earth’s history and the copious geological evidence, latterly backed by archaeology, that sea level (barometer of global temperature, via ocean-water expansion & polar ice melt) undergoes a rapid (100-500 year) & large (1-3 metres) oscillation every 500-2000 years, caused by volcanism and solar fluctuations, certainly not by industrial CO2.AR6 author statistics:Working Group I (WGI), ‘The Physical Science Basis’, 232 authors, including meteorologists, oceanographers, climate scientists, glaciologists, physicists, geographers and computer modellers, but no geologists.WGII, ‘Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, 323 authors, no geologists.WGIII, Mitigation of Climate Change, 229 authors, no geologists. Grand total 784authors, no geologists.Exemplifying IPCC’s chronic lack of impartiality (see my Technical Note 2018-2), one WGI author’s new (2018) book, ‘Sunburnt Country’, aims to convince the public that man is making Australia hotter; another’s frequent mainstream-media articles likewise aim to scare people into accepting that manmade warming is fact, not mere belief, and he criticizes Trump.IPCC’s Lee again, in true UN egalitarian style: “Of the selected experts, 44% come from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, 53% are new to the IPCC process and 33% are women.” How lovely: no geologists, but at least we have politically correct quotas of women, third worlders and youngsters! Worse: the 53% “new” people are doubtless nearly all younger than 50, i.e. indoctrinated through school and university with the ‘CO2 = pollutant’ fallacy.Be appalled that this biased, underskilled, political organization, having judged the imperceptible & geologically trivial 1°C of warming since 1900 (not a provably unprecedented rate) to be manmade, despite copious evidence of CO2’s innocence (Technical Note 2019-11), has unleashed multi-trillion-dollar expenditure, relentlessly raising your family’s taxes and energy bills, and destined to cripple the global economy and downgrade human living standards.In ClosingClimate Feedback and Poynter Institute do a disservice to open, civil debate on climate and energy policies and both appear to be agenda driven, while claiming to be fair, objective and fact-based.It is unfortunate that these flawed organizations are highly influential on media and social media outlets, with the behemoth Facebook relying on the Climate Feedback faulty claims as a rationale for blocking the distribution of the European Climate Declaration.This is contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and contrary to scientific principles.Science is about inquiry, not compliance.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"**Migrants, bundled in blankets and foil, have arrived in Dover after journeying across the Channel,**
Temperatures at the Kent port hovered around 7C while a woman and a group of men were seen being helped ashore by Border Force officials,.
The Home Office said 59 people on four boats crossed the Channel on Friday.
On Thursday two boats with 24 people made the crossing, with the French authorities stopping 147 people leaving French shores over the last two days.
Numbers of people making the dangerous crossing aboard small boats have rocketed this year.
According to figures collated by the BBC about 8,000 migrants in small boats have been taken into the care of Border Force officials, having reached UK shores or been intercepted in the Channel.

"Heat waves are nothing new.
It is often said that many people do not read the minutes of the last meeting.
For days now we have been hearing, about “unprecedented heat” and record temperatures. Naturally the government science and media arms are quick to blame carbon dioxide or man-made global warming for this (and every other unusual weather event).
Three comments:
Firstly, when the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reports a “record” temperature, they mean “since 1910 in BOM’s adjusted records”. They ignore all records earlier than 1910 on the excuse such records were not taken in the shade according to their method.
Secondly, they have “adjusted” their raw data for various reasons, and the adjustments have generally “cooled the past” thus increasing the apparent warming trend, and increasing the chances that a recent heat wave will produce “highest ever temperatures”.
Thirdly, neither the BOM nor their lazy media megaphones have learnt to look at the past as recorded in newspapers of the times.
Rick Dean has had such a look and his report, taken verbatim from newspapers of the times, shows that heatwaves (and associated bushfires) are nothing new. He records at least 24 heatwaves in Australia in the period 1886 to 1929. For example:
In 1895 at Bourke there were 66 deaths from heat apoplexy over a period of six weeks, during which time the heat was never under 114 degrees shade heat and, what was worse, never under 100 degrees at night. The maximum temperature recorded under true shade conditions was 128 DegF (53.3 DegC). In Sydney in Jan 1896 the temperature reached 131 DegF in the shade (55 DegC). Publications at the times recorded many earlier heat waves back to 1791.

By Neil Lock

In the early 1970s, I studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. I enjoyed it at the time, but was left with a feeling that something wasn’t quite right. Although I scraped a First, and was offered a place on Part III of the Tripos, I decided to go out into the real world instead. Never did I make a better life decision.
Over the intervening decades, I have come more and more to question the value of universities. I would have expected the remit of a university to be (1) to seek, (2) to develop, and (3) to pass on, ideas and practices to improve the human condition, both today and in the future. There should be no dishonesties in their processes, no imposed orthodoxies, and no restrictions on the freedom to seek, or to tell, the truth. Yet, universities – not just at Cambridge, but world-wide – seem to have become bastions of political correctness. Anyone in the faculty, who doesn’t toe the party line and parrot the narrative of the moment, will find difficulties in funding or in getting papers published, or may even be in danger of dismissal. Peter Ridd in Australia and Susan Crockford in Canada are topical examples.
CAM
Today, Cambridge University seeks assiduously to cultivate its alumni; for the purpose of donations, no doubt. And they do this through a glossy called CAM (Cambridge Alumni Magazine), which they send out three times yearly. To a mailing list which includes me.
I confess that, for me, CAM has previous. In 2016 [[1]] it published what I can only describe as a full-page ad for nanny-statism. This article talked of: “increasing support for interventions – often by governments – to forcibly change environments to make easier the healthier behaviours that many of us prefer.” And of “how to increase public demand for such interventions.” Yet the author, Professor Theresa Marteau, stands high in the favour of the UK’s current ruling class. Even having, in 2017, been made a Dame Commander of the British Empire.
So, to the latest CAM: [[2]]. There are some good articles in this issue. But it also shows a more sinister side of Cambridge thought today; one which, indeed, makes Professor Marteau’s nanny-statism look a bit tame.
Technology and human rights
The article “Human Rights in a Digital Age” looks at how large companies like Facebook and Google threaten human rights by distilling, and selling on, the personal data they collect.
What I found remarkable here was the tone of the quotes from some of those interviewed. The recurring mention of surveillance capitalism suggests a desire to besmirch capitalism in general. Two of them talk, in a disapproving way, of a neoliberal idea of individual human rights. Another, a former colleague of Professor Marteau, is negative about the use of common sense in evaluating politics, describing it as “entrenched beliefs and familiar tropes.” Another seeks “collective protections… now,” wants to “affirm the collective good in our systems,” and talks appreciatively of a “Just Transition” (whatever that means) to zero carbon (which, I assume, is code for “zero nett carbon dioxide emissions.”)
Taking these together with Professor Marteau’s article, I detect, among some Cambridge academics at least, a top-down, collectivist mentality. This mentality favours big government, is hostile to business, industry and the free market, and disdains individual human beings and our rights and freedoms. But it isn’t, as some on the political right seem to think, a resurrection of Marxism. To me, it looks more like a cross-breed of Lysenkoism and fascism.
The post-modern connection?
At this point, I must tip my hat to writer Lucy Jolin for an aha moment. Early in her essay “How to be Modern,” she makes an approving reference to post-modernism. Cambridge University, indeed, sees enough value in post-modernism to have lent the kudos of its name to two Cambridge Introductions and a Cambridge Companion on the subject. So, what is this way of thinking, that seems to have taken over so much of academic Western philosophy and literature in the last few decades? To show that the hymn sheet I’m singing from isn’t all of my own composition, I refer you to Britannica’s very brief introduction to post-modernism: [[3]].
For those who didn’t take the link, I’ll paraphrase. Post-modernism denies the existence of objective reality and objective truth. Instead, it claims that these things can only be relative to a culture. It denies any basis on which to build up knowledge, and rejects as totalitarian any attempts to systematize knowledge. It denies that there are any objective moral values. It denies that reason and logic, science and technology, business and industry are tools to better the human condition. Instead, it paints them as instruments of oppression and destruction. And it denies that there is such a thing as human nature, independent of culture. Instead, it sees individuals as formed and moulded by the society they happen to live in.
Amazing, isn’t it? This is a mind-set that opposes, in almost every respect, the Enlightenment values which underpin our Western civilization. Such as: Reason. Science. Freedom of thought and rational enquiry. Religious and doctrinal tolerance. The idea that there is a moral core common to all humanity. Natural rights, and recognition of the worth and dignity of the individual. The rule of law and justice. Government for the benefit of the governed; that is, for the benefit of all the governed, real criminals excepted. A positive view of human progress, and a rational optimism for the future. And yet, Cambridge University, no less, sees much value in this anti-Enlightenment credo!
In its more extreme manifestations, and notably among those of the deep green persuasion, this dogma goes further yet, towards anti-humanism. It denies that humans are special, and capable of far more than mere animals. And it denies that the Earth is our planet, and that its resources are there for us to use wisely in order to build the best civilizations we can. So, this mind-set denies us the right to make our planet into what it should be: a comfortable home and a peaceful, beautiful garden, worthy of civilized humanity.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that all, or even a majority of, Cambridge academics have let themselves be taken over by this post-modernist and anti-human creed. Particularly since, in academic circles, post-modernism seems now to be a was more than an is. But the damage has been done. I’m in no doubt that the collectivist mind-set, which I identified from the earlier CAM articles, has at its core ideas close to post-modernism.
And what a crazy bunch of ideas they are! No basis for knowledge? That means no reason at all to have universities, or indeed any institutions of learning. Reality is only relative to a culture? So, people from different cultures have no basis on which to agree on anything; a recipe for a Hobbesian war of all against all. Science, technology, business and industry are bad? That means prosperity is bad, and poverty desirable. Except for the élites, of course. Earth isn’t our planet? If you believe that, it surely isn’t your planet.
No objective truth? That means it’s OK to lie, deceive, mislead or make false accusations. Or to ignore or pooh-pooh facts that don’t support your narratives. No objective moral values? That means anything goes, as long as you can get away with it. Arrogance, selfishness, callousness, recklessness, dishonesty and hypocrisy become normal, and personal responsibility goes out of the window. In short, psychopathic behaviour becomes OK. Individuals are formed by the societies they live in? That leads to demands for more and more central power, to force everyone into the politically correct mould du jour.
Indeed, identity politics, a spin-off from post-modernism, goes further yet. It promotes the idea that any group of people – for example, feminists or Extinction Rebellion protesters – if they can get enough political clout, have a right to force others to kow-tow to their demands.
But this anti-Enlightenment and anti-human syndrome has spread far beyond academe. The political class, including all the mainstream UK political parties, seem to have swallowed the extremist, humanity-hating agenda whole. Virtually all the media, many celebrities, those that think they’re trendy, and a sizeable slice of the rich and the corporate élites have bought it too. And today, its foot-soldiers are desperately trying to spread it among the general population, with lies, hype and ever-repeated screams of “It’s worse than we thought!” Causing serious psychological damage to many young people, whose bullshit meters are not yet well enough developed to resist the assault.
Absolute Zero
To the final CAM article; on the university’s program to “de-carbonize” itself, and to soften people up for the de-carbonization of Western economies, which the current political élites want to force on us all. The title, “Absolute Zero,” echoes a joint report published last November by five UK universities, using the collective moniker “UK FIRES.” Its director is a professor in the Engineering department at Cambridge. For a summary, see [[4]].
I confess that, if I hadn’t been given the link by a reputable source, I would have thought this was merely a sick joke. But sadly, it’s real. And, after just a single pass through the diagram summarizing the proposals, I could see that the whole idea is a nightmare; dystopian for us, and Utopian for the élites, at the same time. The proposals read like the edicts of a crazed, ultra-conservative dictator; and they make Soviet five-year plans look like a cake-walk.
No new petrol- or diesel-engine cars from right now? That would kill the automotive industry, quickly. Moreover, how would people in rural and suburban areas be expected to get around? (If you answer “buses,” how many new buses would be needed?) And how would people, who need to carry loads from place to place, do so?
All UK airports closed, and all freight shipping stopped by 2049? What would happen to the people, like seamen, airline workers and airport workers, who would be forced out of their jobs? And to those in affected industries, like travel and tourism? What would happen to UK trade with the USA? India? China? South America? What would happen to time-critical trade, like fresh fruit from Spain or Morocco? And – just to pick one more from many things that obviously haven’t been thought through – if there is no new home construction but the population is still increasing, where will the new people live?
Oh, and more. Why no mention of nuclear energy? Where’s the cost/benefit analysis, with all the uncertainties? How do we know it’s feasible within the timescale? Where would the money for all this come from? And beyond that, my common sense asks: Where’s the proof that any of this is necessary?
Back to the CAM article. I gagged when I read: “It is clear that we are in a state of climate emergency.” Just because politicians like Michael Gove or Theresa May say there’s an emergency, doesn’t make it true. Indeed, my own take is that anything any politician says should be considered dishonest, or even a lie, until proven otherwise. And then there’s the question… why now? What, objectively, happened in the year 2019, that caused a sudden shift to emergency? Apart from a storm of scares and propaganda, of course.
My state of health did not improve when I read: “We need to transform our whole society over the next couple of decades. Because the science is very clear. Time is running out.” “How do we spark individual behaviour change?” And achieve the “transition to a zero-carbon future… in a way that works for all sectors of society?” Further: “How do we put in place policies that will accelerate transition to a green future?”
That checks a lot of the post-modernist boxes, doesn’t it? The deceit of claiming there’s an emergency, without showing any hard evidence of one. The lie that the science is clear, when it’s about as clear as a hippo in a mud-bath. The arrogance of seeking to “transform” whole societies, without reference to those affected. And of seeking to use government force to facilitate the process. The recklessness of doing such a “transformation” all at once, and in a ridiculously short timescale. The collectivism of lumping us together into “sectors of society.” The clear sense of hostility to the ordinary human being, and the palpable desire to control us and to hurt us.
Moreover, nothing in this article provides or links to any hard, objective evidence that human emissions of carbon dioxide are responsible for any of the claimed effects of climate change. Nor, indeed, that those effects are in any way terrifying. Why not? Why have today’s Cambridge academics seemingly rejected the sage advice of Bertrand Russell, himself a Cambridge man? “When you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but look only, and solely, at what are the facts.”
Where is the proof of guilt?
Now, these proposals would without doubt cause a lot of harm to a lot of people. So, where’s the justification for them? What have we done, to deserve such treatment? Why should any of us accept any restrictions or inconveniences, without first seeing hard, conclusive evidence of what it is that we are supposed to have done wrong, and why it was wrong?
In a country like the UK, supposedly based on the rule of law, a charge such as causing catastrophic global climate change ought to be tried under due process of law. Ought it not? With all sides telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And in due process of law, human rights come into play. If accused of a murder, for example, each of us would have rights to assure us fair treatment. We must be presumed innocent until proven guilty. That is, it is up to the accusers to substantiate their case beyond reasonable doubt. We must also have the right to fair judgement by an independent and impartial tribunal. Each of us must have the right to speak up in our own defence, and to call whatever witnesses, including experts, we find necessary for our defence. And objective records of the trial should be accessible to all who wish to scrutinize them.
Moreover, if those accused of murder should have all these rights (and they should), how much stronger should the safeguards be, when the future of our entire civilization is at stake? Should not the charge be debated and assessed, objectively and rationally, in open and honest court, free from all political, emotional or media bias? Should not those involved in the assessment, on all sides, be required to give their evidence under oath, on penalty of perjury or worse if they lie or mislead? Should not the charge itself, and the conduct of those promoting it, first undergo a thorough audit by independent, honest, unbiased parties? And if the case is not proven beyond reasonable doubt, or if there has been any misconduct at all by the accusers in the case, should the charge not be dismissed with prejudice?
The first right of anyone accused, though, must be to a clear statement of the allegations. As far as I can make out, the charge sheet in this case reads: CO2 emissions by humans are causing catastrophic change in the climate on a global scale. And therefore, governments must take action – immediate action – to limit, or even to eliminate, these emissions.
And yet, I for one see no hard, objective, incontrovertible evidence being put forward that we humans are in any way guilty on this charge. Where is the evidence? Not theories, not computer models, not what-ifs, not guesstimates with huge error bounds and uncertainties. Just evidence: facts, and rational deductions from them, which can be independently verified.
Where, for example, are the millions of climate refugees? The thousands of dead polar bears, and the hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of dead coral reefs, that would have been still living without human-caused global warming? Where is the proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that weather is getting worse on a global scale, and that the cause is human emissions of CO2? And where is the proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that global sea level rise is accelerating abnormally, and for that same reason?
Is there a case to answer at all?
When I look at the supposed case against us, I wonder whether there’s actually any substantive allegation to counter at all. To put their case, the accusers would need to elucidate, using only hard evidence and logical deductions, answers to four questions. (1) Is it warming on a global scale, and if so, by how much? (2) If there is significant global warming, how much of it is caused by human emissions of CO2? (3) If human CO2 is causing significant warming, what would be the likely consequences for human civilization? (4) If there are significant likely negative consequences to civilization of human caused warming, what are the costs and benefits (to all the parties involved) of (a) reacting to problems only as they arise, or (b) putting in place preventive schemes to abate some of the problems?
I’m not going to argue the science in detail here, as that might turn off many of my potential audience. So, what I’ll try to do is be Socratic; that is, ask questions. Here are some of the questions, which any prosecutor seeking to prove the case, and any independent auditor seeking to assess it, would need to address.
To the first question: is it warming? Yes – it’s been warming since the 17th century. But how much is it warming? Which raises questions like: how accurate and reliable are the various sets of temperature data? How global are they? How far back do they reliably go? How affected are they by local influences, like urban heat islands? Is there hard evidence of anything unusual, above and beyond past variability, in recent decades? Where adjustments or in-filling have been necessary to raw data, how well are they justified and documented? Are their effects neutral with regard to trends, as you would expect if they were being done honestly? And, what are the uncertainties? Hint: they’re bigger than you probably think.
As to the second question, how much of this warming is caused by human CO2? This raises questions like: What caused earlier warming periods, like the Minoan, Roman and mediaeval warm periods? What caused the warming out of the Little Ice Age? What factors, like solar activity, might affect warming today, and how have they been accounted for? How much human-emitted CO2 stays in the atmosphere, and for how long? How much warming would be expected in theory from these levels of human CO2? How sure are we that the theory is quantitatively accurate? What happens to the warming afterwards, for example what are the knock-on effects of changes in cloud cover? Have the climate models got the underlying physics correct? And – as always – what are the uncertainties? Hint: they’re a lot bigger than alarmists let on.
The third question – what would be the consequences of warming for our civilization – is, I think, the crucial weak link in the accusation. For historically, human civilization has tended to flourish during warmer periods. So, the assertion that the effects of two, or even 5 or 10, degrees Celsius of global warming will be negative needs serious justification. Indeed, the only credible threat I can see to our civilization from any such warming is sea level rise. And sea level data is… Accurate? Reliable? Global? Properly adjusted for local effects like rising and falling coastlines? Consistent between tide gauges and satellite measurements? Showing anything unusual in recent decades, when considered objectively and as a whole? Moreover, how much, of the sea level rise there has been, has been caused by human emissions of CO2?
Then, there are the economic models, that alarmists have used to loudly proclaim that It’s Worse than We Thought. I don’t claim skills in that area, but I’d expect that some probing by independent experts into the economic calculations, and the assumptions on which they are built, might bear fruit. But in any case, we’re now into such a tower of economic models on assumptions on carbon cycle models on emissions models on climate models on dubious data, that the uncertainties will have grown to monstrous proportions.
As to the fourth question: As any mathematician or businessman knows, if you subtract one uncertain number from another uncertain number, particularly if the two are close together, the uncertainty is likely to become so large that no sane cost-benefit decision can be made. If I remember right, the UK’s 2008 climate change bill had a factor of 7 uncertainty in the estimated costs, and a factor of 12 in the “benefits.” Anyone offering such figures ought to have been told to go away, and not to come back until they had some numbers fit for purpose.
The conduct of the accusers
Next, I’ll ask: How well have those on the accusers’ side behaved? How well has the conduct of the whole process, scientific and political, measured up to the reasonable expectations of those who are being subjected to its consequences? My one-word answer is: atrociously.
What about the scientists? We’ve seen doctoring of data, to make it look more alarming. Hockey stick, anyone? We’ve seen data, that doesn’t support the alarmist narrative, airbrushed out. We’ve seen refusal to release data. We’ve seen suggestions that data should be deleted to forestall Freedom of Information requests. We’ve seen suppression of dissenting scientific views, and even attempts to get journal editors sacked.
Now science, if it is truly to be science, must be conducted in an entirely honest way. If it isn’t honest, it isn’t science. So, if someone took taxpayer money to do science, and what they did using that money was dishonest, is that not fraud against taxpayers?
What about the politicians? We’ve seen politicians making costly green commitments on behalf of the people they are supposed to represent, without any attempt at rigorous justification. We’ve seen political interference in the science, as with the 1995/6 IPCC report. We’ve seen goalposts moved arbitrarily, like lowering some supposed temperature limit from 2 to 1.5 degrees C above historical levels. We’ve seen government whitewashing misconduct by scientists and others, as in the Climategate inquiries.
As to the media, the BBC [[5]] has likened allowing climate change realists to speak to “letting someone deny last week’s football scores.” Even though their own guidelines [[6]] say: “We are committed to reflecting a wide range of subject matter and perspectives… so that no significant strand of thought is under-represented or omitted.” In the murder trial analogy, this amounts to denying us the right to speak up in our own defence, and to have our witnesses – including experts – heard at all.
The precautionary principle
But for me, the most egregious act of bad faith by the accusers is their perversion, indeed inversion, of the precautionary principle. Which, at its root, is “Look before you leap,” or even “First, do no harm.” The 2002 UK government report “The Precautionary Principle: Policy and Application” is here: [[7]]. Here are a few quotes:
· The purpose of the precautionary principle is to create an impetus to take a decision notwithstanding scientific uncertainty about the nature and extent of the risk.
· Although there is no universally accepted definition, the Government is committed to using the precautionary principle, which is included in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.
· Applying the precautionary principle is essentially a matter of making assumptions about consequences and likelihoods to establish credible scenarios…
· ‘Absence of evidence of risk’ should never be confused with, or taken as, ‘evidence of absence of risk.’
· …invocation and application of the precautionary principle carries a general presumption that the burden of proof shifts away from the regulator having to demonstrate potential for harm towards the hazard creator having to demonstrate an acceptable level of safety.
Do you see what they did there? Not only have they abandoned all pretence of presumption of innocence; but they have also inverted the burden of proof. They demand that we, the accused, must show that everything we’re doing is safe. They require us to prove a negative, that we’re not causing a problem. Which, in general, is impossible. And even if we’re not actually causing any risk at all, they can use the ‘absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence’ trick to find us guilty anyway! In a murder trial, such bad faith ought to lead to immediate dismissal of the case, and prosecution for perverting the course of justice. How much worse, then, is conduct of this kind when our whole human civilization is on the line?
Would a zero-carbon economy be sustainable?
Oh, and there’s more. In this case, it isn’t anything the accusers have done. Rather, it’s something they ought to have done, but haven’t.
From the start, one of the major green buzz-words has been “sustainability.” Now, my dictionary defines sustainable as “capable of being sustained,” or, otherwise said, able to endure into the future. And sustainable development, according to the UN: “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Supposedly, the rationale for all the fuss about global warming is that the alarmists think the current world economic system isn’t sustainable.
So, I ask: Would the zero-carbon future, which the politicians, academics and activists think is so important and urgent, actually be sustainable? Would it meet the needs of the present? Would it be able to endure into the future? Or would it, if put into practice, fail; for example, leading to widespread starvation, or people freezing to death? More generally, should not any contemplated political action, on the kind of scale the zero-carbonistas (as I dub them) seek, first be tried out on a smaller scale, to check that it wouldn’t have any negative effects? And would not failure to prototype the effects of such a proposed action be an egregious violation of the true precautionary principle, “Look before you leap?”
The solution is obvious. Isn’t it? Set up a zone, in which those committed to the zero-carbon project can indulge their fantasy without harming anyone else. Let all those, that have promoted or supported the project, go live in that area. Starry-eyed fanatics, that actually think it might work. Academics, that have lived off taxpayers while seeking to drum up support for an agenda that harms us. Corrupt bureaucrats and “scientists,” that have done the agenda’s dirty work. Empty-headed celebrities, that like to virtue-signal their green credentials. Cynical company bosses, that profit and have profited from the agenda. Activists, that hate human civilization and prosperity, and have a yen to destroy them. Media figures, that have trumpeted and hyped the agenda. Politicians that should have done their duty to the people they are supposed to serve, by strongly opposing the agenda; but failed to do so.
We might think, perhaps, of siting this zone in Cambridge. But Cambridge is too valuable as a tourist draw. Better, I think, to find a suitably sized parcel of fen not far away. I’m sure Trinity College will have acreage to let! Then, let the zero-carbonistas all go there to build their very own Shangri-La. As to those that have promoted or supported the agenda, but refuse to go, we’ll call them out as the hypocrites they are, and no human being will ever take any of them seriously again.
The purpose of the exercise, of course, is to find if a zero-carbon economy is sustainable, or not. To that end, we’ll require that the zone doesn’t emit any more CO2 than comes in. And though we’ll allow them to trade with people outside the bounds of their zone, we’ll require the zone as a whole to be economically self-sufficient. They have to show that a zero-carbon economy can survive and prosper without subsidies, grants, or gifts of money or goods from outside – including from government. (Especially from government!)
All this having been set up, we’ll leave them there for – say – fifty years. By then, the planet itself will probably have shown us that their accusations about human CO2 emissions causing catastrophe were pure crapola. Either that, or their sustainability experiment will have ended in failure; a failure which would both prove them wrong and serve them right, and which all human beings worth the name would greet with cries of “good riddance.”
The war we’re in
Now, let’s face it; we’re in a war. A war of a kind that, in England, hasn’t happened since the 17th century. Just as Charles I and James II sought to impose on the people the autocratic “divine right of kings,” so today an establishment cadre of anti-human politicians, bureaucrats, activists, academics, corporate bosses and other vested interests want to use the “climate change” scare to take dictatorial control over all of us. If you doubt that, look at this document from 2009: [[8]]. That one ticks all the post-modernist and anti-human boxes, too. And the organization that produced it, the “UK Energy Research Centre,” is still a major academic player in the “war on carbon.”
How do we defend ourselves against these enemies of humanity? We’ve tried arguing the science. That doesn’t work, because our enemies don’t care about either science or truth. Those, who think it worthwhile, might try forming an overtly climate realist political party, like the Forum voor Democratie in Holland. Though there are practical difficulties, like making sure such a party doesn’t degenerate into far-right nationalism or social conservatism. Civil disobedience is a third possibility. But that can only be a last resort.
No: for me, there is only one way forward. That is, to change hearts and minds. We need to create some climate change, for the better! To do this, I think we must seek to address three main audiences. First, the sizeable portion of the general population who, as polls show, aren’t convinced by the alarmist rhetoric, and aren’t willing to make sacrifices for a cause they don’t believe in. Second, academics at Cambridge and elsewhere, who are concerned that what their activist colleagues are doing is likely to alienate the public, and who want to avoid themselves being brought into disrepute as a result. Third, and probably most important in the short run, those few who have some degree of political influence, but are either new to politics, or have managed to remain uncorrupted by the system. And who are, therefore, willing to look at, and act on, the facts instead of toeing the establishment line.
Oppenheimer’s Razor
So, how do we create climate change, for the better, in hearts and minds? The first step, at any rate, is simple. It is to know who, and what, our enemies are.
Here’s a tool I use to separate the “sheep” – friends and neutrals – from the “goats” – enemies and likely enemies. I call it Oppenheimer’s Razor, after Franz Oppenheimer, the German Jewish sociologist who lived from 1864 to 1943. Here are some quotes from his master-work, The State, first published (in German) in 1908; English edition, 1922 [[9]].
· The State may be defined as an organisation of one class dominating over the other classes.
· There are two fundamentally opposed means whereby man, requiring sustenance, is impelled to obtain the necessary means for satisfying his desires. These are work and robbery, one’s own labor and the forcible appropriation of the labor of others.
· I propose in the following discussion to call one’s own labor and the equivalent exchange of one’s own labor for the labor of others, the “economic means” for the satisfaction of needs, while the unrequited appropriation of the labor of others will be called the “political means.”
· The industrial city is directly opposed to the state. As the state is the developed political means, so the industrial city is the developed economic means.
The blade of the razor is easily visible. To mis-quote George Orwell: Economic means good, political means bad. Even a beginning student of moral philosophy should be able to see, that those who strive always to use the economic means are civilized human beings; whereas those, that use the political means for their own profit, are crooks and villains. And that description applies to all those that take taxpayer money, and use it otherwise than for the benefit of those taxpayers. Such a student should also be able to see, that societies based on the political means rather than the economic means cannot be sustainable in the long term.
But, with the hindsight of more than a century, we can see that Oppenheimer’s optimism, in foreseeing swift victory of the economic means over the political, was premature. For, even in republics and democracies, the state is very much still there. In fact, its size, its power and its overreach have expanded hugely, to the detriment of all of us. And the users of the political means today do far more, and far worse, things to us than merely feathering their own nests. They have agendas and ideologies, that they want to force on all of us, whether we like them or not. And to those ends, they promote, make, support and enforce bad laws.
Bad laws, as Edmund Burke told us 250 years ago this year, are the worst sort of tyranny. You can see the truth of this, by looking at the atrocities committed by fascist and communist governments in the 20th century. But those that promote the zero-carbon agenda today seek to go further than Hitler or Stalin did. They aim at no less than the liquidation of Western industrial civilization, and of everything we human beings have, so laboriously, done to build it up over the last two centuries and more. Contrary to greens’ stated objectives of conserving species habitats, they aim to destroy our habitat, and our rights and freedoms as civilized human beings.
What is to be done?
Just as they were for him, these words of Lenin – no less! – are for us a key question. As I said earlier, arguing the science won’t work. Though I do think it’s valuable to have a repository of the best scientific arguments against the green agenda in general, and the zero-carbon agenda in particular. But arguing the wider case, including the economic and moral aspects, I think may well be more productive. For most people don’t like being ripped off. Nor do they enjoy being on the wrong end of injustice.
There has already been for many years a rising tide of discontent, in the UK at least, against the political class and their cronies. Shown, for example, by the Brexit vote, and people’s reactions to the subsequent fiasco. I’ve no reason to believe this tide doesn’t exist also in the USA and other places too. So, what will happen, as more and more people become aware of the lies and misconduct by the promoters of the green agenda? Of their arrogance, callousness, recklessness and hypocrisy? Of their failure to observe due process, and their trashing of our rights such as presumption of innocence? I expect that people will come more and more to feel contempt, not just for specific politicians and their hangers-on, but for politics as a whole, as it’s practiced today; and for all those that practice it.
Polls tell us that most people really don’t bother much, if at all, about the climate change issue. But as the restrictions on our lives, made in the name of combating climate change, become tighter and more and more onerous, I think there will come a tipping point. At which, many people will come to see the green activists, and those that have promoted and supported them, as the criminals they are.
Ask yourselves: Is it not our right to defend our economy, and the business and industry which has given us so much, against those that want to trash it? And is it not the duty of every human being worth the name, to do what we can to Save Our Civilization?
Should we not respond to our enemies’ “Absolute Zero” with our own Absolute Zero? A studied and contemptuous rejection of political arrogance, selfishness, callousness, recklessness, dishonesty and hypocrisy? And of all those, that use and have used them? Moreover, do not those that have sought to swing a wrecking ball through our human civilization deserve in return to be expelled from our civilization, and denied all its benefits?
The Re-Enlightenment
But to win a war like this, we’ll need something more. We need positives that people can hang on to, and say “yes, I’m with that.” And we have one right there, in our past: The Enlightenment! Is it not time to get the ideas and values that fuelled that revolutionary period in our history, on both sides of the pond, out of the cupboard, dust them off, and polish them up? Is it not time to spark a Re-Enlightenment? Is it not time to re-introduce these ideas into the common parlance of ordinary people? As I listed them earlier: Reason. Science. Freedom of thought and rational enquiry. Religious and doctrinal tolerance. The idea that there is a moral core common to all humanity. Natural rights, and recognition of the worth and dignity of the individual. The rule of law and justice. Government for the benefit of the governed; that is, for the benefit of all the governed, real criminals excepted. A positive view of human progress, and a rational optimism for the future.
We need to re-activate some deeper ideas, too. That we human beings are special. That the Earth is our planet. And that it is our nature to build the best civilizations – plural – we possibly can. For in order to flourish, human beings need an environment of diversity; in which every individual has free choice among many options. That is why good people must utterly oppose any idea of a world government, and reject all attempts towards creating such a thing, like the United Nations and the European Union.
We also need a more concrete and down-to-earth vision for the future, which ordinary people can easily buy into. That future, I think, must be one in which Franz Oppenheimer’s economic means will have superseded, and entirely replaced, the political means as the defining way in which we human beings do things. The future, I foresee, will be one of trade-trade, not raid-raid. Peace, justice and personal responsibility; not wars, bad laws and “sovereign immunity.”
Is it not through our economic activities, that we human beings take control of our environment, and so fulfil our nature? And – monkeys grooming each other notwithstanding – are not business and trade the characteristics which separate us from mere animals? No other species, to my knowledge, has developed a system which allows diverse individuals each to develop their own skills, do what they can for others, and reap in return the rewards they have earned. So, let’s go at it!
Let’s Change the Climate!
Our enemies are right in one thing. Substantial transformations are necessary, to take us human beings and our civilization beyond the failed political system under which we all suffer today. But in a totally opposite direction from what our enemies seek, of course.
The essence of the change I am looking for is something like the humanism of the Renaissance. Which, at the same time, looked back to ancient Greece and Rome, and forward to new developments, spurred on by the technologies of the time, like new aids to navigation. Those humanists were the progressives of their times. So am I; and so, I hope, are you!
Let’s look back to the Enlightenment, and at the same time forward to a better future. Let the climate change begin!

Seriously?!?   




Tomorrow [today] Rep. Henry A. Waxman and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, co‐​chairs of the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, will host representatives from five of America’s major sports leagues, as well as the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC), to discuss the effects of climate change on sporting activities and the work these organizations are doing to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The group will meet for a closed‐​door discussion, followed by a press availability.



Now, admittedly, even as a climatologist, I do spend a fair amount of time discussing sports.   
  
  
But I do so around the water cooler or at the local bar, not with Congressional task forces.   
  
  
Your tax dollars are probably better served that way.

"It was a close call for the queen. A walk around the grounds of Buckingham Palace in the very early morning hours nearly got Queen Elizabeth II shot by one of her guards, The Times of London reported on Wednesday. When she has a difficult time sleeping, the queen will put on a raincoat and walk around the palace grounds, The Times reported, quoting a former guardsman. He was on patrol inside the palace walls at 3 a. m. on an unspecified day several years ago when he saw a figure in the darkness, according to reports. Thinking he had spotted an intruder, The Times said, he called out, “Who’s that?” “To his surprise, it was the queen,” according to the account. “‘Bloody hell, Your Majesty, I nearly shot you,’ he blurted out. ” Realizing his remarks were inappropriate, the guard expected to be rebuked. Instead, The Times reported, Her Majesty replied: “That’s quite all right. Next time I’ll ring through beforehand so you don’t have to shoot me. ”"
"**A video clip of a Kurdish-Iranian girl who died with her family attempting to cross the English Channel last month highlights their drive for a better life.**
The clip shows a nine-year-old girl crying and laughing. ""My name is Anita Iranejad, I am from Sardasht,"" she says.
It is a screen test for a short film to be shot in her hometown. In the background, her father Rasoul Iranejad can be heard gently prompting her: ""I would like to be an actressâ¦ say it.""
The video suggests not just paternal pride, but ambition. Rasoul wants his daughter to achieve her dream. But that is a tall order for a little girl from this impoverished and politically oppressed region. The family are from Sardasht, a small, predominantly Kurdish city in western Iran
A year after the screen test, Rasoul, his wife Shiva Panahi, and their three children Anita, six-year-old Armin and baby Artin, 15 months, embarked on a dangerous journey to Europe.
But the family's hopes for their future were brought to a brutal end in the English Channel on 27 October. A small boat heading to the UK in rough conditions capsized just a few kilometres into its journey. Shiva and the children were trapped without life jackets inside the cabin.
Rasoul, 35, left Iran with his family in early August. Relatives did not want to comment directly on why they left, but there are many reasons why they might have wanted to start again somewhere else.
Sardasht, in west Azerbaijan province close to the border with Iraq, is a difficult place to realise any ambition beyond sheer survival. With little significant industry, it has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, and holds few prospects for its predominantly ethnic Kurdish population. Many are forced to resort to smuggling goods over the border into Iraqi Kurdistan. This is neither profitable - they earn less than $10 a trip - nor safe.
In the past few years, hundreds of them have been shot dead or injured by Iranian border guards. Many have fallen to their deaths from the rough mountainous terrain or been buried by avalanches in winter.
The region is also heavily militarised. Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, there has been conflict between Iranian security forces and armed Kurdish groups fighting for their rights. Iran labels them separatists backed by foreign powers.
Some 10% of Iran's population of 82 million are Kurds, and yet they make up more than half of the country's political prisoners, according to the UN.
There was a brutal crackdown from the authorities during and in the aftermath of anti-government protests in Iran last year, which exploded in the predominantly Kurdish towns on the western border with Iraq, as well as on the outskirts of Iran's major cities.
A friend of Shiva's told the BBC that Rasoul, 35, wanted to escape persecution.
She says that Shiva sold everything they had and borrowed money from friends and family to pay smugglers to take them to Europe. They wanted to get to the UK, which is a popular choice for Kurdish asylum seekers. They believe the UK takes a relatively small number of refugees, compared with other European countries, so they will have better prospects there.
Their first stop was Turkey. A video clip shared with the BBC by Rasoul's friends shows him singing in Kurdish, while the family waits for smugglers to take them to Europe.
""There is pain [in] my heart, huge sadness â¦ but what can I do, I have to leave my Kurdistan and goâ¦,"" he sings, his son Armin laughing in delight. His baby Artin toddles towards him and sits on his knee.
There is a famous saying among the Kurds: ""We have no friends other than mountains."" After the end of World War One, and the collapse of the Ottoman empire, the Kurds were promised independence by victorious allied powers, but the regional powers never accepted that deal - instead their homeland was eventually divided among the new nations of the Middle East. Since then, any moves by Kurds in Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq to set up an independent state have been quashed.
It used to be the case that Turkey was the final destination for thousands of Iranian refugees, but in the past seven years the political climate has meant this is no longer a viable choice.
There are reports from migrants that Turkish security forces have abused Kurdish refugees in police stations or deported them to Iran upon arrival. There have even been a number of political assassinations and kidnappings of Iranian dissidents in Istanbul.
So Rasoul and Shiva would have been keen to move on.
In September they found a smuggler and paid 24,000 Euros [$28,243] to be ferried from Turkey to Italy, and then taken by lorry to northern France.
Charlotte Decanter, a volunteer for the Adra charity in the coastal city of Dunkirk, says she met Shiva while distributing food at Grande-Synthe, the main camp for Kurdish migrants and refugees.
She was struck by her vivacity.
""A small woman, very kind, very sweet. I said a few words in Kurdish. She laughed a lot. She was stunned.""
But somewhere along their journey in France disaster had struck. Shiva and Rasoul were robbed of their possessions.
In texts Shiva sent on 24 October to a friend in Calais, she acknowledges the journey by boat will be hazardous, but says they don't have the money for a lorry trip.
""I know it's dangerous but we have no choice,"" she texts.
She makes it clear how desperate she is to find refuge.
""I have a thousand sorrows in my heart and now that I have left Iran I would like to forget my past.""
A friend of Rasoul's who travelled with the family to France says that on the evening of 26 October the smuggler in Dunkirk said it was time to make the crossing the next day.
They left in the early morning from a beach called Loon Plage, a desolate spot next to an oil depot.
The weather was extremely rough, with gusts of wind up to 30km per hour and waves about 1.5m high. The friend, who calls himself Aware, decided it wasn't worth the risk.
""I was scared, I refused to go,"" says Aware. ""I begged Rasoul that he shouldn't go either. But he said he had no choice.""
Rasoul paid the smugglers around Â£5,500, according to relatives in Iran.
Ebrahim Mohammadpour, a 47-year-old actor and documentary filmmaker from Sardasht, who was also on the boat with his brother Mohammad, 27, and his 17-year-old son, says the craft was only 4-4.5 metres long and designed for eight people, not the 23 that were crammed on to it.
""Honestly we were totally blind because we [had already] suffered so much in this journey,"" says Ebrahim. ""First you think, 'I don't want to get on the boat,' but then you say, 'I will board just to leave this misery.""
Yasin, a 16-year-old who was also on the boat, says only he and two others - no-one in Rasoul's family - were wearing life jackets. The 22 passengers were all Kurds from Sardasht, and the pilot was a refugee from northern Iran, they say.
Iranian migrants who have previously made the journey to the UK tell me smugglers usually ask the passenger who has the least money to drive the boat.
Shiva and the children went into the glass-partitioned cabin, which would have seemed warmer and safer. But it turned out to be deadly.
After around eight kilometres, the boat filled with water, according to Ebrahim.
""We tried to remove the water, but we couldn't. We wanted to return to Calais but we couldn't,"" he says.
His brother Mohammad says the passengers began to panic, lurching from one side of the vessel to the other, before the boat suddenly capsized.
It's difficult to establish exactly what happened next, as the accounts of survivors are confused.
All say that initially at least, Shiva and her children were trapped in the cabin.
Ebrahim says that Rasoul dived under the water to try and rescue them, and came up again to cry for help.
Peshraw, a university student, says he tried to break the glass of the cabin with a carpet cutter but was unable to even crack it. He says that he saw baby Artin floating inside.
Shiva's brother Raso told us he heard Rasoul managed to pull Artin out, then went inside for the others.
Ebrahim sobs as he recalls the moment he saw Anita floating in the water, and managed to grab her.
""I held the child in the water. I thought she might be alive. With one hand I was holding onto the boat and with another, I was holding the child. I kept shaking her to see if she was alive but there was no response,"" he says.
""I can't forgive myself,"" he cries.
Rasoul emerged from the boat moaning, and crying out the names of his family, according to Ebrahim's brother Mohammed, and then just let himself be taken by the waves.
A passing sailing boat raised the alarm at 0930 local time, and began to help those in the water, according to the French authorities. The first rescue ship arrived 17 minutes later, they say.
The authorities say that some people were taken out of the water in cardiac arrest, but will not go into details.
The survivors we spoke to believe Rasoul, Shiva, Anita and Armin had already died. Fifteen other people were taken to hospital. Baby Artin is still missing, presumed dead. Yasin says he saw him swept away in the water.
An Iranian man accused of being the captain of the boat has appeared before an investigating judge in France and is set to faces charges of manslaughter.
Shiva's brother and sister, who both live in Europe, travelled to a morgue in Dunkirk to identify the bodies, and were hoping to repatriate them on Friday.
The numbers of migrants attempting the perilous journey across the Channel is on the rise.
In 2018, 297 people reached the UK in small boats, 1,840 did so in 2019, and nearly 8,000 people have made the journey this year, according to BBC analysis.
At least 10 people have died while attempting this since 2019.
Most of the asylum seekers come from Iran.
Refugee charities and French politicians argue that would-be asylum seekers should be allowed to apply for sanctuary before they arrive in Britain.
Ebrahim says the survivors have nightmares.
Despite this, Yasin says he will try again to cross the Channel.
""Everyone was sad, I was very scared too. But I just want to be in a safe place. I will try again."""
"ISTANBUL  —   An Islamic State disciple kills 39 New Year’s revelers at an Istanbul nightclub. A gunman with a police badge assassinates Russia’s ambassador at an Ankara reception. Kurdish separatist bombers kill 14 soldiers on a bus in central Turkey and dozens of police officers at an Istanbul soccer match. Those assaults were just in the last few weeks, which made a car bombing on Thursday in the city of Izmir, where at least two civilians were killed, seem relatively minor. The 75 million people of Turkey, the NATO member and European Union aspirant that straddles Europe and Asia and was once seen as a stable democracy, are facing a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks unlike anything that has been seen in the West. Add to that the tumult from roughly three million Syrian war refugees, a resurgent Kurdish insurgency and a failed military coup  —   all tied, in the eyes of many Turks, to American negligence, or malice, or both. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies, including the news media, and has lashed out at what he regards as Western complicity. While Mr. Erdogan’s critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country, many Turks, frightened and uncertain, are not complaining. They view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories. Some are even embracing the advent of   Donald J. Trump, despite his   statements, viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him. In some ways, political historians and scholars say, what is happening in Turkey parallels the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the 2015 attacks in France and, most recently, the response to attacks in Germany. In all of them, many citizens were willing to overlook or forsake civil liberties, government powers grew, fringe groups strengthened and spread intolerance, and dissent was regarded with suspicion. “I think there are a lot of similar tendencies, and it leads to, in an extreme case, what we’re seeing in Turkey,” said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle East and African Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. Still, Mr. Cook said, “It’s not that far a leap to go to an extreme  —   can you imagine if the attacks in Turkey had happened in the United States?” On Friday, Hilal Kaplan, a columnist for Daily Sabah, a newspaper close to the government, lashed out at Western news coverage, including an article in The New York Times, that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through Turkish society that the United States is behind terrorism in Turkey. Describing the article as “an attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey,” Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States. She pointed out that Fethullah Gulen, the cleric and former Erdogan ally who many Turks believe was behind the coup attempt, lives in Pennsylvania, and that a former C. I. A. official had once vouched for Mr. Gulen on his green card application. In addition, she called attention to something else: The United States has provided military support to a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State extremists, a militia that Turkey considers an ally of the P. K. K. the outlawed Kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy. In her Friday column, headlined “Why Turkey is looking forward to Trump administration,” she added, “do they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the Turkish people as paranoid and Erdogan as a villain?” In another parallel to    America, the Turkish government has aggressively exploited tragic events to stoke patriotic feelings and to frame the broader struggle within the country as a fight to secure democracy, even if democratic practices are eroded to do so. The comparison was not lost on Turkish scholars, even those critical of Mr. Erdogan, who were in the United States when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked. “I couldn’t believe the extent to which there was a rise in nationalism, even among academics,” said Kemal Kirisci, a senior fellow and director of The Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, recalling his own memories of living in America. “I felt intimidated intellectually, almost felt censured. ” After the coup attempt, the government moved quickly to memorialize victims and places rived by violence, renaming a bridge in Istanbul and a square in Ankara, and changing street names to honor citizens who died defending Mr. Erdogan’s government. At year’s end, the prime minister’s office delivered packages to foreign correspondents in Turkey. Inside a black velvet box, with a silver clasp, was a small marble chunk, described as rubble from the Parliament building in Ankara, retrieved after an attack was carried out during the coup attempt. A note said that the rock “is presented to you as a symbol of Turkey’s devotion to democracy. ” And like American leaders who exhort citizens to maintain daily routines after terrorist attacks, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, urged Turks this week to carry on. “Our citizens should not change the flow of their normal lives,” Mr. Yildirim said in a speech. “If they do, it will be serving the purposes of the terror group. ” Mr. Erdogan and his allies see a double standard in the West’s reaction to Turkey, and say that some of the same measures Turkey is taking to combat terrorism, like resorting to emergency rule, have been embraced in the West, particularly in France. It is this disconnect  —   between how Turkey perceives its own experience and the West’s reaction to events in Turkey  —   that has contributed to Turkey pulling away from its NATO allies, and moving closer to Russia. “In France there is emergency rule for three months, and again for three months, and lately for six months, in total for a year,” Mr. Erdogan said in September. “Is anyone from around the world asking France, ‘why did you declare emergency rule for a year? ’” Mr. Erdogan emphasized that the violence Turkey has faced is far greater than in countries like France. “My brothers, Turkey was the scene of terror incidents so heavy that they cannot be compared with France, and more importantly we faced a coup attempt,” he said. “From this perspective I believe my country will understand the extension of emergency rule, and support it. ” In a speech on Friday, Mr. Erdogan underscored the deep traumas Turkey has suffered in recent years. “I do not believe any other country exists that went on its way standing upright after living with what we have gone through since 2013,” Mr. Erdogan said. “We became a unique example in history. We showed democracy can be protected together with security challenges. ” Mr. Erdogan’s supporters say they are especially upset over how the West has reacted to Turkey’s response to terrorism, saying they had expected solidarity, not criticism. “This is an obvious, very serious and problematic disrespect against Turkey’s right to defend itself against terror,” said Mustafa Yeneroglu, a member of Parliament with Mr. Erdogan’s Islamist Justice and Development Party. Mr. Yeneroglu, the head of Parliament’s human rights committee, said Turkey faced the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts. “If there is no security, there would be no room to enjoy the liberties,” he said. “This situation leads to prioritizing security while answering questions, ‘security or liberty?’ This is not only valid for Turkey but for all other liberal democracies. ” Turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary measures, but they make two counter arguments. One is that Turkey’s broad crackdown  —   in putting so many journalists and intellectuals in jail  —   has gone too far, and is seemingly unrelated to fighting terrorism. Another is that, even with emergency rule, the country has become less safe. “On the contrary, we have faced more attacks, more terror,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a lawyer and professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul who represents many jailed journalists. He continued, “there is emergency rule in France, but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on this scale. ” Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the attempted coup, put it this way: “Yes, ISIS is attacking. The P. K. K. is attacking. There was this coup d’état attempt. But what is this to do with all these journalists? There are over 150 journalists in jail. And with every passing day, they arrest more and more people. ” Marc Pierini, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels who was a former European Union ambassador to Turkey, said the   purges in the military, the courts and the police have, paradoxically, compromised the country’s ability to protect the public. Mr. Pierini also took issue with the government’s contention that its response to threats has been appropriate. “As we’ve seen after the coup, the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law. You started arresting police and gendarmes, now writers, actors, journalists  —   so there is no limit,” he said. “When you start pulling the thread on the rule of law, the whole sweater can come off. And that’s where we stand. ”"

Publishing in the scientific literature is supposed to be tough. Submit a manuscript to a reputable journal and it will go through “peer review,” where your equals criticize your work, send their comments to a journal editor and then the editor will decide whether to accept your submission, reject it outright, or something in between.



In order to limit any bias caused by personal or philosophical animosity, the editor should remove your name from the paper and send it to other experts who have no apparent conflict of interest in reviewing your work. You and the reviewers should not know who each other are. This is called a “double blind” peer review.



Well, this is “the way it is supposed to be.” But in the intellectually inbred, filthy‐​rich world of climate science, where billions of dollars of government research money support trillions of dollars of government policy, peer review has become anything but that.



There is simply no “double blindness.” For reasons that remain mysterious, all the major climate journals leave the authors’ names on the manuscripts sent out for review.



Economists, psychologists and historians of science all tell us (and I am inclined to believe them) that we act within our rational self‐​interest. Removing the double‐​blind restriction in such an environment is an invitation for science abuse.



What about if my professional advancement is dependent upon climate change monies (which applies to just about every academic or government climatologist)? I’m liable to really like a paper that says this is a horrible and important problem, and likely to rail against an author who says it’s probably a bit overblown. May God have mercy on any manuscript that mentions the rather large elephant in the room, which is that we probably can’t do much about it anyway.



Such “confirmation bias” has been noted and studied for years, but the response of science in general — and atmospheric science in particular — has only been to make things worse.



Peer review has become “pal review.” Send a paper to one of the very many journals published by the American Geophysical Union — the world’s largest publisher of academic climate science — and you can suggest five reviewers. The editor doesn’t have to take your advice, but he’s more likely to if you bought him dinner at the last AGU meeting, isn’t he? That is, of course, unless journal editors are somehow different than government officials, congressmen, or you.



Or, if you get wind that someone is about to publish something threatening your gravy train, maybe you can cajole the editor to keep it out of print for a year while you prepare a counter‐​manuscript.



That’s what the “Climategate” gang did with the _International Journal of Climatology_ when University of Rochester’s David Douglass submitted a paper. His work showed that a large warming at high altitudes in the tropics — one of the major ways in which the enhanced greenhouse effect is supposed to change the climate — isn’t happening. For the gory details, click here. The story on this one is still unfolding as the journal has declined to publish a sequel to the counter‐​manuscript.



Or you could simply ignore manuscripts sent to you that find problems with temperature histories.



But there has to be a gold standard somewhere, right? Perhaps the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ (PNAS)?



Dream on. If you are a member of the National Academy, you can submit four manuscripts a year, called “contributed papers” as long as you do the “peer review” yourself! That’s right: you send your manuscript to two of your friends, and then mail your paper along with their comments. Again, pal review.



The PNAS editor then rubber‐​stamps the results. In fact, the editor probably goes through quite a few rubber stamps a year, given that only 15 of the 800‐​odd contributed papers submitted in the last year were rejected. For comparative purposes, _Nature_ would have _accepted_ only about 50 out of that number.



A recent paper submitted to PNAS by National Academy member Richard Lindzen was afforded special treatment. The editor insisted that it be held to a different standard of review because of its “political implications.” Lindzen’s research found that carbon dioxide warming is likely to be much lower than what is being calculated by current climate models.



So what about the legion of alarmist papers from NASA firebrand James Hansen that PNAS publishes via pal review? Don’t they have “political implications” too? In the mind of our National Academy, apparently some political implications are more equal than others.



There’s a lot of confirmation bias working in Hansen’s favor, because it’s back to the back of the plane for ham‐​and‐​egger climate scientists if Lindzen is right. That’s where the “political implications” get personal.



There’s a lot more to this story. Lindzen eventually published his paper — which actually benefited from a real review — in an obscure journal. But the next time you think that peer review is unbiased, think of confirmation bias, pal review and Climategate, and try to figure a way out of the mess that climate science has gotten itself into.

"Most of the CO2 is not in the atmosphere. 98% of all CO2 is in the oceans (38,000 billion tons), and plants and soils (2,000 billion tons). Only 850 billion tons of CO2 is in the atmosphere (2% of the total CO2), and of that, less than 10% is man-made!
Over 90% of the atmospheric CO2 is produced naturally from decaying vegetation, fires, volcanoes, and the oceans. Also 80% of the world’s active volcanoes are under the sea bubbling out both liquid and gaseous CO2 and methane (and the sea is still alkaline). Indeed combustion reactions (power stations, fires, cars etc) produce CO2 and water, but it is the fine pollutant particles and chemicals (like oxides of sulphur and nitrogen) resulting from incomplete combustion that are the major problems affecting local temperatures, weather, as well as human health. Ruminating animals produce more greenhouse gases that all the buses, trucks and cars in the world combined!
Water by far the major greenhouse gas, cannot be controlled or taxed, so CO2 is measurable, blamed and potentially made taxable, even though most of it naturally occurring.Music paradise pro App But by contrast, in the sea, plankton growth from extra CO2 has grown tenfold over 50 years, and this is the main supplier of the oxygen that we breathe. Higher crop yields and greater vegetation growth rates have been reported worldwide due to the increased CO2 over the last 3 or so decades.

When President Barack Obama addresses the United Nations Climate Summit on Sept. 23, you can bet that he will be calling for immediate, substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. But is the time for action now?



The White House has claimed that the cost of delaying action on climate change would be greater than if actions were undertaken now. Therefore, the U.S. should move quickly to enact regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gases. But there is a fatal flaw in the reasoning: the climate issue does not fit the framework in which an early start implies lower costs.



That framework requires three basic conditions to be met. First, we need to know with a high degree of certainty what the optimal policy target is and when it needs to be reached. Second, we need to be sure that no influential new information will be arriving in the near future that might affect our view on an optimal policy target. Third, we need to have an accurate picture of the range of risks associated with acting or not acting.





The arguments for hasty action on greenhouse gases do not hold up.



Firstly, defining the optimal policy regarding greenhouse gas emissions has eluded governments for over 20 years. If there is going to be any policy response, it only makes sense at a global level, but global cooperation is unlikely. Even if it could be achieved, the more fundamental problem is that carbon dioxide, or CO2 (the greenhouse gas targeted under climate policy), is very difficult and expensive to reduce in quantities that matter for climate.



Unlike soot and particulate matter (better known as carbon pollution) there are no scrubbers to capture CO2 and nowhere to put it once it is captured. Reducing CO2 emissions pretty much requires cutting fossil fuel use, which is very expensive in an industrial economy. And at the scale of the global climate, only massive global reductions are large enough to have a measurable effect on climate. But only tiny reductions are affordable.



In other words, affordable measures are ineffective, and effective measures are unaffordable. Anyone picking a target and timetable for CO2 reductions (such as 20 percent by 2020) is, therefore, simply making an arbitrary guess.



The second question relates to the first. What might be the benefits of a 20 percent CO2 cut? To answer, we have to agree on the economic harm associated with the emissions. But, unlike carbon pollution, CO2 itself is not harmful; it only matters to the extent that it affects long‐​term weather patterns, and that is a notoriously difficult question to answer.



Scientists use computer models of the climate to study the problem. For about the past 20 years, models have been predicting far too much warming in response to CO2 emissions compared to what has actually been observed. In fact, notwithstanding President Obama’s erroneous claim in November 2012 that temperatures are increasing “faster than was predicted,” global warming all but stopped in the late 1990s, even though CO2 emissions rose faster than expected thereafter.



Having finally begun to grapple with the widening divergence between models and reality, the climate science community has recently floated dozens of different theories and conjectures, some of which imply pretty major revisions to the understanding of natural variability and the role of greenhouse gases in temperature change. The claim that the “science is settled” never made sense for climate, and is now completely untenable in light of the wild profusion of new theories to explain the mismatch between models and data.



However, this presumably is a temporary situation. We should expect that, over the next few years, progress will be made on the issue, and the theories will be winnowed out as they get tested against the data. In other words, new information will emerge, and it may fundamentally change our understanding of the social costs of CO2 emissions.



Meanwhile, the empirical evidence clearly points to the likelihood that the effects will be revised downward, not upward. It, therefore, is impossible to claim that we are in a position today to know what we will believe in a few years about the optimal policy target.



The third issue gets at the question of risk. If economic models are carefully calibrated against real‐​world data, and, on that basis, they show that the costs of over‐​reacting are small while the costs of under‐​reacting are large, we might still identify an optimal policy target notwithstanding the remaining uncertainties.



Unfortunately, economic models of climate policy are not calibrated to climate data at all; instead, they are calibrated to climate models — the very models now being rethought in light of their significant overestimation of warming in recent decades. If climate models showing a large effect from CO2 emissions get winnowed out, it will have direct consequences for economic analysis since those models contribute to the upper end of the range of expected social costs of carbon.



The arguments for hasty action on greenhouse gases do not hold up. This is a case where there is a positive value to waiting for the policy‐​relevant scientific information we know will be emerging in the next few years, before committing to a long‐​term course of action.

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  —   Federal law enforcement officials said they were investigating whether the gunman who opened fire on Friday at the airport here, killing five people and wounding eight, was mentally disturbed and heard voices in his head telling him to commit acts of violence. According to a senior law enforcement official, the gunman, identified as Esteban Santiago, 26, walked into the F. B. I. office in Anchorage in November and made disturbing remarks that prompted officials to urge him to seek mental health care. Mr. Santiago, appearing “agitated and incoherent,” said “that his mind was being controlled by a U. S. intelligence agency,” the official said. Other officials said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Santiago, who was captured in the airport, had been inspired by terrorist groups, including the Islamic State. The officials said he had viewed extremist materials on the internet. Shortly after 1 p. m. Friday, the suspect, who had been an airline passenger, pulled a semiautomatic handgun out of his bag and opened fire in a crowded baggage claim area in Terminal 2, officials said. The shooting spurred a scene of panic and confusion that played out on live television as scores of travelers burst out of the terminal and onto the tarmac, running and seeking cover, at times in response to erroneous rumors of   attacks. David Fogarty, a carpenter from Key West, was heading to Cancún, Mexico, on vacation when the people around him suddenly began running toward the gates. “Everybody was dropping gear, panicking, jumping over tables,” Mr. Fogarty said in a phone interview. “We were saying: ‘What is going on? Are there people shooting?’ I am not hearing any gunshots, and the whole place is panicking. ” Officers took Mr. Santiago into custody without firing a shot, and on Friday evening, he was being interviewed by F. B. I. agents and county investigators, as the wounded were being treated at hospitals. The senior law enforcement official said Mr. Santiago was making “disjointed” statements in his Anchorage F. B. I. visit. “Although Santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, interviewing agents contacted local authorities,” who took him to a medical facility for evaluation, the official said. “The F. B. I. closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks, and interviews of his family members,” the official said. On Twitter,   Donald J. Trump said that he was “monitoring the terrible situation in Florida” and that he had spoken to Gov. Rick Scott. Hours after the attack, a picture began to emerge of Mr. Santiago as a man who had served his country, but who had experienced trouble and failure. Mr. Santiago was discharged in August from the Alaska Army National Guard for “unsatisfactory performance,” according to Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, the spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard. In September, Mr. Santiago became a father when his son was born, according to an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, a resident of Union City, N. J. who spoke on Friday to the newspaper The Record. In an email, Ms. Olmstead said that Mr. Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. In 2010, he deployed to Balad, Iraq, with the 130th Engineer Battalion, which spent a year clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges he was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. At least two soldiers from his company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is nothing in the record that indicates Mr. Santiago had been in combat. Ms. Olmstead said he served in the Army Reserves before joining the Alaska Army National Guard in November 2014. Before his discharge last year, he worked as a combat engineer as a private first class. An official service record released on Friday by the Army showed that Mr. Santiago had received a number of commendations, including the Army Good Conduct Medal. Mr. Santiago’s brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press that Esteban was born in New Jersey and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2. Nelson Cruz, a Puerto Rico senator who represents Peñuelas, the city in Puerto Rico where Mr. Santiago grew up, said he met Mr. Santiago about seven or eight years ago, and found him to be a “good young man” who loved his family. Mr. Cruz said he spoke on Friday with Bryan Santiago, who relayed that the family was shocked by the news of the killings. The family offered no known motive for the crime, but noted that Esteban had recently been hallucinating and was receiving psychological treatment. “Bryan said his brother went to Iraq or Afghanistan, one of those places, and came back with psychological problems,” Mr. Cruz said. “He would suddenly see visions, but that he was a calm young man and was never violent. ” Esteban Santiago liked sports (particularly boxing, as Bryan is a boxing trainer) and was proud of his military career. “We don’t know what happened with this guy,” Mr. Cruz said. “He was an intelligent, brilliant young man who came back affected. When he came back from the conflict, he did not return well. ” He added that the family wanted to express condolences, but was in a state of panic over the number of news reporters outside their house. At a news conference late Friday in Florida, officials warned that learning the gunman’s motive would be a long, complex process. “We have not ruled out terrorism, and we will pursue every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack,” said George Piro, the special agent in charge of the F. B. I. ’s Miami division. The shooting comes at a tense time for a nation that has been watching nervously as terrorist attacks have occurred elsewhere in the world, and as Mr. Trump, who has promised to bar Muslims from entering the country, prepares to ascend to the presidency. Officials said that he had flown on a flight from Alaska to Minneapolis, and then to Fort   International Airport. In a Facebook post, a Broward County commissioner, Chip LaMarca, said the assailant had been a passenger on a Canadian flight who had checked his weapon in his luggage and then, upon disembarking, went to the airport bathroom to load it. “Came out shooting people in baggage claim,” Mr. LaMarca wrote. On CNN, Mark Lea, a witness, said the gunman “just randomly shot people, no rhyme or reason. ” After the shootings, the gunman lay facedown, spread eagle and “waited for the deputies to come get him,” he said. At that point, the gunman showed no remorse, Mr. Lea said. “He didn’t say anything,” he said. “Nothing. No emotion, no nothing. About as   as you could get. ” Witnesses also recounted scenes of confusion and fear. “All of a sudden there was a stampede,” said Tara Webber, 41, of Allentown, Pa. who was heading home after a   cruise to the Bahamas and was waiting with relatives in Terminal 3 for her flight. Those who were not running, she said, “hit the floor. ” She and her father, Dan Trinkle, 63, dived under a set of plastic chairs. Ms. Webber said she almost landed on a little girl, who was crying, and tried to comfort her. “This was the scariest thing I’ve ever done in my life,” said Ms. Webber, who works for her father’s limousine company. “We’re going to get a car and drive all the way home. ” Her father said he went for the floor like everyone else. “Then the cops told us to leave all our stuff and get out,” he said. “Everything was thrown around all over the place. ” Mr. Trickle said the police and airport authorities seemed unsure of how to handle the situation. “As far as I’m concerned, they weren’t prepared for something like this,” he said. “We were all out on the runway for hours. It made no sense. ” He said he and his family were allowed to leave after three hours and go to a hospital only because his girlfriend, Barbara Keinert, 57, had left her insulin on the cruise ship and needed another dose. The suspect’s name was made public by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, soon after the shooting. Mr. Nelson said he had learned the name from the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, Peter V. Neffenger. Mr. Nelson said Mr. Neffenger had also told him the suspect was in possession of an American military identification. Barbara Sharief, the mayor of Broward County, said authorities were confident that the gunman had acted alone. “Based on the preliminary reviewing of the footage tapes, he is a lone shooter,” Ms. Sharief said. “He is alive, he was not harmed, not shot. ” Airport police officers chased the gunman through the terminal as he continued to fire before apprehending him unharmed near a departure gate and arresting him. The scene that unspooled after shots rang out was intensely chaotic. Live TV showed government vehicles blocking the roads to and from the airport and scores of travelers milling on the tarmac, apparently having been evacuated from the building. Some could be seen marching en masse across the pavement, wheeling bags behind them. Moments later, the passengers would burst into movement, like frightened birds, running one way or another, apparently in reaction to concerns, which authorities later said were unfounded, that more attacks were underway. A number of witnesses called in to television news programs almost immediately after it happened. John Schlicher, a traveler who spoke in a phone interview with MSNBC, said he had been traveling with his wife and    and they were retrieving their bags from a carousel when he heard the first shot. “I wasn’t sure what it was at first, but I saw the person right to my side fall to the ground, and I turned and looked and the shooter was in the center hallway,” he told MSNBC. Mr. Schlicher did not hear the gunman speak, and described him as slender, with dark hair, and possibly wearing a blue “Star Wars”   . Mr. Schlicher said he and everyone around him dropped to the ground. “I put my head down and prayed,” he said. The shooting came as Florida lawmakers were preparing to consider legislation that would relax prohibitions on firearms. State laws allow for the purchase of rifles, handguns and shotguns without a permit, though a license is required to carry a concealed weapon in the state. The legislation, which was proposed last month, would eliminate some “  zones” in Florida  —   which currently include airport terminals, schools and government meetings. The bill was introduced by State Senator Greg Steube, a Republican and longtime opponent of   zones. As the false alarms subsided at the airport, the scene remained tense. Workers and passengers leaving the airport were searched by law enforcement personnel. Passengers who had been on planes on the tarmac were forced to stay in their seats, where they received updates from captains and crew members. Television news stations showed video of medics taking care of a bleeding victim outside the airport. News helicopters showed hundreds of people standing on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. With the airport shut down, the Federal Aviation Administration said that flights headed to Fort Lauderdale had been delayed or diverted to other airports. A number of travelers described harrowing moments of panic. Melody Dorward and a colleague, Amberly Buccholz, had just stepped off a Spirit Airways flight from Ohio when they got caught up in the tide of people who ran down the terminal. They joined in and were directed out to the tarmac, clustered there with others, shifting from spot to spot. Rumors of more gunfire spread through the crowd, with many convinced they had heard shots. “I called my family to say goodbye,” said Ms. Dorward, 22, an   worker, “to tell them I love them. ”"

If timing is everything in comedy, then Al Gore must surely be the greatest comic genius since Groucho Marx. Not only are Gore’s climate prediction pratfalls legendarily comical; the King of Environmentalist Slapstick has timed his latest taxpayer-funded, carbon-spewing international junket to Australia right on the heels of the election where voters overwhelmingly rejected his honking brand of climate change hysteria.



Even more hilariously, Gore parked his climate clownshoes right in the very state that just voted overwhelmingly in favour of coal mining.



According to the blurb, “Climate Week QLD 2019 will showcase how the state is transitioning to a low-carbon, clean-growth economy and building a community of action to address climate change.”



It would have been fun to be a fly on the wall when the planning for this gala week occurred. The expectation would have been that Labor would win the federal election, with the clear message that the public was demanding “real action on climate change” — so the motto goes. Reference would have been made to Bill Shorten’s plans to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and for 50 per cent of electricity to be generated by renewable energy sources.



Gore proved his comedy skill by posing for huggy photos with beleaguered Queensland deputy premier and treasurer Jackie Trad, whose career is hanging on the slenderest of threads. Not content with presiding over a tanking job market (barely kept alive by a ballooning public sector), Trad has been a vocal opponent of the Adani coal mine. It’s widely suspected that premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is eying Trad as a sacrificial lamb.



No doubt ol’ Al could tell her all about being the bridesmaid and never the bride. Which is probably the only useful advice he’d give.



For the life of me, I can’t understand why anyone would give Gore the time of day. After all, he is not a trained scientist; he appears to make a living from concocting scary climate stories.



While he was in Queensland, he was offering up some more whoppers. Maybe he thought the appearance fee he received — estimated to be $320,000, paid for by Queensland taxpayers — necessitated the delivery of some sensational unsubstantiated claims.



To tell an audience that the choice is between Adani and the Great Barrier Reef is puerile and misinformed. To suggest that India is now sourcing 60 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources is just plain wrong — out by a factor of four to five. And these statements come on top of the many falsehoods Gore has peddled in the past.



Gore is also big on renewable energy money farms – well, anything that promises an endless siphon of taxpayer’s money. But the re-election of the Morrison government and especially energy minister Angus Taylor (despite a vicious campaign by GetUp) may well put the kybosh on that little money-spinner, too.



The renewable energy players will be forced to stand on their own two feet — for a change — and will need to adjust to the new reliability standards that come into play on July 1. Penalties are being imposed on far-flung installations and contributions are expected to fund the additional grid infrastructure required to hook up new wind and solar farms.



The salad days are over for the renewable energy industry, a situation ironically made worse in Queensland by the (temporarily stalled) requirement to use lic­ensed electricians for the instal­lations of large-scale solar farms.



  
Time for Al to park his clown shoes – the only ones big enough to fit his gargantuan carbon footprint – back in his Nashville mansion. After all, he’s probably left all the lights on, just like he does every Earth Hour.

"[An excerpt from the newsletter: http://carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/farmer-fred.pdf (PDF, 269KB)]
Yesterday morning, before the frost had left the grass, I was sitting quietly beside my fashionably-green wood-burning heater reading the latest explanation in “The Green Gospel” on why the Arctic ice had not yet melted.
Suddenly Flora burst into the room like an Arctic Blizzard with a look on her face that said I was in big trouble.
“Did you tell that awful Professor Percival he could cut holes in Maria’s belly and leave her with a bum bag and a rubber sausage strapped to her back?”
Can’t believe this is happening? See the sheep torture paddock:
http://www.scienceimage.csiro.au/tag/sheep/i/1898/testing-sheep-for-methane-production/10
And see here where a whole team of apprentice professors are also torturing cows:
http://www.smh.com.au/victoria/diet-change-cuts-methane-emissions-in-cow-burps-20150804-girf6l.html
“It’s all right dear” I explained patiently, “The Prof has a new job researching how to stop sheep from adding carbon compounds to the atmosphere.” (Which means, translated crudely – “how to stop sheep from burping and farting”.) 
“Well tell him to torture that awful Dorper ram that butts me, not my darling Maria. Where are those animal cruelty people when I need them”?
The Prof had coached me on the settled-science story which I now relayed confidently to Flora: “Sheep and cows release lots of carbon-rich gases from both ends. The science says this will affect the atmosphere, heat up the globe, melt the ice caps and we will all drown.” 
“He is being paid big bucks to postpone that watery judgement day.”

Fred McNally, my crusty old neighbour on the other side, was not impressed with the Prof’s reasoning. 
“Surely even a dopey hobby farmer like Percival understands the carbon cycle? Every sheep has two inlet pipes – one for food and water, one for air. And it has three exhaust pipes for wastes – liquid, solids and gases. Sheep cannot manufacture carbon. Every atom of carbon coming out of a sheep’s exhaust pipes must have come in via that sheep’s feed pipes. And every atom of carbon in the sheep feed must come from the grass which gets it from… the atmosphere.” 

Cartoon credit: http://stevehunterillustrations.com.au/political-cartoons/
“Sheep live on recycled burps, belches and farts. Along the way, lots of carbon is tied up in woolly jumpers and in the bodies of sheep, lambs, dingos and hungry humans.”
“Why pick on a non-problem like sheep? Wild dogs have already eaten half of Australia’s flock – we need a predator among the plague of clueless Professors.”
“Can’t the silly old fart see that all sheep are green?”
In the sanctimonious cant of those who preach the green religion, sheep (and cattle) should be hailed as “carbon neutral”.

China’s burgeoning coal power industry
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Renewable advocates are concerned some fossil fuel projects are receiving a share of China’s “new energy” subsidies.
Why China’s Renewable Energy Transition Is Losing MomentumBY MICHAEL STANDAERT • SEPTEMBER 26, 2019Growth of wind and solar in China is slowing as government funding for green energy falters and upgrades to the transmission infrastructure lag. With China’s CO2 emissions again on the rise, experts worry the world’s largest emitter may fall short of key climate goals.…After plateauing from 2014 to 2016, China’s carbon dioxide emissions have risen in the last several years, with an estimated 4 percent increase in the first half of 2019. While coal consumption and production peaked in 2013, both have increased again since 2017 and are slowly creeping back to 2013 levels. Reliance on gas from fracking in the Sichuan basin, as well as coal-bed methane extraction and increased imports of natural gas (China is the second-largest natural gas importer in the world), are on the rise. Since China counts unconventional gases like shale gas and coal-bed methane as “new energy,” they are eligible for subsidies from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology [MIIT]. Roughly $830 million — more than 80 percent of an MIIT new energy fund — went to subsidizing such projects in 2018, according to a recent report by the state-run China Energy News.While continuing to fund unconventional gas, China has now largely stopped providing national-level subsidies to wind and solar projects and is implementing reforms to its feed-in-tariff system, moving to replace it with auctions in which wind and solar power must compete directly with fossil fuels.…This process has started to slow the overall added capacity for wind and solar. While new solar photovoltaic installations hit an all-time high of 53 gigawatts [GW] in 2017, they slipped to around 41 GW last year and current figures put solar installations at slightly more than 11 GW for the first half of 2019. Projections are for about 25 GW of solar power to be installed this year and in succeeding years through 2025, an amount that would not sharply curtail fossil fuel use. Another problem is that renewable energy projects are facing land-use restrictions that protect agricultural, industrial, and urban land in provinces like Guangdong in South China, the country’s economic powerhouse, says Jonathan Luan Dong, a renewables analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. While several non-subsidized renewable energy projects had been scheduled to start in Guangdong in 2019, few actually seem to be moving forward. When I attempted to visit renewable energy projects that were said to be in the works, government offices and companies in the Guangdong cities of Jiangmen, Meizhou, and Zhanjiang declined my requests because the projects hadn’t started.…Read more: https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-chinas-renewable-energy-transition-is-losing-momentum
I don’t understand why selling power on the open market, competing directly with coal, is such a problem. Green advocates including the Australian CSIRO repeatedly assure us that renewable energy is cheaper than coal, even without government subsidies and assistance.

" https://www.valeursactuelles.com/politique/catastrophisme-climatique-y-t-il-un-adulte-lonu-113269by Benoit Rittaud © 2019– translated from the French originalWe know the climate circus season is coming when terrifying reports about the future of the planet spring up like mushrooms. The 25th “Conference of the Parties” COP25, which will take place in Madrid in early December, offers a new opportunity to confirm this observation.The mushroom of the day has been written by the United Nations Environment Program. In the 2019 edition of their “Emission Gap” report, they look at the difference between actual emissions of satanic gases (CO2 and a few others) and emissions that were expected at some preceding circus, also comparing with the so-called virtuous trajectory that we should follow to “stay under the +2 °C limit”.This new report has a great merit: it provides a conclusive proof that energy transitions, carbon taxes, emission quotas and other fashionable constraints have no effect whatsoever, since global emissions are still on the rise. They increased by 1.5% per year on average over the last decade and show no sign of a downturn.Laurent Fabius’ cocardier triumphalism in the end of the glorious COP21 in 2015 in Paris, where humanity was to meet the path of redemption, is over.There is no getting away from these facts. We can feel ashamed, organize whingeing protests, give up our cars, convert to veganism, but nothing will do: developing countries want to have the same standard of living as ours. Go figure. That’s why they increase their energy consumption (especially China) and, therefore, their CO2 emissions. The pace is so fast that nothing will reverse the trend in the medium run, even if you keep up your good resolution to turn off the tap while brushing your teeth.In a world ruled by grownups, such crystal-clear facts would easily lead to a logical conclusion: since, despite all UN processions, we are not in a position to reduce global emissions, we must address the question differently.Obviously, the best would be to acknowledge that the climate we experience at now is not worse than the climate of past centuries; that the global warming is of a rather weak order of magnitude and provides at least as many advantages as disadvantages; that nothing indicates that the extreme events are more powerful or more numerous than those of the past (unlike the smartphones we have, that allow us to spread in real time more and more videos of these events on social networks); or that carbon dioxide is the primary food of plants and, as such, is a blessing for the biosphere. (According to NASA’s satellites, CO2 was the main driver of the 18 million square kilometers greening of the planet observed over the past 35 years.)Without going as far as to accept these obvious but politically incorrect facts, a sensible people could nevertheless consider that if we can’t act on a cause, then we must act on what might be the consequences. In short: opening the umbrella instead of dancing to stop the rain.Of course, this is not what is proposed in the 2019 report on emissions gap, by far. As if nothing had happened, this report echoes the most unrealistic recommendations to reverse the trend. In its carbo-centered fantasies, the rise in emissions suddenly stops next year, before the world commits to a resolute decline. The scenario is more or less equivalent to the idea that a car running at full speed on the highway can, “if its driver is trying hard,” take a right-angle turn without too much damage.We may wonder if the authors really believe what they say or if, in fact, the report has been written by an unconscious robot, unaware of the aberrations made up by its limited vision resulting of some narrow-minded algorithms implemented in it which force it to carry out its absurd and useless task.Anyway, no doubt that many right-thinking voices will use this report as an argument to ask for more self-flagellation to avoid punishment imposed by the climate bogeyman. May the few grownups who will pass by there try to reassure these voices of this small world. By the way, considering the huge costs of the measures they suggest, it is high time to think about blowing the whistle to end the game.Benoit Rittaud’s blog: https://mythesmanciesetmathematiques.wordpress.com/2019/11/27/climat-y-a-t-il-un-adulte-a-lonu/ Association des Climatos-Réalistes https://www.climato-realistes.fr/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and was a public servant for 27 years, a diplomat for 10 years prior to that service.The United States Democratic Party leadership appears to be enamored with the proposal for a “Green New Deal”, the idea of eliminating all fossil fuels from the US economy by 2030 and converting the economy into a fully socialized one. Several analysts have produced excellent reports explaining the implications of the energy part of the deal. I thought I might add a short comment that will make the issue more understandable for the average person. Over eighty per cent of U.S. energy use is now supplied by fossil fuels – oil, natural gas, and coal. Eliminating all these uses would mean eliminating oil use in transportation (i.e. cars, trucks, railways, aircraft and marine vessels, as well as off-road vehicles like tractors and construction equipment), power generation, and industrial, commercial and residential uses. It would shut down most petrochemicals production, including products ranging from plastics to roofing material. It would force the elimination of all coal, oil and natural gas-fired electricity generation and its replacement by renewable energy generation, meaning mostly wind and solar energy. Perhaps most important, it would mean electrifying the parts of the economy that now run on fossil fuels. That would more than quadruple current electricity demand. First QuestionsOne of the first questions people should consider is whether it is possible to convert all current electricity generation to wind and solar energy. Both of these sources are “intermittent”, meaning that they only produce when the conditions allow it – when the sun shines in the case of solar and when the wind blows in the case of wind turbines. Electricity is difficult and expensive to store; how much would it cost to store electricity so that it is available when the renewables are not generating? In November, 2018, Roger Andrews, a retired engineer, performed an analysis of this issue, examining the specific cases of Germany and California. His analysis can be read here: http://euanmearns.com/the-cost-of-wind-solar-power-batteries-included/ He deliberately used assumptions that would tend to bias the outcome of his analysis in favour of renewable energy. For example, he assumed that: Annual electricity demand in the two jurisdictions stays constant, and does not increase to allow for increased electrification of the economy;Transmission system upgrades are ignored (i.e. there are no costs to moving the electricity from where it is generated by often remote renewables plants to urban areas);The generators operate at a capacity factor of 25%; andThe cost of battery storage would be U.S. $200 per kilowatt hour, about half the current cost of utility-scale Li-ion batteries according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (a source always optimistic about the economics of renewables). The electricity demand patterns in Germany and California are quite different. In Germany, wind generation is highly erratic and peaks in the winter, while solar production is low but smooth. The result is periodic surpluses of generation over demand of up to 80,000 megawatts (MW) and deficits of up to 50,000 MW. The storage capacity requirement peaks in May at slightly over 25,000 gigawatt-hours. In California, both wind and solar generation peak in the summer. Although demand is only about half that of Germany, the result is that the storage requirement also approaches 25,000 gigawatt hours. CostsUsing his optimistic assumptions, Andrews calculated the combined wind plus solar levelized cost of energy (LCOE) to be U.S. $50 per megawatt hour. With storage and related capital costs included, the combined LCOE of a 100% wind and solar generation system was US $699 per megawatt hour for Germany and US $1,096 per megawatt hour for California. The total cost in each case was US $5 trillion. Within the United States, California represents about seven per cent of the total electricity demand, meaning that total U.S. demand is about 14 times larger. Germany’s electricity demand is 13.6 per cent of U.S. demand, so total U.S. demand is about seven times larger. That suggests that the costs of a 100% renewables electricity generation in the U.S. would be somewhere between US $35 trillion and US $70 trillion. If it were possible to transition to an all-renewable electricity generation system within eleven years, the cost would be somewhere between US $3.2 trillion and US $6.4 trillion per year. This does not include the costs of adding electricity services to meet the needs of electrifying the whole economy or the costs of adding generation to permit economic growth. By comparison, the total U.S. federal government budget for 2019 is US $4.4 trillion. ConclusionYou may judge for yourself how realistic or desirable this is. ~~~~Albertans will find similar ‘shocking’ information in this LinkedIn Post: “Wind’s Winter of Discontent” https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/winds-winter-discontent-curtis-sheptycki/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"Wake Up Australia: we are becoming Green and Defenceless.
As Australia’s industrial capacity declines, Australia is becoming green and defenceless. History holds lessons.
Back in Dec 1941, Japan suddenly attacked the huge US Naval base at Pearl Harbour. Three days later, two “invincible” British warships, “Repulse” and “Prince of Wales” were sunk by Japanese planes off Malaya. Soon Japanese armies were rampaging through Asia towards Australia. By Feb 1942, the “impregnable” British fortress of Singapore surrendered and Japanese bombs were falling on Darwin. By Sept 1942 the Japanese army had slashed their way down the Kokoda Track and could see the lights of Port Moresby. They were looking across Torres Strait to Australia. At that time, most of our trained soldiers were fighting Rommel in North Africa or in Japanese prison camps.
Suddenly Australia was on its own and needed to defend itself with what we had here.
Armies need soldiers, weapons, bullets, vehicles, fuel, food, alcohol (and cigarettes).
Soldiers volunteered and were conscripted. Australian conscripts formed part of the force that met the Japanese on the Kokoda Track.
Of course Australia had very few engineering tools when war broke out, especially key tools like lathes. F W Hercus Manufacturing started making a copy of the famous American Southbend lathe in the 1940’s. These machines were installed in factories around Australia and used to make small parts for the war effort. Most of the lathe operators were women.
Enfield Rifles, Bren Guns and Vickers Machine Guns were produced in large numbers at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow supported by feeder factories in the area. Britain lost so many weapons at Dunkirk that Australian factories were sending guns to them. We could not do that now.
Motor oil was produced in limited quantities from oil shale at Glen Davis, but petrol was in serious short supply, and had been rationed since 1940. With the fall of Singapore, this shortage became severe, and charcoal burners suddenly appeared to keep cars and trucks moving. Kerosene was scarce so carbide lights were widely used. The demand for charcoal was so great that firewood became scarce so it was also rationed.
To conserve supplies for soldiers, rationing was introduced for tea, clothing, butter, sugar, meat and cigarettes. Hotels were only allowed to serve alcohol twice a day for one hour at a time of their choosing.
An immediate critical shortage was copper for cartridge cases and communications – Australia had mines producing lead, zinc, silver, gold and iron, but there was a critical shortage of copper. Fortuitously, just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, an exploration drill hole at Mount Isa had struck rich copper ore.
Mount Isa was called on to avert a calamitous shortage of copper in Australia. With government encouragement, Mount Isa Mines made the brave decision to suspend the profitable silver/lead/zinc operations and convert all mining and treatment facilities to extracting copper.
The lead concentrator could be converted to treat copper ore, but the biggest problem was how to smelt the copper concentrates. Luckily the company had skilled engineers and metallurgists in the lead smelter. In a miracle of improvisation, scrap steel and spare parts were purchased and scavenged from old mines and smelters from Cloncurry, Mt Elliott, Mt Cuthbert and Kuridala and cobbled into a workable copper smelter. In 1943 the first Mount Isa blister copper was produced. Production continued after the war when Mount Isa returned to extracting the then more profitable silver/lead/zinc. Later new plant was built enabling both lead and copper metal to be produced from this fabulous mine.
This story of the importance of self-reliance has lessons for today.

The war on carbon energy, the carbon tax, the renewable energy targets, escalating electricity costs and the voices in Parliament calling for Emissions Trading Schemes have all unnerved our big users of carbon fuels and electricity. Smelting and refining have become threatened industries in Australia, and closure of the Mount Isa copper smelter and the Townsville copper refinery has been foreshadowed. Already six major metal smelting/refining operations have closed in Australia this century and more are likely. The closures have affected copper, lead, zinc, steel and aluminium – the sinews of modern industry. And the car industry, with all its skills and tools, is closing. Like many of Australia’s engineering shops, F W Hercus ceased production of lathes in 2001.
More and more land and offshore waters are totally closed to exploration and mining. Offshore exploration for oil is very limited, except in the north-west. On land, there is no exploration in green no-go areas and the “lock-the-gate” rent-a-crowd are trying to prevent gas explorers from drilling even on their own exploration tenements. Local production and refining of oil is also declining, and it was estimated recently that by next year, half of Australia’s oil refining capacity will have closed. In the event of a disruption to tanker routes, Australia has just 12 days of diesel supplies before city fuel and food supplies start to dry up. Will we see charcoal burners on cars and trucks once again?
Heavy industry is scorned, and is migrating to Asia. We are losing the resources, skills and machinery needed for our own security, while we fritter away precious resources on green energy, direct action, carbon capture and storage and other pointless anti-carbon chimeras.
Our foolish green energy policies and the suicidal war on carbon fuels are killing real industry leaving us unskilled and defenceless – like a fat toothless walrus basking on a sunny beach.
Wake up Australia.

"Perhaps the documentary “Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds” would seem less poignant and compelling had its subjects not just died, or had they not died, stunningly, within a day of each other. But the movie’s plucky intimacy shines through that fog. It’s a portrait, not a tribute  —   though as the documentary reminds us, every portrait is in some way a tribute to something. The film, directed by the actor Fisher Stevens and Alexis Bloom, debuts on HBO Saturday night after the cable network moved up its premiere from March. That decision is hard to begrudge. As this movie makes evident, these two were no strangers to making headlines. Ms. Reynolds was well known to one generation for, in part, the tabloid bonanza surrounding her when her husband Eddie Fisher skipped out with her best friend, Elizabeth Taylor. Several other generations have grown up surrounded by all things Princess Leia, memorably played by Ms. Fisher in the “Star Wars” films. “Bright Lights” finds mother and daughter living in separate houses in what they call “the compound. ” Ms. Fisher takes a soufflé out of her oven and carries it on a tray down the path to her mother’s house. “I usually come to her,” Ms. Fisher says. She pauses. “I always come to her. ” Who wouldn’t? She’s Debbie Reynolds, movie star and cabaret performer. Ms. Reynolds rose to fame with cheery, wholesome roles, and even in her 80s could turn on that pert sunniness in a split second, so smoothly you’d never know it was an act  —   except that this is a documentary, and it includes the footage of just before this light clicks on. “It’s not my best day,” she sighs, sounding weary and a little   as she and Mr. Stevens discuss where exactly the camera will be. And then  —   bing!  —   there she is, as perky as a kindergarten teacher. Because the gently quirky celebrity documentary is an enjoyable if standardized format, the potency of “Bright Lights” sneaks up on you. If it were just about its subjects’ huge, starry lives, that really would be enough for a documentary. But it also smartly, and subtly, pushes its audience to ask two of modern pop society’s central, uncomfortable questions: First, are famous people “real” people? And second, am I becoming my mother? By the time Mr. Stevens and Ms. Bloom start filming, this almost cosmic   between mother and daughter seems to have resolved itself to a wry but balanced mutual orbit. Though both women seem a little reluctant to admit it, the similarities between them abound. Ms. Fisher’s house is decorated eclectically, with memorabilia and silly knickknacks everywhere. Ms. Reynolds’s collection is far more orderly: She was among Hollywood’s great archivists and had hoped to open a museum, but instead is resigned to auctioning off many of her pieces, including Marilyn Monroe’s famous   dress from “The Seven Year Itch” and a pair of Judy Garland’s   shoes from “The Wizard of Oz. ” “I like my ghosts,” she tells her daughter. Ms. Fisher is brainy and salty and hilarious, and she’s frank and eloquent in describing being bipolar. We see both archival and    footage of Ms. Fisher in manic phases, and she’s articulate, artful even, about her  . “One mood is the meal the next mood is the check,” she says. But she too knows how to flip the switch. She refers to her appearances at fan conventions as “the lap dance,” but engages with her fans nonetheless. A woman cries. Little girls in their Princess Leia costumes beam. Their heroine gamely poses for photo after photo, signing every manner of memorabilia. It’s not so different, really, from her mother’s cabaret act. That nightclub act comes up several times in “Bright Lights,” including footage of a    Carrie being summoned to the stage to sing “Bridge Over Troubled Water. ” Her bold alto voice and sassy   almost, but don’t quite, belie that she’s a barely cooperative teenager desperate to rebel. Ms. Fisher says she rejected singing more or less to spite her mother. Six or so years after that nightclub performance, she married Paul Simon. You know. The guy who wrote “Bridge Over Troubled Water. ” It’s all so Hollywood, so poetic, so dramatic. Despite their extraordinary circumstances, much of the family banter among Ms. Reynolds her son, Todd Fisher and Ms. Fisher seems like ordinary talk. Adult siblings agonize over an aging parent’s finances and  . Mother and daughter have the same shoes. Brother and sister exchange knowing “well, that’s Mom” shrugs. There’s no people like show people, but Hollywood families are, somehow, still just families."
"**Investment bank Citigroup has suspended a senior trader allegedly accused of stealing food from the staff canteen, media reports say.**
The trader, Paras Shah, is reported to have been earning more than Â£1m a year including bonuses.
He was removed from his post as head of high-yield bond trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa last month, the Financial Times reported.
Citigroup has refused to make any comment on the allegations.
According to reports, Mr Shah, aged 31, was suspended following allegations that he helped himself to sandwiches from the canteen at the bank's London headquarters in Canary Wharf.
It is not clear how many times this happened or over what period of time the alleged behaviour occurred.
The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Shah on LinkedIn, but his profile was unavailable and appears to have been deleted.
Mr Shah is not the first leading City figure to have faced serious consequences because of alleged or proven petty dishonesty.
In 2014, BlackRock director Jonathan Paul Burrows was banned from working in the financial services industry after he was caught regularly avoiding buying a train ticket on his commute to London.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said he should have been a role model for others and his conduct had ""fallen short of the standard expected for someone in his position"".
Mr Shah's departure came weeks before the bank was due to pay annual bonuses to senior employees.
He joined Citigroup in 2017 after spending seven years at HSBC.
His job involved trading in junk bonds, which are issued by companies with low credit ratings or short track records as a means of raising cash.
Because there is a risk that the company that issued them will default and render them worthless, they have to offer a higher return on investment, which is why they are also known as high-yield bonds."

By Kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
We keep hearing again and again how climate change is one of the main causes of migration. But when you ask those affected whether the climate in their home country was the cause of flight, they usually look at you in awe and shake their heads violently: “There’s war, and you can no longer live there” is the recurring answer. “And the war is NOT caused by climate”.
In the propaganda battle, every means is justified. In 2018 the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) proudly reported that its employee Jacob Schewe was co-author of this World Bank report. After reading the opening thesis “Climate change has become one of the main drivers of emigration…,” the matter was settled.

Or was it really? Two recent papers show that this is not the case at all.
On November 26, 2019, a paper by Ingrid Boas from Wageningen University (Netherlands) and her colleagues appeared in “Nature Climate Change”. It clarifies that all such “myths” have been spread without any science so far. In the article, they call for the facts to be dealt with scientifically, and make it clear at the end:
Instead of having policy dictate the priorities of science, resulting in self-perpetuating false claims about climate-induced migration, the science policy process needs to allow careful and critical evidence-seeking research to indicate the main challenges ahead.”
Also another paper dismissing climate change causes mass migration has been published – by Nature. Abstract by Boas et al. in 2019 nature climate change:
Climate migration myths
Misleading claims about mass migration induced by climate change continue to surface in both academia and policy. This requires a new research agenda on ‘climate mobilities’ that moves beyond simplistic assumptions and more accurately advances knowledge of the nexus between human mobility and climate change.”

Introduction
The EurObserv’ER organisation publishes data annually on all types of EU28 Renewable installations and their productivity.  EurObser’ER is backed by the EU and promotes the transition to Renewables.  Their report for Solar power in 2019 here is a typical example of their annual data output for each technology.
Photovoltaic barometer 2019
This post uses the EurObserv’ER data series since 2008 as they relate to about 80% of European Renewable generation installations, those being:

Wind power Onshore
Wind Power Offshore
On grid Solar PV power.

From the peak installation rate in 2010 the European commitment to Weather Dependent Renewables had reduced by more than half in 2018.
The performance of the five EU countries with the most significant commitments to Renewables
The following countries are the main Renewables protagonists in Europe.  Together these countries represent more than 75% of European Renewable installations, with by far the largest commitment has been made by Germany as a result of its longstanding “Energiewende” policy.  In 2018 the proportions of the EU28 Renewables were as follows:

Germany  35.9%
Spain  9.7%
Italy  10.5%
The United Kingdom  12.2%
France  8.5%.

The average capacity figures, for the period 2008 – 2018, achieved by these five countries is shown below:

The following graphic shows the progressive percentage changes in Renewables installations and the average overall capacity factor that each country has achieved.

They show how Germany has maintained its major commitment to Renewables and how Italy and Spain have allowed their Renewable commitment to stagnate since 2011, whereas in the United Kingdom and France the growth of Renewable installations has continued.
Italy has shown poor capacity performance mainly because it has committed to a large proportion of Solar power, whereas Spain has maintained relatively good performance by ignoring Solar power and relying much more on Onshore wind.
Germany has a continuing poor performance because of it insistence on Solar power in its cloudy northerly context.
The UK has had a reasonable performance but that has recently fallen off in spite of the use of Offshore wind power, because performance is always diminished by the large proportion of ineffective solar power in the UK.
A comparative assessment of the excess capital and long-term costs incurred to support Weather Dependent Renewables is provided at:
https://edmhdotme.wordpress.com/eu28-weather-dependent-renewables-in-2017-and-indicative-costs/
The overall comparative costs results for the EU28 are shown below:

The following graphics for these five principal European countries show the progress each has made in Renewables installation since 2008 and the way in which the commitment to Weather Dependent Renewables has actually diminished over the past 10 years.
Germany
Overall new German Renewables installations are now running at about half of their peak level in 2011.  The total installation is now rated at ~104GW with a combined output of ~17.3GW, with an overall capacity factor of ~20%:  this nominally represents ~20% of German electricity generation.
Onshore wind installations have been in use in Germany for several decades and now represent ~50% of German Renewables:  their installation rate peaked in 2016 and has since fallen by half to ~2.3GW per annum.  The capacity factor for Onshore wind in Germany is comparatively low at ~18%.  It seems that there is now substantial and growing local resistance to the future development of Onshore wind farms.
Solar installations in Germany and represent ~41% of German Renewables even though Germany is one of the cloudiest countries in Europe, resulting in a Solar capacity figure of less than ~10%.  Their Solar installations peaked quite early in 2011, and had fallen to a quarter of that peak by 2014.  But they have seen a recent minor resurgence, overtaking Onshore wind in installations in 2018.
Offshore Wind power installations started more recently in 2014 and are now continuing at about half of their original peak rate:  they now represent about 6% of installed German Renewables.  Offshore Wind performance with an average capacity factor of ~27% and reaching ~34% in 2018 is certainly more productive than Onshore wind:  however Offshore wind is still inherently variable, as with all wind generation, its is entirely dependent on weather conditions and in addition has to contend with the adverse marine environment, which increases costs significantly and reduces service life.

Spain
The Spanish were very early to commit to Renewables mainly with Onshore wind, however by 2013 all further installations had virtually ceased.  The commitment of massive subsidies for Weather Dependent Renewables in Spain contributed to the parlous state of the Spanish economy.
In spite of being a southerly nation the use of Solar power in Spain has been minimal and is in fact now not even being replaced as it ages, this is mainly because subsidy support is being withdrawn.  This is in spite of the fact that Solar power in Spain apparently has the highest capacity factor in Europe at ~19%.
Overall Spain at a capacity factor of ~23% has the most productive Renewables industry in Europe.

Italy
Onshore wind power in Italy’s about 1/3 of the Italian Renewables commitment and it generates slightly less than half of Italy’s Weather Dependent Renewable output.  Installations of Onshore wind are continuing, albeit slowly.
As opposed to Spain, Italy another country with good Southerly exposure, made large scale early commitments to on-grid Solar power particularly in 2011 – 2013.  But since then Solar installations have reduced to about 1/10th of their peak level.
The total Renewables installation now amounts to about 28GW producing ~4.6GW, this nominally represents ~14% of Italian electricity generation.
Overall the capacity factor at ~15% achieved by Italian Weather Dependent Renewables is low, primarily because of the large commitment to Solar energy as opposed to Wind power.

United Kingdom
In 2008 the United Kingdom passed the Climate Change Act, making its far reaching commitments to Renewable energy into law.  As a result, by 2018 the UK had ~35GW of installed Weather Dependent Renewables amounting to ~12% of the EU fleet, second only to Germany.  The UK installations produced ~6.7GW with an overall capacity factor of ~18.9%.  That level of generation nominally provides ~15% of United Kingdom demand.
The average performance of Onshore wind power in the UK was reasonable but it performed poorly in 2018 with ~16% capacity.  Nonetheless Onshore installations are continuing to grow.
The UK is a world leader in Offshore wind power with total installation of ~8GW, a larger fleet even than Germany.  UK Offshore wind achieved an average capacity of ~29% and performance was good in 2018 at ~36%.  But Offshore installations have halved in 2018 to about 1GW per annum.  Offshore wind faces significant obstacles of high costs of installation and maintenance and the adverse maritime environment limiting useful service life.
The UK had a massive flirtation with Solar power around 2013, this arose directly as a result of the influence as ministers in the Department of Energy and Climate Change by coalition Liberal Democrats, namely Chris Huhne and Ed Davey.  As The UK has a cloudy northerly climate, this results in the worst capacity factor in Europe averaging only ~8%, probably the lowest Solar performance factor globally.
The insistence on UK Solar was a political decision made against the strenuous opposition of the civil service experts in the Departments Energy and Climate Change. Even so this has resulted in Solar energy now amounting to 37% of the UK Weather Dependent Renewables.  In 2018 commitment to Solar was reducing but was still more than half the installation of new Renewables.
France 
At 4.44 tonnes / head in 2017, France had achieved the lowest CO2 emissions / head of any developed country:  this is as result of the long standing commitment in France to Nuclear power.  This level of CO2 emissions is close the global average level for the whole ~7.4 billion world population.  The provision of relatively cheap CO2 free energy in France is one of the country’s major industrial achievements.
https://edmhdotme.wordpress.com/global-man-made-co2-emissions-1965-2017-bp-data/
However recently, with the introduction of a growing commitment to Weather Dependent Renewables, the French CO2 emissions are now rising according to the 2017 figures released by BP.
French Nuclear generation produces significant excess power, (more than 7%),  which is profitably exported to neighbouring countries, particularly to the United Kingdom and Germany.
https://edmhdotme.wordpress.com/comparing-electricity-generation-in-three-european-nations-2017/
https://edmhdotme.wordpress.com/graphic-presentations-of-electrical-generation-performance-in-three-european-countries-2017/
Were CO2 emission a real concern, the current policy in France is irrational.  It is to reduce its ~75% commitment to Nuclear energy for electricity generation down to 50% to be replaced with Renewables.  This policy, like Germany’s intention to eliminate all its Nuclear power by 2025, must be a retrograde step with regard to CO2 emissions reduction when compared with an increasing reliance on fossil fuels needed to compensate for the intermittency and unreliability of Weather Dependent Renewables.
Nuclear power in France should have been regarded as one of the country’s most valuable industrial assets.
Some Conclusions

The European commitment to installation of Weather Dependent Renewables has reduced and looks set to continue to diminish as various countries progressively withdraw their subsidy support.
Renewables growth in Spain and Italy virtually ceased in 2013.
If CO2 emissions reduction was the objective, the decisions in Germany and France to reduce their commitments to Nuclear energy are emotional and entirely irrational.
It is questionable whether Weather Dependent Renewables are:

CO2 emissions neutral, in other words they require more CO2 emissions to be generated in their manufacture, installation, maintenance and demolition than they could ever save during their service life
their EROI, Energy Return on Energy Invested, is marginal and insufficient to justify their use to provide sufficient excess power for any developed or developing Nation.



The Catch-22 of Energy Storage

comparatively un-economic in their use of materials



Weather Dependent Renewables are universally more expensive than the conventional alternatives of Gas-firing or Nuclear power.  ~2-3 times for Nuclear power and in the UK worst case ~16+ times more expensive than Gas-firing.

The Countries such as the UK and Germany that make major commitments to Solar PV and Offshore Wind end up with the most expensive installations.  Those countries like Spain that commit most to Onshore Wind power have the most economic Renewable installations.  But a recent paper
https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/01/Capell-Aris-UK-Electricity-System-1.pdf
This paper shows that the UK policy change to promote Gas-firing over coal burning in the 1990s, the “Dash for Gas” was co-incidentally also an effective mechanism to reduce CO2 emissions and as well as being a very cost effective means of electricity generation. The continuation of that use of Gas-firing policy would have maintained lower CO2 emissions in the UK, even though still dependent on use of fossil fuels.
Weather Dependent Renewable Energy depends on capturing essentially dilute and very variable sources of power.  So at the same time Weather Dependent Renewables are comparatively:

capital cost expensive
maintenance expensive, especially Offshore
inevitably intermittent and thus unreliable.

The late Prof David Mackay, (former chef scientific advisor of the Department of Energy and Climate Change), in a final interview before his untimely death in 2016 said that the concept of powering a developed country such as the UK with Weather Dependent Renewable energy was:
“an appalling delusion”.
At the time he also said:
“There’s so much delusion, it’s so dangerous for humanity that people allow themselves to have such delusions, that they are willing to not think carefully about the numbers, and the reality of the laws of physics and the reality of engineering….humanity does need to pay attention to arithmetic and the laws of physics.”
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/03/idea-of-renewables-powering-uk-is-an-appalling-delusion-david-mackay
If the objectives of using Weather Dependent Renewables were not confused with possibly “saving the planet” from the output of the UK’s / Europe’s small amount of Man-made CO2 produced in the UK for electricity generation, their actual cost in-effectiveness and their inherent unreliability, Weather Dependent Renewables would have always been ruled them out of any engineering consideration as means of National scale electricity generation.
It is essential to ask the question what is the actual value of these government mandated excess costs to the improvement of the environment and for the potential of perhaps saving minuscule temperature increases a 100 years in the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA recent video published by the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation features experts warning that Europe’s current path to a renewable energy powered society is hurting the poor and that green energy proponents are suffering from delusion.

President-elect of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, a career bureaucrat has committed to making Europe “the world’s first climate-neutral continent”.
Delusion in Brussels
However, the lofty plans, supported by most of Europe’s ruling parties, show unmistakable signs of reality-detachment as worker unrest, discontent and tensions spread across France, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. Yet, rather than taking all the strife seriously, Brussels prefers to deny it and blindly charge ahead with its virtuous green energy obsessions.
The GWPF video wonders if the experiment and unrealistic ideas about renewable energies will end up being “unsustainable policymaking”.
Experts warn that the odds that it will are high, but the pompous eurocrats are too obstinate to acknowledge it.
Expanding energy poverty

Already energy poverty has grown to potentially explosive social dimensions, warns Dr. Mikko Paunio of Finland. In some places heat has become so expensive that people are cutting trees down to keep warm.
Energy expert Professor Fritz Vahrenholt warns how Germany is “nearing the poverty front in a social and economic disaster”.
Brussels convinced green means prosperity
But Europe remains in denial, insisting that green energies are the economic solution for Europe’s future, and refuses to admit that the high energy costs are severely burdening the economy. “Europe is showing the way towards a safe and prosperous low carbon future for our planet and economy,” a green energy propaganda video insists.
Citizens rejecting, protesting
But reality tells a different story. Many countries in Europe aren’t going to meet their 2020 targets, and green parties in a number of countries have slipped as citizens have begun standing up to the hardships brought on by carbon reductions. There’s growing rejection of green policies especially among the poor. But Europe refuses to believe it, and pledges to keep pressing ahead, even as protests on the streets intensify.
Doomed to crash
What is it going to take before Europe’s leaders leave lala-land and get back to reality? What wake-up call is it going to take to get the slef deluded eurocrats to see the economic hardship and energy insecurity their policies are inflicting?
Prof. Vahrenholt fears it’ll take a real shock: “I’m quite sure this will change. First we will see the negative consequences of the Energiewende [German transition to green energies]. Let there be one day or two days of blackout, and they will see what they have done.” He adds that deindustrialization also will not work: “It’s a matter of two or three years when this will crash.”

Guest essay by Larry Hamlin
Thanks to Dr. Roy Spencer for his excellent WUWT article exposing the plight of the economically poor Brazilian farmers as well as the gross mischaracterizations by climate alarmists of fires in the Amazon region.

Dr. Spencer’s article provides a 30+ year long time period graphic showing the area of deforestation of the Amazon region starting in year 1988 through 2019 as shown below from the source referenced in Dr. Spencer’s posting.

The L A Times article addressed in my prior posting at WUWT provided a graphic presented by the Times showing the Amazon region area of deforestation but misleadingly cherry picked to address just the last two years of data for 2018 and 2019 as shown below.

I criticized the Times politically contrived cherry picking as anti-science alarmist propaganda which is a completely valid assessment since the Times was clearly concealing the much larger areas of Amazon deforestation that had occurred in the past as the more complete long time period graphic clearly displays both in my original posting (shown below) as well as Dr. Spencer’s posting.

If the Times had made a comparison between 2019 data versus 2016 data for example the result would show lower deforestation in 2019 with year 2016 data being more than 10% above 2019 data through August with only July 2019 being somewhat higher than July 2016 and all other months of 2019 being lower than year 2016 further demonstrating the anti-science cherry picking alarmist scheme by the Times in trying to support its politically misleading presentation.

Recent data from NASA Earth Observatory Images using MODIS data has documented a decrease in global fire burned acreage since 2003 further undermining alarmist claims that man made CO2 emissions are increasing global fire impacts. The study notes:
“One of the most interesting things researchers have discovered since MODIS began collecting measurements, noted Randerson, is a decrease in the total number of square kilometers burned each year. Between 2003 and 2019, that number has dropped by roughly 25 percent.”
Additionally results from a new study utilizing NASA satellite data show that during a 35 year period global forests have increased growth by over 2.2 million square kilometers due to increasing CO2. The study notes the following results over the period 1982 through 2016:
“Over the entire span, the researchers found that new tree cover had offset tree cover loss by approximately 2.24 million square kilometers—which they note is approximately the size of Texas and Alaska combined.”
The claims by climate alarmist and their media manipulators that we must now “panic” regarding global fires including those in the Amazon region are driven by politics not science.
As Dr. Spencer astutely noted in his article:
“This is just one more example of the media controlling the narrative and selectively and hypocritically placing blame on a particular (and almost always right-leaning) political party.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermans, like lots of other people, often love to preach water but drink wine.
So often I’ve heard Germans claim it’s so important to cut back on CO2 emissions, install green energy production system and to live green in order to present climate change.
And even though tiny Germany cutting back on CO2 emissions is not going to make any difference to the climate, Germans will insist: “We have to be an example to the rest of the world.”
Yet, right after all the preaching and virtue signalling, you’ll often hear them boast about their holiday travels to exotic places or vacations on luxury cruise ships. Or even worse: ferry the kids 500 meters to school in the family SUV because it’s raining.
German new cars increasing in horsepower
And the same story is the same when it comes to purchasing new automobiles. Many Germans tell you that green, electric, low consumption cars are the way to go. Yet when it comes time to buy a new car, they’ll snap up a real fossil fuel guzzler.
This hypocritical behavior is once again confirmed by a recent article in Spiegel Online here, which reports that the trend to ever greater horsepower vehicles in Germany continues unabated.

Germans love SUVs
Spiegel reports: “According to a survey by the CAR Institute at the University of Duisburg-Essen, the 3.61 million newly registered cars last year had an average of 158 hp under the hood – five hp more than a year earlier and the tenth increase in a row.”
This development, Spiegel reports, “was driven by the trends towards heavy SUVs and powerful plug-in hybrid drives. Newly registered SUVs had an average of 172 hp” and they “accounted for around 33 percent of all new car registrations in 2019.”
For hybrid cars, Spiegel writes the “average power even reached 194 hp”.
No end in sight for German horsepower love affair
What’s even more surprising is that green-conscious Germans aren’t about to end their love affair with powerful cars any time soon. Auto trend expert Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, who headed the CAR Institute study, “does not believe the trend towards more and more performance is reversing”, Spiegel reports.
“Only once in the past 25 years has the number of horsepower of new cars declined,” Dudenhöffer told German daily “Welt”.

"**Hate eating certain vegetables? It could be down to your genes, say US scientists who have done some new research.**
Inheriting two copies of the unpleasant taste gene provides a ""ruin-your-day level of bitterness"" to foods like broccoli and sprouts, they say.
It could explain why some people find it difficult to include enough vegetables in their diet, they suggest.
The gene may also make beer, coffee and dark chocolate taste unpleasant.
In evolutionary terms, being sensitive to bitter taste may be beneficial - protecting humans from eating things that could be poisonous.
But Dr Jennifer Smith and colleagues from the University of Kentucky School of Medicine say it can also mean some people struggle to eat their recommended five-a-day of fresh fruit and veg.
Everyone inherits two copies of a taste gene called TAS2R38. It encodes for a protein in the taste receptors on the tongue which allows us to taste bitterness.
People who inherit two copies of a variant of the gene TAS2R38, called AVI, are not sensitive to bitter tastes from certain chemicals. Those with one copy of AVI and another called PAV perceive bitter tastes of these chemicals, but not to such an extreme degree as individuals with two copies of PAV, often called ""super-tasters"", who find the same foods exceptionally bitter.
The scientists studied 175 people and found those with two copies of the bitter taste PAV version of the gene ate only small amounts of leafy green vegetables, which are good for the heart.
Dr Smith told medics at a meeting of the American Heart Association: ""You have to consider how things taste if you really want your patient to follow nutrition guidelines.""
The researchers hope to explore whether using spices could help mask the bitter taste and make vegetables more appealing for people who are hard-wired to dislike certain varieties."
"Some of the most fascinating conversations about class anxiety aren’t happening on cable news networks these days but on a more unexpected place on television: shows like “Atlanta,” “ ” and “Insecure,” which have explored a profound, if largely ignored, economic issue  —   black downward mobility. On “” the Johnson family is led by Dre, a marketing executive, and Bow, a doctor. They have four children in private school and a house in an affluent, predominantly white neighborhood in Los Angeles. They took a vacation to Disney World estimated to cost more than $20, 000. But despite the family’s seeming stability, “ ” is largely about class tension. A central dilemma is Dre’s battle between his financial aspirations and racial authenticity, his    and his loyalty to his   roots. One of the best episodes this season, “Jack of All Trades,” opens with Dre (Anthony Anderson) and Bow (Tracee Ellis Ross) learning of their young twins’ career test results: Diane (Marsai Martin) might be in a “position of power in a political organization,” while Jack (Miles Brown) is likely to be “a member of a unionized group of skilled laborers. ” Despite Jack’s obvious excitement about, and talent for, the manual trades, his parents become obsessed with redirecting his career trajectory, worried that he will be pigeonholed, like Dre’s   father, Pops (Laurence Fishburne) in a   job for the rest of his life. As Pop’s presence reminds us, while Dre’s parents worked hard to provide him with an education, Dre did not inherit wealth, making his    status both new and fragile. This is a legitimate worry because more and more members of the   middle class are finding themselves in an economic downslide, with little hope that the next generation will earn more than the one before. In 2015, the Pew Research Center released a report detailing that the number of American households earning a   income had reached its lowest point in over 40 years. And the gap between the wealth of white and black families has widened to its highest level since 1989, according to a Pew report from 2014. Black male children raised in   households in the late 1970s and early ’80s have fallen out of the middle class at particularly higher rates than white male children after becoming adults, another Pew report found. On shows like Donald Glover’s “Atlanta” on FX and Issa Rae’s “Insecure” on HBO, both about a group of    professionally striving and financially struggling (and both, along with “” nominated for Golden Globes) the theme of black downward mobility is put into high relief. “Comedy in the black community is almost always about struggle,” said Mary Pattillo, author of “Black Picket Fences: Privilege and Peril Among the Black Middle Class. ” “And while exploring class differences is not new for black sitcoms, it is important that these themes are reproduced and restaged for each generation. The specifics might be different, but every generation returns to this theme because the precarity of the black middle class has not disappeared. ” On “Atlanta,” we meet Earn, a Princeton dropout who grew up in a   family and who works at an airport kiosk. He quits that job to manage his cousin, an    rapper named Alfred Miles, known as Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) who has a song on the radio but makes a living as a drug dealer. Earn’s economic instability is exacerbated when his    girlfriend and his daughter’s mother, Van (Zazie Beetz) loses her job as an elementary schoolteacher because it was the only constant source of income for the family. “‘Atlanta’ offers up a realistic portrait of the vulnerability that the black middle class faces today,” said Jessica S. Welburn, a sociologist at the University of Iowa who researches   downward mobility. “While the election of the first   president gives many a sense of progress, racial disparities have also intensified and limited what has typically been a pathway to the middle class for   like a college degree or a government job. Knowing this,   still try to break through these barriers with obviously mixed results. ” “The Jacket,” the season finale of “Atlanta,” offers up one of the most pointed critiques of structural racism that I have seen on television this year: Neither Earn’s   childhood nor his Princeton education can protect him from the constraints that he and his friends find themselves under. After Earn wakes up in a strange house in a strange bed without his jacket, we follow him on an increasingly desperate search in increasingly dangerous situations. He finally arrives outside the home of the Uber driver who has his jacket, only to witness him being shot by the police. As extraordinary as that trauma might be for most Americans, the show portrays the sort of everyday violence to which   and Latinos, of various classes, are vulnerable. If race is intimately tied to class, so is gender, as Ms. Rae’s “Insecure” so poignantly reminds us. The main conflict on the series is its female protagonists, Issa and her best friend, Molly (Yvonne Orji) navigating the muddy waters of millennial dating. We first meet Issa, who works at a nonprofit, and her     boyfriend, Lawrence (Jay Ellis) on shaky ground. Despite his Georgetown degree, Lawrence is an entrepreneur unable to finalize his business plan or find a corporate job. He settles on working at Best Buy, and later, with encouragement from Issa, sets aside his dream of developing an app to take a gig at a tech  . And while the season concludes with a   breakup, their relationship was perhaps doomed from the beginning, by his inertia, his unemployment and their economic insecurity. Through Molly, a lawyer who brilliantly   between corporate and colloquial vernacular, the show explores how class mobility often differs for   women and men. After a string of disappointing romantic encounters, Molly ends up dating Jared (Langston Kerman) a witty, caring guy whom Issa jokingly calls “  ” because he works at Enterprise. Molly ends their relationship (the first of two times) after she and her friends find out he did not attend college. Averil Y. Clarke, author of “Inequalities of Love:   Black Women and the Barriers to Romance and Family,” said: “  black women are plagued by a very common racial problem. They, like most women, are encouraged to pursue the   script: Go to college, get a good job and get married and have kids. ” She added, “But, when it comes to dating, black women’s class aspirations are more likely to be unfulfilled than white women, their femininity and sense of value more likely to feel under assault. ” Historically, whether it was the striving of “The Jeffersons” or “The Fresh Prince of  ” or the   settings of shows like “Sanford and Son,” “Roc” or “Thea,” class differences have dominated black sitcoms in the    era. That these three recent shows are all created by   (Kenya Barris created “ ”) might enable them to attend differently to these nuances of   lives. Ms. Rae said in an interview with Vox, “This isn’t a show exclusively about, like, the struggle of being black. ” Instead, “It’s just regular black people living life. ” By setting her show in South Los Angeles, she is able to reveal the spectrum of   class diversity, as she noted in an interview with The Daily Beast: “Yes, there’s poverty there, there are gang members there, but there’s also affluence, there’s middle class, and everybody meshes together. ” Likewise, Mr. Glover said in an interview with Vulture, “I wanted to show white people, you don’t know everything about black culture. ” In that same interview, he underscores that one key difference is how he depicts class diversity. When Mr. Glover heard a suggestion that Paper Boi live in a   “traplike” home, he refused. “We were like: ‘No, he’s a drug dealer, he makes enough money to live in a regular apartment. ’” He added, “There were some things so subtle and black that people had no idea what we were talking about. ” Taken together, these sitcoms remind us of the centrality of race, not just to our conversations but to policies around income inequality. That the coming years may yield a hiring freeze on the federal work force, the continuing decline of unions, and more suffering for both   and     is no laughing matter. But, as the adage goes: Sometimes we simply have to laugh to keep from crying."
"

On December 7, 2009 the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” from carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse” gases. Thanks to the goofy Supreme Court decision, _Massachusetts v. EPA_ , after making such a finding, the EPA must then regulate CO2 ultimately to the point at which it no longer “endangers” human health and welfare.



As long as this ruling stands, no one can stop them without a specific Act of Congress. If a (Republican?) president directs his EPA administrator to back off, Environmental Defense, the Sierra Club and everyone else in the multibillion dollar global warming lobby will be in court in a second, arguing that the Supremes were quite clear: endangerment means regulation.



So, the only way to stop the EPA is for them to reverse their Endangerment Finding.



I think it is time to make this easy for them. Or, perhaps, easy for anyone to compel them to do so.



The Finding is based largely on two documents, with only one, _Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States_ , pertaining directly to the U.S. This 188‐​page, 569‐​citation tome is the Big Kahuna. Shoot it down and the Finding is gone, too. This document was produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (UGCRP), which has easily consumed $10 billion in a very few years and serves to advance the careers of bureaucrats, academics and college presidents. USGCRP has absolutely no incentive to do anything but hype climate change.



Which it did. Recognizing this (and knowing that EPA’s regulatory boot is not going to be popular) I have undertaken a little project, preparing a document with exactly the same format, flow, and subject matter as the USGCRP report, based upon the massive volume of refereed science that they chose to ignore in order to keep their gravy train hurtling down the track.



I’m calling my document _Additional Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States._



Here is Page 13 of the USGCRP Report.





And here is Page 13 from _Additional Climate Change Impacts in the United States_ :





So, how much science did the USGCRP leave out? As I noted, their document contains 569 citations. The final numbers aren’t in yet, but it appears that _Additional Climate Change Impacts_ will top out with well over 700.



What this means is that the USGCRP report that EPA is using as entre to your pocketbook ignored more than half of the published science. You should be able to take that to court. Honey, they shrunk the science.

Ireland is fast-tracking legislation that will effectively ban all gas-powered vehicles within a decade, leaving customers who are buying cars in January confused about what to do next, local reports show.
The country’s Climate Action Minister Richard Bruton plans to publish the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill 2019 enforcing such a ban, the Independent.ie reported Monday. The ban was officially announced in June, according to the report. One of Ireland’s political parties is pushing back.
“Fianna Fáil is mindful that families and businesses remain extremely reliant on petrol/diesel cars and that any phase out must be combined with greater investment in EV charging, public transport and cycling infrastructure,” Fianna Fáil climate spokesman Jack Chambers told the Independent.
Chambers noted that any phase out of fossil fuel-powered vehicle required an immediate transition to electric vehicles. The country’s automotive industry also suggested fast-tracking such a proposal, which was designed to eliminate carbon emissions, could create a lot of confusion.
“This only adds to the confusion, at a time when people are buying new cars. January is the biggest selling month for new cars,” Brian Cooke, director general of Society of the Irish Motor Industry, told reporters.
He added: “There are around 35,000 new cars sold in January, so it’s the key month for us.” (RELATED: Schumer Announces Plan To Nix Virtually Every Gas Powered Vehicle In The Country)
Ireland’s push is similar to one that U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York proposed in October.
“That’s why I am announcing a new proposal designed to rapidly phase out gas-powered vehicles and replace them with zero-emission, or ‘clean,’ vehicles like electric cars,” Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, wrote in an editorial that month after suggesting scientists agree that climate change represents an imminent threat to the U.S.
He added: “The goal of the plan, which also aims to spur a transformation in American manufacturing, is that by 2040 all vehicles on the road should be clean.” The plan would remove more than 63 million gas-powered cars from the road by 2030, Schumer estimates.
The senator’s office expects the proposal to cost roughly $392 billion over a decade. The Washington Post referred to the idea as “essentially ‘Cash for Clunkers’ on steroids,” referring to a policy from the Obama-era encouraging Americans to trade their old vehicles for fuel-efficient cars.
Cash for Clunkers was the mechanism allowing the federal government to offer incentives of between $2,500 and $4,500 to citizens who traded in their older vehicles for newer ones.  Critics called the idea, which received generous media fanfare, a failure even if it was designed with the best of intentions.
Schumer has not responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"• The record seven awards for the musical “La La Land” included for best picture comedy or musical and wins by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. “Moonlight” won for best picture drama. • Meryl Streep gave an impassioned, politically charged speech after receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award. • Casey Affleck, Viola Davis, Isabelle Huppert and Tracee Ellis Ross also won awards. Here is a list of the winners. • And in TV categories, “The Crown” and “Atlanta” were triumphant. • Wesley Morris, Melena Ryzik and Dave Itzkoff provided   commentary. And The Times was also on the red carpet. The     “La La Land” dominated the 74th Golden Globes on Sunday, receiving a promotional boost in the form of a lavish tribute that kicked off the awards telecast and collecting a record seven prizes, including one for best comedy or musical. No film has won more than four Globes since 1979, when the crime drama “Midnight Express” received six, the previous   number. “I’m in a daze now officially,” said the force behind “La La Land,” Damien Chazelle, 31, as he accepted the directing award. Noting the “La La Land” plot  —     dreamers try to make it in show business  —   Emma Stone said in accepting the award for best actress in a musical or comedy, “I think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world, and that’s what this movie is about. ” “La La Land,” made by Lionsgate, also won Globes for song, score, screenplay and actor. The bliss felt by the “La La Land” cast and crew was likely mirrored by the disappointment of those involved with “Moonlight,” the night’s    film. Despite six nominations, “Moonlight,” about a young black man growing up in Miami, received a lone trophy  —   albeit an important one: best drama. “Please, tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend,” Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight,” said in accepting the award, trying to boost the art film’s box office performance. A year after Hollywood was excoriated for its lack of diversity at the Oscars, inclusion was a major theme on Sunday. “This is for all of the women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy,” said Tracee Ellis Ross, as she accepted the best television actress Globe for her role in the ABC series “ . ” “I want you to know that I see you. We see you. ” Ms. Ross was the first black woman to win in the category since 1983, when Debbie Allen won for “Fame. ” There were several surprises. Isabelle Huppert took best actress in a drama for the French film “Elle,” beating Natalie Portman, who was favored to win for “Jackie. ” (“Elle,” a thriller about a businesswoman who tracks her rapist, also won best foreign film.) The foreign journalists who bestow the Globes are known for spreading their awards far and wide, but several films received nothing, including “Florence Foster Jenkins,” “Lion,” “Hacksaw Ridge” and “Hell or High Water. ” “Manchester by the Sea,” despite five nominations, was honored only in the best actor category for Casey Affleck. HBO, despite 14 nominations, the most of any network, was shut out altogether. The first award of the night, for best supporting actor, dropped jaws: Aaron   won for his performance in Tom Ford’s   “Nocturnal Animals,” beating favorites like Mahershala Ali of “Moonlight. ” “I made it  —   thank you,” Mr.   said, looking a bit startled. To the surprise of almost no one, Viola Davis took the supporting actress prize for playing a 1950s homemaker in “Fences. ” After doling out two kisses, one to her husband and one to Denzel Washington, who directed “Fences” and stars in it, Ms. Davis thanked its producers for taking a risk on the film. “It doesn’t scream moneymaker,” she said. “But it does scream art. It does scream heart. ” Early television awards were widely distributed. The   FX series “Atlanta,” about an aspiring rapper and his manager cousin, was honored as best comedy and Donald Glover won for best comedic actor for his performance in the show. Beating the likes of Rami Malek (“Mr. Robot”) and Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) for best actor in a drama was Billy Bob Thornton, honored for his performance in “Goliath,” a show with little buzz. Best actress in a TV drama went to Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix’s “The Crown,” which won for best dramatic series. As expected, “The People vs. O. J. Simpson: Crime Story” was named best   and Sarah Paulson, repeating her win at the Emmys, collected a trophy for her portrayal of the prosecutor Marcia Clark in that show. A   Ms. Paulson was showered with hugs from   as she returned to her seat. The night got off to a jerky start. After the host, Jimmy Fallon, opened the show with the taped “La La Land”  number, he became befuddled after a teleprompter malfunction. Still, he kept it breezy. “Let’s make tonight a celebration,” Mr. Fallon said in his monologue. Despite promises in preshow interviews to zing Donald J. Trump ahead of his inauguration, Mr. Fallon even kept his political jokes to a minimum. “One of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,” he said, almost in a mumble. For casual movie fans, the annual Oscar race starts with the Globes. (Oscar nomination ballots are due on Friday.) But the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the Globes, has worked in recent years to make its television honors more relevant by leaning toward rookie shows like “The Affair” and “Transparent. ” Hollywood stylists spent most of the week fretting about the weather forecast. For days, it looked like torrential rain would threaten a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a swamp. On Sunday, however, Angelenos awakened to “another day of sun,” to borrow a lyric from “La La Land. ” When Meryl Streep, a   Globes nominee and   winner, accepted her Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she gave an impassioned speech that, while never mentioning Mr. Trump by name, was a clear reaction to the election. “Take your broken heart, make it into art,” she said, quoting Carrie Fisher. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said that he had not watched the Globes or Ms. Streep’s speech, but that he was “not surprised” that she and some other entertainment figures had criticized him during the Hollywood event. “Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep’s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. While winners steered away from directly criticizing Mr. Trump, several used their moment onstage to take clear jabs. The British actor Hugh Laurie, collecting a   actor award for “The Night Manager,” said: “I can say I won this at the   Golden Globes. I mean, it has the words ‘Hollywood,’ “Foreign’ and ‘Press’ in it. ” He added, “I also think to some Republicans, even the word ‘Association’ is sketchy. ” Some Trump supporters, either anticipating the barbs or irritated that many Hollywood stars have been outspoken in their horror at his election, made #BoycottGoldenGlobes trend on Twitter early on Sunday. The Golden Globes are great fun, and so is its red carpet. Among this year’s first arrivals were the Stallone sisters, this year’s Miss Golden Globes, shepherded about by their father Sylvester’s     publicist no buttering up of reporters. A news crew from Canada was promised a question with the sisters but then told “They need to go do Twitter” first. Issa Rae and Donald Glover were among the luminaries who admitted to feeling slightly intimidated to being there. Mr. Glover said he really wanted to meet Ms. Davis, and that he was still shocked at the huge response to “Atlanta,” his FX series. “It was supposed to be a punk show,” he said. “And they screened it at A. F. I. and Scorsese was laughing. ” Ms. Rae, of the HBO show “Insecure,” said she was still adjusting to her growing fame. “I’m an introvert, I barely leave the house,” she said. “To be out here is a blessing but I’m like: ‘Wow, guys. It’s just me. ” Even though Netflix has upended the TV industry, that streaming service had never won in the best drama or comedy category at the Globes (and the Emmys, for that matter). That changed this year with “The Crown,”  which was named best drama. Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, won for best actress in a drama. “The Crown” beat out “Stranger Things,” also from Netflix “Westworld,” the HBO series that practically requires a Ph. D. to understand it NBC’s   “This Is Us” and HBO’s “Game of Thrones. ” Another closely watched television race was for best comedic actress, where Ms. Ross beat out some stiff competition to become the first black woman to win in the category since Debbie Allen in 1983. Also nominated were the   Globe winner Sarah Jessica Parker, for her role as a   suburban mother in HBO’s “Divorce” Ms. Rae, nominated for her   performance in HBO’s “Insecure” Julia   from the network’s “Veep” and last year’s winner, Rachel Bloom (“Crazy  ”). Globe voters have ardently tried to leave behind their reputation for paying more attention to celebrity than honoring the year’s best performances. Once upon a time, Globe attendees also bellied up to the open bar in a boozy spectacle, but nominees  —   heeding the scolding eyes of their publicists  —   have largely started sticking to water. Despite moments of seriousness, however, the Globes lived up its raucous reputation. The “Modern Family” star Sofia Vergara made anus jokes from the stage. NBC censors bleeped expletives from Amy Schumer. Dinner guests in multiple instances chatted right through the speeches. As ever, the ballroom’s smoking patio was chockablock with stars at one moment, Sophie Turner from “Game of Thrones” lit her cigarette off one held by her   Maisie Williams. The young “Stranger Things” cast members ran around taking selfies. As ever, the ceremony’s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. About 18. 5 million people watched last year, down from 19. 3 million in 2015. Televised award shows in general have been suffering from viewer erosion, partly because there is a seemingly endless array of them, but NBC had high hopes for Mr. Fallon. He has a much wider fan base than Mr. Gervais and has been using his “Tonight Show” perch as a promotional platform for the gig."

His full bio is here.  In 2017, there were 22.7 million light duty vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) registered in Canada. They represented 12 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions in that year. The current federal government target is to reduce GHG emissions by about 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. In practice, that means a reduction from 716 megatonnes (Mt) of emissions in 2017 to 512 Mt in 2030, or 28.5%. The Green Party and a number of municipalities have called for a reduction of 45% from 2015 levels by 2030, of about 43.5 %. Presenting these goals in terms of percentages of emissions means little to the average citizen. What if we used some simple assumptions and some simple mathematics to illustrate what it would mean in one sector of the economy if the government chose to seek comparable percentage emissions reductions in all economic sectors? Let’s ignore for the sake the argument the fact that Canadians buy about two million new light duty vehicles each year, and junk a similar but slightly smaller number of older vehicles, and just treat the number of vehicles as constant. Reducing light duty vehicles by 28.5% means a reduction of 6,470,000 vehicles, or almost 500,000 vehicles a year from the roads from 2017 to 2030. Reducing light duty vehicles by 43.5% means a reduction of 9,875,000 vehicles, or 760,000 vehicles per year from the roads from 2017 to 2030. So, the next time someone says that Canada can make these reductions without a problem, ask them how we would remove that many vehicles per year from the roads, and whether they will be the first to volunteer to give up their car.———–RELATED:The 85 Million Tonne Obsessionhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/27/the-85-million-tonne-obsession/You Can’t Get There from Herehttps://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/You_cant_get_there_from_here_Lyman.pdf Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

From E&E Climatewire
Maya Earls, E&E News reporter
Published: Monday, December 23, 2019
A new survey has found that few medical schools incorporate climate change into their curricula.
Despite the threat climate change poses to human health, very few medical schools have made it a part of their coursework.
The International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations recently conducted a survey of medical schools in 118 countries. Of the medical schools reviewed, the IFMSA found 15.9% have made climate change a part of their curricula.
Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency room doctor and climate change researcher at the Harvard Global Health Institute, said she was not surprised by the results. Through her work at Harvard, she has tried to incorporate climate change into the teachings of U.S. medical schools.
Salas said the survey shows there is an opportunity to train the next generation of physicians so they have the skills necessary to practice in a future where global warming affects every aspect of their jobs.
“Climate change is truly that threat multiplier,” she said. “It impacts, in my opinion, every facet of how we practice medicine.”
The health impacts of climate change are numerous. More days with extreme heat could account for an increase of 1 million deaths each year in India alone (Climatewire, Nov. 1). Wildfires, which are also predicted to increase, pose a threat to people with respiratory conditions (Climatewire, Dec. 16). And the changing climate is exposing more people to vector-borne diseases such as Zika and Lyme (Climatewire, Oct. 30).
Sheri Weiser, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said her own interest in climate change was spurred by research into food insecurity. The more she studied the subject, the more she found the issue was significantly exacerbated by climate change.
For example, an August study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found increased climate shocks could reduce gains that have been made in lowering the rates of stunting caused by poor childhood nutrition. The United Nations also issued a report that found the number of people suffering from hunger in 2018 reached an eight-year high due to economic, political and climate-related factors.
Weiser is now a leader in incorporating climate change into the university’s curriculum.
“One of the biggest barriers is competing priorities,” she said. “And how to add content without taking away content.”
Medical school curriculum by nature is always changing to include new research. An Association of American Medical Colleges survey of 147 medical schools in 2017-2018 found 34.7% were planning to make a curriculum change in the future. The survey found 30.6% of schools already had a curriculum change in the process.
There are natural fits in the curriculum to bring climate change into the conversation, according to Weiser. For example, the study of infectious disease presents an opportunity to discuss how more people could be affected.
Salas echoed that idea, saying that schools can add climate change to lessons of asthma and other conditions.
“My approach is all they need to do is add a climate lens to what they’re already teaching,” she said.

Censorship is always imposed in the supposed public interest, to protect people from being corrupted by errant views. In fact it is a device for the powerful to silence dissenters and manufacture an artificial truth. 



Patrick Michaels, a member of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has accused the climate establishment of trying to manufacture a consensus in peer‐​reviewed academic journals by censoring or squeezing out dissenters. He should know he is a victim. 



IPCC scientists, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, are not unanimous on climate change. A few like Patrick Michaels and John Christy say fears of global warming are greatly exaggerated. The climate establishment dismisses most dissenters as the equivalent of Holocaust deniers. It cannot so easily dismiss Michaels or Christy, who are distinguished members of the Nobel Prize‐​winning team. 



Climategate is the recent scandal revealing that establishment scientists like Phil Jones and Michael Mann, at the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of East Anglia University, sought to destroy emails, hide data, and evade freedom of information requests in order to thwart dissenting voices. Mann and Jones claim that the censorship attempts were minor, and do not affect the truth on climate. Really? Then why try to censor something so minor? What will these worthies do if something major comes up that really threatens their establishment view? 



These clumsy censorship attempts are merely the tip of the iceberg, says Michaels in a Wall Street Journal op‐​ed. The bible of scientists is peer‐​reviewed literature in academic journals. Establishment scientists now seek to squeeze dissenters out of these journals, and close down journals that do not toe the line. This attempt to fix the academic literature and manufacture a bogus “scientific consensus” suggests there might be something to hide. 



The academic climate literature, including IPCC documents, held in the 1990s that the medieval warm period around 1100 AD was warmer than the 20th century. Then, in 1999, Mann proposed the ‘hockey stick’ hypothesis. Using multivariate statistics and questionable data weighting, he wiped out both the medieval warm period and the subsequent ‘little ice age’ (a cold period from the late 16th century to the mid‐​19th century), leaving only the 20th‐​century warming as a big temperature outlier. The IPCC establishment eagerly embraced this re‐​writing of the entire history of climate change. In any other discipline, the hockey stick thesis would have gone down as one more plausible hypothesis. But the IPCC has, in effect, wiped out all the earlier historical literature in one stroke! 



Then Climate Research, a refereed journal, published two papers offending the establishment. One paper in 2003 by Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas (of the Harvard‐​Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), analysed dozens of “paleoclimate” studies and concluded that 20th‐​century temperatures could not confidently be considered warmer than those a thousand years ago. This reaffirmed the existence of the medieval warm period. The establishment also disliked a paper by Michaels in Climate Research in 2002, showing that the magnitude of warming in CRU’s own data was not as great as predicted by the IPCC models. This suggested that the models might be exaggerating the impact of atmospheric carbon dioxide. 



Normal academic practice would have required the establishment to rebut these views. Instead, Mann suggested putting Climate Research out of business, or at least hiding information from it. He wrote in one of his emails , “Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the Climate Research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal… We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board.” 



After establishment scientists threatened a boycott of publications and reviews, half the editorial board of Climate Research resigned. Scientists like Michaels found it increasingly difficult to get published. Some dissenters like Sallie Baliunas stopped trying, “tiring of summary rejections of good work by editors scared of the mob”. 



Geophysical Research Letters (GRL) is another popular refereed journal. Climategate exposed emails between establishment scientists wanting to oust one of the editors of GRL suspected of climate scepticism. “It’s one thing to lose Climate Research. We can’t afford to lose GRL.” The establishment succeeded in ousting the editor, and then exulted in an email, “the GRL leak may have been plugged up now w/​new editorial leadership there.” 



Regretably, the IPCC itself is now getting tainted by this attempt to capture academic journals and censor dissenting views. Objecting to some dissenting papers, Mann is reported to have said, “I can’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin and I will keep them out somehow — even if we have to redefine what the peer‐​review literature is!” 



As a UN body, the IPCC must not allow itself to be captured by one scientific faction or another. It needs to give fair representation to all views. Indeed, the IPCC is supposed to take into account all peer‐​reviewed literature, including dissenting views. 



Is this actually happening? No, says Michaels. “The last IPCC compendium on climate science, published in 2007, left out plenty of peer‐​reviewed science that it found inconveniently disagreeable. These include articles from the journals Arctic, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, Earth Interactions, Geophysical Research Letters, International Journal of Climatology, Journal of Climate, Journal of Geophysical Research, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Quaternary Research.” 



This is a formidable indictment. Michaels is not a sceptic: he sees evidence of warming, but thinks it is much exaggerated. So, this is not a case of the establishment trying to silence a sceptic: it is trying to silence even a non‐​sceptic with insufficient religious zeal. 



Scientific methodology usually beats attempts at manipulation. The problem here is that the IPCC has won a Nobel Prize. Establishment scientists are only human, and can be expected to spin everything and anything to prove that they did indeed deserve the award. That will seem to them a more worthwhile goal than mere scientific truth. There lies the danger.

What is it with governments and local councils these days? Many seem to have a penchant for either coming up with wacky ideas or involving themselves in areas that they think are fashionable, but in truth are no more than virtue signalling.



Take the latest from Auckland council declaring a Climate Change Emergency after hours of, no doubt, pointless debate. Will it change anything? No. What, practically, will it achieve? Nothing. Penny Hulse says it will ensure the council considers the effects of climate change in all its decision making. What a load of frivolous tosh. There was no need to spend hours of debate to vote on a piece of nonsense enabling them to do something they were able to do anyway. This a scandalous waste of time and ratepayers monies. 



If I were to apply the word emergency it would be to Council’s core services: freeing up land and reducing red tape and compliance costs. I suppose spending time on those is in the too-hard basket as answers would be required. Climate Change is easy because you can look good and pretend you are doing something when you don’t have to do anything. And nobody, if they even care, will notice any difference. This sort of time wasting is not the reason we reluctantly pay our rates. If Jacinda Ardern can wreck an entire region’s economy on a Captain’s Call why do these muppets need to spend hours sitting around debating this codswallop?



This Climate Change claptrap is the favourite stuff and nonsense of the Left. They are all about looking good, feeling good, kindness and the warm fuzzies but in reality, achieving next to nothing. Kiwibuild, tree planting, light rail, the list goes on. 



It’s the Local Body elections this year. Be careful who you vote for.

"NICE, France  —   At times it was hard to know who was on trial, the smuggler or the state. The defendant, Cédric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives. He would do it again, he suggested. Instead, when asked by a judge, “Why do you do all this?” Mr. Herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of France’s practice of rounding up and turning back Africans entering illegally from Italy in search of work and a better life. It was “ignoble,” he said. “There are people dying on the side of the road,” Mr. Herrou replied. “It’s not right. There are children who are not safe. It is enraging to see children, at 2 in the morning, completely dehydrated. “I am a Frenchman,” Mr. Herrou declared. The trial, which began on Wednesday, is no ordinary one. It has been substantially covered by the French news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of France’s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into Europe and the quandary they present. France, foremost among European nations, prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism, fraternity and solidarity. And yet, perhaps first among them, too, it is struggling to reconcile those values with the pressing realities of a smaller, more globalized world, including fear of terrorism. The contradictions are being played out in courtrooms, in politics and in farmers’ fields, on the sidewalks of Paris and in train stations from the Côte d’Azur to the northern port of Calais, where the government demolished a giant migrant camp in the fall. On the one hand, politicians in this year’s presidential election are competing to see who can take the toughest line on securing France’s borders. Most are promising a crackdown on migrants, with admission reserved for   cases of political persecution. Terrorist attacks, including the one last summer in Nice that killed 85 people, have exacerbated   sentiment. But in these remote mountain valleys, where Jews fleeing the Nazis and the Vichy collaborators found refuge during World War II, Mr. Herrou has become something of a folk hero by leading a kind of loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north, many destined for Britain or Germany. His work has won him admiration for his resistance to the state and his stand that it is simply right to help one’s fellow man, woman or child. Others in this region seem to agree. In the square outside the   courthouse, hundreds of sympathizers gathered and shouted, “We are all children of immigrants!” Mr. Herrou got a hero’s welcome as he descended the steep steps late in the evening, trailed by television cameras. Inside, not even the prosecutor,   Prêtre, seemed to want him there and praised his cause as “noble. ” He asked for an   sentence, but quickly reassured the court that it should be suspended, “of course. ” Still, the law is the law. “He’s demonstrated a manifest intention to violate the law,” Mr. Prêtre told the court. “One can criticize it, but it’s got to be applied. ” The verdict, which will be made by the panel of three judges who heard the case this week  —   there was no jury of peers  —   is scheduled to be announced on Feb. 10. The appeal for leniency was both an acknowledgment of widespread discomfort with the law, as a well as recognition of Mr. Herrou’s growing status in the region around Nice and its mountainous backcountry, the Roya Valley. Mr. Herrou was voted “Azuréen of the Year” last month by the readers of the leading local newspaper,   to the fury of regional officials. “I am Cédric,” read one of the placards in the crowd. “Long live the righteous of the Roya,” read another. The courtroom on Wednesday was filled with people from the mountain  —   the men bearded and ponytailed, the women in duffel coats  —   who had come to support Mr. Herrou and who were convinced right was on their side. The notion that Mr. Herrou is trying to uphold what he sees as basic French values, rather than violating the law, is much of the reason he appears to enjoy a considerable measure of popular support. The argument formed the essence of his lawyer’s defense strategy. Remember the last word in the French Republic’s motto, “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité,” his lawyer, Zia Oloumi, told the court. “They are saying M. Herrou is endangering the Republic,” Mr. Oloumi told the three judges. “On the contrary, I think he is defending its values. “You see, you have got this value, fraternity, and the dictionary is quite clear,” Mr. Oloumi said. “Think about the impact of your decision on the practical application of the idea of fraternity. ” Mr. Herrou was not making any political points, Mr. Oloumi insisted. He was merely responding to a humanitarian crisis in his own backyard the Roya Valley had become a way station for migrants. The judges did not respond. But the lightness of the sentence called for by Mr. Prêtre suggested that the concepts invoked by Mr. Oloumi had resonance. Mr. Herrou’s accusers seemed most taken aback by his stubbornness. Not every migrant Mr. Herrou picks up is by the side of the road. He finds many outside the migrant camp across the Italian border at Ventimiglia, looking especially for women and children. The presiding judge, Laurie Duca, reminded him he had first been arrested in August, near his mountainside home at    with a van full of migrants. At that time, the prosecutor released him, suggesting that Mr. Herrou’s humanitarian motivations absolved him. That first arrest was evidently merely a warning. “After August, you said you knew it was illegal,” Judge Duca remarked in court. No matter. Mr. Herrou persisted, describing his   work to journalists last fall and even occupying a disused summer camp owned by the state railroad when his own modest homestead became overwhelmed. At that point, in   the authorities decided they had had enough of him. “You were there, and you were extremely active,” the judge said. “Why so much press?” Mr. Herrou replied, “It is right that society should know about all this. ” The judge and the prosecutor suggested that this time Mr. Herrou would not get the humanitarian pass he had benefited from previously. The local political establishment is furious with him. “At the very moment when we need strict controls, Mr. Herrou’s ideological, premeditated actions are a major risk,” Eric Ciotti, the president of the departmental council and a leading   member of Parliament, wrote in  . Mr. Prêtre, the prosecutor, suggested that Mr. Herrou’s persistence and openness had been his undoing. “Mr. Herrou acknowledges everything,” Mr. Prêtre said, with astonishment. “This trial springs from a communications strategy for a cause that I totally respect. ” And yet, “this is what he told the police. He said, ‘I am violating the law.’ But I am the prosecutor. I must defend the law. ”"

Despite stressing global sea level rise is worrisome and due to anthropogenic warming, Chafik et al. (2019) report a distinct cooling trend in the North Atlantic that coincides with a transition to falling regional sea levels since 2004.

Meanwhile, Ruan et al. (2019) attribute the rapid deceleration in Greenland ice sheet melt since 2013 to the -2.0°C North Atlantic cooling that apparently has begun affecting the Arctic.

A cooling trend in recent decades has also spread to West Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, and East Antarctica (Lüning et al.,2019).

Paris climate talks this week descended into madcap all-night negotiations, as delegates desperately tried to salvage some kind of agreement beyond empty promises to do something sometime about what President Obama insists is the gravest threat to our planet, national security and future generations.
In the end, what we apparently got out of Paris is voluntary emission caps, voluntary progress reviews, no international oversight of any voluntary progress, and voluntary contributions to the Fund.
Obligating the United States to slash its fossil fuel use, and send billions of taxpayer dollars annually to dictators, bureaucrats and crony industrialists in poor countries would be disastrous. Thank goodness it did not happen. But we are not out of the woods yet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German government, led by Angela Merkel, had been warned more than 7 years ago of the very real potential for a pandemic and that the country’s health care system was not prepared to deal with such a crisis.
Yet, instead of preparing for the probable scenario, the government poured tens of billions of euros into fighting the imaginary “climate crisis”. Now, as Germany reels from the current COVID-19 pandemic, critical voices are asking why the government never bothered to take action to implement preventive measures.
A printed federal government document titled “Report on Risk Analysis in Civil Protection 2012” looked at two potential hazards the country could face: 1) Flooding rivers fed by mountain run off, and 2) potential SARS-like pandemic.
Described 1 to 1 today’s situation – in 2012!
The 88-page government report, beginning on page 55, explicitly assesses the potential pandemic risks and warns of catastrophic consequences that could unfold. It describes almost 1 to 1 what is happening today. Particularly macabre is that the corona virus is explicitly named and that the outbreak would start in “February” and that the first two cases would appear in North Rhine Westphalia and Southern Germany!
Moreover it describes the major economic changes  and the possible encroachment of fundamental rights that would occur. The event is also seen unfolding in February in Asia and spreading to Germany just weeks later (see 2.4).
Widespread damage
The report also assesses the damage extent (Schadensausmaß) a pandemic would have in the four categories comprising man, environment, economy and immaterial. Except for environment, most were rated with “E” for extensive.

Extent of damage rated “E” means:

The costs to the private sector caused by the event are considerable, supra-regional scope, and a large proportion of the companies concerned cannot from their own resources. Long-term losses of turnover for the affected industries are or companies to be expected. A large number of companies go into insolvency, many more companies are threatened with insolvency; in some sectors, nationwide effects are (supplier companies). The entire national economy suffers from the event into a recession, economic stimulus packages are necessary.”
and
Maintaining public security and order is endangered across regions to nationwide.”
Eight years later, we see that the authors of the pandemic scenario could not have been more accurate. Yet, the German government never took the risk analysis seriously and stood by as its health care system eroded further. Instead the German government unilaterally poured hundreds of billions to combat global climate, among other things.
“Incompetence, gross negligence”
In a recent interview, economist and book author Dr. Markus Krall brings up the 2013 government report (15:00), saying that the government should have invested in the country’s health care system long ago and that the government’s failure to take action to prepare for this risk shows how “incompetently” we are being governed.
Krall adds that the government could have, for example, procured 100,000 respirators for a mere 50 million euros in preparation for a pandemic. “We spent billions, many billions…hundreds of billions by the handful, for other things”.
“I don’t want to say what I think about it, but every person can decide for himself what it means in terms of gross negligence in policymaking’s obligation with respect to the duties it was responsible for.”
Krall accuses the German government of moving too slowly due to its open border ideology. “Our German chancellor wanted, no matter what, to stick to her open borders, and she still does.”
Krall notes, “I have absolutely no understanding over how this government sets its priorities. That just cannot be accepted. It’s irresponsible.”

A review of state-of-the-art climate data tells a different story than what NOAA tells the public.
While media outlets scream “hottest ever” for the world in June and July (it’s summer) and opportunistic climate crusaders use those headlines to push the idea of a “climate crisis” the reality is for USA is that so far most of 2019 has been below normal, temperature-wise.
Little known data from the state of the art U.S. Climate Reference Network (which never seems to make it into NOAA’s monthly “state of the climate” reports) show that for the past nine months, six of them were below normal, shown in bold below.
201810-0.18°F201811-2.56°F2018122.39°F2019010.63°F201902-3.15°F201903-2.81°F2019041.55°F201905-1.13°F201906-0.14°F
Above: Table 1, U.S. average temperature anomaly from October 2018 to June 2019. Full data file here
Note the below average value for June, 2019 at  -0.14°F 
The data, taken directly from NOAA’s national climate data page, shows not only that much of 2019 was below average, but that the US Temperature average is actually cooler now for 2019 than we were in 2005, when the dataset started.
 Figure 1, U.S. average temperature anomaly from January 2005 to June 2019. Source of graph, NOAA, available here
The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) was established to give the most accurate temperature readings compared to the old Cooperative Observer Network (COOP) which suffers from urban encroachment, siting problems, and a multitude of human induced inhomgeneities such as station moves, incomplete data, closed stations, and runway condition stations at airports that were never designed to report climate data. 
Click for report
Readers here know of my work to highlight these problems, and as a result, there was a 2011 report by the GAO about the problems with the old COOP network. They investigated a subset of the larger COOP network (The USHCN) and said:
According to GAO’s survey of weather forecast offices, about 42 percent of the active stations in 2010 did not meet one or more of the siting standards. With regard to management requirements, GAO found that the weather forecast offices had generally but not always met the requirements to conduct annual station inspections and to update station records. NOAA officials told GAO that it is important to annually visit stations and keep records up to date, including siting conditions, so that NOAA and other users of the data know the conditions under which they were recorded. NOAA officials identified a variety of challenges that contribute to some stations not adhering to siting standards and management requirements, including the use of temperature measuring equipment that is connected by a cable to an indoor readout device— which can require installing equipment closer to buildings than specified in the siting standards. NOAA does not centrally track whether USHCN stations adhere to siting standards and the requirement to update station records, and it does not have an agency wide policy regarding stations that do not meet its siting standards. Performance management guidelines call for using performance information to assess program results. NOAA’s information systems, however, are not designed to centrally track whether stations in the USHCN meet its siting standards or the requirement to update station records. Without centrally available information, NOAA cannot easily measure the performance of the USHCN in meeting siting standards and management requirements.  Source:  GAO-11-800 August 31, 2011, Climate Monitoring: NOAA Can Improve Management of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network https://www.gao.gov/highlights/d11800high.pdf 
NOAA’s response? Rather than fix it, they closed reporting the USHCN subset of COOP stations in 2012. They now say this on their climate data page:
National USHCN monthly temperature updates have been discontinued. The official CONUS temperature record is now based upon nClimDiv. USHCN data for January 1895 to August 2014 will remain available for historical comparison.Source:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=uscrn&datasets%5B%5D=cmbushcn&parameter=anom-tavg&time_scale=p12&begyear=2004&endyear=2019&month=12 
Yet, while the USHCN was closed, and the data from it are no longer reported in the monthly and yearly NOAA climate reports, the problems identified in the USHCN persist in the larger COOP Network, of which several thousand stations remain:
 Distribution of U.S. Cooperative Observer Network stations in the CONUS. U.S. HCN version 2 sites are indicated as red triangles.  Source:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ushcn/introduction 
All NOAA did was treat the visible symptoms we identified (by excising them), while leaving the larger disease uncured, and continuing to use the majority of data in it, data with the same sort of problems and inhomgeneities discovered in the USHCN subset. The USHCN was 1218 station out of over 8700 COOP stations, and that remaining data is used to calculate the U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset used to report “official” temperature averages today. Basically all they did was sweep the problem under the rug, and report that they have algorithms to “fix” bad data.
In any other branch of science, in the stock market, or in criminal forensics, “bad” data would be thrown out as unreliable. 
Meanwhile, perfectly good data gets ignored in favor of “fixed” bad data. NOAA says this about the new state-of-the-art Climate Reference Network network:
The vision of the USCRN program is to maintain a sustainable high-quality climate observation network that 50 years from now can with the highest degree of confidence answer the question: How has the climate of the Nation changed over the past 50 years?These stations were designed with climate science in mind. Three independent measurements of temperature and precipitation are made at each station, insuring continuity of record and maintenance of well-calibrated and highly accurate observations. The stations are placed in pristine environments expected to be free of development for many decades.Source:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/us-climate-reference-network-uscrn 
The data from the rest of the world, as reported by NOAA’s Global Historical Climatology Network is largely composed of the same type of stations, with an equal to or even greater (due to lack of consistent quality control) set of data problems.
Unfortunately, NOAA doesn’t seem to think the data from this state-of-the-art US Climate Reference Network is worth reporting to the public. A scan of the last 5 years of yearly and monthly “State of the Climate” reports has not a single mention of this high quality data, preferring to cite the data from the old COOP network instead, now repackaged as  the U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset.
In fact, for the June 2019 State of the Climate Report,  NOAA is claiming that the US was 0.2F above average in June, when in fact the US Climate Reference Network reported the June data as below average at  -0.14°F 
The June contiguous U.S. temperature was 68.7°F, 0.2°F above the 20th century average, ranking in the middle third of the 125-year record.Source:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201906 
So what is the correct US Temperature for June? 
In May, 2019, there was also a disparity. USCRN reported the national average temperature as below average at  -1.13°F 
While NOAA’s “official” climate report said it was only about half that, reading warmer by 0.43°F:
For May, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 59.5°F, 0.7°F below the 20thcentury average and ranked in the bottom third of the 125-year record.Source:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201905 
It seems NOAA can’t even agree on reporting what the actual temperature of the United States is on a monthly basis, using their own old and unreliable data, while neglecting to report the best data they have. Why?
That’s a travesty of government incompetence worth investigating.
One wonders if screaming headlines about “hottest ever” this month would even exist if the world had a global version of the U.S. Climate Reference Network where the data was quality controlled, and measurements taken far away from the human induced heat of urbanization.

If you haven’t already discovered [No Punches Pulled](https://nopunchespulled.com/) I highly recommend that you check it out. One of Sir Bob’s recent blog posts is on Climate change conferences and he doesn’t disappoint.



We’re being hammered about our wicked ways with plastic, dairy farming, cars etc, the latest fashionable sin being our evilness in flying in jet planes.  
Last week, the current whipping boy for some British newspapers, namely Prince Harry plus his wife Meaghan, were given a roasting for a short trip in Elton John’s jet as his guests for a stay with him. So why don’t they hammer Elton John and the hundreds of others owning private jets?  
Well, get this.  
Currently, the United Nations is organising a climate change conference for next year, which is expected to attract 30,000 international delegates, including world leaders. That’s not a misprint. Thirty bloody thousand flying in from all points of the globe, including doubtless New Zealand.



  
Boris is pressing the UNO to host it in Glasgow […]  




Lang Banks, director of the Scottish World Wildlife Fund delivered this nonsense.  




 _“This will be a vital milestone in the global response to the growing climate crisis. The fossil fuel era began in Scotland and in 2020 the global community must come to Glasgow and say that this will be the last fossil fuel generation and that we’re ready to take on the climate and nature emergencies we face.”_



Yeah, right! That’s why 30,000 are going to burn fossil fuel to complain about burning fossil fuel.  
So what exactly will these 30,000 do when at this conference? We know the answer, as with all such large-scale conferences There will be no conferring, just ear-bashing speeches telling those present what they already know.  
I’ll pay $1,000 for any delegate who actually pays his or her own air-fare and hotel costs in return for $10 for everyone with their snout in a public trough. That should net me $300,000, assuming there are any takers.  
If these parasites on the public purse were sincere they’d stay at home and receive the addresses by email to read at their leisure […]



Of course that’s true of all conferences, now a massive tax-deductible holiday excuse but otherwise in 90% of the cases, utterly valueless.  
In 1999 The Australian Tax Office said as much, noting how international conferences timing and location **invariably coincided with major sporting events.**  
So to open the batting as it were, they first targeted a law conference in Britain, coinciding with the Rugby World Cup being hosted by Wales and advised they would not allow tax deductibility for the travel costs. All hell broke out resulting in then Prime Minister John Howard intervening with the ATO and having this decision reversed.[…]  
  
The quid-pro-quo for the conference costs deductibility tax rort is conferences are now big business, generating jobs and incomes for host cities. But the United Nations 30,000 attendee climate conference is another matter and surely the most hypocritical mass action in human history. Furthermore, readers will be partly paying for it as you can be sure our Greens will be there on the public purse. If they had any integrity they’d refuse.  
And if the Conference is staged in Glasgow it’s odds on it will coincide with the 2 months long Edinburgh Festival […] Put that down to an amazing coincidence.

Every several years, an acronym of federal climate poobahs produces a new “National Assessment” of climate change effects on the U.S. The latest one, by the National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee (NCADAC) has been sent out for “expert review” to ham‐​and‐​eggers like yours truly.



After seeing it, I should add another thing to the list of things you don’t want to see being made in Washington. The new list now includes legislation, sausage, and climate assessments.



This is the third go‐​round, and as it stands, it’s the worst of the lot.



That’s saying something. The first one, in 2000, used two (out of the dozens available) climate models. One predicted the largest precipitation changes of all, and the other the largest changes in temperature. They were both wrong at the time the Assessment was published, predicting three times as much warming as was observed, and having absolutely no forecast skill estimating changes in precipitation. It seemed impossible, but the temperature predictions were _worse_ than one could get from a table of random numbers, a rare example of what should be called negative knowledge; kinda like getting less than 25% correct on a four‐​way multiple choice test.





You would think $3.5 billion per year of global change science spending would get you some honest background analysis.



The second one, produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program in 2009, was so bad that I produced an entire look‐​alike document (available here) for direct comparison to the government’s version, available here. The amount of material missing from the federal report was truly mind‐​boggling. Ours had hundreds more endnotes. The feds somehow missed hundreds of scientific papers repeatedly documenting the pervasiveness of the growth‐​enhancing effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which are obvious from satellite images of our getting‐​greener planet.



But the new one — the capstone of $3.5 billion per year’s worth of public monies — takes the cake.



These reports only rarely contain blatant lies. Instead, we are fed a mélange of half‐​truths, incomplete statements, and misquoted citations. Who really expects reviewers to dig so deep as to uncover all of these?



Well, I’ve been doing just that for the last six weeks, and will continue until the end of the comment period, which is on April 12. I’ve uncovered some real whoppers, an example of which isn’t going to do much for the sagging reputation of climate types, wounded already by climategate and various data scandals.



Most anthropogenerated climate change is mediated through changes in the two basic variables of temperature and precipitation. Here’s a precipitation forecast, given in Figure 2.12 on page 44 of the 1200‐​page tome.







I’m showing the “higher emission” forecast because, in the following analysis, that is the one that cuts the NCADAC the most slack. At any rate, these maps still look like B-A-D stuff’s a‐​brewin’.



Where there are stripes on the map, NCADAC says that “confidence is large” and the changes are all predicted to be the same sign by their suite of 18 models.



But, nowhere in their 1200 pages is there any context or background. One can be highly confident of a forecast change, but the change can also be operationally meaningless. I’m pretty confident tomorrow is going to be a couple of degrees warmer than today, but does that make any difference to me?



So, to provide this background, I looked only at the high‐​confidence state‐​season combinations. I then calculated the standard deviation around the total observed (1901–2011) data and, given the magnitude of the predicted changes through the end of this century, totaled up how many years, with a 50–50 probability, it will take for any change in rainfall to poke its way out of the year‐​to‐​year noise. In other words, how long will it take for any forecast to become a detectable change?



There were 84 separate season‐​state combinations where confidence is large. First, the good news. In nine of these, the predicted change has already come out of the noise. Now the better news — eight of them are precipitation increases, with the most in the spring. Farmers should do handstands over that.



From there on, it’s downhill, fast. On the _average_ , it will be 520 years before a state’s precipitation changes significantly in the summer. In the winter, 330 years. Averaged across all seasons, 297 years. That’s three centuries from now.



You would think $3.5 billion per year of global change science spending would get you some honest background analysis…or maybe you wouldn’t, because, given that detectable statewide rainfall changes are about three centuries away, why would we continue to spend this kind of money on such an overblown bunch of sausage?

"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), President Obama, and hisadministration think that alternative energy sources (like wind and solarpower) and biofuels in particular are the salvation from “climate change,”previously called “global warming.”
They view “carbon pollution” (a misnomer, as they actually mean carbondioxide, CO2) as the root cause of the current economic and environmentalmalaise in general. That’s why they blessed the nation with the “RenewableFuel Standard.”
I think the opposite is true; neither CO2 nor the “carbon footprint” is thecause of today’s many problems. In fact, the world today would be muchbetter off if that nonsense had never become a political football.

I’d love to be a witness to what happens at that climate “conference”. But I somehow doubt the topic of conversation will be their personal carbon footprints, unless they decide to start comparing the size of their private jets.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman ©2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.Executive SummaryREAD FULL REPORT: THE UNITED NATIONS 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Jan 20 2019Canadians may view the federal government’s global warming policies as detached from other political and policy objectives, and not part of a broader national or international framework. The 2018 report by Global Affairs Canada containing a “voluntary national review” of Canada’s progress in meeting the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development shows that this is not true. In the paper that follows, I quote extensively from the report in order to give precise examples of the rationale that governs the Federal government’s approach and to show that it is part of an integrated whole. For those used to traditional public policy goals, the document is surprising, and in some respects quite alarming Reports of this kind historically have been dry recitations of programs and expenditures made in keeping with an international commitment. This document, instead, uses language typical of a federal Budget, full of striking, almost bombastic statements about the radical transitions in social, economic and environmental conditions that the government seeks to make. Further, the tone is not consensual, clearly representative of a wide range of viewpoints and regional perspectives in Canada. It is strident and ideological, a bold declaration that “progressive” values and highly interventionist approaches take primary place in the government’s thinking. The priorities are strikingly clear – the feminist agenda and the broader LGBTQ2’s gender goals, “reconciling” with indigenous people by giving them ever more funds and power, and transforming the Canadian economy towards a “green” version with renewable energy dominating and little role for the hydrocarbons industry. It is, in some senses, a declaration of victory over the more conventional goals and communities within the Canadian political system. One cannot help but be struck by the range of initiatives underway, many of which have largely escaped media attention in Canada. The spending commitments alone are eye-opening – $180 billion for infrastructure, of which $20 billion is for green infrastructure, $28.7 billion for public transit, $25.3 billion for social infrastructure, and $10.1 billion for trade and transportation infrastructure. The document expresses a profound belief that all this will increase Canada’s future prosperity, ignoring the fact that, apart from the trade and transportation investments there is no obvious reason why this should be so. In its endorsement of “progressive” goals, the document makes no reference to the groups apparently viewed as the villains and oppressors – especially Caucasian, heterosexual males; non-indigenous people; multi-generational Canadians; the oil and gas industry; and Canadian business generally. I wonder who is paying for all the programs. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"**Six boats carrying 159 people have been found by UK authorities as migrants continue to try to cross the English Channel.**
The Home Office released Tuesday's figures and said authorities in France prevented about 30 people making the journey on the same day.
Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said the criminals behind the crossings were breaking the law.
UK authorities were ""relentlessly"" going after those responsible, he said.
He said: ""We are working side by side with France to increase beach patrols and enhance surveillance to stop the crossings at source, breaking up the ruthless gangs who facilitate this activity, and locking up the people smugglers responsible.
""We are returning migrants who have no right to stay in the UK to safe countries with flights every week and will do whatever we can to make this route unviable.""
More than 7,915 people have crossed the Channel in more than 600 boats this year."
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019About the AuthorRobert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, a diplomat for 10 years prior to that. His complete biography can be read here. Executive SummaryCover image licensed from Shutterstock. Much of the public and media attention concerning measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada focuses on reducing automotive emissions. Almost every governmental announcement concerning a new climate regulation or tax celebrates this in terms of the “number of passenger vehicles per year taken off the roads”. The public dialogue and policy debate that surrounds these issues, however, are not based on an informed view of the facts or of the decisions that governments have been making. This paper may help to support the public debate.LINK TO FULL REPORT: THE 85 MILLION TONNE OBSESSION FinalAs context, in 2016 15.6 million Canadians commuted back and forth from home to work. After five decades of governmental efforts to discourage commuting by personal vehicle, the percentage of working Canadians commuting by car has fallen from 80.7 to 79.5 per cent. In other words, regardless of what government planners, transit commissions and environmentalists may prefer, the average citizen is voting for personal vehicles. Of the many measures governments have taken, four stand out in terms of cost: vehicle fuel efficiency regulations on new light duty vehicle sales; subsidies for the purchase and refueling of hybrid and electric vehicles; transit subsidies; and taxes on motor fuels. Canada and the United States have harmonized their light duty vehicle fuel efficiency regulations since they were first introduced in the late 1970’s. In 2008 and 2012, both countries agreed to a schedule of increasingly stringent increases in fuel efficiency that would raise the standard for passenger cars from 39.1 miles per U.S. gallon in 2017 to 55.3 miles per U.S. gallon in 2025 and for light duty trucks (and SUVs) from 29.5 mpg in 2017 to 39.3 mpg in 2025. In August, 2018, the Trump Administration announced that it planned to freeze the fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through to 2026. California has said it will sue to oppose these changes. In the face of these developments, the Trudeau government signed a cooperation agreement with California which, while not explicit, appears to signal that it will depart from Canada’s historic policy of harmonization with the U.S. federal government. The consequences of such a move cannot be fully assessed without a detailed analysis, but it could mean that in future Canadian auto manufacturers might be required to adopt emissions and fuel efficiency technologies that are more expensive than those that are required of the U.S. auto industry in general, affecting Canadian firms’ ability to compete. In April 2019 the Trudeau government announced targets for increasing the share of zero-emissions vehicles in Canada, rising to 100 per cent of new vehicle sales in 2040. It also announced that it would provide subsidies for the purchase of hybrids and electric vehicles ranging from $2,500 to $5,000 per vehicle. When added to the subsidies offered by British Columbia and Quebec, this could raise the combined federal-provincial subsidy to a high of $10,500 to $13,000 per vehicle, which equates to $350 to $433 per tonne of emissions avoided, many times the current ($20 per tonne) value of carbon emissions permits. U.S. studies show that as much as 70 per cent of EV sales would take place without subsidies, and that EVs are bought primarily by people with above-average incomes. In 2016, the Trudeau government announced Canada’s Long-Term Infrastructure Plan, which promises $180 billion in spending on infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2028. This includes $28.5 billion for public transit. Unfortunately, there is no source that can inform the Canadian public about how much is being spent on transit in total by federal, provincial and municipal governments, what this means for ridership or what this means for the amount and cost of emissions reductions. U.S. studies indicate that fares pay only one third of transit systems’ operating costs, and that the total governmental subsidy of transit capital and operating costs is about $1.17 per passenger mile. Canadian studies indicate that, in the unlikely case that it could be achieved, a doubling of commuters using transit would reduce GHG emissions by about 2.5 million tonnes per year. According to the analysis of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the national average motor gasoline price in 2018 was $1.35 per litre, 47 cents of which was tax. This is equivalent to a carbon tax of $192 per tonne. If one adds the carbon taxes scheduled to apply by 2022, the carbon tax equivalent of all gasoline taxes will be $235 per tonne. In 2017, passenger vehicles, including all cars, SUVs and pickup trucks, produced 85 million tonnes of GHGs. This was 11.9 per cent of the Canadian total. If Canada somehow could eliminate these uses altogether, it would take us only 42 per cent of the way to the 2030 emissions reduction target. As unlikely as even that is, it seems we cannot shake our public obsession with vehicle emissions, regardless of cost. Image licensed from Shutterstock.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



The earth has been growing gradually cooler for the last three decades. The trend shows no sign of reversing … yadda, yadda, yadda.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
As much of the USA experienced an abundance of the white stuff, CNN picked this as a good time to make an “end of snow” prediction.

Climate change is threatening winter sports’ very existence
By Derek Van Dam, CNN Meteorologist
Updated 1904 GMT (0304 HKT) February 29, 2020
(CNN)A warming planet has major ramifications on winter snowpack across the globe, including a long-term drying trend for many. That’s a concern for winter sports enthusiasts and communities that depend on snow throughout the year. 
Not many understand this better than the climate advocacy group known as Protect Our Winters (POW). The group is an organization of professional athletes and like-minded individuals fighting for policy to protect winter sports and mountain communities.
“Increased temperatures are melting away both my sport and my livelihood,” professional ski mountaineer and POW representative Caroline Gliech told the US Senate late last year.
This year has been a prime example of what is becoming more common. Snowfall has been abysmal in California this winter. The state-wide snowpack is running far below average to date and there is little relief in sight before the season ends. This is a stark comparison to last year when California was walloped with above-average snowfall and ended the season 175% of average by April 1.
It’s this variability that leaves many wondering what the long-term trends are indicating. If climate science holds true, this winter whiplash could put many out of business as the low-snow years mount.
What a difference a year makes! Left: 2019, Right: 2020. Sierra snow pack is below normal for this time of year, at about 58% statewide. Dry weather is expected to continue. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/yjxR5JceCp— NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) February 18, 2020

Climate catastrophists just can’t help themselves. Their models predict a hothouse world in their lifetimes, so they see every glitch or variation in conditions as evidence the great temperature acceleration has begun, and endlessly embarrass themselves with their wild “end of snow” predictions.

"**You don't expect to find a British pasty in a small corner of Virginia. So how did the Cornish delicacy wind up thousands of miles away across the ocean, asks Jonathan Turley.**
The famous Greek physician Hippocrates once said ""let food be thy medicine."" In a pandemic, that means comfort foods that transcend feelings of isolation and desolation.
For Anglophiles living near Washington, DC, there is an island of normalcy amidst the uncertainty of life under lockdown. A refuge where one can indulge in such quintessentially English delights as Cadbury's eggs, McVities digestive biscuits and, of course, the eponymous pasty.
Most Americans are unfamiliar with that Cornish delight. Indeed, you have to be careful to pronounce your love for ""PAST-eez"" rather than ""PAY-stees"" or your neighbours will think that you frequent strip joints.
But the flaky handheld meat pie is a staple of British cuisine, earning mentions in Shakespeare. The version we eat today was popularised in the 19th Century in Cornwall, in the southwest of England, amongst labourers who appreciated the portability of this filling lunchtime treat.
So how did the Pure Pasty shop make its way to Vienna, Virginia?
Founder Mike Burgess, 58, says he suffered something like a midlife crisis when he quit his job in IT in his 40s. But while most middle-aged men buy a sports car or take up surfing, Burgess took every dime he had and decided to open a pasty shop across the sea.
Born in Nantwich, Chester, Burgess had heard from his mates that they could not find a pasty in the States to save their soul. Seeing a demand without a supply, he set out to learn how to make the perfect pasty with the same focus as someone venturing on a spiritual journey.
Rather than going to an ashram, Burgess went to Cornwall to learn the essence of the pasty. He continued to work on his technique, even using a local pub in Kent as a laboratory for his culinary creations.
He moved to the United States in 2009 and a year later opened his own shop, with the help of another ex-pat, Nicola Willis-Jones. From Yorkshire, Willis-Jones had once cooked for the Queen as a member of the Air Force but had relocated to the US and was longing for English cuisine.
Shortly before he opened, she rang him and offered her services. She was hired on the spot and he credits her for helping him developing the recipes and for perfecting the crust.
Since then, ex-pats and displaced Brits have flocked to the little shop in Vienna to get their fix of pasties and other English groceries, from British back bacon to Balson's bangers to Branston's pickles.
But Burgess would not truly earn the title of ""perfect pasty"" until he returned to Cornwall to compete in the World Pasty Championship - the Olympics of pasties. In 2018, he shocked the pasty world by winning the top prize - the first for an American pasty shop.
His win, in the open savoury category for his barbeque chicken pasty, caused an uproar over his unconventional use of the ingredient pineapple.
Many denounced the notion as wholly non-traditional, if not heretical. Making matters worse, a local shop had jokingly entered a pastry in the shape of a pineapple. In the ensuring hoopla over the ""Hawaiian Pasty,"" people assumed that the pineapple pastry was his winning pasty. He received tongue-in-check messages of possible riots and even a threat by one pasty aficionado to secede from Cornwall.
Pineapples aside, Burgess won again in 2019 again in the open savoury category. In 2020, it grabbed the silver medal with a near perfect score of 97 out of 100 points.
These days, Burgess worries about his family and friends back in England. He wants his fellow Brits to hold firm and to know that they will come through this together on both sides of the ocean.
In the meantime, he is committed to keeping the pasties flowing as his way to remaining unbowed to this virus.
With the chronic shortage of toilet paper and sanitisers due to panic buying, Burgess will not allow hoarding of pasties. He limits purchases to just eight per customer for curbside pickup.
Locked in a home with one's children for a couple months, a supply of pasties is essential. Indeed, it should be listed under the Defense Production Act for pandemic necessities.
After all, pasties have long been featured in history's most trying times. When Falstaff seeks to comfort weary travellers in The Merry Wives of Windsor, what does he offer with the ale ""to drink down all unkindness""? Venison pasties, of course.
In our own unkind times, pasties serve the same Falstaffian function for all wanting a taste of normalcy.
As an American who fell in love with pasties and digestives when visiting England, The Pure Pasty converted my family faster than Beckham could bend it.
Returning with our precious load, the kids eagerly grabbed their favourite pasties from Leslie's Moroccan Lamb to Madie's Chicken Masala to Aidan's Chicken Cordon Bleu to Jack's Traditional Beef. We sat in reverential silence; each alone with his or her pasty panacea.
After all, there are some things that simply transcend words.
As Parolles stated in Shakespeare's All's Well That Ends Well, ""if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more"".

Simon Bridges must have sore balls from straddling the fence over man-made climate change. It has turned my stomach to see National MPs going along with the man-made climate change nonsense. National is supposed to be the practical party and the no-nonsense party. By straddling the climate change issue they are pleasing nobody.



Judith Collins, unlike National leader Simon Bridges, is not at all conflicted about how she will vote. She has stated that she will vote **against the Zero Carbon Bill** in its present form. In contrast to her decisive declaration, Simon Bridges has said that National’s position on the Bill was that “ **we have resolved not to resolve it** **yet**.” Instead of opposing the bill Bridges has written to the Prime Minister and James Shaw, offering to work with them to **establish an independent, non-political Climate Change Commission.**  




This kind of fence-straddling from Simon Bridges is dividing the National party along urban and rural lines. If National lose the rural vote by siding with Urban wets over the nonsense that is man-made climate change then they are in for a hiding. They will gain no extra urban vote by dancing to Jacinda Ardern’s Climate change tune. Currently, the National party leadership are all in the urban camp. The sole outlier firmly in the camp of the farmers and the Rural vote is Judith Collins.



The government has agreed to put the 2050 upper methane reduction target at 47 percent even though the Ministry of Primary industry proposed a 33% upper limit. Politik reports that ministry advice was **overruled by the PM, who wanted the higher number.** 47% is much higher than the 35% target wanted by climate change activists Generation Zero, which shows that our PM is more extreme than even youth activists!



Federated Farmers told the Select Committee that the economic, social and employment repercussions of the 2050 24-47% reduction target for methane were “eye-watering for farmers” and average dairy farmers’ **profits could be cut by up to 60%** and 12% of dairy farmers would be unable to meet their annual debt obligations by 2040.



  
My father-in-law, before he became president of the National party, went on a fact-finding mission to Germany for the party. This was between 1993 and 1996. He came back convinced that National should split into an urban party and a rural party. I think that idea’s time has come, because at the moment a conflicted National is pleasing no one and the farmers need a champion.

"**Burglars broke into a school kitchen and stole all its food, including four full large freezers.**
The raid at Gosfield School in Essex happened overnight on Friday.
It said it would no longer be able to feed the children of key workers, or its staff, because of the theft.
Among the items taken were four commercial freezers full of food, all the dry foods in the kitchen and the contents of the catering refrigerators, said the school.
It added that staff at the school near Halstead were ""incredibly saddened"".
Essex Police said it was investigating the burglary.
It happened after schools closed on government orders due to the coronavirus outbreak.
On its Facebook page, the school explained it would now be unable to feed the children of key workers who are still attending and staff who have agreed to run a ""skeleton operation"".
It said staff had been into the village to purchase food ""but with restrictions on what they are allowed to purchase this is not straightforward"".
Supermarkets have started to restrict sales of essential food and household items as a result of coronavirus stockpiling.
The school has asked children of key workers, as identified by the government, to take a packed lunch to school.
More than than 1,600 people have commented on the Facebook post to express their ""disgust"".
One person wrote: ""What a horrible thing to happen, so sorry for the school.""
Another said: ""Unbelievable... Whatever happened to 'pulling together'.""

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\---   
  
Nic Lewis and Judith Curry just published a blockbuster paper that pegs the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity—how much the earth’s average surface temperature is expected to rise in association with a doubling of the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide concentration—at 1.64°C (1.05°C to 4.05°C, 90% range), a value that is nearly half of the number underpinning all of President Obama’s executive actions under his Climate Action Plan.   
  
This finding will not stop the President and the EPA from imposing more limits on greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels. A wealth of similar findings have appeared in the scientific literature beginning in 2011 (see below) and they, too, have failed to dissuade him from his legacy mission.   
  
The publication of the Lewis and Curry paper, along with another by Ragnhild Skeie and colleagues, brings the number of recent low-sensitivity climate publications to 14, by 42 authors from around the world (this doesn’t count our 2002 paper on the topic, “Revised 21st Century Temperature Projections”). Most of these sensitivities are a good 40% below the average climate sensitivity of the models used by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).   
  
Lewis and Curry arrive at their lower equilibrium climate sensitivity estimate by using updated compilations of the earth’s observed temperature change, oceanic heat uptake, and the magnitude of human emissions, some of which should cause warming (e.g., greenhouse gases), while the others should cool (e.g., sulfate aerosols). They try to factor out “natural variability.” By comparing values of these parameters from the mid-19 century to now, they can estimate how much the earth warmed in association with human greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
The estimate is not perfect, as there are plenty of uncertainties, some of which may never be completely resolved. But, nevertheless, Lewis and Curry have generated a very robust observation-based estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity.   
  
For those interested in the technical details, and a much more thorough description of the research, author Nic Lewis takes you through the paper (here) has made a pre-print copy of the paper freely available (here).   
  
In the chart below, we’ve added the primary findings of Lewis and Curry as well as those of Skeie et al. to the collection of 12 other low-sensitivity papers published since 2010 that conclude that the best estimate for the earth’s climate sensitivity lies below the IPCC estimates. We’ve also included in our Figure both the IPCC’s subjective and model-based characteristics of the equilibrium climate sensitivity. For those wondering, there are very few recent papers arguing that the IPCC estimates are too low, and they all have to contend with the fact that, according to new Cato scholar Ross McKitrick, “the pause” in warming is actually 19 years in length. 







_Figure 1._ _Climate sensitivity estimates from new research beginning in 2011 (colored), compared with the assessed range given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the collection of climate models used in the IPCC AR5. The “likely” (greater than a 66% likelihood of occurrence)range in the IPCC Assessment is indicated by the gray bar. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95 percent confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The right-hand side of the IPCC AR5 range is actually the 90% upper bound (the IPCC does not actually state the value for the upper 95 percent confidence bound of their estimate)._ _Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best-matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing._

"Or “Droughts and Extreme Weather are Nothing New.”
by Dr Bill Johnson
Outpourings of climate bulldust over recent decades have been more alarming than changes in the climate.
Drought and above-average temperatures during recent El Niño-dominated years from 2001 to 2010 were deliberately and relentlessly marketed as global-warming. Driven incestuously by WWF and its Wentworth Group; green groups; Climate Commissioners; and a bunch of pretend-institutes, superlatives flew-up every greasy-pole out through talking-heads into the community’s ear.
Australians endured an endless chatter-based marketing campaign involving the ABC, CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology that intertwined CO2; the hot/critical decade; Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) “health”; and the carbon tax; grinding them into our national psyche. Science was reorganised with rivers of tax-payers cash enticing once-proud universities to lend brand to the cause. Every hot/cold/dry/wet day, clamouring professors popped out of disused broom-cupboards across the land, waving models and “new reports”. It was an overt scientifically-disingenuous beat-up.

"**Burger King has launched its first plant-based burger in the UK - but it is not suitable for vegans and vegetarians.**
The soy-based version of its Whopper burger is cooked on the same grill as meat burgers.
The fast food chain says the Rebel Whopper is aimed at those who want to cut meat consumption.
But a spokesperson for the Vegan Society called the launch a ""missed opportunity"".
Burger King says that the burger ""patty"" itself is plant-based, but because of how it is cooked it will not be labelled as suitable for vegans or vegetarians.
It will also be served with mayonnaise, unless the customer asks otherwise.
Katie Evans, marketing director for the chain, said the burger was aimed at ""flexitarians"". She added it wanted the burger to replicate the ""flame-grilled taste"" as closely as possible.
Burger King did confirm, though, that its vegetarian bean burger and its vegetarian option on the children's menu are cooked separately.
Sam Calvert, head of communications at the Vegan Society, said that not making the new burger fully vegan ""seems a missed opportunity"".
She added that vegan mayonnaise was ""readily available"" and used by other well-known chains, which would also make the burger suitable for some religious groups that avoid eating certain animals and eggs.
The Rebel Whopper launch on Monday also saw a backlash on social media. One Twitter user called it ""a case of big corporations jumping on the bandwagon of a trend"".
Lifestyle blogger Donna Wishart criticised Burger King for failing to deliver ""actual vegan products"", when other fast food companies do so.
However, Toni Vernelli, international head of communications and marketing at Veganuary, dismissed claims that Burger King was trying to ""capitalise on the vegan pound"".
She said that ""increasing the availability of plant-based options"" was the best way to encourage the reduction of meat consumption.
""Don't let perfection be the enemy of good,"" she said.
The Vegan Society describes veganism as a ""lifestyle"" that avoids all animal foods such as meat, dairy, eggs and honey, as well as animal-based products like leather.
According to the latest research by the Vegan Society, conducted in 2018, there are about 600,000 vegans in Great Britain.
Flexitarianism, part-time vegetarianism or veganism, is becoming more popular.
In 2020, at least 300,000 people pledged to go vegan for the first month of the year, under the Veganuary campaign, the organisation said.
Interest in vegan and vegetarian products shows no sign of slowing down. This January, other well-known food chains have launched meat substitutions for popular products.
Bakery Greggs announced a vegan ""steak bake"" after the success of its vegan sausage roll last year, while coffee chain Costa said it would offer a ""vegan ham and cheese"" toastie."

This open letter is a response to that appeal.The law professors err on six specific points. I will show that:Carbon dioxide is not pollution.The purchase and sale of oil, natural gas and coal constitute free transactions made by sellers and buyers, who are well informed about the implications of their decisions.The products sold and purchased have major societal benefits that far exceed the alleged adverse effects.In fact, forcing fossil fuel producers to cease selling their goods and services would, given the lack of alternatives, have major adverse effects on society and the economy.Canadian environmental law does not support the actions they propose.Actions taken to harm Canadian fossil fuel companies would have at most a negligible effect on the global environment.Energy illiteracy must not be enshrined in law.Image licensed from Shutterstock.  Climate Change Policy – A Threat to CanadaShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

“Letting go of the phantastic mathematical objects and achievables of model- land can lead to more relevant information on the real world and thus better-informed decision- making.” – Erica Thompson and Lenny Smith
The title and motivation for this post comes from a new paper by Erica Thompson and Lenny Smith, Escape from Model-Land. Excerpts from the paper:
“Model-land is a hypothetical world (Figure 1) in which mathematical simulations are evaluated against other mathematical simulations, mathematical models against other (or the same) mathematical model, everything is well-posed and models (and their imperfections) are known perfectly.”
“It also promotes a seductive, fairy-tale state of mind in which optimising a simulation invariably reflects desirable pathways in the real world. Decision-support in model-land implies taking the output of model simulations at face value (perhaps using some form of statistical processing to account for blatant inconsistencies), and then interpreting frequencies in model-land to represent probabilities in the real-world.”
“It is comfortable for researchers to remain in model-land as far as possible, since within model-land everything is well-defined, our statistical methods are all valid, and we can prove and utilise theorems. Exploring the furthest reaches of model-land in fact is a very productive career strategy, since it is limited only by the available computational resource.”
“For what we term “climate-like” tasks, the realms of sophisticated statistical processing which variously “identify the best model”, “calibrate the parameters of the model”, “form a probability distribution from the ensemble”, “calculate the size of the discrepancy” etc., are castles in the air built on a single assumption which is known to be incorrect: that the model is perfect. These mathematical “phantastic objects”, are great works of logic but their outcomes are relevant only in model-land until a direct assertion is made that their underlying assumptions hold “well enough”; that they are shown to be adequate for purpose, not merely today’s best available model. Until the outcome is known, the ultimate arbiter must be expert judgment, as a model is always blind to things it does not contain and thus may experience Big Surprises.”
The Hawkmoth Effect
The essential, and largely unrecognized, problem with global climate models is model structural uncertainty/error, which is referred to by Thompson and Smith as the Hawkmoth Effect. A poster by Thompson and Smith provides a concise description of the Hawkmoth effect:
“The term “butterfly effect”, coined by Ed Lorenz, has been surprisingly successful as a device for communication of one aspect of nonlinear dynamics, namely, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (dynamical instability), and has even made its way into popular culture. The problem is easily solved using probabilistic forecasts.

“A non-technical summary of the Hawkmoth Effect is that “you can be arbitrarily close to the correct equations, but still not be close to the correct solutions”.
“Due to the Hawkmoth Effect, it is possible that even a good approximation to the equations of the climate system may not give output which accurately reflects the future climate.”
From their (2019) paper:
“It is sometimes suggested that if a model is only slightly wrong, then its outputs will correspondingly be only slightly wrong. The Butterfly Effect revealed that in deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems, a “slightly wrong” initial condition can yield wildly wrong outputs. The Hawkmoth Effect implies that when the mathematical structure of the model is only “slightly wrong”, then even the best formulated probability forecasts will be wildly wrong in time. These results from pure mathematics hold consequences not only for the aims of prediction but also for model development and calibration, ensemble interpretation and for the formation of initial condition ensembles.”
“Naïvely, we might hope that by making incremental improvements to the “realism” of a model (more accurate representations, greater details of processes, finer spatial or temporal resolution, etc.) we would also see incremental improvement in the outputs. Regarding the realism of short- term trajectories, this may well be true. It is not expected to be true in terms of probability forecasts. The nonlinear compound effects of any given small tweak to the model structure are so great that calibration becomes a very computationally-intensive task and the marginal performance benefits of additional subroutines or processes may be zero or even negative. In plainer terms, adding detail to the model can make it less accurate, less useful.”
JC note: This effect relates to the controversy surrounding the very high values of ECS in the latest CMIP6 global model simulations (see section 5 in What’s the worst case?), which is largely related to incorporation of more sophisticated parameterizations of cloud-aerosol interactions.
Fitness for purpose
From the Thompson and Smith paper:
“How good is a model before it is good enough to support a particular decision – i.e., adequate for the intended purpose (Parker, 2009)? This of course depends on the decision as well as on the model, and is particularly relevant when the decision to take no action at this time could carry a very high cost. When the justification of the research is to inform some real-world time-sensitive decision, merely employing the best available model can undermine (and has undermined) the notion of the science-based support of decision making, when limitations like those above are not spelt out clearly.”
“Is the model used simply the “best available” at the present time, or is it arguably adequate for the specific purpose of interest? How would adequacy for purpose be assessed, and what would it look like? Are you working with a weather-like task, where adequacy for purpose can more or less be quantified, or a climate-like task, where relevant forecasts cannot be evaluated fully? How do we evaluate models: against real-world variables, or against a contrived index, or against other models? Or are they primarily evaluated by means of their epistemic or physical foundations? Or, one step further, are they primarily explanatory models for insight and understanding rather than quantitative forecast machines? Does the model in fact assist with human understanding of the system, or is it so complex that it becomes a prosthesis of understanding in itself?”
“Using expert judgment, informed by the realism of simulations of the past, to define the expected relationship of model with reality and critically, to be very clear on the known limitations of today’s models and the likelihood of solving them in the near term, for the questions of interest.”
My report Climate Models for Laypersons, addressed the issue of fitness for purpose of global climate models for attribution of 20th century global warming:
“Evidence that the climate models are not fit for the purpose of identifying with high confidence the relative proportions of natural and human causes to the 20th century warming is as follows:

substantial uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)
the inability of GCMs to simulate the magnitude and phasing of natural internal variability on decadal-to-century timescales
the use of 20th century observations in calibrating/tuning the GCMs
the failure of climate models to provide a consistent explanation of the early 20th century warming and the mid-century cooling.”

From my article in the CLIVAR Newsletter:
“Assessing the adequacy of climate models for the purpose of predicting future climate is particularly difficult and arguably impossible. It is often assumed that if climate models reproduce current and past climates reasonably well, then we can have confidence in future predictions. However, empirical accuracy, to a substantial degree, may be due to tuning rather than to the model structural form. Further, the model may lack representations of processes and feedbacks that would significantly influence future climate change. Therefore, reliably reproducing past and present climate is not a sufficient condition for a model to be adequate for long-term projections, particularly for high-forcing scenarios that are well outside those previously observed in the instrumental record.”
With regards to 21st century climate model projections, Thompson and Smith make the following statement:
“An example: the most recent IPCC climate change assessment uses an expert judgment that there is only approximately a 2/3 chance that the actual outcome of global average temperatures in 2100 will fall into the central 90% confidence interval generated by climate models. Again, this is precisely the information needed for high-quality decision support: a model-based forecast, completed by a statement of its own limitations (the Probability of a “Big Surprise”).”
While the above statement is mostly correct, the IPCC does not provide a model-based forecast, since they admittedly ignore future volcanic and solar variability.
Personally I think that the situation with regards to 21st century climate projections is much worse. From Climate Models for Laypersons:
“The IPCC’s projections of 21st century climate change explicitly assume that carbon dioxide is the control knob for global climate. The CMIP climate model projections of the 21st century climate used by the IPCC are not convincing as predictions because of:

failure to predict the warming slowdown in the early 21st century
inability to simulate the patterns and timing of multidecadal ocean oscillations
lack of account for future solar variations and solar indirect effects on climate
neglect of the possibility of volcanic eruptions that are more active than the relatively quiet 20th century
apparent oversensitivity to increases in greenhouse gases”

With regards to fitness for purpose of global/regional climate models for climate adaptation decision making, there are two particularly relevant articles:

The Myopia of Imperfect Climate Models, by Frigg, Smith and Stainforth
On the use and misuse of climate change projections in international development by Nissan et al.

“When a long-term view genuinely is relevant to decision making, much of the information available is not fit for purpose. Climate model projections are able to capture many aspects of the climate system and so can be relied upon to guide mitigation plans and broad adaptation strategies, but the use of these models to guide local, practical adaptation actions is unwarranted. Climate models are unable to represent future conditions at the degree of spatial, temporal, and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information.”
Pathways out of model land and back to reality
Thompson and Smith provide the following criteria for identifying whether you are stuck in model land with a model that is not adequate for purpose:
“You may be living in model-land if you…

try to optimize anything regarding the future;
believe that decision-relevant probabilities can be extracted from models;
believe that there are precise parameter values to be found;
refuse to believe in anything that has not been seen in the model;
think that learning more will reduce the uncertainty in a forecast;
explicitly or implicitly set the Probability of a Big Surprise to zero; that there is nothing your model cannot simulate;
want “one model to rule them all”;
treat any failure, no matter how large, as a call for further extension to the existing modelling strategy.”

“Where we rely more on expert judgment, it is likely that models with not-too-much complexity will be the most intuitive and informative, and reflect their own limitations most clearly.”
“In escaping from model-land do we discard models completely: rather, we aim to use them more effectively. The choice is not between model-land or nothing. Instead, models and simulations are used to the furthest extent that confidence in their utility can be established, either by quantitative out-of-sample performance assessment or by well-founded critical expert judgment.”
Thompson and Smith focus on the desire to provide probabilistic forecasts to support real-world decision making, while at the same time providing some sense of uncertainty/confidence about these probabilities. IMO once you start talking about the ‘probability of the probabilities,’ then you’ve lost the plot in terms of anything meaningful for decision making.
Academic climate economists seem to want probabilities (with or without any meaningful confidence in them), and also some who are in the insurance sector and the broader financial sector. Decision makers that I work with seem less interested in probabilities. Those in the financial sector want a very large number of scenarios (including plausible worst case) and are less interested in actual probabilities of weather/climate outcomes. In non financial sectors, they mostly want a ‘best guess’ with a range of uncertainty (nominally the ‘very likely’ range); this is to assess to what degree they should be concerned about local climate change relative to other concerns.
As argued in my paper Climate Change: What’s the Worst Case?, model inadequacy and an inadequate number of simulations in the ensemble preclude producing unique or meaningful probability distributions from the frequency of model outcomes of future climate. I further argued that statistical creation of ‘fat tails’ from limited information about a distribution can produce very misleading information. I argued for creating a possibility distribution of possible scenarios, that can be created in a variety of ways (including global climate models), with a ‘necessity’ function describing the level and type of justification for the scenario.
Expert judgment is unavoidable in dealing with projections of future climates, but expert judgment on model adequacy for purpose is arguably more associated with model ‘comfort’ than with any rigorous assessment (see my previous post Culture of building confidence in climate models .)
The ‘experts’ are currently stymied by the latest round of CMIP6 climate model simulations, where about half of them (so far) have equilibrium climate sensitivity values exceeding 4.7C – well outside the bounds of long-established likely range of 1.5-4.5C.   It will be very interesting to see how this plays out – do you toss out the climate model simulations, or the long-standing range of ECS values that is supported by multiple lines of evidence?
Application of expert judgment to assess the plausibility of future scenario outcomes, rather than assessing the plausibility of climate model adequacy, is arguably more useful.
Alternative scenario generation methods
An earlier paper by Smith and Stern (2011) argues that there is value in scientific speculation on policy-relevant aspects of plausible, high-impact scenarios, even though we can neither model them realistically nor provide a precise estimate of their probability. A surprise occurs if a possibility that had not even been articulated becomes true. Efforts to avoid surprises begin with ensuring there has been a fully imaginative consideration of possible future outcomes.
For examples of alternative scenario generation that are of particular relevance to regional climatic change (which is exceptionally poorly simulated by climate models), see these previous posts:

Broadening the portfolio of climate information 
Climate Change: What’s the worst case? 

Historical and paleoclimate data, statistical forecast models, climate dynamics considerations and simple climate models can provide the basis for alternative scenario generation.
Given the level and types of uncertainty, efforts to bound the plausible range of future scenarios makes more sense for decision making than assessing the probability of probabilities, and statistically manufacturing ‘fat tails.’
Further this approach is a heck of lot less expensive than endless enhancements to climate models to be run on the world’s most powerful supercomputers that don’t address the fundamental structural problems related to the nonlinear interactions of two chaotic fluids.
Kudos to Thompson and Smith for their insightful paper and drawing attention to this issue.

"**My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here, Somi Ifeh from Lagos in Nigeria, records her spending over a week and shares tips for saving.**
Somi is 26 and works for a PR firm in Lagos. A lot of Somi's money ends up being spent on food, books... and more food.
She recently went head-to-head with another blogger, Maura Hannon in Switzerland, on World Business Report \- have a listen here to hear Somi talk about what she spent her money on this week.
I just wrapped up an event in the early hours and haven't really had much rest. Mind you, my healthy eating begins today. My sister bought me a book of recipes which I will use this week.
My spending this week is going to be healthy. The afang [vegetable] soup cost me about **â¦1,000** to make, and transport cost me **â¦850** to and from work. The afang soup is good for my diet.
**Total spend: â¦1,850 ($5; Â£3.90)**
Today I spent my money only on transportation which cost me **â¦800**. Oh wait, I bought roasted plantain for **â¦100**.
I prepped my meals at home. For breakfast I had two boiled eggs, for lunch I had chicken stir-fry, and for dinner I had roasted plantain because I had to run out of the office before dinner.
I regretted running out because I was hungry and peckish most of the night, and I had forgotten to buy the tiger nuts for snacking.
I loaded my phone with **â¦750** credit and I used **â¦500** to buy 2GB of mobile data today.
**Total spend:** **â¦1,650 ($4.50; Â£3.50)**
This is the same as Tuesday, I am still healthy eating, so the food was the same. Black and green tea at 11:00, chicken stir fry for lunch, afang soup for dinner.
I left the office at 17:00 to see a friend. I spent **â¦400** on getting to the office, **â¦500** on getting to my friend's house and I took an Uber taxi home, not sure how much it cost because I didn't order it.
**Total spend: â¦900 ($2.50; Â£1.90)**
We are having an assessment in my office today. I was hoping for a salary increase - which might be a nice bonus as 2019 was a crazy year.
Thankfully it came through - I got my pay rise.
I ran late today so couldn't prep any meals. And, I am really hungry today as it is the last day of my healthy eating.
I joined my cousin in her Uber to the Island today, so my transport to the office was **â¦200** as opposed to the usual **â¦400.**
I spent **â¦100** on bread and another **â¦100** on a biscuit. And ate chicken stir-fry for lunch. I had nothing for dinner. I spent **â¦400** on the journey home, met my aunt at the gate and escorted her to my other aunt's house. I spent **â¦800** on credit today.
**Total spend: â¦1,600 ($4.40; Â£3.40)**
I spent most of the day at home. I have a tonne of books in my house. I buy historical romances. When I've finished with them I exchange them.
I stepped out to sell some novels I had read to my customer, I spent **â¦250** on biking to and fro. I made a measly **â¦1,000** on 30 books I had initially bought for **â¦300** per book.
I collected **â¦1,000** from my cousin because I didn't have cash at home.
I fixed my nails for **â¦500** , and I bought two pairs of pants for **â¦500**.
I stepped out for my aunt's office party, I had to go home to pick up a selfie stick, so I ended up spending **â¦550** on transport instead of **â¦250** but my aunt paid for the Uber home.
Money made: **â¦2,000**
**Total spend: â¦1,800 ($4.95; Â£3.80)**
I got paid my December salary today, and had a logistics reimbursement [when you pay for a cab to a meeting out of your own account you can claim money back from the work account] of **â¦5,000** sent to me.
I went out with my aunt to Victoria Island and from there went to eat with a friend. I had two scoops of gelato for **â¦1,700** and KFC Streetwise: Two pieces of chicken with fries for **â¦2,000**.
We take turns to cook and tomorrow is my turn, so I withdrew **â¦7,000** from the bank, joined my friend's Uber to the market/my tailor's to pick up my dress (made from a traditional material called aso-ebi, worn on special occasions - I have a wedding tomorrow). I bought dried fish, pepper, chicken, turkey and coconut powder for the coconut rice tomorrow. This cost me **â¦4,750** including transport. I bought credit of **â¦3,000** , to buy data for a week (6GB) - with my phone and my love of Netflix it's best to buy in moderation.
**Total spend: I spent â¦11,450 ($31.50; Â£24.30) today, whew that's a lot.**
A friend is getting married today. I followed my family to church for the 08:00 mass. I am a Catholic. I stayed in church for meetings till 14:00, I took a keke [tricycle taxi] to my friend's house in the Government Reserved Area. I had a make-up artist come to do my make up for the wedding, this cost me **â¦5,000.**
I took Bolt taxi to the venue [Bolt seemed cheaper than Uber that evening] but it cost **â¦,1600** \- way more than the estimate which was **â¦800 - 1000.** I reported the ride but still no response. I took an Uber home and it cost me **â¦1,500**.
**Total spend: â¦8,100 ($22.30; Â£17.17)**
In a week I spent **â¦27,350 ($75.30; Â£58)** and earned **â¦2,000 ($5.50; Â£4.24)**. I spend more than I earn so I think I need two jobs. In our city we need a side hustle.
I only spent on transport and food so I didn't have any big expenses.
I don't go out much Monday to Friday. I go to work and come back home. It's just the kind of person I am.
**Total weekly spend:** **â¦27,350 ($75.30; Â£58)**
We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. We're particularly keen to hear from disabled people about the extra cash your disability costs you. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (World) Facebook group, or if you live in the UK, please join our My Money (UK) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you."
"  Donald J. Trump dismissed Meryl Streep as “a Hillary lover” early Monday morning after the actress, in a speech at the Golden Globes award ceremony, denounced him as a bully who disrespected and humiliated others. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said he had not seen Ms. Streep’s remarks or other parts of the Globes ceremony, which were broadcast on NBC, but he added that he was “not surprised” that he had come under attack from “liberal movie people. ” [ Read Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech ] The Globes were the last   Hollywood event before Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, a transfer of power that many in the entertainment industry have bemoaned. While   comments at the Globes were relatively restrained, Ms. Streep, one of the most outspoken progressives in the film world, mounted a powerful critique of Mr. Trump’s abilities as a performer, complimenting in a backhanded way a style of showmanship that she all but called insidious. “There was one performance this year that stunned me  —   it sank its hooks in my heart,” Ms. Streep said. “Not because it was good there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. “It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter,” she said, referring to a speech by Mr. Trump in 2015 when he shuddered and flailed his arms, seeming to mock a disabled reporter for The New York Times. “It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can’t get it out of my head, because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life. ” Mr. Trump, as he has done many times before, grew heated in the interview as he flatly denied that he had intended to make fun of the Times reporter, Serge F. Kovaleski. “I was never mocking anyone,” Mr. Trump said. “I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story,” arguing that the reporter had been trying to back away from an article he wrote in September 2001 about the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and elsewhere that month. “People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing,” he said in the interview. “And remember, Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep’s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of his opponent, Mrs. Clinton. Later Monday morning, Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets, called Ms. Streep “one of the most   actresses in Hollywood,” and “a Hillary flunky who lost big. ” He also reiterated his argument that he had not mocked the reporter “but simply showed him ‘groveling. ’” Ms. Streep’s artful denunciation of Mr. Trump  —   whom she never mentioned by name  —   drew applause from many other actors at the Globes ceremony, but also attacks online from the  ’s allies, like Sean Hannity, as well as some Republicans, like Meghan McCain, who are critical of Mr. Trump but see Hollywood liberals as only emboldening his supporters. Ms. Streep’s speech did not seem intended to win people over  —   she spoke dismissively of football and mixed martial arts at one point  —   but rather to voice frustration and anger before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” she said in her remarks. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. ” Mr. Trump said that, Ms. Streep and her allies aside, he was confident that celebrities and others would turn out in strong numbers for his inauguration. “We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps   turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars,” Mr. Trump said. “All the dress shops are sold out in Washington. It’s hard to find a great dress for this inauguration. ”"
"

National party



Official advice given to Climate Change Minister James Shaw has once again been ignored, showing that he only takes advice when it suits his narrative, National’s Climate Change spokesperson Todd Muller says.



“The Climate Change Chief Executives Board advised that to give credibility and certainty, areas such as the methane target should be given to an expert group such as the Climate Change Commission. They also noted an indicative range of a **22-35** per cent methane reduction.



“The Minister chose to ignore this and included an onerous target of up to **47** per cent in the Climate Change Amendment Act Bill. As has become the norm for this Government, its work was shipped off its 250 working groups, only to be ignored.



“The Minister has also dismissed reports from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment who likewise **advised a methane target much lower than what the Minister has proposed.**



“I have supported James Shaw establishing independent advisory groups on climate change, but this effort becomes pointless if he only listens to advice that suits a political purpose.



“National has disagreed with the Government’s proposed agricultural methane target in the Climate Change Bill, and suggested that this matter be put to the new Climate Change Commission the Minister is establishing.



“Targets for 2050 can seem abstract, but when the economic implications are as severe as the $300 billion that has been projected in the Regulatory Impact Statement, it’s important that decisions are well thought out and backed by solid scientific reasoning.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn 2019,  more than 440 scientific papers were published that cast doubt on the position that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate’s fundamental control knob…or that otherwise serve to question the efficacy of climate models or the related “consensus” positions commonly endorsed by policymakers and mainstream media sources.

Over 440 scientific papers published in 2019 affirm the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, emphasizing that climate science is not settled.
More specifically, the papers in this compilation support these four main skeptical positions — categorized here as N(1) – N(4) — which question the climate alarm popularized in today’s headlines.
N(1) Natural mechanisms play well more than a negligible role (as claimed by the IPCC) in the net changes in the climate system, which includes temperature variations, precipitation patterns, weather events, etc., and the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on climatic changes are less pronounced than currently imagined.
N(2) The warming/sea levels/glacier and sea ice retreat/hurricane and drought intensities…experienced during the modern era are neither unprecedented or remarkable, nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability.

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




N(3) The computer climate models are neither reliable or consistently accurate, the uncertainty and error ranges are irreducible, and projections of future climate states (i.e., an intensification of the hydrological cycle) are not supported by observations and/or are little more than speculation.
N(4) Current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment, whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields, lower mortality with warming).
In sharp contrast to the above, the corresponding “consensus” positions that these papers do not support are:
A(1) Close to or over 100% (110%) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, leaving natural attribution at something close to 0%.
RealClimate.org: “The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
A(2) Modern warming, glacier and sea ice recession, sea level rise, drought and hurricane intensities…are all occurring at unprecedentedly high and rapid rates, and the effects are globally synchronous (not just regional)…and thus dangerous consequences to the global biosphere and human civilizations loom in the near future as a consequence of anthropogenic influences.
A(3) The climate models are reliable and accurate, and the scientific understanding of the effects of both natural forcing factors (solar activity, clouds, water vapor, etc.) and CO2 concentration changes on climate is “settled enough”, which means that “the time for debate has ended”.
A(4) The proposed solutions to mitigate the dangerous consequences described in N(4) – namely, wind and solar expansion – are safe, effective, and environmentally-friendly.
To reiterate, the 440+ papers compiled in 2019 support the N(1)-N(4) positions, and they undermine or at least do not support the “consensus”A(1)-A(4) positions.  These papers do not do more than that.   In other words, it is not accurate to claim these papers prove that anthropogenic global warming (AGW) positions are invalid, or that AGW claims have now been “debunked”.

" LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS: 90 ITALIAN CLIMATE SCIENTISTS SIGN NEW PETITIONWe must ‘’listen to the scientists’’ the climate alarmists preach.Well in Italy, over 90 Scientists have recently signed a petition, titled; ‘’Climate, a counter-current petition’’.To the President of the RepublicTo the President of the SenateTo the President of the Chamber of DeputiesTo the President of the CouncilPETITION ON GLOBAL ANTHROPIC HEATING (Anthropogenic Global Warming, human-caused global warming)The undersigned, citizens and scientists, send a warm invitation to political leaders to adopt environmental protection policies consistent with scientific knowledge.In particular, it is urgent to combat pollution where it occurs, according to the indications of the best science. In this regard, the delay with which the wealth of knowledge made available by the world of research is used to reduce the anthropogenic pollutant emissions widely present in both continental and marine environmental systems is deplorable.But we must be aware that CARBON DIOXIDE IS ITSELF NOT A POLLUTANT. On the contrary, it is indispensable for life on our planet.In recent decades, a thesis has spread that the heating of the Earth’s surface of around 0.9°C observed from 1850 onwards would be anomalous and caused exclusively by human activities, in particular by the emission of CO2 from the use of fossil fuels in the atmosphere.This is the thesis of anthropic global warming [Anthropogenic Global Warming] promoted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations, whose consequences would be environmental changes so serious as to fear enormous damage in an imminent future, unless drastic and costly mitigation measures do not are immediately adopted.In this regard, many nations of the world have joined programs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and are pressed, even by a throbbing propaganda, to adopt increasingly demanding programs whose implementation, which involves heavy burdens on the economies of the individual member states, it would depend on climate control and, therefore, the “salvation” of the planet.However, the anthropic origin of global warming IS AN UNPROVEN HYPOTHESIS, deduced only from some climate models, that is complex computer programs, called General Circulation Models .On the contrary, the scientific literature has increasingly highlighted the existence of a natural climatic variability that the models are not able to reproduce.This natural variability explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850.The anthropic responsibility for climate change observed in the last century is therefore UNJUSTIFIABLY EXAGGERATED and catastrophic predictions ARE NOT REALISTIC.The climate is the most complex system on our planet, so it needs to be addressed with methods that are adequate and consistent with its level of complexity.Climate simulation models do not reproduce the observed natural variability of the climate and, in particular, do not reconstruct the warm periods of the last 10,000 years. These were repeated about every thousand years and include the well-known Medieval Warm Period , the Hot Roman Period, and generally warm periods during the Optimal Holocene period .These PERIODS OF THE PAST HAVE ALSO BEEN WARMER THAN THE PRESENT PERIOD, despite the CO2 concentration being lower than the current, while they are related to the millennial cycles of solar activity. These effects are not reproduced by the models.It should be remembered that the heating observed since 1900 has actually started in the 1700s, ie at the minimum of the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the last 10,000 years (corresponding to the millennial minimum of solar activity that astrophysicists call Maunder Minimal Solar ). Since then, solar activity, following its millennial cycle, has increased by heating the earth’s surface.Furthermore, the models fail to reproduce the known climatic oscillations of about 60 years.These were responsible, for example, for a warming period (1850-1880) followed by a cooling period (1880-1910), a heating (1910-40), a cooling (1940-70) and a a new warming period (1970-2000) similar to that observed 60 years earlier.The following years (2000-2019) saw the increase not predicted by the models of about 0.2 ° C  [two tenths of a degree] per decade, but a substantial climatic stability that was sporadically interrupted by the rapid natural oscillations of the equatorial Pacific ocean, known as the El Nino Southern Oscillations , like the one that led to temporary warming between 2015 and 2016.The media also claim that extreme events, such as hurricanes and cyclones, have increased alarmingly. Conversely, these events, like many climate systems, have been modulated since the aforementioned 60-year cycle.For example, if we consider the official data from 1880 on tropical Atlantic cyclones that hit North America, they appear to have a strong 60-year oscillation, correlated with the Atlantic Ocean’s thermal oscillation called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation .The peaks observed per decade are compatible with each other in the years 1880-90, 1940-50 and 1995-2005. From 2005 to 2015 the number of cyclones decreased precisely following the aforementioned cycle. Thus, in the period 1880-2015, between number of cyclones (which oscillates) and CO 2 (which increases monotonically) there is no correlation.The climate system is not yet sufficiently understood. Although it is true that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, according to the IPCC itself the climate sensitivity to its increase in the atmosphere is still extremely uncertain.It is estimated that a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2, from around 300 ppm pre-industrial to 600 ppm, can raise the average temperature of the planet from a minimum of 1 ° C to a maximum of 5 ° C.This uncertainty is enormous.In any case, many recent studies based on experimental data estimate that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is CONSIDERABLY LOWER than that estimated by the IPCC models.Then, it is scientifically unrealistic to attribute to humans the responsibility for warming observed from the past century to today. The advanced alarmist forecasts, therefore, are not credible, since they are based on models whose results contradict the experimental data.All the evidence suggests that these MODELS OVERESTIMATE the anthropic contribution and underestimate the natural climatic variability, especially that induced by the sun, the moon, and ocean oscillations.Finally, the media release the message according to which, with regard to the human causeof current climate change, there would be an almost unanimous consensus among scientists that the scientific debate would be closed.However, first of all we must be aware that the scientific method dictates that the facts, and not the number of adherents, make a conjecture a consolidated scientific theory .In any case, the same alleged consensus DOES NOT EXIST. In fact, there is a remarkable variability of opinions among specialists – climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, astrophysicists – many of whom recognize an important natural contribution to global warming observed from the pre-industrial period and even from the post-war period to today.There have also been petitions signed by thousands of scientists who have expressed dissent with the conjecture of anthropic global warming.These include the one promoted in 2007 by the physicist F. Seitz, former president of the American National Academy of Sciences, and the one promoted by the Non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), whose 2009 report concludes that “Nature does not the activity of Man governs the climate ”.In conclusion, given the CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE THAT FOSSIL FUELS have for the energy supply of humanity, we suggest that they do not adhere to policies of uncritical reduction of the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere with THE ILLUSORY PRETENSE OF GOVERNING THE CLIMATE.http://www.opinione.it/…/redazione_riscaldamento-globale-…/…PROMOTING COMMITTEE:Uberto Crescenti, Emeritus Professor of Applied Geology, University G.

"The intelligence agencies’ report on the Russian intervention in the American presidential election portrays it as just one piece of an     propaganda campaign. But it was a campaign made enormously more powerful by the tools of the cyberage: private emails pilfered by hackers, an internet that reaches into most American homes, social media to promote its revelations and smear enemies. What most Americans may have seen as a   effort  —   brazen meddling by Russia in the very core of American democracy  —   was, the report says, only part of a   information war that involves not just shadowy hackers and   websites, but also more conventional news outlets, including the thriving Russian television network RT. The election intervention to damage Hillary Clinton and lift Donald J. Trump was the latest fusillade in a campaign that has gone on under the radar for years. For the three agencies that produced the report  —   the C. I. A. the F. B. I. and the National Security Agency  —   this is a   moment: They have just told their new boss that he was elected with the vigorous, multifaceted help of an adversary, the thuggish autocrat who rules Russia. “Putin and the Russian government aspired to help   Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” the report says, in unusually blunt and sweeping language. Perhaps most arresting is the assessment that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, sees the election attack as payback  —   not offense, but defense. He has borne a serious grudge against Mrs. Clinton, who he believes denigrated him when she was secretary of state and encouraged the   protests in Moscow that erupted against him in 2011. Mr. Putin, the report says, sees the hidden hand of the United States in the leaking of the Panama Papers, files stolen from a law firm that exposed the wealth of his closest associates, secreted in offshore accounts. He even blames the United States for the exposure  —   carried out mainly by international sports authorities  —   of Russian athletes for their widespread use of   drugs. “From the Russian perspective, this is punching back,” said Christopher Porter, a former C. I. A. officer who now studies cyberattacks at the firm FireEye. “We may not think that’s fair or justified, but that’s the way they see it. ” Mr. Porter said Mr. Putin had made no secret of his view that the United States, by promoting democracy in countries like Ukraine and Georgia, had interfered in Russia’s backyard and was trying to undermine its power. What is missing from the public report is what many Americans most eagerly anticipated: hard evidence to back up the agencies’ claims that the Russian government engineered the election attack. That is a significant omission: Mr. Trump has been expressing skepticism for months that Russia was to blame, variously wondering whether it might have been China, or a   guy, or a guy from New Jersey. There is only a whisper of dissent in the report  —   the eavesdroppers of the N. S. A. believe with only “moderate confidence” that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump, while their colleagues at the C. I. A. and the F. B. I. have “high confidence. ” While most of Congress and much of the public appears to accept the agencies’ findings, Mr. Trump’s prominent doubts, accompanied at times by scorn for the agencies’ competence, has rallied a diverse array of skeptics on the right and the left. Under the circumstances, many in Washington expected the agencies to make a strong public case to erase any uncertainty. Instead, the message from the agencies essentially amounts to “trust us. ” There is no discussion of the forensics used to recognize the handiwork of known hacking groups, no mention of intercepted communications between the Kremlin and the hackers, no hint of spies reporting from inside Moscow’s propaganda machinery. At the top of every page of the report is a disclaimer that acknowledges what is missing: “This report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment, but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign. ” It offers an obvious reason for leaving out the details, declaring that including “the precise bases for its assessments” would “reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future. ” The absence of any proof is especially surprising in light of promises on Thursday from the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. that he would “push the envelope” to try to make more information public. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama had directed officials to “make as much of it public as they possibly can. ” That will not be enough for many, as the initial reaction showed. While some welcomed the scope of the report, many others were disappointed. “This is big: CIA, NSA  FBI publish perhaps the most   intelligence community assessment in US history,” Thomas Rid, a professor at King’s College London and an expert on cyberwarfare, wrote on Twitter. But Susan Hennessey, a former intelligence agency lawyer who is now the managing editor of the online journal Lawfare, wrote: “The unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention. ” Though the unclassified report is 25 pages long, counting the covers and several blank pages, the core analysis runs just five pages. That is less than the   “annex” devoted to RT America, the television network. It is a description of the broadcaster from an intelligence report written in 2012, years before the   hacking took place. The agencies “have taken an   look at the broader Russian strategy,” said Mr. Porter, the former C. I. A. officer. The detailed description of RT’s tactics, though years old, he added, was included because they fit that strategy. Mr. Trump may have been persuaded by his classified briefing on Friday on the Russian attack, which included everything that the unclassified report leaves out, even if the statement he issued afterward seemed lukewarm. But this report is unlikely to change the minds of skeptics who, like the   remember the intelligence agencies’ faulty assessments on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and fear being misled again."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDuring last week’s record-setting European heat wave, Germany’s previous record of 40.3C was impressively shattered by the measurement station located at the northwest city of Lingen, near the Dutch border, some 50 kilometers from where I live. The German DWD weather service and media loved it!
Controversial siting
Yet, controversy now swirls about the new record setting measurement since it has come to light that the measurement is fraught with some considerable siting issues.
As the photo published by T-online here shows, the station is located right near a DWD office building, is shielded from the wind by grown trees and is located not far from a public swimming pool.
Meteorologist Michael Theusner told t-online.de: “The monthly average of the daily highs in Lingen has been deviating more and more upwards from the average of the highs in Lower Saxony since 2010.” The station has become increasingly shielded and thus tends to heat up more.
Swiss veteran meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann wrote the extra heat possibly could be heating the station by up to another 3 degrees!
DWD accepts overheated reading
Germany’s DWD national weather service has even confirmed that the station’s siting is no longer adequate and that a move to a new site had been already long planned. But despite the acknowledged poor siting, the DWD went ahead and confirmed the reading as valid. The 42.6°C reading now stands as Germany’s new all-time recorded high temperature, no matter how questionable the reading may be.
Valid? How does Lingen compare to other temperature stations located nearby? I did a check.
Fifty kilometers to the east of Lingen where I live (Quakenbrück), my home thermometer showed a high of 38.2°C. That’s unofficial, of course, but it made the Lingen reading look suspicious. So I decided to compare Lingen to the other official stations nearby to see if their readings were as hot as Lingen’s.
The surrounding readings do indeed confirm meteorologist Kachelmann’s gut suspicion. Lingen readings are suspiciously 2 – 3C hotter than those of its neighboring stations.
What follows is a chart depicting the readings recorded by the Lingen station over the past past week. The DWD itself stated that the mercury in fact reached 42.6°C on Thursday (Do. 25.07)!

Chart: wetter24.de
Now looking at the Nordhorn station, located some 20 kilometers away, here the mercury climbed to 40.9°C, which is 1.7°C below the Lingen reading:

Chart: wetter24.de
At the Meppen station, also located some 20 km away to the north of Lingen, the mercury reached 39.2°C, a far cry (3.4°C) from Lingen’s maximum reading:

Chart: wetter24.de
At the military base in Diepholz, some 65 km to the east, the high on Thursday reached 38.7 degrees, i.e. almost 4°C below the Lingen reading!

Chart: wetter24.
In Bersenbrück, some 40 km to the east, according to wetterkontor.de, the mercury rose to 39.6°C,  which is 3°C below Lingen’s record reading.
Looking at two other stations nearby, we see that Emsdetten recorded 40.6°C, and Ahaus saw 39.5°C, both significantly below Lingen’s recorded measurement.
More than 2°C hotter than surrounding stations!
A summary of all the temperature readings recorded at Lingen compared to those of 6 nearby stations for the past 5 days, July 23 – July 27:

On every single day, Lingen handily beat its neighbors by at times large margins. Did the climate aim some sort of giant heat ray at Lingen?
2.6°C hotter than adjacent stations
On the record-setting date of Thursday, July 25, 2019, the mean of the 6 neighboring stations listed in the table was an eyebrow-raising 2.6°C below the Lingen reading. All the stations cited around the Lingen station all share very similar topographical characteristics, and all are located on the north German flatlands, and thus comparable.
No doubt the reading at Lingen is accurate. But it looks like the siting of the Lingen station is causing overheated conditions. The DWD should think twice before accepting Lingen’s dubious 42.6°C reading as a valid new record and allowing it to flow into the statistics.
In the contest to be the hottest city in Germany, Lingen cheated.

"**Food safety inspectors are to visit an Edinburgh shopping mall following an infestation of pigeons in its food court.**
The inspectors will meet managers at Waverley Mall in Princes Street to assess the mall's pigeon control plans.
As many as eight birds have been seen in the court at one time with some even being seen flying at table height.
Waverly Mall officials said they had only received two complaints in 18 months.
Shopkeepers in the centre told BBC Scotland the ""vermin"" live and roost inside the mall.
They said a flock of pigeons entered the building last winter when work to widen its entrances meant there were no doors for a while.
Shop owners said mall managers had made many attempts to remove the pigeons humanely, to no avail.
It is understood plans to use high-frequency technology, which neighbouring Waverley Station used, was mothballed following complaints from people saying it affected their hearing aids.
Managers have asked pest control to investigate."
"**McDonald's is to join a growing list of fast food restaurants selling fully vegan meals in the UK.**
McDonald's said its Veggie Dippers meal - including vegan nuggets served with chips and a soft drink - will launch in the UK on 2 January.
It follows the likes of KFC and Greggs in introducing vegan options.
Animal rights activists Peta said a vegan meal was ""the very definition of a happy meal"".
However, it said it would continue to campaign for McDonald's to bring its McVegan burger, which is available in Finland and Sweden, to the UK.
McDonald's new dippers are made of rice, red peppers, tomato pesto and split peas, fried in breadcrumbs.
The product will be fried separately from products containing meat, a spokesman said, and served with McDonald's UK chips, which are vegan-friendly.
The move comes as restaurants are capitalising on increasing demand from UK customers for vegetarian and vegan food options.
McDonald's said in the last 12 months it had seen an ""80% uplift"" in customers ordering vegetarian options.
The firm is the latest fast food chain to offer vegan products. Famously, Greggs launched a vegan sausage roll at the beginning of the year which it credited with boosting sales.
Other chains with vegan options include Frankie & Benny's, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Nando's, Papa John's and Pizza Hut.
The Humane Society International UK, which campaigns for animal welfare, said McDonald's move would help veganism go mainstream.
""When big global brands like McDonalds start serving up vegan food, it can have a huge meat-reduction impact overall,"" director Claire Bass told the BBC.
Peta director Elisa Allen said: ""A vegan meal - one that doesn't require killing - is the very definition of a happy meal.
""We'll continue to encourage consumers to vote with their wallets and choose vegan to help spare pigs, cows, and chickens a short, miserable life and a violent death.""
A survey by Mintel in 2018 found people giving a variety of reasons for eating less meat, including for its perceived health benefits, to try to lose weight, and because of animal welfare and environmental concerns."
"**The competition watchdog has said it may be forced to launch an in-depth investigation into Amazon's plans to invest in food delivery firm Deliveroo.**
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was worried the tie-up could increase delivery prices.
The regulator gave the two firms five days to address its concerns about competition in the food delivery space.
If they fail to impress the watchdog, the $575m (Â£437m) deal could ultimately be blocked.
The CMA said that the investment may prevent Amazon from launching its own food delivery operation, a move which could reduce prices for customers in the future.
""Millions of people in the UK use online food platforms for takeaways, and more than ever are making use of similar services for the same-day delivery of groceries,"" said Andrea Gomes da Silva, executive director of the CMA.
""There are relatively few players in these markets, so we're concerned that Amazon having this kind of influence over Deliveroo could dampen the emerging competition between the two businesses.""
She said that if the deal were to go ahead in its current form then there was a ""real risk"" that customers, restaurants and grocers would face higher prices and lower quality services.
In a statement, Deliveroo said it was confident it could persuade the CMA that Amazon's investment would ""add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers"".
Amazon said the investment would help Deliveroo develop new products and remain competitive.
It is not the first time Amazon has tried to enter the food delivery market in the UK.
The online retailer briefly ran its own delivery venture, Amazon Restaurants UK, which it started in 2016 but closed just two years later.
It was previously reported to have made approaches to buy Deliveroo outright. Uber also reportedly had talks with Deliveroo regarding an interest in buying it.
Deliveroo founder and chief executive Will Shu came up with the idea for the firm after he moved from New York to London as a banking analyst. He was working long hours and was frustrated by the fact so few restaurants delivered, a service widely available in the US.
In the firm's early days, Mr Shu delivered all the food himself on a motorbike, while Greg Orlowski, his co-founder who has since left the business, developed the booking technology from his home in the US. Mr Shu still claims to get on his bike once a week to deliver an order to customers in London, as a way of staying in touch with riders.
Deliveroo has grown quickly - last year it doubled the number of towns and cities it operates in, helping sales to surge by 72%.
However, losses deepened to Â£232m in 2018, from Â£199m a year earlier as the company splashed out Â£18m on technology and Â£10m on free insurance for its riders.
Sales grew to Â£476m in the year to December 2018, up from Â£277m in 2017.
Deliveroo operates in 11 markets outside the UK including Australia, France, Germany and Hong Kong."

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.



From [The Independent, July 9, 2009](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/just-96-months-to-save-world-says-prince-charles-1738049.html)



Time to roll out a a royal – stepping well outside his role.



Capitalism and consumerism have brought the world to the brink of economic and environmental collapse, the Prince of Wales has warned in a grandstand speech which set out his concerns for the future of the planet.



The heir to the throne told an audience of industrialists and environmentalists at St James’s Palace last night that he had calculated that we have just 96 months left to save the world.



And in a searing indictment on capitalist society, Charles said we can no longer afford consumerism and that the “age of convenience” was over.



The Prince, who has spoken passionately about the environment before, said that **If the world failed to heed his warnings** then we all faced the “nightmare that for so many of us now looms on the horizon”.



He concluded with:



If we don’t face up to this, then Nature, the biggest bank of all, could go bust. And no amount of quantitative easing will revive it.



We are now 123 months later and I have just checked outside my window – the world still seems to be there, unsaved.



And the climate reality deniers still want us to start the ‘quantitative easing’ of our CO2 emissions.



Current score: Experts 0 – Reality 22.

China has a widespread network of temperature stations used by NASA.
Today we plot the NASA mean annual V4 unadjusted temperature data since 1997 for 18 stations situated in the northwest China Shinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, shown in the map below (blue dots):

The plotted NASA data appear as follows:



 
No significant trends

google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The data show that 10 of 18 stations in this very rural region show zero warming or cooling! This defies the claims that climate change is global and unprecedented. The reality is that nothing unusual is happening.
333-year temperature reconstruction: warmer 250 years ago
That China is not warming is of course something that is not really new. Recently there was a study featuring a 333-year temperature reconstruction in the western mountains of China.

No warming there as well in well over 300 years.
7-10°C warmer 9000 years ago
Moreover, two recent papers show that Northeastern China was 7-10°C warmer 9000 years ago – and 1.7°C warmer in the 1800s! For example Liu et al, 2019:

The Week That Was: 2019-09-28 (September 28, 2019)

Quote of the Week – “Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn’t fit in with the core belief.”— Frantz Fanon, French West Indian psychiatrist, political philosopher, revolutionary, [H/t William Readdy]

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

UN Children’s Climate Circus: The conditions for most of the world’s population are improving significantly. Although wars are ongoing, there is no major world war, killing millions. There are no major famines, other than those created by government policies. World grain reserves are full, and production is increasing greatly in tropical countries, which were once considered too hot, with too thin, too acidic soils to be major grain producers. There is still much to do, particularly in Africa, South America and Asia, but, based on the World Bank. the numbers of people living in extreme poverty are declining significantly, with major reductions in Asia. So based on mathematical computer models, the UN and many international organizations are declaring we are in a “climate crisis” – based on projections of the future that are not validated by physical evidence today.
This week, the UN hosted a circus, celebrating fears of carbon dioxide (CO2)-caused climate change featuring children and the fears and horrors their parents and teachers have taught them. Fears of monsters lurking in the dark have been used for generations to control the behavior of children. For example, Inuit artists carved the monsters their parents claimed would await them, if they wandered too far from the camp and the safety of the fire. Particularly, in the winter the fears were real, but the monsters were not. Similarly, Grimm’s Fairy Tales were a collection of folk tales told to children to have them behave.
Given that carbon-based fuels are vital for modern civilization, it is unfortunate that these tales are told to and taken seriously by children. That children believe them, is not a surprise. Children are very gullible to well told stories evoking fears. The tragedy is that the grown-ups believe the children who have been repeatedly told the tale of “climate crisis.”
According to the University of Rochester Medical Center, over the past 25 years great progress has been made in understanding the development of the human brain as one matures. Functional MRIs measuring blood flow in the brain have demonstrated the changes in the way information is processed in the brain as one matures in adolescence, from teenage, to adult. The center of thinking slowly changes from the amygdala, center of instinctive reaction, emotion, to the prefrontal cortex, the center for reasoned judgement with full change about the age of 25. Many parents have been frustrated when they asked their teenager why the teenager did something stupid and heard the reply “it seemed like a good idea at the time”. This is common and has little to do with one’s intelligence. It has to do with mental maturity. The size of the prefrontal cortex is the major distinction between the human brain and that of other primates. It is sad to witness “climate crisis” advocates manipulating children, who naturally respond to fear and cannot yet resist reasonably, for their purposes.
As tragic as some of the child pronouncements were, it is disappointing to realize that the UN and the “climate crisis” promoters must stoop so low to mobilize support for their weakly supported ideas. On this subject, the popular press has lost all reasoned judgement. According to reports, the poster child of the movement and 15 others filed a formal complaint to the UN that Brazil, Germany, France and others had violated the Convention on the Rights of the Child by failing to take sufficiently bold measures to reduce carbon emissions. Germany and France have been among the most ardent promoters of the “climate crisis.” The formal complaint angered representatives of these governments. Did the handlers of the children go too far?
In reviewing some of the documents on the Convention, TWTW found no reference to the right to a stable climate. But this is just another example of the farce the UN’s insistence on a “climate crisis” has become.

*******************
A Fluid Issue: On his web site, No Tricks Zone, P. Gosselin has drawn attention to a short book by Japanese climate modeler Mototaka Nakamura, author of about 20 published papers on fluid dynamics. A new short book is written in both English and Japanese is available in Kindle. Australian reporter Tony Thomas, who has followed the climate issue for years, reviews the book, emphasizing that the certainty claimed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers is hollow.
Among other important changing phenomena, the climate system is largely made up of two fluids in dynamic motion, the oceans and the atmosphere, and we simply do not know enough about fluid dynamics to make long-term predictions about the interactions of these fluids. According to Nakamura the climate models are useful tools for academic purposes, but useless for prediction. As quoted by Thomas, Nakamura writes:
“These models completely lack some critically important climate processes and feedbacks and represent some other critically important climate processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to the extent that makes these models totally useless for any meaningful climate prediction.
“I myself used to use climate simulation models for scientific studies, not for predictions, and learned about their problems and limitations in the process.”
Nakamura and his colleagues tried to repair the errors:
“…so, I know the workings of these models very well … For better or worse I have more or less lost interest in the climate science and am not thrilled to spend so much of my time and energy in this kind of writing beyond the point that satisfies my own sense of obligation to the US and Japanese taxpayers who financially supported my higher education and spontaneous and free research activity. So please expect this to be the only writing of this sort coming from me.
“I am confident that some honest and courageous, true climate scientists will continue to publicly point out the fraudulent claims made by the mainstream climate science community in English. I regret to say this, but I am also confident that docile and/or incompetent Japanese climate researchers will remain silent until the ’mainstream climate science community’ changes its tone, if ever.”
Thomas writes some of the gross model simplifications are:
· # Ignorance about large and small-scale ocean dynamics.
· # A complete lack of meaningful representations of aerosol changes that generate clouds.
· # Lack of understanding of drivers of ice-albedo (reflectivity) feedbacks: “Without a reasonably accurate representation, it is impossible to make any meaningful predictions of climate variations and changes in the middle and high latitudes and thus the entire planet.”
· # Inability to deal with water vapor elements.
· # Arbitrary “tunings” (fudges) of key parameters that are not understood.
As Richard Lindzen has stated for years, the models fail to capture changes in clouds including changing cloud area and that the sizes of clouds are too small for grid scale modeling.
Nakamura’s work reinforces what many, including Lindzen, have stated. But it is refreshing to see that a modeler who spent years trying to model the climate system recognizes how unsuccessful this 40 plus year effort has been. As will be discussed in future TWTWs there is a way to understand the influence of additional atmospheric carbon dioxide on the climate without resorting to modeling turbulent, dynamic fluids, which cannot produce reasonable results for prediction.

Number of the Week: 30% fewer labor hours: Promoters of the Green New Deal have been promising thousands of new green jobs. Apparently, members of the US United Auto Workers who went on strike are not impressed by the promise of electric automobiles. Sales of today’s electric autos require huge subsidies which, under current US laws, phase out after a production limit is reached. Unless there are dramatic technological breakthroughs,, which are yet to materialize, electric automobiles will be significantly more costly than vehicles with internal combustion engines, resulting in fewer sales and the weakening of the industry, resulting in fewer jobs. An additional issue is providing charging stations for electric vehicles. Who pays for them? Who powers them?
Further, according to the CEO of Volkswagen, electric cars have fewer moving parts, and production requires about 30% fewer labor-hours, resulting in fewer jobs. Globally the loss of these jobs will be partially offset by increases in mining and material processing jobs in lithium extracted in Argentina, Zimbabwe, Chile, China and Australia, and in cobalt extraction in the Democratic Republic of Congo. United Auto Workers will not be impressed if advocates of the Green New Deal include these jobs as promised green jobs. Further, what will generate the electricity to power these electric vehicles? See Article # 2.

Suppressing Scientific Inquiry 
How to Evaluate the Evidence of Contrarians – Scientifically
By Jennifer Marohasy, Her Blog, Sep 21, 2019
https://jennifermarohasy.com/2019/09/how-to-evaluate-the-evidence-of-contrarians-scientifically/
“…Misha Ketchell who is the editor of the influential academic publication The Conversation is quoted claiming to care so much about the evidence that the opinions of ‘sceptics’ must be excluded.”
“But this begs the question: how do we define scepticism, and on what basis do we discount the opinion of a so-called sceptic?
“If their opinions are at complete odds with the evidence: then wouldn’t it be more useful to show this? To use them, and their wrong claims, to explain the truth within the theory of human-caused global warming?”
“Science is a method, science is never settled. We must therefore always be open-minded, tolerant and ready to be proven wrong. But history will eventually show that it is Misha Ketchell who is wrong and that this editor is not using a reasonable, or in any way evidence-based, criteria for deciding what should be published. This is so very wrong and so very harmful to science, democracy and the capacity of other opinion leaders and academics to evaluate the evidence which is so necessary if they are to get to the truth in such matters as climate change.”

“I believe that this saga, as well as showing how ineffective journal peer review tends to be in spotting problematic issues in papers, illustrates the need for a much closer involvement of statisticians in climate science research.

1. A Climate Change for Lawsuits
Will the Supreme Court leave it to juries to decide contested public issues?
By William McGurn, WSJ, Sep 23, 2019
https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-climate-change-for-lawsuits-11569279287?mod=hp_opin_pos_2
TWTW Summary: The journalist writes:
“When National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr. was alive, the American Civil Liberties Union was a frequent target of his barbs. Once he even devoted an episode of ‘‘Firing Line” to a debate on the proposition ‘‘Resolved: The ACLU is full of baloney.’‘
“So give the ACLU credit for rising above policy differences. When a combative climatologist, Penn State’s Michael Mann, filed a defamation lawsuit in 2012 against National Review, Mark Steyn, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Rand Simberg, the conservative magazine found itself fighting alongside the left-leaning civil-liberties outfit.
“District of Columbia courts denied National Review’s motion to dismiss the case under the local anti-Slapp law, meant to thwart lawsuits aimed at silencing advocates on issues of public concern. The ACLU filed two friend-of-the-court briefs supporting the magazine’s appeals. One argued that the statements at issue are ‘‘constitutionally protected opinion and fair comment.’‘ (News Corp, this newspaper’s owner, joined another brief on National Review’s behalf, filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.)
“Thus far, alas, the courts have found largely in Mr. Mann’s favor, most recently in March. If the ruling by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is allowed to stand, parties will have an incentive to sue their adversaries and ask juries to settle what are essentially differences of opinion.”
An exception to this is the Canadian Courts which have found in favor of Tim Ball because Mr. Mann failed to produce the physical evidence supporting his claims.
The only hope now is that the Supreme Court—which considers National Review’s petition Oct. 1—will hear the case. The defendants say the statements in question were ‘‘a subjective opinion about a matter of scientific or political controversy,” protected by the First Amendment. Mr. Mann says they were false factual assertions. The D.C. judges say it’s up to a jury to distinguish fact from opinion.
Mr. Mann is famous in global-warming circles as the originator of the ‘‘hockey stick” graph. The graph charts the Earth’s temperatures since the year 1000, showing a slow, steady decline that turned sharply upward in the 20th century. Mr. Mann’s critics have questioned both his statistical methods and the proxies he used to estimate medieval surface temperatures.
“In an inflammatory 2012 CEI blog post, Mr. Simberg likened Mr. Mann to a notorious Penn State figure: ‘‘Mann could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data in the service of politicized science that could have dire economic consequences for the nation and planet.” Mr. Steyn quoted Mr. Simberg’s post on National Review’s website. Mr. Mann sued, saying he was being accused of ‘‘academic fraud.” He noted that academic and governmental investigations had cleared him of scientific wrongdoing.”
A previous Penn State investigation had cleared Mr Sandusky as well.
“The legal issue hinges on whether what Mr. Simberg said is subjective opinion that should be decided in public debate, as NR contends, or a factual assertion that a jury could find false and defamatory, as Mr. Mann claims. By sending the case to a jury, the D.C. Court of Appeals has rewarded Mr. Mann’s attempt to use the courts to settle the science and silence the criticism. That sets a dangerous precedent.
“In some senses the Mann suit may represent the perfect storm for litigation because so many consider climate science beyond question. The opinion of the appellate court, for example, carries the whiff of a religious authority rendering final judgment—the idea being that university faculties and other authorities have spoken so debate must be closed.
“There’s also the venue. This lawsuit didn’t go through the federal courts but through D.C.’s equivalent of state courts, where judges and juries probably aren’t the friendliest to conservatives. With so many publications, think tanks and activists keeping offices in the nation’s capital, it isn’t hard to see how Washington could quickly become the venue for similar lawsuits.”
This distinction is important because the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is not the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is frequently called the second most powerful court in the country, after the Supreme Court.
“The larger point is that while so-called climate deniers might be the first defendants, they are unlikely to be the last. If the D.C. ruling stands, National Review asks in its petition to the high court, what’s to prevent, say, Charles Koch from suing Greenpeace for accusing him of having funded a ‘‘junk study . . . loaded with lies and misrepresentations of actual climate change science”? Or Steve Bannon from founding a deep-pocketed organization to sue Trump opponents and then shopping for a venue where a friendly jury might agree that an over-the-top opinion is a defamatory statement of fact?
‘‘’The only way to protect free speech for our allies is to protect it for our adversaries,’ says Art Spitzer, legal director for the ACLU of D.C. ’Today it’s unacceptable to deny climate change, but yesterday it was unacceptable to deny that homosexuality was sinful, and tomorrow it may be unacceptable to deny that robots are better parents than humans. Society can’t progress unless people are free to express and consider heretical ideas, because there’s no way to predict which heretical ideas will be tomorrow’s truths.’”
The views of people are not the same as physical evidence.

2. Endangered Green Auto Workers
The striking union figures out that electric cars will cost jobs.
Editorial, WSJ, Sep 23, 2019
https://www.wsj.com/articles/endangered-green-auto-workers-11569280762
TWTW Summary: The editorial states:
“Democratic presidential candidates have promised that they know how to create millions of green jobs to replace the ones they plan to kill in fossil-fuels production, but it seems that not even their friends at the United Auto Workers believe them. This is one reason that auto workers at GM are striking.
“Auto makers around the world are pumping billions of dollars into electric-car production to comply with government mandates. Some CEOs including GM’s Mary Barra believe electric cars will become more popular as batteries improve and decline in cost. But EVs make up only 2% of U.S. auto sales despite state and federal subsidies that can exceed $10,000 per car.
“The economic risks are clear even to the UAW, which published a paper this spring warning that electric cars could cause thousands of job losses because they require fewer parts and less labor. An electric powertrain for a Chevy Bolt has 80% fewer moving parts compared to an internal combustion engine, but it is about three times as expensive.
“Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess has said that ‘building an electric car involves some 30% less effort than one powered by an [internal combustion engine]. That means we will need to make job cuts.’ GM will have to do likewise to compete. According to the paper, Ford has told investors ‘the product simplification that comes from EVs’ can lead to ‘a 30% reduction in labor hours per unit compared to ICE production.’”
The editorial continues with a discussion of how electric cars will crimp sales and profits, Further, it concludes with:
“Auto makers will also have to cut labor costs as electric cars crimp profits. The UAW says that 
China leads the world in lithium-ion battery production. Most lithium is extracted in Argentina, Zimbabwe, Chile, China and Australia while about 60% of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where kids earn $1 to $2 per day, according to the UAW. Environmentalists have opposed lithium mining in the U.S.
“One of the myths of the climate warriors is that remaking the global economy to purge fossil fuels is a free lunch. Someone will pay, as the auto workers have figured out.”

Bjorn Lomberg writes on Facebook:
Oops, remember that viral sled-on-water picture showing “our ongoing climate catastrophe” (CNN)?
Turns out it is entirely normal, happened in the 1800s, and will probably happen *less* with higher temps.
But Al Gore wants permission to use it in his slideshow. 

In the article Lomborg cites, it says:
Spring in Greenland interpreted as climate change: “This is completely normal”
CNN has presented a photo as evidence of the devastating impact of a warming planet, but that is not necessarily what the photo shows. Scientists say this is a typical and damaging climate doomsday story. 
Sometimes a picture speaks more than a thousand words. Sometimes the picture merely speaks what the viewer wants to hear. Over the past week, a photo of a dog sled moving through melt water in a fjord near Thule in north-west Greenland went global.
 Sometimes a picture speaks more than a thousand words. Sometimes it deceives. Over the past week, a photo of a dog sled moving through melt water in a fjord near Thule in north-west Greenland went global as supposed evidence of climate change. The photo was taken by Steffen M. Olsen, a PhD researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). Foto: Asger Ladefoged 
The picture was taken by a scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) and appears ominous. As if the ice is melting fast under the feet of the dogs and might at any moment crack and pull the sled down into the deep water. As if the very foundation of humanity is melting before the camera.
The photo has been shared by CNN, the BBC and several of the world’s leading papers, and even the former U.S. Vice President and one-time presidential candidate Al Gore, who joined the fight against climate change in 2001, has asked the DMI for permission to use the picture in his efforts to convince the world that action is urgently needed to prevent a looming climate disaster.

"**Stu Deeley was named winner of the 2019 series of MasterChef: The Professionals and joked it would take ""footballers' wages"" to make him leave Birmingham.**
He described the competition as ""life-changing"" and praised the support he received from family and mentors.
""I can't believe it,"" the 28-year-old said. ""I've never won anything in my life so to win this is such an unreal feeling. I'm so, so happy.""
He will open a restaurant in the city's Jewellery Quarter in the spring.
Deeley, who is head chef at The Wilderness, said he initially thought the show ""was not for me because I don't like the limelight"".
But he was inspired to apply following the birth of his son Jack, now two, as he wanted to inspire him to take on challenges.
""It's the biggest thing I could do,"" he said. ""I just went for it.
""It's been so good, it's such a good programme. It's a TV show but it's focused on the cooking.""
He praised his fellow finalists, Exose Grant Lopo-Ndinga, 22, from Manchester, and Olivia Burt, 24, from Worcestershire, as ""so good"".
Deeley said his highlight of the competition was cooking for the chefs with 26 Michelin stars between them, adding: ""To do that and cook for them and get such high praise is just mind-blowing.""
The winning chef, who had a successful spell at Birmingham's Michelin-starred Simpsons, took inspiration from his home city to create fusions based on the multicultural cuisine he enjoyed as a child.
He previously said he has not travelled much but Birmingham brought the flavours of the world to him.
His Birmingham-inspired dishes included a faggots and peas dish and a curried monkfish homage to the balti.
And he wowed during the chef's table episode, where fellow Brummie Glynn Purnell told him he ""smashed it"" with his plate of suckling pig belly with black pudding and langoustine.
Judge Gregg Wallace said: ""I love Stu's food. Here's a lad who has grown up in Birmingham and has fallen in love with the flavours that surrounded him.""
Reiterating how important the city is to him, Deeley added: ""It would take footballers' wages to make me leave Birmingham. I wouldn't leave Birmingham for anything.
""This is where I grew up, this is where I live, this is where everything is for me."""
"**Food packs should display how much exercise a person would need to take to burn off the calories contained in the product, UK researchers say.**
Appreciating it would take four hours to walk off the calories in a pizza or 22 minutes to run off a chocolate bar creates an awareness of the energy cost of food, they say.
The labels would help people indulge less, exploratory studies suggest.
The aim is to encourage healthier eating habits to fight obesity.
According to the researchers from Loughborough University, who looked at 14 studies, this type of labelling could cut about 200 calories from a person's daily average intake.
This may not sound like much but, they say in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, it would have an impact on obesity levels across the country.
More than two-thirds of adults in the UK are overweight or obese.
Lead researcher Prof Amanda Daley said: ""We are interested in different ways of getting the public to make good decisions about what they eat and also trying to get the public more physically active.""
And labelling food with ""exercise calories"" made it easier for people to understand what they were eating and nudge them into making better choices.
Prof Daley said many people would be shocked to realise how much physical exercise would be required to burn off calories from certain snacks and treats.
""We know that the public routinely underestimate the number of calories that are in foods,"" she said.
""So if you buy a chocolate muffin and it contains 500 calories, for example, then that's about 50 minutes of running.
""This definitely isn't about dieting.
""It's about educating the public that when you consume foods, there is an energy cost, so that they can think, 'Do I really want to spend two hours burning off that chocolate cake? Is the chocolate cake really worth it?'""
The Royal Society for Public Health would like to see the labelling introduced as soon as possible and says it is a move many consumers would also welcome.
It says: ""This type of labelling really does put an individual's calorie consumption in the context of energy expenditure and knowing how out of kilter we can be partly explains the record levels of obesity we face.
""Small changes can make a big overall difference to calorie consumption, and ultimately weight gain.""
Prof Daley hopes a large food chain or company will be willing to try the new labels on their products so the system can be given a ""real life"" trial.
But concerns have been raised about labelling food in this way.
Tom Quinn, from the eating disorder charity Beat, said: ""Although we recognise the importance of reducing obesity, labelling food in this way risks being incredibly triggering for those suffering from or vulnerable to eating disorders.
""We know that many people with eating disorders struggle with excessive exercising, so being told exactly how much exercise it would take to burn off particular foods risks exacerbating their symptoms."""

**The East Anglia emails are just the tip of the iceberg. I should know.**



Few people understand the real significance of Climategate, the now‐​famous hacking of emails from the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit (CRU). Most see the contents as demonstrating some arbitrary manipulating of various climate data sources in order to fit preconceived hypotheses (true), or as stonewalling and requesting colleagues to destroy emails to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the face of potential or actual Freedom of Information requests (also true).



But there’s something much, much worse going on — a silencing of climate scientists, akin to filtering what goes in the bible, that will have consequences for public policy, including the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recent categorization of carbon dioxide as a “pollutant.”





[O]ur refereed literature has been inestimably damaged, and reputations have been trashed.



The bible I’m referring to, of course, is the refereed scientific literature. It’s our canon, and it’s all we have really had to go on in climate science (until the Internet has so rudely interrupted). When scientists make putative compendia of that literature, such as is done by the U.N. climate change panel every six years, the writers assume that the peer‐​reviewed literature is a true and unbiased sample of the state of climate science.



That can no longer be the case. The alliance of scientists at East Anglia, Penn State and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (in Boulder, Colo.) has done its best to bias it.



A refereed journal, _Climate Research_ , published two particular papers that offended Michael Mann of Penn State and Tom Wigley of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. One of the papers, published in 2003 by Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas (of the Harvard‐​Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), was a meta‐​analysis of dozens of “paleoclimate” studies that extended back 1,000 years. They concluded that 20th‐​century temperatures could not confidently be considered to be warmer than those indicated at the beginning of the last millennium.



In fact, that period, known as the “Medieval Warm Period” (MWP), was generally considered warmer than the 20th century in climate textbooks and climate compendia, including those in the 1990s from the IPCC.



Then, in 1999, Mr. Mann published his famous “hockey stick” article in _Geophysical Research Letters_ (GRL), which, through the magic of multivariate statistics and questionable data weighting, wiped out both the Medieval Warm Period and the subsequent “Little Ice Age” (a cold period from the late 16th century to the mid‐​19th century), leaving only the 20th‐​century warming as an anomaly of note.



Messrs. Mann and Wigley also didn’t like a paper I published in _Climate Research_ in 2002. It said human activity was warming surface temperatures, and that this was consistent with the mathematical form (but not the size) of projections from computer models. Why? The magnitude of the warming in CRU’s own data was not as great as in the models, so therefore the models merely were a bit enthusiastic about the effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide.



Mr. Mann called upon his colleagues to try and put _Climate Research_ out of business. “Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal,” he wrote in one of the emails. “We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board.”



After Messrs. Jones and Mann threatened a boycott of publications and reviews, half the editorial board of _Climate Research_ resigned. People who didn’t toe Messrs. Wigley, Mann and Jones’s line began to experience increasing difficulty in publishing their results.



This happened to me and to the University of Alabama’s Roy Spencer, who also hypothesized that global warming is likely to be modest. Others surely stopped trying, tiring of summary rejections of good work by editors scared of the mob. Sallie Baliunas, for example, has disappeared from the scientific scene.



 _GRL_ is a very popular refereed journal. Mr. Wigley was concerned that one of the editors was “in the skeptics camp.” He emailed Michael Mann to say that “if we can find documentary evidence of this, we could go through official … channels to get him ousted.”



Mr. Mann wrote to Mr. Wigley on Nov. 20, 2005 that “It’s one thing to lose _Climate Research_. We can’t afford to lose _GRL_.” In this context, “losing” obviously means the publication of anything that they did not approve of on global warming.



Soon the suspect editor, Yale’s James Saiers, was gone. Mr. Mann wrote to the CRU’s Phil Jones that “the _GRL_ leak may have been plugged up now w/​new editorial leadership there.”



It didn’t stop there. Ben Santer of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory complained that the Royal Meteorological Society (RMS) was now requiring authors to provide actual copies of the actual data that was used in published papers. He wrote to Phil Jones on March 19, 2009, that “If the RMS is going to require authors to make ALL data available — raw data PLUS results from all intermediate calculations — I will not submit any further papers to RMS journals.”



Messrs. Jones and Santer were Ph.D. students of Mr. Wigley. Mr. Santer is the same fellow who, in an email to Phil Jones on Oct. 9, 2009, wrote that he was “very tempted” to “beat the crap” out of me at a scientific meeting. He was angry that I published “The Dog Ate Global Warming” in _National Review_ , about CRU’s claim that it had lost primary warming data.



The result of all this is that our refereed literature has been inestimably damaged, and reputations have been trashed. Mr. Wigley repeatedly tells news reporters not to listen to “skeptics” (or even nonskeptics like me), because they didn’t publish enough in the peer‐​reviewed literature — even as he and his friends sought to make it difficult or impossible to do so.



Ironically, with the release of the Climategate emails, the Climatic Research Unit, Michael Mann, Phil Jones and Tom Wigley have dramatically weakened the case for emissions reductions. The EPA claimed to rely solely upon compendia of the refereed literature such as the IPCC reports, in order to make its finding of endangerment from carbon dioxide. Now that we know that literature was biased by the heavy‐​handed tactics of the East Anglia mob, the EPA has lost the basis for its finding.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019We were remiss in not reporting previously on the Canadian Taxpayer Federation (CTF) 20th Annual Gas Tax Honesty Report published on May 17, 2018. The federation’s analysis of the taxes on motor gasoline and diesel fuel is directly relevant to the current controversies about carbon taxes and their economic effects today.Here we will present only some of the main points from the CTF report. Those who are interested in the details can view the entire report here:https://www.taxpayer.com/media/2018-GTHD-EN.pdfIn 2018, the national average gasoline price was $1.35 per litre, including 54 cents in taxes.Gas Price RankingThe pump price of gasoline in any one location is the total of the pre-tax price (based largely on the costs of crude oil, refining and marketing) and the tax bill. Table 1 shows the 2018 average pump prices for selected cities in Canada.Table 1Gas Price Ranking (Dollars per litre)Province/CityPump PricePre-Tax PriceTax billVancouver$1.55$1.05$0.51Montreal$1.38$0.83$0.55Ontario$1.33$0.88$0.44Nova Scotia$1.25$0.83$0.42Alberta$1.24$0.88$0.36Notice that Vancouver has the highest pre-tax price and pump price, but Montreal has the highest tax bill.Tax Pile-OnIt seems more taxes are added to gasoline every decade. Depending on where they live in Canada, motorists who use gasoline or diesel fuel can be subject to federal and provincial excise taxes, sales taxes, transit taxes (Vancouver and Victoria), carbon taxes, and the strange “tax-on-the-tax” because the HST is applied to other taxes.Carbon TaxesThe fastest growing tax on motor fuels is the carbon tax. Because of the different tax regimes among the provinces, carbon taxes in 2018 ranged from the minimum required federal carbon tax of $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent to $18 per tonne in Ontario and Quebec, to $30 per tonne in Alberta and $35 per tonne in British Columbia.Under the federally imposed regime, the minimum carbon taxes will rise from $10 per tonne in 2018 by $10 per tonne per year until they reach $50 per tonne in 2022. Depending on which political party is in power, they will go on rising significantly after that. Table 2 shows what this means to the motorist.Table 2Federal Government Minimum Carbon TaxYearCarbon Taxtonne)Gasoline Equivalent(litre)Annual Total   2018$10$0.02$402019$20$0.05$802020$30$0.07$1202021$40$0.09$1602022$50$0.11$200The True Carbon TaxIf the purpose of carbon taxes is to discourage use by raising the cost, that objective is being served by all the taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, taxes that are not borne by other fuels. The true “carbon tax” is thus the per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent of all the taxes imposed on motor fuels, and especially gasoline. Table 3 shows what this meant for gasoline consumers in different cities in 2018.Table 3The True Carbon TaxProvince/CityTax Bill($/L)    Tax per TonneMontreal0.55$231Vancouver0.51$228Ontario0.44$188Nova Scotia0.42$180Alberta0.36$158The Canadian average for this carbon tax equivalent is $192 per tonne.RevenueThe taxes already on gasoline and diesel fuel yield enormous revenues. As the federal excise tax revenues are returned to the provinces to pay for transit expenditures, by far the majority of these funds go to the provincial governments. Table 4 indicates CTF’s estimates of the total revenues from taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel in 2018.Table 4 Gas and Diesel Tax 2018 Revenue EstimatesTaxRevenues ($million)Provincial Per-litre Taxes11,987Provincial Sales Tax3,803Federal Excise Tax4,733Federal Sales Tax3,528Tax-on-tax1,764Total24,051In other words, even without counting the carbon taxes, Canadian governments took in over $24 billion in revenue from taxes of motor fuel in 2018.As the Canadian Taxpayers Federation says in its report, it’s time for some tax honesty.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
" Reposted from the Independent Institute:  Is global warming real? Have any such predictions been established scientifically? Would massive “carbon” taxes and other controls put America and the world—especially the poor—at great risk?At this special event, geoscientist and astrophysicist Willie Soon separates fact from fiction in the global warming debate. He explains why the forecasts from CO2 climate models have been so wrong—and why solar influences on clouds, oceans, and wind drive climate change, not CO2 emissions. Stanford University physicist Elliott Bloom then comments.“The whole point of science is to question accepted dogmas. For that reason, I respect Willie Soon as a good scientist and a courageous citizen.” —Freeman J.

As Willie has shown in many ways, observational facts do not fit the CO2 dogma, and an enormous amount of evidence points to the Sun as a much more important driver of climate….

Share this...FacebookTwitterTop politician Friedrich Merz of Angela Merkel’s CDU party told German daily Die Welt the climate movement “ultimately gets down to our freedom-based lifestyle”.

CDU’s Friedrich Merz. Image: https://www.friedrich-merz.de/
Reacting to the harsh criticism launched by the German Greens, the media and Fridays for Future who claim that the German government’s recent proposal to combat CO2 emissions doesn’t go far enough, Merz said: “The alternative would be an unprecedented deindustrialization of our country.”
He added: “Even the introduction of a CO2 tax would not have been enough, nor would a series of bans on everything from SUVs to meat and air travel.“
The reality is that Germany’s share of global greenhouse gas emissions is just too puny (<3%) to make any perceptible difference. So what is behind the draconian decarbonization drive?
Germany’s industry has been reeling from the attacks launched by radical environmentalists, the very industries that are at the heart of freedom. Merz Told Welt: “On the other hand, behind the vociferous criticism and the demands for radical solutions, much is hidden and there is not the desire for more environmental protection. One or the other of you is saying it quite openly: It’s about overcoming the system, about destroying our market economy.”
Criticism from Merkel, Macron

So vocal and aggressive have the green radicals have become that even some of the world’s most high profile proponents of climate protection proponents have grown wary of the radical greens.
Recently the online Epoch Times reported on the reactions from European leaders:
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel distanced themselves from Thunberg over her speech to the United Nations and a legal complaint Thunberg filed that accuses France and Germany, among other nations, of a lack of action on climate change. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison faulted Thunberg for subjecting Australian children to “needless anxiety.”
“They’ve got enough things to be anxious about,” Morrison said of his own daughters. “We’ve got to let kids be kids. We can’t have them growing up as mushrooms, but we’ve got to get a bit of context into this.”
Macron criticized Thunberg for taking a radical and antagonistic position. “All the movements among our youth, or the less young, are useful,” Macron told French broadcaster Europe 1. “But now they must concentrate on the people who are further away, those who are trying to block [sustainable initiatives]. These radical positions will naturally antagonize our societies.”
“French Ecology Minister Brune Poirson also criticized Thunberg for creating divisions that may prove irreparable,” The Epoch times wrote.
“I do not believe that we can mobilize the population with despair, with almost hatred, setting people against one another,” Poirson told Radio France. “It’s important, she mobilizes. But what are the solutions she puts on the table? I do not know.”
Merkel  took a subtler approach to criticize the teenage climate activist: “I would like to take the opportunity to strongly contradict her in one matter,” Merkel said, according to The Times of London. “She did not adequately address the way technology and innovation, especially in the energy sector but also in energy conservation, raise possibilities for reaching our goals.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterCO2 concentrations have risen from 310 ppm to 410 ppm since the 1930s. However, there has been no net change in Arctic or Greenland temperatures during these last 90 years. During the Pliocene, CO2 also ranged between about 300-400 ppm, but the Arctic was 15-22°C warmer and sea levels 25 meters higher than today. Is CO2 really Earth’s “control knob”?
Nearly ten years ago, the imagery of a CO2 “control knob” for climate was canonized in the journal Science.

Image Source: Lacis et al., 2010
The CO2 concentration was said to determine – or control – Earth’s temperature.

However, the scientific literature’s paleoclimate record does not provide fundamental support for this paradigm of a CO2-controlled climate.
During the Ordovician, for example, CO2 concentrations reached 4,200 ppm – more than 10 times today’s levels. And yet the Earth returned to a glaciated “Snowball Earth” state during this period (Shuang et al., 2019).

Arctic/Greenland warming?
The Arctic is a region where a significant percentage of the Earth’s recent warming has arisen, and consequently this warming has been linked to the rise in CO2 concentrations from about 310 ppm in the 1930s to 410 ppm today.
And yet scientists continue to publish papers indicating the 1930s warmth was similar to or greater than that of today (Araźny et al., 2019, Hanhijarvi et al., 2013) despite the sharp contrast in CO2 levels.
Image Source: Araźny et al., 2019

There has been no significant net warming in Greenland during the last 90 years according to newly published papers (Holme et al., 2019, Ruan et al., 2019,  Vermassen et al., 2019,  Khazendar et al., 2019) as well as other recent papers (Hanna et al., 2011, Kobashi et al., 2017, Mikkelsen et al., 2018).

Is modern Greenland ice sheet melt significant?
During the Holocene Thermal Maximum (about ~9000 to ~7000 years ago), the Greenland ice sheet had about 500 meters less thickness than it has had in recent millennia, and its margins had retreated up to ~100 km behind their present-day position (Nielsen et al., 2018).

Image Source: Nielsen et al., 2018
The modern Greenland ice melt has amounted to an insignificant 15 mm since 1900 (Fettweis et al., 2017, Fettweis et al., 2008). That’s just 1.5 cm added to sea levels since the 20th century began – and no net contribution for the 60 years between the 1940s and 2000s.

Image Source: Fettweis et al., 2017

The Pliocene Arctic was 15-22°C warmer than today despite similar CO2 levels 
Cronin and Cronin ( 2015) reported that the Arctic Ocean was sea-ice-free and had temperatures reach a balmy 8-10°C three interglacials ago (MIS 11), when CO2 values peaked at 280 ppm. Polar bears somehow survived this much-warmer-than-today interval.
The same paper indicates the Arctic’s mean annual temperatures were 18.3°C warmer than today during the Pliocene, even though the Pliocene had CO2 concentrations similar to modern.

Image Source: Cronin and Cronin, 2015
A new paper indicates CO2 concentrations ranged between about 300 and 400 ppm during the Pliocene, but that Arctic mean annual temperatures were 15-22°C warmer than now (Fletcher et al., 2019) during this period.
Furthermore, all this polar warmth meant Earth’s sea levels were as much as 25 meters higher than present-day during the Pliocene.

Image Source: Fletcher et al., 2019
If CO2 was the Earth’s control knob, this is inconsistent with a “Snowball Earth” glaciation at 4,200 ppm, a sea-ice-free, 10°C to 22°C warmer Arctic at 280 ppm to 400 ppm, and no significant net change in Arctic/Greenland temperature as CO2 rose from 310 ppm to 410 ppm.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
As promised, we report here on yet another published estimate of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity that is towards the low end of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) range of possibilities.   
  
Recall that the equilibrium climate sensitivity is the amount that the earth’s surface temperature will rise from a doubling of the pre-industrial atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. As such, it is probably _the_ most important factor in determining whether or not we need to “do something” to mitigate future climate change. Lower sensitivity means low urgency, and, if low enough, carbon dioxide emissions confer a net benefit.   
  
And despite common claims that the “science is settled” when it comes to global warming, we are still learning more and more about the earth complex climate system—and the more we learn, the less responsive it seems that the earth’s average temperature is to human carbon dioxide emissions.   
  
The latest study to document a low climate sensitivity is authored by independent scientist Nic Lewis and is scheduled for publication in the _Journal of Climate_. Lewis’ study is a rather mathematically complicated reanalysis of another earlier mathematically complicated analysis that matches the observed global temperature change to the temperature change produced from a simple climate model with a configurable set of parameters whose actual values are largely unknown but can be assigned in the model simulations. By varying the values of these parameters in the models and seeing how well the resulting temperature output matches the observations, you can get some idea as to what the real-world value of these parameters are. And the main parameter of interest is the equilibrium climate sensitivity. Lewis’ study also includes additional model years and additional years of observations, including several years from the current global warming “hiatus” (i.e., the lack of a statistically significant rise in global temperature that extends for about 16 years, starting in early 1997).   
  
We actually did something along a similar vein—in English—and published it back in 2002. We found the same thing that Lewis did: substantially reduced warming. We were handsomely rewarded for our efforts by the climategate mafia, who tried to get 1) the paper withdrawn, 2) the editor fired—not just from the journal, but from Auckland University, and 3) my (Michaels) 1979 PhD “reopened” by University of Wisconsin.   




Lewis concludes that the median estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity is 1.6°C, with a 90% range extending from 1.0°C to 3.0°C. (That’s almost exactly what we found 11 years ago.)   
  
Based on this result, we welcome Lewis (2013) to the growing list of results published in the scientific literature since 2010 which find the climate sensitivity to be on the low side of the IPCC. God knows what the climategaters are emailing today.   




Figure 1 illustrates all the new results as well as the IPCC’s take.





  
  
Take special note of the new findings (and their mean) in relation to the black bar at the top labeled “IPCC AR5 Climate Models.” Of the 19 state-of-the-art climate models used in the IPCC’s newest Assessment Report (which is still in its draft form) exactly _zero_ have an equilibrium climate sensitivity that is as low as the mean value of estimates from the recent literature included in our Figure.   
  
Based on the collection of results illustrated in our Figure, _the future climate change projections about to be issued by the IPCC are off by an average of a whopping 70 percent_.   
  
No wonder the IPCC is reluctant to lower their best estimate of the actual value of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity. If they did, they would be admitting that the collection of climate models they have chosen (there is choice involved here) to project the earth’s future climate are, well, how should we put this, _wrong!..._ which would mean that so too is the rate at which the sky is falling, according to the USGCRP and the US EPA.   
  
We, at Cato’s Center for the Study of Science, will continue our efforts to portray the evolving state of climate science and to convince the powers-that-be that national and international assessments upon which EPA regulations are founded (and loony proposals for a carbon tax are based) are fatally flawed. Or as we put it, in our recent (April 12) review of the USGCRP’s draft “National Assessment,” in its current form, “the NCA [National Climate Assessment] will be obsolete on the day of its official release.”

You Ought to Have a Look _is a recurring feature from the Cato’s Center for the Study of Science that briefly highlights a few interesting blog posts from around the web that are comments on subject areas we are currently emphasizing. Climate change issues currently top the list. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary. This is the first installment of_ You Ought to Have a Look _  
_   
  
\---   
  
We start off with the estimable Judith Curry, former chairwoman of the highly regarded School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology (aka “Georgia Tech”). Her musings, published every few days on her blog “Climate Etc.” have a wide following amongst climate geeks (like us), while oftentimes her postings should be of interest to a wider, more general audience.   
  
Judith scored big last week with an excellent op-ed in the _Wall Street Journal_. In her subsequent blog post “My _WSJ_ op-ed: Global warming statistical meltdown,” she takes you through the version that appeared in print as well as some of the earlier drafts of it highlighting lessons she learned along the way. The article focuses on her recent blockbuster publication in which she and co-researcher Nic Lewis peg the earth’s climate sensitivity—how much warming will occur as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide—at a value about one-half that which is produced by the collection of “state-of-the-art” climate models used by the UN and the Obama Administration to underpin their calls to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions from the production of energy.   
  
And nearly every Friday, she posts her “Week in Review” where she highlights things that have recently caught her eye or events that she was involved in. In the current issue, she describes her recent travels which included a trip to Ohio’s Oberlin College where she “debated” me (PJM). As she describes it:   




The debate went fine, we each had 10 minutes to make opening statements on the science, and then an additional 10 minutes to discuss broader implications. I used my time to discuss the values issues and decision making under deep uncertainties. PJM discussed the increasingly perverse incentives in academia and government funded science, see [link] for some of his recent writing on this topic. He definitely makes some valid points.



Next, you might want to check out the witty Matt Briggs (“Statistician to the Stars”) post on “Don’t Say ‘Hiatus’” in which he takes us (and virtually everyone else) to task for using the terms “pause” and/or “hiatus” to refer to the past 18 years or so of no statistically significant overall change in the earth’s average surface temperature. Briggs’ main point is that since climate change models are so bad (unskillful), there is no reason for _a priori_ expectations of the temperature behavior one way or the other. In other words, a “pause” from what?   
  
Be aware that Briggs is a very twisty writer, often leading the reader down a path that takes a sharp turn further down his somewhat detailed essays. But there is always some gem to find at the end!



Briggs is an interesting character. He is associated with Cornell, where he teaches on advanced statistics course. He was an editor of _Journal of Climate_ , the American Meteorological Society’s flagship climate journal, but he quit after getting tired of the terrible manuscripts that were sent in (and often published).   
  
It’s hard not to like Matt’s style, and you will be seeing a lot of his work highlighted here.   
  
Finally, our friend Roy Spencer’s wide ranging drroyspencer.com (usually on things atmospheric, but sometimes otherwise) has an interesting article pointing out that size matters when it comes to climate change. In his post “Climate Change: A Meaningless Artifact of Technology?,” Roy notes that if you can’t distinguish the signal of climate change from the noise of natural variability (or even if you can, if it is exceedingly tiny), then there is really nothing worth getting worked up about. Roy worries:   




“This seems to be the fate of our advanced society — we must find increasingly obscure things to fret over as we solve our major problems…hunger, disease, water-borne illness, infant mortality. But with real problems now appearing – renewed terrorist threats, Ebola — I fear we are straining gnats as we swallow camels.”



In a case of good timing, Roy followed-up that post with one illustrating a prime example of all this from Secretary of State John Kerry, who recently said something along the lines of “Life as you know it on Earth ends if climate change skeptics are wrong.” In his post “Life as You Know It Will End if John Kerry is Wrong…OR Right,” Roy demonstrates that, given the catastrophically high cost of converting even half of our fossil-fuel based energy to renewables, most of us will be living in poverty if Kerry’s solutions are implemented. Roy includes a video in which he and other energy policy experts discuss how the premature push toward renewable energy on a large scale will increase human suffering. It is well worth watching.

From the AGU
Project utilized 25 years of data from six international satellite missions
29 July 2019
Joint Release
WASHINGTON — Constructed from a quarter century’s worth of satellite data, a new map of Antarctic ice velocity by glaciologists from the University of California, Irvine and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the most precise ever created.
Published today in a new paper in the AGU journal Geophysical Research Letters, the map is 10 times more accurate than previous renditions, covering more than 80 percent of the continent.
“By utilizing the full potential of interferometric phase signals from satellite synthetic-aperture radars, we have achieved a quantum leap in the description of ice flow in Antarctica,” said lead author Jeremie Mouginot, UCI associate researcher in Earth system science. “This more detailed representation will help improve our understanding of ice behavior under climate stress over a larger part of the continent, farther south, and will enable improved projections of sea level rise through numerical models.”

To chart the movement of ice sheets across the surface of the enormous land mass, the researchers combined input from six satellite missions: the Canadian Space Agency’s Radarsat-1 and Radarsat-2; the European Space Agency’s Earth remote sensing satellites 1 and 2 and Envisat ASAR; and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s ALOS PALSAR-1.
While the data were spread across 25 years, the pace of signal gathering accelerated in the last decade as more resources were deployed in the Earth’s orbit. As ice sheet science coordinator in the World Meteorological Organization’s Polar Space Task Group, co-author Bernd Scheuchl, UCI associate project scientist in Earth system science, was responsible for acquiring the relevant data from the various international space agencies.
Previous mapping efforts relied heavily on “feature” and “speckle tracking” methods, which detect the subtle motion of parcels of ice on the ground over time; this approach has been proven effective in estimating ice flow speed. To measure significantly slower ice sheet movement in the vast interior regions, the UCI team augmented these techniques with synthetic-aperture radar phase interferometry, which detects the subtle motion of natural reflectors of radar signals in snow/ice independent of the size of the parcel of ice illuminated by the radar.
“The interferometric phase of SAR data measures the ice deformation signal with a precision of up to two orders of magnitude better than speckle tracking,” Mouginot said. “A drawback is that it requires a lot more data, namely multiple passes at different angles over the same point on the ground – a problem that was solved by a consortium of international space agencies pointing Earth-monitoring spacecrafts to this part of the world.”
The team was able to compose a map that resolves ice movement to a level of 20 centimeters (a little over half a foot) per year in speed and 5 degrees in annual flow direction for more than 70 percent of Antarctica. It’s the first time that high-precision mapping of the interior areas has been accomplished.
“This product will help climate scientists achieve a number of goals, such as a better determination of the boundaries between glaciers and a thorough evaluation of regional atmospheric climate models over the entire continent,” said co-author Eric Rignot, chair and Donald Bren Professor of Earth System Science at UCI and a JPL senior research scientist.
“It will also help in locating the most promising sites for ice core drilling to extract climate records and in examining the mass balance of Antarctica beyond its periphery.”

Water is essential for all life, and happily it is abundant on our blue watery planet.
However, salty oceans cover 70% of Earth’s surface and contain 97% of Earth’s water. Salt water is great for ocean dwellers but not directly useful for most life on land. Another 2% of Earth’s water is tied up in ice caps, glaciers and permanent snow, leaving just 1% as land-based fresh water.
To sustain life on land, we need to conserve and make good use of this rare and elusive resource.
Luckily, our sun is a powerful nuclear-powered desalinisation plant. Every day, solar energy evaporates huge quantities of fresh water from the oceans. After a stop-off in the atmosphere, most of this water vapour is soon returned to earth as dew, rain, hail and snow – this is the great water cycle. Unfortunately about 70% of this precipitation falls directly back into the oceans and some is captured in frozen wastelands.
Much of the water that falls on land is collected in gullies, creeks and rivers and driven relentlessly by gravity back to the sea by the shortest possible route. Allowing this loss to happen is poor water management. The oceans are not short of water.
Some animals and plants have evolved techniques to maximise conservation of precious fresh water.
Some Australian frogs, on finding their water holes evaporating, will inflate their stomachs with water then bury themselves in a moist mud-walled cocoon to wait for the drought to break. Water buffalo and wild pigs make mud wallows to retain water in their private mud-baths, camels carry their own water supply and beavers build lots of dams.
Some plants have also evolved water saving techniques – bottle trees and desert cacti are filled with water, thirsty humans can even get a drink from the roots and trunks of some eucalypts and many plants produce drought/fire resistant seeds.
Every such natural water conservation or drought-proofing behaviour brings benefits for all surrounding plants and animals.
People have long recognised the importance of conserving fresh water – early settlers built their homes near the best waterholes on the creek and every homestead and shed had its corrugated iron tanks. Graziers built dams and weirs to retain surface water for stock (and fence-crashing wildlife), used contour ripping and good pasture management to retain moisture in soils, and drilled bores to get underground water. And sensible rules have evolved to protect the water rights of down-stream residents.
In some snow-fed rivers like the Nile, floods are generally a reliable and predictable annual event. For millennia the Nile delivered water and silt fertiliser to the farmers on the flood plains in Lower Egypt. The massive High Aswan Dam may have done more harm than good – it certainly did great harm to the farmers and land down-stream by stealing the silt and the water that supported the productivity of farms that have fed millions since Roman times. The value of the electricity generated by the dam probably does not compensate for these losses.
But in Australia, rainfall is usually a boom and bust affair. Much fresh water is delivered to the land surface suddenly in cyclones, storms and rain depressions. But “The Wet” is always followed by “The Dry”, and droughts and floods are normal climatic events. People who fail to store some of the flood must put up with the drought.

" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.In 1999, there was a famous episode on the U.S. television animated series, South Park, in which a dowdy teacher harangued her class with the explanation of all that is going wrong in the world. “Blame Canada” she cried, and the class took it up with a rousing musical refrain. I am reminded of the absurdity of that episode, if not its sense of humour, by the present tendency of municipalities in some regions to sue Canadian oil companies for the alleged economic damages of global warming. The whole claim rests on a mountain of false assumptions and misjudgements, but I would like to examine just one set of them – the claim that it is oil producers in one country, Canada, that are responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions rising. At the heart of this allegation is the assumption that oil-related emissions of greenhouse gases, as measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), are the main sources of global emissions. Let’s examine that in terms of the emissions from the most widely used refined oil product, motor gasoline, throughout its life cycle. This is what is called a “wells to wheels” analysis. The estimates of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions on this basis have been changing over the past two decades as a result of intense study of the issue by various governments in Canada and the United States. Fifteen years ago, the rule-of-thumb calculation was that, of the roughly 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule produced wells to wheels for gasoline in the United States, 15% was attributable to exploration, production, transportation, refining and marketing and 85% was due to final combustion in the vehicle. After 2007, due to more detailed analysis carried out largely by the California Air Resources Board and its consultants, the percentages, on average, were revised to: Crude exploration and production: 8%Crude and product transport: 1.5 %Crude refining: 13%Final combustion: 78% Thus, the entire “upstream” portion of the oil-to-gasoline life cycle is now considered to constitute 22%, and the final consumption by the motorist constitutes 78%, or almost four-fifths. So, if one accepts the thesis that we should blame someone for oil-related emissions, who is it – the producers, refiners, or consumers? Consumers, of course, are not easy to sue. In around 2006, a number of U.S. private foundations began a well-funded systematic campaign to vilify the Alberta oil sands, a campaign that some researchers in Canada have tracked in terms of the financing provided to environmental non-governmental organizations here.  The “war” on oil sands resulted in significantly more attention to the emissions associated with different types of crude oil, and claims that gasoline produced in the United States using Canadian synthetic crude oil produced up to 45% more CO2 emissions than that produced using conventional crude oil. In 2009, Jacob Consultancy completed a study for the Alberta Energy Research Institute in which it delved in far greater detail into the GHG emissions at each stage of the production to consumption cycle for crude oils consumed in the United States. The following PowerPoint presentation, delivered in 2011, summarizes the results. https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/article/2011/03/Jacobs%20Consultancy%20LCA%20Meeting%20March%2021.pdf One of the most interesting of the study findings was that there are a wide range of emissions associated with the many different domestic and foreign crude oils sold in the United States, and that natural gas flaring during production was of unexpected importance in differentiating among the different crude CO2 emission levels. In fact, the studies concluded that Canadian oil produced by mining and SAGD methods produce on average about 10% more, or 10 grams CO2 per megajoule more, than gasoline produced using the average of U.S. domestic and imported market crudes. CA TEOR, a type of heavy California crude oil produced by enhanced recovery, produces higher emissions than the oil sands crude. Canadian oil producers have been making considerable progress in reducing the energy intensity of their production techniques. According to a recent report on the Natural Resources Canada website, GHG emissions per barrel of oil produced in the oil sands have fallen by 29% since 2000. https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/facts/cru The “bottom line”, I would suggest, is that close to 80% of the CO2 equivalent emissions from oil occur at the final consumption (i.e. combustion) stage, so that is where environmental zealots or the municipalities that wish to support them should focus their blame. A few final comments about context would seem to be justified. According to the National Inventory of GHG emissions published by Environment and Climate Change Canada, Canada’s emissions in 2016 were 722 megatonnes. All emissions from transportation, including road, rail, marine and aviation modes were 173 megatonnes, and those from all passenger road vehicles were 93 megatonnes. So, the fuel consumption by Canada’s fleet of light duty vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) constitutes 12.9 % of Canada’s GHG emissions. You could eliminate every one of them, and leave us all dependent on walking, cycling and horses, and you would only get slightly over one third of the way to Canada’s 30 % emissions reduction target by 2030. Even that would not cause a ripple in the ever-growing tide of global emissions.

The Kerry‐​Lieberman‐​Graham (is he still part of these efforts?) climate bill summary has been leaked. I’m sure my colleague Pat Michaels will weigh in on its contents soon, but in the meantime I thought I would comment on the trade‐​related aspects of the bill, or at least the summary that is now in the public domain.   
  
  
As Scott Lincicome points out, the drafters have gone to great pains to emphasize that this bill is, like, _totally_ about saving the environment. (Which, by the way, is a bit of a turnaround). I’ve blogged before about why advocates of “border adjustment measures” need to be careful about the justification they offer. In short, the World Trade Organization does not look too kindly upon disguised protectionism, and any legal challengers would probably use things like, say, press releases touting the (traditional) protective benefits of carbon tariffs as evidence of U.S. wrongdoing. The House bill fell short in that regard, with lots of talk about equalizing costs etc, and apparently the sponsors of the Senate bill have learned from warnings from trade experts. Not completely, though. Here’s Scott on their efforts to be more careful, and why they fall short: 



The bill’s short summary (available here) also follows [a] new “green” road‐​map…: 



In order to protect the **environmental goals of the bill** , we phase in a WTO‐​consistent border adjustment mechanism. In the event that no global agreement on **climate change** is reached, the bill requires imports from countries that have not taken action to limit emissions to pay a comparable amount at the border to **avoid carbon leakage** and ensure we are able to achieve our **environmental objectives**.



You couldn’t shoehorn more “environmental” references into this summary if you tried. Only one small problem: this strictly “environmental” summary falls clearly under the main heading “Expanding America’s Manufacturing Base,” and the long summary of Sections 775–777 above comes under the main heading “Subtitle A — Protecting American Manufacturing Jobs and Preventing Carbon Leakage.” So did the Senate drafters really just take all that time purging all of the scary “competitiveness” language from their new bill’s carbon tariffs provisions, only to keep them under a legislative subtitle that expressly denotes provisions dealing with domestic industrial competitiveness?



Scott’s right, but I found the heading in the bill’s long summary even more blatant: Title IV, under which the international provisions are explained, is called “Job Protection and Growth”. Call me overly cautious, but I don’t think having the phrase “job protection” as _the first words in the title_ on border measures is a good way to hide your intent from the WTO or, for that matter, your increasingly‐​fractious trade partners.

"United States intelligence officials have determined that last year’s cyberattacks on the World   Agency originated with the Russian government, perpetrated in apparent retaliation for what President Vladimir V. Putin deemed to be an   effort to defame Russia for widespread doping. That conclusion was published Friday in a declassified intelligence report ordered by President Obama. The report centered on Russia’s efforts to affect the 2016 American presidential election at Mr. Putin’s direction, while also referring to Russia’s related “influence efforts against targets such as Olympic athletes and other foreign governments. ” “A prominent target since the 2016 Summer Olympics has been the World   Agency,” the report said. WADA, the global regulator of drugs in sports, commissioned numerous investigations into systematic Russian doping last year. In July, the agency recommended that Russia be barred from the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro for its   doping program, which persisted for years and spanned disciplines. Weeks later, the regulator discovered that its database containing the private medical information of international athletes had been breached. A group identifying itself as Fancy Bear  —   a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics experts had tied to the Russian government  —   published the records of athletes who had received special clearance to take typically banned substances for medical reasons. In Friday’s report, American intelligence officials concluded that the Fancy Bear hacking had originated with Russia’s main military intelligence unit, the G. R. U. which had also begun working to influence the American election in March. Many of the records stolen from the doping regulator related to American athletes, including Simone Biles, the gymnast who won numerous medals in Rio, and the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The release of the records was an apparent attempt to discredit the athletes and paint the United States as hypocritical, Friday’s report stated. On Friday, Catherine MacLean, a spokeswoman for the antidoping agency, pointed to the organization’s statement in September condemning the criminal activity and noted that the agency had “asked the Russian government to do everything in their power to make it stop. ” Russian news media and sports officials have repeatedly invoked the stolen records in recent months, arguing that they are evidence of legalized doping and what they perceive to be the preferential treatment of Western athletes. Regulators and Olympic officials have repeatedly defended the affected athletes, noting that they followed proper procedure and received formal clearance. “Russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,” Vitaly Smirnov, a former top Russian sports official appointed by Mr. Putin to reform the nation’s antidoping system, said last month, referring to the hacked records as evidence. “The general feeling in Russia is that we didn’t have a chance. ”"
"Queen Elizabeth II made her first public appearance in almost a month on Sunday, allaying concerns about her health after she missed Christmas and New Year’s Day church services because of what Buckingham Palace described as a persistent cold. The queen, who will turn 91 in April, attended services at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, England, with Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and his wife, as well as several members of the Duchess of Cambridge’s family, including her sister, Pippa, and brother, James. Before Sunday, the queen, whose appearances are usually a staple of the holiday season, had not been seen in public since Dec. 9. Her absence on Christmas Day was the first time in 30 years that she had not attended the holiday service.   on social media celebrated the queen’s reappearance. “The Queen has been seen in public,” one Twitter user said. “Huge relief. I can sleep easy in my bed now. ” The queen’s   came several weeks after a widespread Twitter hoax started by a fake BBC account that convinced many of her fans that she had died. Despite feeling under the weather, the queen managed to record her traditional Christmas broadcast. “The message of Christmas reminds us that inspiration is a gift to be given as well as received, and that love begins small but always grows,” she said then. “I wish you all a very happy Christmas. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA plot of ice core data from Greenland reveals that CO2 does not drive temperatures.
At Facebook, Gregory Wrightstone posted a chart plotting atmospheric CO2 concentration reconstructed from  Dome C Ice Core versus temperature that was reconstructed from the GISP 2 Ice Core.
According to global warming scientists, there’s supposed to be tandem movement between the two magnitudes.
CO2, they say, drives global temperature.
But over the past 8000 years, the data show that temperature in reality has moved in the opposite direction of CO2 and thus of what climate alarmist scientists have told us.

If anything can be drawn from the plotted data, it is that there’s an inverse correlation: As CO2 rises, temperature drops. But of course there’s a lot more to it. CO2 is not that huge major climate driver that alarmists like having us believe it is.

His full bio is here.Forget the Dream HouseSummaryAccording to a recent Abacus poll, the affordability of housing is the largest concern among young adults in Canada. Every quarter, RBC Economic Research publishes its survey of housing trends and affordability. In the report published in March 2019, RBC assessed the percentage of income needed by the average family to cover the costs of owning a home as 52%. So, on average, Canadians pay more than half their income on housing ownership costs.Cover Image licensed from Shutterstock. LINK TO FULL REPORT: Forget the Dream House FINAL Federal and provincial government policies under the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (PCF) will make matters considerably worse over the next decade. One PCF commitment is that federal, provincial and territorial governments will “work to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a ‘net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030.” The incremental costs of these changes will be high. Building an Energy Star home will cost an extra $8,000 to $10,000, an R2000 home costs $30,000-$40,000 and a net zero home $100,000-$150,000. Canadians build roughly 200,000 homes per year. In 2012, around 1400 of those homes were energy star certified. Less than 50 were R2000 certified and about 15 were considered net-zero. Assuming that the cost of household energy use is between $2,000 and $4,000 per year, an Energy Star home would take 10 to 20 years to payback. R2000 would take 15 to 30 years to payback, and net zero 25 to 50 years to payback. Further, most homeowners only plan to live in a house for around five years, and so they will not get to experience the energy savings benefits. Using the low end of the estimated additional cost of a net-zero house of $100,000 per unit and the estimate of 200,000 average new home sales per year, moving to mandate the use of net-zero homes in Canada by 2030 would impose an additional $20 billion per year cost on the Canadian economy. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

Democratic Florida Rep. Kathy Castor is getting pushback from climate skeptics after she asked Google on Monday to nix content on YouTube that takes a skeptical approach to United Nations’ climate models.
Castor asked CEO Sundar Pichai in a Jan. 27 letter not to incentivize “climate misinformation content on its platform.” She made the request after a Jan. 16 report from a nonprofit group suggested it found examples where YouTube’s algorithms promoted so-called climate denialism.
“Stop promoting climate denial and climate disinformation videos by removing them immediately from the platform’s recommendation algorithm,” the Florida Democrat wrote in a list of suggestions to Pichai.
Castor also asked the CEO to stop “monetizing” such content.
The report, published by AVAAZ, hits several pieces of content, including a 2018 Fox News interview with climate scientist Patrick Michaels, who explained why 31 of 32 climate models are “fudged” by design. Michaels worked as a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute until 2019.
AVAAZ argued this claim, and one he made suggesting only half of global warming might be caused by human activity, contained misinformation. (RELATED: Exclusive: Facebook Removed False Label After Scientists Said Climate ‘Alarmist’ Fact Checkers Are Targeting Them)
Watch:

“Half of the warming since 1976 is plausible and in line with the IPCC which says ‘more than half the warming since mid-century,’” Michaels told the Daily Caller News Foundation in defense of his claims.
He was referencing data from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
He added: “That’s post 1950 but there was no warming from 50 through 75. All the warming is post 1975 and the U.N. statement accommodates 51% which sure looks like a half.”
Other climate skeptics are also weighing in on Castor’s request, as well as the report that prompted the congresswoman’s letter.
Michaels experienced a similar incident in September 2019, when Facebook deemed claims he and another scientist made in a Washington Examiner editorial false. The tech company eventually removed the label after Michaels argued their points in a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Facebook exempted opinion content and political advocacy organizations from the social media giant’s independent fact-checking efforts in October of that year after the DCNF’s report highlighting Michaels’s complaints.
“Instead of engaging in open debate with climate skeptics, Rep. Castor just wants to shut us up. I can only imagine what her side would do to us if they had real power,” JunkScience founder Steve Milloy told The Washington Times on Wednesday, two days after Castor sent her letter.
Climate Depot founder Marc Morano accused the Democrat of trying to silence skeptics.
“Sadly, I expect YouTube to cave and continue its policies of clamping down on climate skeptics and those who oppose so-called solutions like the Green New Deal or U.N. Paris climate pact,” he told The Washington Times. “YouTube has already initiated policies that amount to climate ‘virtue signaling’ with their disclaimers.”
Castor has not responded to the DCNF’s request for comment.
“We can’t speak to Avaaz’s methodology or results, and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels based on specific perspectives,” a YouTube representative said in a statement addressing AVAAZ’s report.

"**Finnish scientists producing a protein ""from thin air"" say it will compete with soya on price within the decade.**
The protein is produced from soil bacteria fed on hydrogen split from water by electricity.
The researchers say if the electricity comes from solar and wind power, the food can be grown with near-zero greenhouse gas emissions.
If their dreams are realised, it could help the world tackle many of the problems associated with farming.
When I visited Solar Foods' pilot plant on the outskirts of Helsinki last year the researchers were raising funds for expansion.
Now they say they have attracted 5.5m euros of investment, and they predict â depending on the price of electricity â that their costs will roughly match those for soya production by the end of the decade - perhaps even by 2025.
I ate a few grains of the precious protein flour - called Solein - and tasted nothing, which is what the scientists have planned.
They want it to be a neutral additive to all sorts of foods.
It could mimic palm oil by reinforcing pies, ice cream, biscuits, pasta, noodles, sauces or bread. The inventors say it can be used as a medium for growing cultured meat or fish.
It could also nourish cattle to save them eating soya raised on rainforest land.
Even if things go according to plan â which, of course, they may not â it will be many years before the protein production is scaled up to meet global demand.
But this is one of many projects looking towards a future of synthesised food.
The firmâs CEO is Pasi Vainikka, who studied at Cranfield University in the UK and is now adjunct professor at Lappeenranta University.
He told me the ideas behind the technology were originally developed for the space industry in the 1960s.
He admits his demonstrator plant is running some months behind time but says it will be ready by 2022. A full investment decision will come in 2023, and if all goes according to plan, the first factory will appear in 2025.
He said: âWe are doing pretty well so far. Once we scale the factory from the first one by adding reactors (to ferment protein) and take into account the amazing improvements in other clean technologies like wind and solar power, we think we can compete with soya possibly as early as 2025.â
To make Solein, water is ""split"", using electrolysis to make hydrogen. The hydrogen, carbon dioxide from the air and minerals are fed to bacteria, which then produce the protein.
A key determinant, he said, would be the price of electricity. The firm anticipates that as more renewables come on-stream, the cost will fall.
The progress of this extraordinary technology has been hailed by the environmental campaigner George Monbiot, who has made a TV documentary, Apocalypse Cow, broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK at 22:00 GMT on Wednesday.
Monbiot is generally pessimistic about the future of the planet, but says Solar Foods has given him hope.
He said: âFood production is ripping the living world apart. Fishing and farming are, by a long way, the greatest cause of extinction and loss of the diversity and abundance of wildlife. Farming is a major cause of climate breakdown.
âBut just as hope appeared to be evaporating, âfarmfree foodâ creates astonishing possibilities to save both people and planet.
âBy temporarily shifting towards a plant-based diet, we can help buy the time to save species and places.
âBut farmfree food offers hope where hope was missing. We will soon be able to feed the world without devouring it.â
Research by the think tank RethinkX, which forecasts the implications of technology-driven disruption of many kinds, suggests that proteins from precision fermentation will be around 10 times cheaper than animal protein by 2035.
It forecasts the result will be the near-complete collapse of the livestock industry - although critics will complain that this doesnât take into account the ability of meat producers to harness the novel proteins to feed their own stock .
A consortium of leading scientific research and academic institutions has been formed to identify innovative solutions to tackle climate change linked to the agri-food sector.
A paper last year concluded that microbial protein was several times more efficient than soya in terms of land use, and required just a tenth as much water.
Another factor, though, will be cultural. Many people will still want to eat lamb chops that look like lamb chops.
Professor Leon Terry from Cranfield University told BBC News there was growing interest from investors in novel foods.
âThere is increased momentum and investment round synthetic foods,â he said. But he asked: ""Is there really an appetite for their consumption?â

" Just the Facts on Carbon Tax: Twelve Facts to Rebut Ecofiscal Canada’s Ten MythsLINK TO OUR REPORT:  Just the Facts FINALSummaryEcofiscal Canada has just issued a report on “10 Myths About Carbon Pricing in Canada.” We respond with 12 facts.Climate change is the last on the list of priorities for Canadians according to Ecofiscal’s own poll conducted by Abacus Data (Feb. 2018)There is no open debate on carbon taxes and climate policy. Canadian media does not support Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press on climate change.Extreme weather is unrelated to human influence on climate or carbon dioxide concentrations.Carbon tax is not effective in reducing carbon dioxide/GHG emissions.Carbon taxes hurt jobs and drive commerce and industry out-of-business or offshore. In 2013, the EU industry minister said such energy policies were causing an ‘industrial massacre’.Suggesting that a rebate (carbon dividend) is ‘larger than carbon cost to families’ is impossible math, deceptive and dishonest; the rebate does not incorporate the incremental rise in cost of living as carbon taxes are applied to everything. “Tax ‘em and bribe ‘em with their own money.”Canada one of the largest emitters? Faulty logic. Where is the climate justice for the world’s second largest, cold, vast, resource exporting nation?Elites versus the People – tax-free/tax-exempt/tax-avoiding pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and union funds see you as their ATM for unfunded pension liabilities.Fair and Equal? Green billionaires have funded the climate ‘crisis’ campaign for their own vested interests.A tax grab and more – watch for the ‘personal carbon ration’A cash grab by government – with an alarming scope of income that could be larger than even income taxes!Not science-based – Carbon dioxide is not a control knob that can fine tune climate. Therefore a carbon tax is unnecessary and irrelevant.Now you may wonder why there is such a disparity of views. How can a group of highly qualified economists come to the Ecofiscal conclusion that supports carbon pricing – while another group of economists, scientists and Professional Engineers like Friends of Science Society reach a different conclusion?The answer lies in the disconnect between the carbon tax ‘as a market mechanism’ and the grim reality of the scope of intended greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets.  To many people, these are simply numbers to be reached – they are unaware of how deeply embedded the use of energy is in every aspect of modern life, or they falsely believe ‘clean-tech’ will solve the problem [the Apollo Fallacy[i]]. They don’t realize that ‘success’ – in this case – would mean catastrophe for Canada.Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat, outlines the crux of the matter in this summary:Economists love carbon taxation because it is a market-based policy instrument, and thus, in their minds, more “economically efficient” than regulations and subsidy programs. They forget that such taxes are rarely, if ever, used as alternatives to regulations and subsidies – they just become redundant, costly add-ons.  But there is a far more important point. Taxes are just a policy instrument, and the instrument is nowhere near as important as the policy goal. The policy goal in the case of Canadian climate change policy is to reduce emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 and by at least 50% from 2005 levels by 2050. Canadian emissions were 704 megatonnes in 2016. To reach the 2030 target, they would have to decline by 192 megatonnes, and to reach the 2050 target they would have to decline by 338 megatonnes.  The entire emissions from transportation in 2016 were 173 megatonnes. So you could eliminate every car, SUV, truck, bus, aircraft, train and marine vessel in the country, and you still would not achieve the 2030 target. The 2050 target could not be attained if you eliminated all the transportation sources (173 Mt), all the heavy industry (81 Mt), and almost half the oil and gas operations (80 Mt out of 183 Mt). This is assuming zero growth in emissions due to economic or population growth.  How exactly, would you accomplish this by raising energy prices? You could only do so by raising them so high that you drove millions of people into bankruptcy and forced thousands of firms to cease operations and leave Canada. You won’t hear any carbon tax advocate talking about that. That’s what it means for the nation. And what does this mean for the working person or pensioner? Belgian philosopher Drieu Godefridi explains the reasons behind the persistent Gilets Jaunes/Yellow Vests anti-carbon tax movement in France: This tax oppression mechanically condemns millions of formerly middle-class and working poor French people to a head-first plunge into poverty where they will no longer know how to pay for the necessities of life: heating, fuel, medical care, food. It seems doubtful that the revolt of people is diminishing when the state progressively and aggressively confiscates the means of their subsistence, and finally their dignity.[ii] RELATED;Robert Lyman – Climate Change Policy: A Threat to CanadaCan Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?  [i] https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=cob_papers[ii] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/11/28/3-reasons-to-think-that-the-movement-of-yellow-vests-has-only-just-begun/Just the Facts On Carbon TaxDownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"**People should cut the amount of beef, lamb and dairy produce they eat by a fifth to combat climate change, a report says.**
It says public bodies should lead the way by offering plant-based options with all meals.
But it says if people donât cut consumption willingly, taxes on meat and dairy might be needed.
The report comes from the governmentâs official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC).
Its chief executive Chris Stark told BBC News: âWe can't meet the government's 2050 Net Zero target without major changes in the way we use the land, the way we farm, and what we eat.â
The farming union NFU welcomed much of the report, although they oppose cuts in livestock - but some environmentalists believe it's too timid.
**'Greening' the countryside**
The document recommends a host of measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the countryside.
Others include increasing UK forestry cover from 13% to at least 17% by 2050, and restoring at least half of upland peat bogs.
But itâs the proposals for reducing consumption of dairy produce and red meat that are likely to draw attention.
The authors say reducing the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we eat by at least 20%, and reducing food waste by 20% would save the equivalent of seven million tonnes of CO2 from farms.
They say land thatâs no longer needed for cattle and sheep could support trees crops to burn for energy.
**Fewer sheep and cows expected**
The authors anticipate around a 10% drop in cattle and sheep numbers by 2050 against 2017 levels. They say there's already been a reduction of around 20% in the past two decades.
Some upland farmers argue that on thin soils, the only productive use of the land is for livestock.
Minette Batters, NFU President said: ""Plant-based products do not always necessarily have a lower impact on the environment.
""Of British land, 65% is only suitable for grazing livestock and we have the right climate to produce high quality red meat and dairy. Therefore it makes sense that, when talking about environmental impact, the public continues to support British livestock production.""
The report says: âGrasslands can have a positive impact on soil quality (by storing carbon in the soil) but grassland cannot continuously increase its carbon store.
âThis means grassland cannot be used continually to offset methane emissions from livestock.â
The broad-ranging document also says farmers must use fertilisers more intelligently. They should deal with animal manure better, and reduce food waste.
**Peatland burning 'should be banned'**
The report urges a ban on regular burning on peatland, and a ban on peat extraction.
Controversially, the committee recommends expanding crops grown to be burned for energy to around 23,000 hectares each year.
This is resisted by food charities such as the Sustain Alliance. Its spokesperson Vicki Hird said: âThe emphasis on energy crops to feed power plants is dangerous â it could damage biodiversity and ecosystems as well as our food security.â
**New forests could be funded by aviation levies**
The Committee says land use â thatâs farms, forests and peatland â accounted for 12% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2017.
But by 2050, it says, farmers and land-managers must reduce these emissions by almost two thirds for the UK to meet its targets.
New forests, it urges, should be funded by a levy on greenhouse gas-emitting industries such as aviation.
Increasing forestry, the report says, will provide woods for recreation, clean the air, filter water and capture flood waters on the land.
The re-wilding campaigner George Monbiot said the report contained âfeeble half-measuresâ.
He said: ""The level of ambition is in no way matched to the scale of our climate and ecological emergencies.
""People in the UK are already reducing their red meat consumption.
""A 10% reduction in cattle and sheep numbers by 2050 is likely to be much smaller than the shift that's going to happen anyway, without the help of the measures the committee proposes.""

Chairman Carbon Sense Coalition
It’s time to defund all CSIRO global warming activities and conferences.
For years now CSIRO and their UN/IPCC puppet-masters have claimed that “climate science is settled”. Tinder PC If so, why are Australian governments still wasting some $150M annually on creating climate scares and producing propaganda for a political war on carbon energy and carbon dioxide?
Australia should cease all government funding for global warming “research” and carbon-centric climate models and leave the honest, useful and difficult business of weather forecasting to the BOM, which should revert to its once-proud name and role as “The Weather Bureau”.
The neurotic focus of Australian politicians and their research puppets on the UN man-made global warming agenda has starved useful research into real factors that do affect global climate. These include cycles and oscillations in solar activity, cosmic rays and clouds, crustal and magmatic movements, volcanic eruptions, and the periodic changes in planetary orbits and axial tilts within the solar system.
Australia is an island surrounded by the vast oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. But CSIRO is mesmerised by atmospheric greenhouse mirages and largely ignores the causes and timing of ENSO oscillations, the amount and locations of submarine volcanism, and the timing, drivers and locations of deep ocean currents and upwellings.
If CSIRO and the government Universities cannot do such basic research in our region their funds should be diverted to the deficit, or applied to weather-proofing our infrastructure.

"WASHINGTON  —   As Senate Republicans embark on a flurry of confirmation hearings this week, several of Donald J. Trump’s appointees have yet to complete the background checks and ethics clearances customarily required before the Senate begins to consider   nominees. Republicans, who are expected to hold up to five hearings on Wednesday alone, say they simply want to ensure that the new president has a team in place as soon as possible. “I believe all the  ’s cabinet appointments will be confirmed,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said. But Democrats are calling for the process to be slowed and for the hearings to be spread out. That, they say, would allow more time to vet the nominees. “Our first overarching focus is getting tax returns and ethics forms,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. In a letter to Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the leader of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter M. Shaub Jr. said on Friday that “the announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me. ” He said the packed schedule had put “undue pressure” on the office to rush its reviews of the nominees and he knew of no other occasion in the office’s four decades when the Senate had held a confirmation hearing before the review was completed. Mr. Schumer responded on Saturday by saying that the letter had made clear that the Trump transition team colluded with Senate Republicans to “jam through” the nominees. Several of the nominees are millionaires or billionaires and have vast webs of financial interests that must be untangled. The Trump transition team issued a statement on Saturday evening defending its handling of the nomination process. Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush, said he thought none of the nominees could receive a full vote on the Senate floor before the vetting was complete. Norman Eisen, Mr. Obama’s ethics counsel in his first term, said the paperwork delays were “totally  . ” The status of the background checks and ethical clearances can change by the day. Republicans say they expect the missing documents to be submitted for all the nominees eventually. The hearings are scheduled to begin on Tuesday, with testimony from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the nominee for attorney general, and Gen. John F. Kelly, the pick for homeland security secretary. On Wednesday, the parade of nominees is expected to include Rex W. Tillerson, the choice for secretary of state Betsy DeVos, the pick for education secretary and Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the nominee to lead the C. I. A. Later in the week, the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. chosen as commerce secretary, and Andrew F. Puzder, the labor secretary pick, are scheduled to come before congressional panels. While some of Mr. Trump’s nominees, notably Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the choice for health secretary and an ardent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, are certain to receive hostile receptions, large numbers of Democrats will probably vote for many others. Still, Democrats are preparing a furious assault against the nominees by going after the   himself and trying to drive a wedge between them over his most incendiary promises, like banning Muslim immigrants and bringing back torture. “Where will they come down?” Mr. Schumer, the new Democratic leader, asked in an interview. “Will they try to persuade the president that’s the wrong way to take America?” Democrats plan to keep the focus on the   to a degree with few historical parallels. New presidents usually serve as a backdrop this year, by contrast, Mr. Trump’s words will loom over the hearings as Democrats press the nominees to take a position on them. Democrats have little chance of blocking any of the nominees, having given up the use of the filibuster in such cases when they were in the majority, but they say Mr. Trump has handed them ample political ammunition. Mr. Sessions is certain to be asked whether he, as attorney general, would make good on Mr. Trump’s pledges to get a special counsel to “jail” Hillary Clinton over her email server. General Kelly can expect questions about whether he favors Mr. Trump’s call to build a wall on the Mexican border and create a database on Muslims. Mr. Pompeo is likely to be asked about his views on Mr. Trump’s support for waterboarding and his skepticism about the intelligence agencies’ findings on Russian election meddling. Mr. Tillerson will probably face a grilling over Mr. Trump’s vow to “cancel” the Paris climate accord. Mr. Tillerson has spent hours trying to quietly assure lawmakers that he would take a more distant stance than Mr. Trump on the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, with whom Mr. Tillerson had close relations as the head of Exxon Mobil. The Trump transition team, which did not comment on the background checks, is bracing its nominees for questions about the  ’s more controversial positions, according to people with knowledge of the preparations. But officials would not say what tack the nominees would take in responding. “I have no doubt that the   and a number of his comments will come up,” said Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions’s confirmation team. “But Senator Sessions has a long record of service himself. ” Mr. Sessions will testify before the Judiciary Committee, which is generally friendly territory for sitting senators. But he is likely to face blistering questions from Democrats who are concerned about his civil rights record. In the 1980s, racially charged accusations derailed his nomination to a federal judgeship. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she would press Mr. Sessions to say where he stood on Mr. Trump’s pledges to have a special counsel further investigate Mrs. Clinton’s emails. “Hillary’s situation is done, and other than some kind of gross retribution, there’s no reason for that to even be something to look at,” Ms. Feinstein said in an interview. By posing tough questions, said Sarah A. Binder, a political scholar at George Washington University, Democrats will try to lure the nominees into inflicting political damage on themselves by adopting some of Mr. Trump’s more divisive language. She said the terrain was so risky that the nominees might be better served by adopting a stance usually seen only from judicial nominees: “Don’t take a position. ” Democrats intend to use all the procedural moves available to slow the process on the Senate floor, possibly spending up to 30 hours per nominee, denying Mr. Trump a full cabinet when he takes office. Republicans are indignant. “Holding up confirmations just for delay’s sake is irresponsible and it is dangerous,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. He added, “This is a dangerous world we are living in, and why in the world would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues delay for delay’s sake   Trump getting to fill his cabinet, particularly these important national security offices?”"

"The F. B. I. has arrested a Volkswagen executive in Florida, accusing him of playing a central role in a broad conspiracy to keep United States regulators from discovering that diesel vehicles made by the company were programmed to cheat on emissions tests. The executive, Oliver Schmidt, a German who is the former top emissions compliance manager for Volkswagen in the United States, was arrested on Saturday by investigators in Florida on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. He is expected to be arraigned on Monday. The arrest of Mr. Schmidt is an escalation of the criminal investigation into emissions cheating by Volkswagen and comes amid talks between the company and the United States Justice Department about what penalties the carmaker should accept as part of a settlement. After a study by West Virginia University first raised questions over Volkswagen’s diesel motors in early 2014, Mr. Schmidt played a central role in trying to convince regulators that excess emissions were caused by technical problems rather than by deliberate cheating, Ian Dinsmore, an F. B. I. agent, said in a sworn affidavit used as the basis for Mr. Schmidt’s arrest. Mr. Schmidt deceived American regulators “by offering reasons for the discrepancy other than the fact that VW was intentionally cheating on U. S. emissions tests, in order to allow VW to continue to sell diesel vehicles in the United States,” the affidavit said. Mr. Schmidt continued to represent Volkswagen after the company admitted in September that cars were programmed to dupe regulators. He appeared before a committee of the British Parliament in January, telling legislators that Volkswagen’s behavior was not illegal in Europe. Lawyers representing Mr. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment late Sunday. Officials at the Justice Department also declined to comment, as did an F. B. I. spokesman in Detroit. In a statement, Jeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said that the automaker “continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice” but that “it would not be appropriate to comment on any ongoing investigations or to discuss personnel matters. ” A Volkswagen spokesman in Germany also declined to comment. Lawsuits filed against Volkswagen by the New York and Massachusetts state attorneys general accused Mr. Schmidt of playing an important role in the carmaker’s efforts to conceal its emissions cheating from United States regulators. In 2014, when California air quality officials began an investigation of Volkswagen emissions, Mr. Schmidt was general manager of Volkswagen’s Engineering and Environmental Office based in Auburn Hills, Mich. For more than a year, he and other Volkswagen officials repeatedly cited false technical explanations for the high emissions levels, the authorities said. In September 2015, Mr. Schmidt and other Volkswagen officials formally acknowledged the existence of a   defeat device that allowed Volkswagen cars to cheat emissions tests. Volkswagen’s   and belated confession angered officials from the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency, and it is likely to have vastly increased the cost to the company from the scandal. It has already agreed to pay $16 billion to owners of diesel vehicles and will probably have to pay several billion dollars more in fines. Volkswagen eventually said that it had fitted 11 million diesel cars worldwide with illegal software that made the vehicles capable of defeating pollution tests. The software enabled the cars to sense when they were being tested for emissions and turn on   systems to curb emissions at the cost of engine performance. But those controls were not fully deployed on the road, where cars spewed nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times the levels allowed under the Clean Air Act. James Liang, a former Volkswagen engineer who worked for the company in California, pleaded guilty in September to charges that included conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violating the Clean Air Act. But Mr. Schmidt’s arrest brings the investigation into the executive ranks. The arrest came as Volkswagen and the Justice Department neared a deal to pay more than $2 billion to resolve the criminal investigation into the emissions cheating. The company or one of its corporate entities is expected to plead guilty as part of the deal. The settlement could come as early as next week, barring any   hiccups, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. The German automaker has been eager to put the Justice Department investigation behind it before   Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20. American prosecutors had traveled to Germany in recent months to interview Volkswagen executives, according to German prosecutors. The criminal case against Volkswagen, and the potential guilty plea, set it apart from other recent auto industry investigations. In settlements with General Motors and Toyota over their handling of safety defects, for example, the companies agreed to pay large fines but did not plead guilty. Prosecutors are also mulling criminal charges against Takata, the Japanese manufacturer under criminal investigation for its defective airbags. Volkswagen has already agreed to pay up to nearly $16 billion to resolve civil claims in what has become one of the largest consumer   settlements ever in the United States, involving half a million cars. Under the settlement, most car owners have the option of either selling their vehicles back to Volkswagen or getting them fixed, provided the automaker could propose a fix that satisfied regulators. The scandal has affected many Volkswagen and Audi models, including the Audi A3 and Volkswagen Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat diesel cars."

I’ve got to say for once Joe Biden has shown some real balls. 
The threat to jail fossil fuel executives presumably includes current or former executives like his son Hunter Biden (Burisma) and Nancy Pelosi’s son Paul Pelosi (Viscoil), and who knows how many other children of prominent Democrats who hold or have held lucrative fossil fuel directorships in the Ukraine and elsewhere. 
It takes a courageous politician to threaten jail time for his own kin, and the children of some of his most important political allies.

"A controversial experiment with a   workday in one of Sweden’s largest cities wrapped up this week with a cheerful conclusion: Shorter working hours make for happier, healthier and more productive employees. There’s just one catch. The practice is too expensive and unwieldy to become widespread in Sweden anytime soon. The   trial, which took place in the southern city of Gothenburg, centered on a municipal retirement home where workers were switched to a   day, from eight hours, with no pay cut. Seventeen new nursing positions were created to make up for the loss of time, at a cost of around 700, 000 euros, or $738, 000, a year. Although it was small, the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work, namely whether investing in a better   balance for employees, and treating workers well rather than squeezing them, benefits the bottom line for companies and economies. “The trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day,” said Daniel Bernmar, the leader of the Left party on Gothenburg’s City Council, which had pushed for the experiment. “They include healthier staff, a better work environment and lower unemployment. ” But the high price tag, and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday, was likely to discourage widespread support for taking the concept nationwide. “The government is avoiding talking about the issue,” Mr. Bernmar said. “They’re not interested in looking at the bigger picture. ” While a growing number of countries and companies are studying the concept of employee happiness, the idea of improving it through shorter work hours has by no means gained broad traction. In Gothenburg, the City Council’s conservative opposition parties derided the experiment as a utopian folly and sought to kill it, citing high costs for taxpayers and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace. The current government is also not backing a shorter workweek. Even the handful of progressive political groups aligned with Mr. Bernmar’s Left party have not made a   workday in Sweden a priority in their platforms. Nor have large Swedish companies, including multinationals active around the world, embraced the idea. Other Swedish towns that previously conducted limited experiments with a shorter   workweek eventually abandoned the concept, citing high costs and flawed implementation. A similar model in France has been controversial for more than 15 years, ever since a Socialist government made a   workweek mandatory. François Fillon, a conservative politician who is considered the   to become France’s new president in elections this May, has vowed to kill it if he wins. Companies of all sizes in France have complained repeatedly that the short workweek requirement has damaged competitiveness and generated billions in additional costs. French unions defend the measure as protecting workers from employers who might otherwise return to more onerous workplace conditions. Still, some large companies are beginning to explore the argument that happy workers may make better, more productive employees. Amazon, Google and Deloitte recently began experiments to compress the   week into four days for some employees. Amazon, which has come under fire for encouraging employees to work long hours, announced last summer that it would test a   workweek for a small group of employees and managers, giving them 75 percent of their current pay but leaving them with the same benefits as other workers. In the experiment at the Gothenburg retirement home, employees reported working with greater efficiency and energy when their hours were cut to six from eight a day. They called in sick 15 percent less than before and perceived their health to have improved at least 20 percent, according to a preliminary review issued last year. At a nearby municipal retirement home, where a control trial left working conditions unchanged, employees reported increased blood pressure and said they perceived no improvement in their health, peace of mind or alertness, the review showed. A final report is scheduled to be released in March. The program increased Gothenburg’s costs by 22 percent, mostly to pay for new employees. But around 10 percent was offset by reduced costs to the state from people being taken off the unemployment rolls and paying taxes into the system, rather than receiving state subsidies, Mr. Bernmar said. Modest experiments are moving ahead in a handful of small towns in Sweden, mostly in the public health care sector, to see if the results from Gothenburg can be duplicated. This year, four additional Swedish municipalities are expected to start research programs. A small but growing number of private Swedish companies, mainly technology   are also dabbling with the concept, following the lead of some established companies, including a Toyota service center in Gothenburg that has successfully operated on a   day for more than a decade. The bigger issue, Mr. Bernmar argues, is whether policy makers are willing to explore a connection between human happiness and health and productivity. Despite arguments that governments have no business in setting happiness as a public policy goal, leaders in several countries, including Italy, Japan and Qatar, are increasingly paying attention to the concept. The question, Mr. Bernmar added, was “should we work to live, not live to work?”"
"SAN FRANCISCO  —   In 1949, a Life magazine photographer named Gjon Mili made a pilgrimage to the French Riviera to see Pablo Picasso. Mili had come up with a way to photograph trails of light, and he wanted to shoot Picasso “drawing” in midair with a light pen  —   a process that would leave no trace except on film. Picasso loved it. The result, published in Life and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, was Picasso’s celebrated series of “light drawings” of bulls and centaurs and the like  —   photographs that captured him in the act of creating the ultimate in ephemeral art. Picasso is long gone. But some 68 years later, Google has been calling on dozens of artists, animators and illustrators with a   update of Mili’s concept  —   a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it, at least for viewers wearing a VR headset. In place of Gjon Mili are Drew Skillman and Patrick Hackett, a pair of video game developers turned virtual reality enthusiasts who live in San Francisco. They were trying to build a   chess application one night a couple of years ago when they discovered it had an unexpected side effect: As you moved the chess pieces around in virtual space, they left trails of light behind. Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature, the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails, hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions. In April 2015, seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called Tilt Brush, Google bought their company for an undisclosed sum  —   which is how Mr. Skillman and Mr. Hackett have come to be ensconced in the company’s offices near the downtown waterfront here. With Google’s support, Tilt Brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing, painting, even sculpting in space. It was released in April as a free   to the new HTC Vive, an $800 virtual reality system produced by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC in partnership with Valve, an American video game developer. (It’s on sale as a $30 software package from Valve’s online store.) Reviewers immediately dubbed it the Vive’s killer app. This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman’s apartment, a    studio in South Park, the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco’s digerati since the 1990s. “Not in our wildest dreams,” said Mr. Skillman, a slightly built    with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest, unassuming manner. Tilt Brush got its name because in its earliest versions, you would draw or paint on a   surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space. But because the HTC Vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of   controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space, the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a   area  —   no surface required. One controller serves as a palette, with dozens of colors and effects the other acts as a brush or pen. To watch someone use it is a bit unnerving, since the person appears to be making marks in midair, but you can’t actually see those. But put on a Vive headset and step between the sensors yourself  —   as I did in a windowless room in Google’s New York offices  —   and the illusion of delusion disappears. Instead, you suddenly see what has been produced: a phantom creation in three dimensions, something you can walk around, walk through, poke your head inside, do everything except touch. Google’s investment in virtual reality pales beside Facebook’s $2 billion purchase of the VR pioneer Oculus. Still, Tilt Brush is part of a growing effort, one that began with the introduction in 2014 of supercheap cardboard headsets that work with smartphones, and continues with the recent release of a stunning virtual reality version of Google Earth as a free download for Vive owners. Over the past year, Google has invited more than 60 people to try Tilt Brush and offer feedback, and this week the company is unveiling their work and participation. “You would never want to create an artistic tool with only engineers,” said Mr. Skillman. “That’s just absurd. ” According to Tory Voight, Google’s Tilt Brush program manager, those who have joined this    program include Dustin Yellin, a Brooklyn artist known for his   collages encased in layers of glass, and Jonathan Yeo, a British painter whose portrait of Kevin Spacey as the fictional American president Francis J. Underwood was exhibited last year at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery. Jeff Koons, whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $58 million, had early access, though he was not part of the artists in residence program. Bob Mankoff, Roz Chast and other cartoonists for The New Yorker have also checked it out, as has Alex Hirsch, the young animator behind Disney’s hit television series “Gravity Falls. ” Last June, Mr. Hirsch posted a sample creation on Twitter along with an enthusiastic status update: “Drawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a   wizard god!” But the first to try it was Glen Keane, a   figure who in his 37 years at Disney had brought the warmth of   animation to such characters as Ariel (in “The Little Mermaid”) Aladdin, Tarzan and Pocahontas. “When I left Disney in 2012,” Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif. “I told them it was because I know there’s something new coming  —   I don’t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it. ” He was still looking when he met Regina Dugan, then the leader of Google’s secretive Advanced Technology and Products group, which was experimenting with virtual reality. First he partnered with the group to make a   virtual reality short called “Duet,” a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an Academy Award. “Duet” broke new ground, since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been  . But though he’d spent a lifetime drawing on paper, Mr. Keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear. “The goal would be to animate not on paper but in space,” he said. Enter Tilt Brush, which Mr. Keane encountered when Mr. Skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in San Francisco. Though still in a primitive state, it was maturing rapidly, and Mr. Keane soon became a convert. In September 2015, seven months before its release, he previewed its capabilities with “Step Into the Page,” a   video. “The edges of the paper are no longer there,” he exclaimed in a   as he did a loose, freehand sketch of Ariel in virtual space. “This is not a flat drawing. This is sculptural drawing. ” Scott McCloud, the graphic artist whose book “Understanding Comics” is considered the ultimate guide to the art form, got to play with Tilt Brush when Google invited him to its Silicon Valley headquarters in August. “I don’t mind saying, I’m a little bit obsessed with this program,” he said as we sat in his small,   office in a mall in the Los Angeles exurb of Thousand Oaks. “One thing that appeals to me the most is, it’s still very early. Everyone is asking fundamental questions. We’re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for. I love it when technology is in that stage. ” So, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. “I doodle with it,” said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. “I describe it as a   sketchbook. ” What it won’t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call “Flatland. ” For denizens of Flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of   this can be problematic. Mr. Mankoff, the cartoon editor at The New Yorker, came up with some characteristically     drawings during the two days he spent using Tilt Brush with Ms. Chast and other colleagues at Google’s New York offices. But though he professes to have enjoyed the experience, he seems unlikely to lead The New Yorker out of Flatland. “You’ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists,” he said. “Or it may just not work  —   but that’s no reason not to try it. ” One suggestion the New Yorker team had: cubes and cylinders and other   shapes to draw on, “so you’re not starting from zero in   space. ” (Google has since implemented a similar idea.) Other than that, Mr. Mankoff offered with a grin: “The advice I would have for Google is, more cats. You can’t go wrong with cats. ” Mr. Keane has a different item on his wish list. Currently, works created in Tilt Brush are as motionless as a New Yorker cartoon. They’re essentially static, and Mr. Keane is an animator. “To me, the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space,” he said as I viewed a Tilt Brush drawing called “Victory Dance” in his studio. The piece captures a brief moment in time, seconds after his daughter’s high school choir had won a national championship  —   but it begs to be brought to life. “Just like you have a spatial dimension, you’ve got to have time as a dimension,” Mr. Keane continued. “There’s no reason you can’t do that. I’m not smart enough to figure it out. But Drew is. ”"
"**The sausage-skin maker Devro is to close one of its two Lanarkshire factories with the loss of 90 jobs.**
The company has announced a proposal to shut its Bellshill operation.
Devro said it intends to increase manufacturing at its other North Lanarkshire site in Moodiesburn, which recently received a Â£2m investment.
It said the closure was in response to changing consumer trends and was ""part of Devro's drive to achieve a fully integrated global business"".
Chief executive Rutger Helbing said: ""Scotland will remain strategically important to Devro's global operations.
""However, the collagen market is evolving and we must look at how we manage our business and stay competitive.""
He added: ""Decisions like this are never easy. I know this will be an uncertain time for many colleagues, their families and the wider community.
""Our priority now is to ensure we have the right support in place for those who may be affected by these plans.""
Unite pledged to support the affected staff.
The union's regional industrial officer, Wendy Dunsmore, said: ""The announcement is devastating for the workforce.
""It's vital that everything is done through this consultation period to ensure there are no compulsory redundancies. The company has stated that it wants to increase the range of products at its nearby site in Moodiesburn.
""We are calling on the company to guarantee job security and a future for the Moodiesburn site.
""As part of this process, it will be vital to protect and safeguard all modern equipment in Scotland."""

Listen up Auckland City Council, Environment Canterbury and the Nelson City Council and any other politically correct bodies who’ve been quick to jump on the climate change emergency bandwagon. Sucked in by hundreds of councils worldwide saying “action on climate change has to be prioritised at all levels of society and government”, you’d all better listen-up to the new kids in town talking about **“mass delusion”**.



The Aussies pipped us at the post by becoming enlightened before we’d even thought about the economic downside of our adopted climate change delusion. It’s not hard to understand why our frenemies jumped the gun: they are not keen to stick a knife into the back of their oil and gas industry or tell farmers to cull their farting cows, and they are certainly much more enthusiastic about protecting their lucrative mining industry than we are.



While we are stuck in the dark ages, beating our breasts about the “impending climate disaster”, 75 Australians stuck their heads above the parapet to say in unison “ **CO 2 is good for the planet**“. Shock, horror: conservative politicians, industry and mining leaders are the Australian contingent of [CLINTEL](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/09/28/global-climate-intelligence-group-founded/), the global climate intelligence group putting the science back into climate science.



CLINTEL wrote a letter to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the UN’s chief climate negotiator, Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, describing the benefits of cutting greenhouse gas emissions as “imagined”.



“The letter says: “ **Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming** , while politicians should dispassionately **count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.** ”



  
This worldwide movement is challenging the UN wealth distribution machine, aka climate change emergency, which has spread into local government statements like the following from Environment Canterbury. 



“ **The science is irrefutable** – climate change is already impacting ecosystems and communities around the world, with increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods and droughts; melting polar ice sheets; sea level rise and coastal inundation and erosion; and impacts on biodiversity including species loss and extinction.”



  
Actually, the science **is** refutable – which is exactly why 500 scientists bothered to write to the UN. 



Seasonal weather storms cause coastal erosion and sea levels are currently rising at an average rate of 30 centimetres every 100 years, which is not catastrophic. Whether they will continue at this rate is not clear, and as for species extinction, there are prevailing factors other than global warming. 



“Our planet is now in the midst of its sixth mass extinction of plants and animals — the sixth wave of extinctions in the past half-billion years. 



We’re currently experiencing the worst spate of species die-offs since the loss of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year.



Unlike past mass extinctions, caused by events like asteroid strikes, volcanic eruptions, and natural climate shifts, the current crisis is almost entirely caused by _us_ — humans. In fact, **99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming.”**



  
Scientists agree the earth is warming, but by how much and why, is not clear. Climate change predictors of impending catastrophe blame human intervention, arguing that **unless we change our behaviour we will experience climate disaster.**



Until now, climate change deniers of this impending doom have been largely quiet, so the emergence of a large group of prominent scientists and professionals changes everything. Climate change scaremongers no longer get to peddle their theories about man-made climate change unchallenged. As _The BDF_ ‘s resident writer on climate change, WH, says: the science is far from settled.



I’m not sorry to say that unless the greenies evolve, their days are numbered. They’ve been nothing but an expensive pain in the butt destroying our farming, transport, mining and energy industries and they’ve scared the children!



Teachers should hasten back to their classrooms with revised curricula to teach the important stuff. Now that we’re clear about the imagined climate change doom and gloom, we can look forward to a bright and prosperous future. 



Teachers can dispel student anxiety that the end of the world is nigh, and instead tell them about the desperately needed scientists, geologists and mining engineers for the oil, gas and mining boom awaiting us when this toxic handbrake is released.

Greta stopped going to school, and even stopped eating, before her parents “helped” her by convincing her to become a climate activist.
Greta Thunberg’s father: ‘She is happy, but I worry’Greta Thunberg’s father has said he thought it was “a bad idea” for his daughter to take to the “front line” of the battle against climate change.Millions of people have been inspired to join the 16-year-old in raising awareness of environmental issues.But Svante Thunberg told the BBC he was “not supportive” of his daughter skipping school for the climate strike.Mr Thunberg said Greta was much happier since becoming an activist – but that he worries about the “hate” she faces.…Struggle with depressionSpeaking to Husain as part of the show, Mr Thunberg said his daughter had struggled with depression for “three or four years” before she began her school strike.“She stopped talking… she stopped going to school,” he said.He added that it was the “ultimate nightmare for a parent” when Greta began refusing to eat.…Over the next few years they began discussing and researching climate change, with Greta becoming increasingly passionate about tackling the issue.…Read more: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50901789

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite phony wind lobby surveys claiming that over 90% of Germans support an expansion of wind power (and only a 5% fringe oppose), German wind park projects have hit the brick wall of intense citizens’ protest.

German protesters demand a stop to the “madness” of the industrialization of nature. Image: proNatur Citizens Initiative. 
For example, German environmental protection group www.naturschutz-initiative here reports how the approval for three wind turbines in the Butzbach municipal forest granted by the Giessen Regional Council on 12 October 2018 has been deemed illegal.
According to their press release:
After the discussion meeting on 22 January 2020, the administrative court revoked the permit on 28 January 2020. The environmental association Naturschutzinitiative e.V. (NI) had taken legal action against the State of Hesse primarily because in its opinion the permit violates European law. For example, exceptions to the ban on killing wasp and buzzard were permitted which are not compatible with the European Birds Directive.”
Huge protester turnout in Odenwald
In the region of Odenwald/Rothenberg, a planned additional wind farm of 13 turbines, each 250 meters tall, on the ridge between Rothenberg and Beerfelden was met with fierce protest from 300 demonstrators, reports regional online site Fact.de here.
According to Fact.de, “It was a strong appearance of the young Rothenberg citizens’ initiative proNatur, with support from many parts of the Odenwald.
What’s really impressive: the proNatur citizens protest group had been founded just 6 days earlier!

Irmgard Neuer, spokeswoman of the citizens’ initiative said: “A good 300 people of all age groups had gathered at the gymnasium in Rothenberg with banners, drums, whistles and warning vests to loudly oppose the planned additional wind farm of enormous dimensions in the region.”
“No positive effect on nature”
One of the protest mobilizers, leader Vera Krug of Siedelsbrunn, admonished her fellow protesters “not to let up and to inform all fellow citizens about the negative effects of the industrialization of nature”.
“No destruction of nature ever has a positive effect on the climate”, Vera Krug stated.
Local citizens fear that the quality of life in the area would be severely damaged by the installation of 13 huge wind turbines “without any real benefit for the climate”.
Fact.de reports:
Before the demonstration at the village center broke up, ‘everyone agreed that the destruction of nature by wind industry plants should not be allowed either in the Odenwald or in any other forest’.”
Wind turbine proponents were surprised by the large protester turnout.
Bitter divisions in once peaceful communities
Wind energy opposition has become an extremely  polarizing issue in Germany, one that has led to bitter divisions in once peaceful communities, especially those in rural areas.
The issue of rural wind park industrialization has become such a hot topic that according to Fact.de: “Ruth Bender of the Wall Street Journal had traveled from Berlin to report on the demonstration. She stayed overnight at the local “Hirschen” and talked to several protagonists on site. The Südwestrundfunk (SWR) had also sent a camera team to Rothenberg for reporting.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe perspective that polar bears  are endangered by global warming because reduced sea ice limits their seal-hunting opportunities is contradicted by observations of (a) polar bears thriving (body condition) during melt season, and (b) no trends in reduced seal consumption by polar bears in the 21st century.
From the 1880s to 1940s, the Arctic’s Beaufort Sea was up to 3°C warmer than the 2000s (Durantou et al., 2012).
Consequently, during this warmer period, the region’s sea ice coverage endured over a month less (i.e., 34 fewer days of sea ice) than it does today.
Somehow the region’s polar bears managed to survive with warmer temperatures and less sea ice.

Image Source: Durantou et al., 2012
New study: No change in seal diet of Beaufort Sea polar bears (2004-2016)
A new study (Bourque et al., 2020) finds about 65% of the Beaufort Sea polar bear diet consists of ringed and bearded seals.
Trend analysis indicates this shows there is no “clear increases or decreases in proportional consumption of any prey species” from 2004 to 2016. Further, “the effect for melt season was not significant for any individual prey (p > .10)”.
In other words, polar bears were consuming no fewer seals in 2016 than they did in 2004.
The reduction in sea ice hasn’t limited polar bears’ feeding practices.

Image Source: Bourque et al., 2020
That polar bears continue to feast on seals when sea ice is less available in the late summer is not surprising to native populations. Inuit hunters have observed polar bears capturing seals on “really thin” ice (Wong et al., 2017). Thick sea ice isn’t necessary.

Polar bears’ best body condition is in August-October – after sea ice breakup occurs

Polar bears’ worst body condition – when they’re at their thinnest – occurs during the months of the year when sea ice is thick: April and May.
Their best, well-fed body condition occurs during the months when sea ice is at its thinnest, or after the seasonal ice break-up occurs: August to October.
Scientists acknowledge the “increase in body condition after break-up date was somewhat unexpected” (Galicia et al., 2020).

Image Source: Galicia et al., 2020
“Consensus” science and the “emotional charging of the polar bear”
The likely reason polar bears’ seal-hunting resiliency is “unexpected” is because many scientists have assumed the popular claim that polar bear habitats are threatened by declining sea ice is accurate.
After all, that’s what the “consensus” says.
Anyone who disagrees with the declining-sea-ice-threatens-polar-bears narrative is a “denier” engaging in “denial” according to scientists like Michael E. Mann (Harvey et al., 2018).
Some scientists have been honest enough to acknowledge the “horror stories” about “extremely skinny” or “starving” bears “on the brink of extinction” are an example of the “emotional charging of the polar bear” compromising objective analysis (Sellheim, 2020).

Image Source: Sellheim, 2020
Estimates of of the size of polar bear populations can range from 19,000 to 30,000 – an enormous uncertainty range.
Of the 19 distinct polar bear populations in the Arctic, just 7 are thought to be declining. The status of the other 12 populations is either stable, increasing, or unknown.
Perhaps a little more skepticism – rather than “emotional charging” – would be recommended in polar bear ecological science.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
As the earth’s climate sensitivity is perhaps _the_ key factor in what climate lies ahead, we’ll often report on scientific findings that enhance our understanding of this important parameter.   
  
Recall from our previous discussion, that the earth’s “climate sensitivity” is the amount that the average global surface temperature will rise, given a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from its pre-industrial value. This metric is the key to understanding how much global warming will occur as we continue to burn fossil fuels for energy and emit the resultant CO2 into the atmosphere.   
  
And as we mentioned, the big problem is that scientists don’t know what the true value of the climate sensitivity really is. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) summed up its assessment of the science regarding the value of the climate sensitivity in its 2007 _Fourth Assessment Report_ (AR4) thusly:   




It is _likely_ to be in the range 2°C to 4.5°C with a best estimate of about 3.0°C, and is _very unlikely_ to be less than 1.5°C. Values substantially higher than 4.5°C cannot be excluded...



New findings seem to be coming in with some regularity since the publication of the AR4 that the IPCC’s estimate is on the high side of reality. We discussed some of these findings in our publication _Addendum: Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States_ (p.26-27) and more recent ones in a _Global Science Report_ last month.   
  
Now we have another new, lower estimate, to report on.   




Just published in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ is a paper by Julia Hargreaves, James Annan and two Japanese colleagues titled “Can the Last Glacial Maximum [LGM] constrain climate sensitivity?” While Hargreaves et al. don’t really answer that question directly, they use a new determination of the cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum to derive estimates of the climate sensitivity (although their estimates come replete with caveats). So, they must think they are on to something.   
  
Their estimates are derived using two different statistical techniques, one employing regression relationships between tropical temperatures during the LGM and climate model climate sensitivity, and another using a Bayesian approach weighting each climate model based on how well it matches the new LGM data. The two methods produced very similar results, with a mean equilibrium climate sensitivity of about 2.5°C with a 90% confidence range of about 1°C to 4°C. This result is more tightly constrained than the IPCC estimate and also shifted a bit towards lower values.   
  
One of the caveats from the Hargreaves et al. is that the climate models whose results they tried to match with the LGM conditions did not include the influence of atmospheric dust and vegetation changes, influences which the authors note “while these are poorly constrained, they are likely to be net cooling influences.”   
  
They made a “rather simplistic” attempt to approximate the influence of atmospheric dust and found that it dropped their sensitivity estimates even further, to about 2°C, with the low end of the 90% confidence range falling below 1.0°C. Recall that in the AR4, the IPCC stated that it was “very unlikely” that the equilibrium climate sensitivity was below 1.5°C. In IPCC parlance, “very unlikely” means with less than a 10% chance of occurrence. We would venture to say that Hargreaves, Annan and colleagues found a substantially greater chance that the true climate sensitivity lies below 1.5°C.   
  
While this will almost surely not be the last we hear from these authors on this matter as they indicate that there is still plenty of work to be done using newer climate models and improved climate forcing and paleo-temperature estimates, it is definitely an interesting initial effort/result.   
  
In Figure 1 (below), we’ve added the two sets of climate sensitivity estimates from Hargreaves et al. into our chart of new, lower, climate sensitivity estimates published in just the last 2 years or so (our initial chart was first reported here).   






  




Figure 1. Climate sensitivity estimates from new research published since 2010 (colored), compared with the range given in the IPCC _Fourth Assessment Report_ (black). The arrows indicate the 5 to 95% confidence bounds for each estimate along with the mean (vertical line) where available. Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The right-hand side of the IPCC range is dotted to indicate that the IPCC does not actually state the value for the upper 95% confidence bound of their estimate. The thick black line represents the IPCC’s “likely” range.   
  
Over time, our guess is that this chart will continue to expand with the addition of new studies.   
  
Stay tuned!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreta Thunberg lives in Sweden. According to peer-reviewed science, Sweden was at least 3°C warmer than it is today about 6000 to 9000 years ago, when CO2 concentrations lingered around 265 ppm. At 410 ppm CO2, 21st century Sweden is colder now than almost any time in the last 9000 years.

A Much Warmer Northern Hemisphere
During the Medieval Warm Period, wine vineyards flourished in Scandinavia and Russia at the same latitude (55°N) where polar bears roam today.

Image Source: Lamb, 1959
Earlier in the Holocene, when CO2 levels hovered around 260 ppm, vast forests extended all the way up to the coasts of the Arctic Ocean (Russia), suggesting temperatures were up to 7°C warmer than today (MacDonald et al., 2000).

Image Source: MacDonald et al., 2000
The limits of Arctic sea ice (north of Greenland) extended 1000 kilometers further north of where sea ice extends to today (2007), as Arctic Ocean temperatures were 2-4°C warmer about 8500 to 6000 years ago (Funder et al., 2011).

Image Source: Funder et al., 2011
Throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Austria, Canada, Iceland, Russia), summer air temperatures were about 3° to 5°C warmer than today between 10,000 and 8000 years ago, when CO2 values held steady at 260 ppm (Ilyashuk et al., 2011).

Greta Thunberg’s Sweden: Colder As CO2 Rises

Greta Thunberg has been warning the world about the dangerous warming consequences of the modern rise in CO2 concentrations.
And yet despite CO2 levels rising from 260 ppm to 410 ppm since the Early Holocene, the country where she resides has continued to record nearly the coldest temperatures of the last 9000 years.

For example, permafrost that exists today in northern Sweden wasn’t present just a few hundred years ago, as the region was too warm to support permafrost until recent centuries (Sannel et al., 2018).

Image Source: Sannel et al., 2018
Tree trunk remains located 600 to 700 meters atop the limits of today’s barren mountain treelines (northern Sweden) date to the Early Holocene, suggesting (with the lapse rate) temperatures were 3-4°C  warmer than today from about 9000 to 6000 years ago (Kullman, 2018).

Image Source: Kullman, 2018
There are many proxy reconstructions that show modern Sweden’s temperatures are either the coldest or nearly the coldest of the last 9000 years. They also suggest most of the Holocene was 3°C to 4°C warmer than today for this region (Antonsson and Seppä, 2007, Bigler e tal., 2002, Bigler et al., 2006, Borzenkova et al., 2015, Grudd, 2008).

Does Greta Know?
These scientific conclusions affirming a much warmer Northern Hemisphere and Sweden do not support the poplularized  position that climate change is a manifest consequence of a dangerous rise in CO2 emissions.
Greta Thunberg likely hasn’t been made aware of this science; it undermines the narrative the adults around her have been pushing.

From Dr. Susan Crockford’s Polar Bear Science
Posted on February 27, 2020 | Comments Off on State of the Polar Bear Report 2019: Are polar bear researchers hiding good news?
International Polar Bear Day is a good day to ask: Are polar bear researchers hiding good news? Extended lags in publishing polar bear counts and a failure to publish data on female polar bear body weights and cub survival in Western Hudson Bay for more than 25 years make it look like polar bear researchers are delaying and suppressing good news.

In particular, the failure to report the data on cub survival and weights of female bears suggests that these health measures have not declined over the last two decades as claimed. If these figures are indeed the strongest evidence that sea ice loss due to climate change is harming Western Hudson Bay polar bears, why on earth have they not been made public? And why won’t a single journalist ask to see that data?
GWPF press release, London, 27 February 2020:
A prominent Canadian zoologist has suggested that scientists may be hiding a spate of good news on polar bears.
In State of the Polar Bear Report 2019, published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) on International Polar Bear Day, Dr Susan Crockford explains publication of population counts for several Arctic regions have been long overdue.
Data on the body condition of female bears and survival of cubs in Western Hudson Bay have not been published in over 25 years, despite claims that these are key measures of the impact of climate change on bears.
According to Dr Crockford, this may well be because the data do not support claims of disaster for the bears.
Dr Crockford also says that sea ice conditions for Western and Southern Hudson Bay bears have been excellent in recent years.
“It can hardly be claimed that lack of sea ice is causing Western and Southern Hudson Bay polar bear numbers to decline as a result of poor cub survival and reduced weights of adult females when breakup and freeze-up dates have been so advantageous for the last three years,” Dr Crockford said.
The report also looks at recent incidents when two Russian Arctic towns were visited by polar bears, and suggestions that 2019 was the year of the polar bear ‘invasion’. The lives of local residents were certainly threatened by the congregations of bears, which numbered more than 50.
And as Dr Crockford explains, such large congregations of polar bears are likely to be an on-going problem because there are now so many polar bears roaming the Arctic and because virtually all communities still have open garbage dumps:
There is no evidence these 2019 ‘invasion’ incidents were caused by a local lack of sea ice or because the polar bears were starving. Right now, Arctic residents and visitors face a much greater risk of having a deadly encounter with a polar bear at almost any time of year than they did decades ago because polar bear populations are so much larger.
“Predictions of future calamity do not change the present reality that polar bears are abundant and thriving,” Dr Crockford said.

Key Findings
• Reports have yet to be published for polar bear population surveys of M’Clintock Channel and Viscount Melville (completed 2016 and 2014, respectively), Southern Beaufort and Gulf of Boothia (completed 2017) and Davis Strait (completed 2018), yet several were promised for 2019 or sooner.
• At present, the official IUCN Red List global population estimate (2015) is 22,000–31,000 (average about 26,000), but surveys conducted since then might raise the average to about 29,500.
• Despite having to deal with changes in summer sea ice habitat greater than all other Arctic regions, according to Norwegian biologists polar bears in the Svalbard area of the Barents Sea showed few negative impacts from the low sea ice years of 2016 through 2019.
• Despite repeated claims that the Southern Beaufort subpopulation is declining and nutritionally stressed, a summer survey of the coast of Alaska in 2019 documented 31 fat healthy polar bears onshore in July compared to only three in 2017, when sea ice retreat had been similarly early.
• In 2019, and contrary to expectations, freeze-up of sea ice on Western Hudson Bay came as early in the autumn as it did in the 1980s (for the third year in a row); sea ice breakup in spring was like the 1980s too, with the result that polar bears onshore were in excellent condition.
• If the public are to take seriously repeated claims of harm to polar bear health and survival due to climate change, data collected since 2004 on cub survival and weights of female polar bears in Western Hudson Bay must be made available: it has now been more than 25 years since data has been published on cub survival and weights of female polar bears in Western Hudson Bay but polar bear specialists continue to cite decades-old data to support their statements that lack of sea ice is causing declines in body condition and population size.
• Since polar bear researchers acknowledge that there has been no negative trend in either freeze-up or breakup dates for sea ice in Western Hudson Bay since at least 2001, the failure to report current data on cub survival and weights of female bears suggests that body condition and cub survival have not declined over the last two decades as claimed.
• Two separate incidents at opposite ends of the Russian Arctic at the beginning and the end of 2019 made this the year of the polar bear ‘invasion’. Belushya Guba in the Barents Sea over the winter of 2018/2019 and Ryrkaypiy, Chukotka in December 2019 were each besieged by more than 50 bears, which terrified local residents. Although tragedy was ultimately averted, this is likely to be an on-going problem for Arctic settlements in the future: not because there is not enough sea ice but because there are now so many polar bears roaming Arctic coastlines.

Parts of Europe have seen a couple of brief but intense heat waves this summer, and so some of the public got brainwashed by the media into thinking the continent’s summer climate is rapidly getting hotter and that all this is the new normal.
Yet, when we examine the unaltered data from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA) for locations in northern Europe that have long-term datasets available, we see there has been no July warming trend over the past decades. Media reports suggesting otherwise are nonsense.
Ireland
Looking at 6 stations in Ireland, we have the following for July:

Data source: JMA.
Overall, Ireland’s mean July temperatures have been cooling off modestly over the past 3 decades and more, even though three stations are located at airports.
Sweden
In the Nordic country of Sweden, where we find a very high amount of climate alarmism, July tempweratures there have changed very little over the past 2 decades, according to data from the JMA:

Data source: JMA.
Finland
In neighboring Finland, we find the following trends:

In Finland, 5 of 6 stations show no warming in July over the past two decades. Data source: JMA.
NOAA fudges, fakes a “new global July record”

The chart that set off the media claims of a record hot July globally was one provided to the media by the NOAA:

Note how the NOAA chart above shows records in areas where there were no thermometers to record earlier data. and infilled data are made up to show records.
Compare the above chart, which was issued to the public, to the one that results from surface thermometers across the globe below. Note the numerous, large gray areas which show no data are available.

Many of these areas were simply filled in with fantasy data.
Satellite data show no record
So what do the satellites, which have been measuring the the complete surface – without huge gaps – since 1979, tell us about July? No doubt the month was a hot one, but Dr. Roy Spencer here tells us it was probably only the 4th warmest July.
According to Dr. Spencer, the NOAA “record” results “come from a fairly limited and error-prone array of thermometers which were never intended to measure global temperature trends.”
He says their accuracy is hampered by problems such as urbanization, poor ocean temperature measurement methodology and that “both land and ocean temperatures are notoriously incomplete geographically.”
To show how greatly temperature measurement can vary, Spencer presents a Reanalysis chart for July:

Dr. Spencer comments: “Note from that figure how distorted the news reporting was concerning the temporary hot spells in France, which the media reports said contributed to global-average warmth.”

The latest Nobel Prize for chemistry has confirmed what science students are taught early on: that all scientific theories are intrinsically uncertain; that science progresses through skepticism and attacks on existing theories, and that successful attacks are sometimes rewarded with Nobel Prizes. It follows that skepticism about global warming, far from being antiscience, is in keeping with the standard scientific approach — and could one day fetch a skeptic a Nobel Prize.



The Nobel for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli scientist Daniel Shechtman for his discovery of “quasicrystals,” which violate standard theories about crystals. Scientists had believed that all crystals form in repeated periodic patterns, and commercial production of crystals was based on that understanding. But Shechtman exploded the conventional wisdom by discovering quasicrystals, which form regular patterns that never repeat.



When Schechtman first announced his discovery, his superiors were scornful, telling him he should review his basic chemistry textbooks. When he persisted, he was asked to leave his research group. His first paper on the topic was rejected by the _Journal of Applied Physics_. But Schechtman persevered, and he proved that what 99.9 percent of scientists believed was wrong.





Skepticism is at the very heart of the scientific method.



Sound familiar? We keep hearing that 95 percent or 98 percent of scientists believe catastrophic, man‐​made global warming is proven. Climate skeptics are widely denounced as science deniers. However, as Schechtman showed, 99 percent of scientists can be and have been wrong.



Science proves nothing beyond all doubt. Rather, it progresses by knocking down existing theories in favor of better ones, which in turn are subject to fresh attacks. Skepticism is at the very heart of the scientific method. The scientific approach is at odds not with climate‐​change skeptics, but with those who claim global warming is completely proven, contestable only by madmen and blackguards paid by oil companies.



A recent experiment at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland is casting doubt on another idea believed by about 100 percent of scientists: Einstein’s theory of relativity. CERN scientists have found particles called neutrinos that seemed to have traveled faster than light, challenging a fundamental plank of modern science. According to the theory of relativity, a particle traveling faster than light will go backward in time.



Environmentalists denounce climate skeptics as science deniers. But have the CERN scientists been denounced as Einstein deniers? No. The scientific community is shocked by the discovery but keeping an open mind — even about something as firmly established as the theory of relativity.



To say 95 percent of scientists believe in global warming suggests, incorrectly, that the skeptics are loonies. In fact, they have included Nobel laureates such as Ivar Giaever, Robert B. Laughlin, and Norman Borlaug. Giaever recently resigned from the American Physical Society in protest against its insistence that global warming is “incontrovertible.” He declared, “The claim … is that the [global average] temperature changed from 288.0 to 288.8 degrees Kelvin in 150 years, which (if true) means to me … that the temperature has been amazingly stable.”



The most scientists know about the climate is not much. They know so little that they can’t predict the next drought or El Niño. When they try to predict temperatures a century hence, it’s a real stretch.



When people know only a little about a topic, they tend to make a lot of the little they know. The little in this case is that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will raise temperatures if other things remain constant. But other things are not constant; they vary in ways we do not fully understand.



That’s why we cannot say why temperatures were high in the medieval period despite low carbon dioxide concentrations. It’s also why the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does not make a definite prediction of future temperatures, instead positing six scenarios ranging from benign to catastrophic.



We know so little about the climate that we can’t rule out the possibility of a catastrophe. So we can discuss how much insurance we should buy to cover a disaster that may never happen. But that’s different from planning for certain disaster.



Answering the insurance question requires massive funding of research not just by proponents of global warming, but also by skeptics — the breed that has repeatedly won Nobel Prizes for overthrowing the existing orthodoxy.

"SAN FRANCISCO  —   The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics  —   highlighted by Donald J. Trump’s election victory  —   has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight. “The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,” said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government’s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1, 025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin’s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1, 150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1, 000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low  —   under $200  —   in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a   American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. “I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,” Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA recent paper published in the Swedish journal Geografiska Annaler: Series A, Physical Geography authored by Holmlund and Holmlund, found that the strongest melts of the Storglaciären in Sweden occurred between the 1930s and 1960s.

The glacier mass then even increased from the early 1970s to the mid 1990s.
According to the authors, geodetic volume estimates of Storglaciären in Sweden suggest a 28% loss in total ice mass between 1910 and 2015, but the greatest part of the melt occurred in the mid 20th century – a time when CO2 levels were deemed to be at a safe level.
The authors used terrestrial photographs of Tarfala valley, where Storglaciären is situated, from 1910 to allow an accurate reconstruction of the glacier’s surface, past volume and mass. They found say that the likely start of a melting trend is supported by imagery from 1922, which shows almost no snow was present on top of Storglaciären, and other glaciers showed tendencies of retreat.
76% of the mass loss seen from 1910 to 2015 occurred between 1920 and 1970, i.e. in less than half of that 105 year period, they estimate.
The mass change of Storglaciären stabilized and even contained periods of increases in mass after 1970, their analysis shows.

Arctic sea ice stable over the past 10 years
It appears Arctic ice melt has slowed down over the recent decades, and has not accelerated like global warming alarmists like to claim.
Over  the past 10 years, Arctic sea ice minimum has not fallen in over a decade:

Guest “it’s time to go full-Chevron on these greenhadists”!
BERNIE SANDERS WANTS TO PROSECUTE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMPANIES, BUT DOESN’T KNOW WHAT LAWS THEY VIOLATEDAUGUST 27, 2019 | WILLIAM ALLISON 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is out with yet another climate proposal, this time to prosecute fossil fuel executives for causing climate change. […]The attack continues on his campaign website:“Bernie promises to go further than any other presidential candidate in history to end the fossil fuel industry’s greed, including by making the industry pay for its pollution and prosecuting it for the damage it has caused.” The problem? Sanders didn’t explain what laws these companies have broken. Spoiler alert: Providing affordable, reliable energy isn’t a crime anywhere, least of all in the United States.But because Sanders personally doesn’t like what these companies do, he believes they should be taken to court.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the German libertarian site achgut.com here, guest writer Ulrike Stockmann writes a portrait of climate activist Greta Thunberg’s family. The title: “The Thunberg-Ernmans: An infinitely sad family history“.

Ulrike Stockmann writes a portrait of the Ernman-Thunberg family. Image: achgut.com
Stockmann portrait is based on the published book by Greta Thunberg’s mother, Malena Ernman: “Scenes from the Heart”, which describes Greta’s past life and her path to becoming an environmental activist.
Family a drama and tragedy
Having read the book, Stockmann writes that “nothing surprises any more and that Greta being climate prophet is merely the tip of the iceberg of a family drama.”
What follows are excerpts of Stockmann’s portrait of the Ernman-Thunberg family:
Malena Ernman is a successful opera singer. Her husband Svante Thunberg is an actor. […] By the time Greta enters the fifth grade, suddenly she is no longer feeling well at all. She refuses to eat, cries all day long and is depressed. […]
Greta’s hunger strike becomes life-threatening: she eats almost nothing for two months. The parents take her to the hospital and the Centre for Eating Disorders. [..] In addition, Asperger’s syndrome, highly functional autism and OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) are diagnosed.
One day at school Greta sees a film about the pollution of the oceans showing a huge island of plastic waste and bursts into tears. Overall Greta is unhappy at school. […]  She doesn’t feel well at school. Everything becomes too much for her.”
Stockmann sees parental neglect, quoting Ernman in the book
Soon afterwards, little sister Beata also falls into a serious crisis. The parents have their hands full with Greta and neglect her: ‘Beata disappears into her room as soon as she comes home from school. We hardly get to see her. She feels our restlessness and avoids us.’
Because of Greta’s complicated food rituals, the then nine year old has to eat her dinner alone all the time. ‘Soon we’ll take care of you too, my darling, but first Greta has to get well,’ says Ernman she tries to cheer up her little daughter. She has a guilty conscience, but the situation can’t be changed, can it?”

Tic and illness afflicted family
When Beata enters the fourth grade, she can no longer bear to be with her family she has one tantrum after the other. She feels neglected, insults her mother as ‘slut’, ‘bitch’ and ‘worst mother in the world’ and throws objects at her.
At the age of 11, Beata is diagnosed with ‘ADHD with features of Asperger, OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and a disorder with oppositional defiance’. Beata has developed several tics, for example she needs an entire hour to walk one kilometer, because she has to avoid certain paving stones. ‘She always has to put her left foot on first and if she makes a mistake, she has to start all over again.’
The remarkable thing about this is that she only has these constraints when she is with her mother. She [Ernman] writes: ‘And I can well understand that. I felt the same way with my mother – all my tics stood out much more strongly in her presence.’
Unfortunately Ernman doesn’t get to the bottom of it, at least not in her book.”
Ernman never blames herself, only others
Stockmann at achgut.com continues:
On the one hand, she opposes the fact that others label their daughters because of their diagnoses. On the other hand, at the next moment she stylizes these handicaps as ‘superpowers’. Not once in the whole book does she question herself or her husband as parents. It is always the others who are to blame – the school, society, the health system. Or climate change.
“Because we were shitty. I felt like shit. Svante was shitty. The children were shitty. The planet was shitty. Even the dog was shitty,’ it continues. A projection of the own misfortune on the whole globe. The perfect excuse so that Malena Ernman doesn’t have to face up to any examination into the causes of her misery within her family.
With a lot of pathos, she takes CO2 values, statistics about psychological child and youth diseases and burn-out, storm catastrophe lists of the past years – then adds feminism and anti-racism – stirs once, and the pathetic rest of the book is finished. […]
A neurotic, repressing woman flees into a climate mania. She even tries to explain her fear of flying with her bad conscience about CO2 emissions. In the end she gets burn-out and her own ADHD diagnosis.”
Stockmann sums up:
The predicted climate catastrophe gives Malena Ernman and her family the opportunity to put their own fate and also their responsibility for their own well-being at the bottom of the list. The earth is sick, the Thunbergs are sick.”
They are also the poster family of the climate rescue movement. It’s astonishing that the activists and media are exploiting the family the way they are.

Martin Luther, whose famous ninety-five thesis against the Catholic Church triggered The Reformation.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Are greens facing a growing crisis of confidence, in leaders who make great public shows of climate piety, without backing those words with actions?
Is The Climate Change Debate A Replay Of The Reformation?Michael Lynch Contributor Jun 30, 2019, 07:12am…In the early days of the global warming debate, I read an English writer praising his country’s example of recognizing climate change compared to American skepticism, although he did admit the British hadn’t actually taken steps to address the problem. Similarly, the U.S. has reduced greenhouse gas emissions more than most countries in the past few years, but incidentally, mostly due to cheap natural gas, and it remains the climate villain in the eyes of many because the president is a denier.…Some of the new proposals to address climate change put me mind of the debate between faith and works, especially when they seem more for demonstration purpose than actually reducing emissions.  Numerous governments have suggested phasing out all carbon-based electricity generation or all petroleum-fueled vehicles by a point decades into the future, and these tend to be hailed by activists as representing, if not solutions, then great strides forward. New York state, for example, just proposed phasing out carbon-based electricity by 2050; France wants to ban conventional vehicles by 2040, the U.K. by 2050.  But as Michael Coren notes, “So far, it’s just words.”…And we have been here before. Many other national and sub-national environmental programs were later abandoned; the 1990s saw California enact mandates for electric vehicle sales—requiring 10% of sales in 2003 be zero emission vehicles—which was adopted by a number of other states, primarily in New England. Ultimately, it was abandoned after wasting billions of dollars. Numerous locales in the U.S. signed on to requirements for oxygenated gasoline, only to back out at the last minute when the cost became apparent.…Read more: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2019/06/30/is-the-climate-change-debate-a-replay-of-the-reformation/
Are we seeing a green version of The Reformation?
I agree with the author that there seems to be growing criticism of the blatant hypocrisy of high profile greens, their great public displays of green piety no longer seems enough to cover for all their private jets, opulence, and utter personal hypocrisy. 
Yet even amongst greens critical of the hypocrisy of their leaders there is very little acknowledgement of practical issues. For example, very few greens, even amongst those to take their personal lifestyle choices seriously, seem to recognise that US fracking technology has substantially reduced the USA’s greenhouse emissions. Many greens continue to vigorously oppose zero carbon nuclear energy, despite its obvious benefits in terms of reducing CO2 emissions. 
Sadly the author mars an otherwise excellent article by finishing up praising the potential benefits of a carbon tax, though he doesn’t really explain why a carbon tax would be different from previous failed green schemes.

"**Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda are easing restrictions on some of their products which were imposed in the wake of stockpiling earlier this month.**
All the major supermarkets restricted customers to buying fixed numbers of individual items to keep shelves full.
Aldi is now scrapping limits completely on all but a few items, while Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda have also removed some limits and changed others.
Meanwhile, grocery sales in the UK were at record levels in March.
Aldi customers will be able to buy as many as they want of most items in its stores.
However, they will only be allowed to purchase four of some - including hand wash and soap, toilet roll, certain canned goods and alcohol - and two of antibacterial hand gel, UHT milk and baby formula.
Morrisons is upping the limits on some items from three to four per customer and removing some altogether to make it easier for people to donate to food banks.
The supermarket will create local drop-off points for customers to donate products to others and will distribute Â£10m of food to food banks itself.
Waitrose is removing its cap on all fresh food, so meat, fish, poultry and other fresh goods can now be purchased freely along with fruit and vegetables.
Alcohol and Easter confectionery are also not subject to limits, although restrictions do remain on certain items.
Asda is removing limits on fruit and vegetables and chilled products.
Tesco, Sainsbury's and Co-op are not changing their policies on restrictions at the moment.
Meanwhile, figures from consumer analysts Kantar showed huge increases in shopping in the UK this month.
The busiest spell was from 16-19 March, when 88% of households visited a food store, adding up to 42 million extra trips across four days.
In the last four weeks, year-on-year supermarket sales grew by 20.6%.
Kantar's Fraser McKevitt said Â£10.8bn sales in the past four weeks were ""even higher than levels seen at Christmas"".
The figures have mainly risen because of people making extra shopping trips, rather than spending more on each visit.
The average household spent an extra Â£62.92 during the past four weeks, equivalent to adding five days' worth of groceries.
London had the biggest increase, with grocery spending up by 26% during the month.
Mr McKevitt added: ""It's inevitable that shoppers will add extra items to their baskets when faced with restrictions on their movement.
""With restaurants and cafes now closed, none of us can eat meals on the go any longer and an extra 503 million meals, mainly lunches and snacks, will be prepared and eaten at home every week for the foreseeable future.""
Online grocery spending was 13% higher than in the same period last year.
The average online basket cost Â£81.88, which was Â£6 more than in March 2019, while 14.6% of households received an online delivery - up from 13.8% at the same time last year.
Sales of alcohol rose by 22% - an extra Â£199m.
There was also a rise in spending for families with children over the age of 16, which is likely to be down to the youngsters returning early from college or university. Those families spent Â£508 on average on groceries in March, Â£88.13 more than they did in the same month last year.
Supermarket spending data from analysts Nielsen showed that in the week ending 21 March, many shoppers had filled their cupboards and instead were deciding to stock up the freezer.
Its figures showed that sales of frozen food that week rose by 84% compared with the same period last year.
Nielsen's Mike Watkins said there had been a ""seismic shift in overall shopping patterns"".
He added: ""Unlike stores, there is a finite capacity for online grocery shopping, due to warehouse capacity and available delivery slots, and this will have limited the growth of online sales.""
Online deliveries have been a sticking point for many people, who have found themselves unable to book slots and follow Prime Minister Boris Johnson's request to use online deliveries and stay at home.
Tesco, which last week limited online orders to 80 items only, has now expanded its home delivery and click and collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks.
It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet.
Asda is also recruiting more delivery drivers, while Sainsbury's has introduced priority slots for elderly and vulnerable customers and is contacting eligible customers on its database.
Morrisons is creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, while Waitrose says it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers."

The melting sea ice in the Arctic region might uncover a vast wealth of resources and open up new international trade routes, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday.
Pompeo delivered remarks from Finland, where he attended a meeting of nations with territory in the Arctic region. Pompeo largely focused on Chinese and Russian interests in the area but mentioned that melting sea ice afforded the U.S. economic prospects. (RELATED: Trump Approved The First-Ever US Oil Facility In Arctic Waters)
“The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance,” Pompeo said, according to CNN. “It houses 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil, 30 percent of its undiscovered gas, an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and millions of square miles of untapped resources, fisheries galore.”
“Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade,” Pompeo added. “This could potentially slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much as 20 days.”
Pompeo warned that Russia is increasingly aggressive about the region, and he said China appears to have a vested national security interest in the region. Pompeo said both countries could be trying to claim the Arctic’s vast natural resources for themselves, Reuters reported.
Pompeo’s criticisms “were totally out of sync with the facts,” China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, according to Reuters. “It is inconsistent with the general trend of peaceful cooperation in the Arctic, completely confuses right with wrong, and has ulterior motives.”

The Finland meeting brought together the Arctic council composed of eight member countries. Besides Finland, Russia and the United States, the rest of the council is made up by Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. China obtained observer status on the council in 2013.
The council sought to agree upon a joint declaration of goals for the Arctic, but could not get the U.S. to sign on to a proposed document, The Associated Press reported.

"**The mouth-watering food served up by South East Asia's street food vendors is a vital part of region's character and tourist appeal. So what happens if you make them pack up and move indoors?**
In the tiny, two-metre square kitchen where Melvin works alongside his mother, there's barely space for both to stand between the boiling vats of braising gravy, the buckets of offal, bags of rice and a row of suspended duck carcasses.
Melvin grew up watching his parents run the stall in Singapore, instilling in him a passion for hawker food.
""I love this job. I love being a hawker,"" he says, before admitting it's a ""very tough"" way of earning a living.
They don't take short cuts, so work starts early, shortly after 7am, collecting fresh ingredients, rolling up the rattling metal shutters, then laboriously washing out tubes of pig intestine and fatty strips of pork skin in plenty of cold water. Eggs must be parboiled, vegetables and tofu chopped, the meat cooked and portioned, sauces and garnishes prepared.
But somehow by lunchtime their stall is ready to churn out anything up to 200 portions a day of kway chap and braised duck, a dish originating from Guangdong in southern China, and rich in the flavours of orange peel, star anise, chilli and cinnamon.
In most Asian cities food hawkers line the streets, with pungent cooking aromas enticing passers-by. But Melvin's customers tuck into their meals under cover, on the second floor of a purpose-built shopping complex. They eat at formica-topped tables and cooking smells are sucked away by a humming extractor fan.
""Street food is no longer street-side food here in Singapore. It's a style of food that came from the street,"" says KF Seetoh, a culinary consultant and unofficial spokesperson for the city state's food hawkers.
Singapore is a city built on migration. Waves of Indians, Chinese, Indonesians and others have flooded into the region's most prosperous city, joining the native Malays. But from the start, migrant workers craved familiar dishes from home.
""In the 1950s there were 22,000 itinerant vendors on the streets,"" says Mr Seetoh. ""Some people said get rid of them.""
Instead, he says, the authorities made ""a very practical decision"" - to bring them indoors.
It is an approach that has served Singapore well. The country is renowned for its rich variety of affordable food. Two of the city's hawkers have been awarded coveted Michelin stars.
Several have created lucrative enterprises, a few have even expanded abroad. Singapore's government has applied for hawker culture to be recognised by Unesco for ""intangible cultural heritage"" status, alongside the likes of Belgium's beers and Turkish coffee houses.
That success, Mr Seetoh argues, is largely due to Singapore's decision to sanitise and regulate the sector.
""They said if you are going to eat it, it better be safe, because we don't know where these folks on the street got their supplies from. Did they wash their hands? Are they hygienic?""
From the 1960s onwards, vendors were installed in purpose-built hawker centres across the rapidly developing city state, provided with running water, electricity, grey water drainage and extraction hoods.
Along with the new facilities came regulations. Don't chop and prepare food on porous wood - surfaces must be stainless steel. Keep cooked and uncooked meat separate, and stored at precise temperatures. Wear gloves. Check the source of your ingredients.
Each stall is given a hygiene rating.
""It is what we expect from this uber-efficient government,"" Mr Seetoh says. ""We call that peace of mind. Who doesn't want that?
The answer is plenty of others in the region. Malaysians scoffed when Singapore applied for Unesco heritage recognition, arguing the city's food had lost its authenticity since coming off the streets.
Bangkok is now attempting to follow in Singapore's footsteps by bringing its own street food vendors into purpose-built centres in a bid to clear space on the pavements. However, the authorities are facing widespread opposition from those who say the character and appeal of Thailand's capital will be lost if its food hawkers are brought indoors.
Jorge Carillo, an anthropologist who studies South East Asia's street food sector, says moves like this are being encouraged by a preference amongst a new generation of customers in countries like Vietnam for higher hygiene standards and air-conditioned shopping centres. On top of that, costs are rising, while customers expect prices for street food to remain low.
But, above all, what is undermining the sector's prospects is the day-to-day reality of the job, he says.
""I have this issue with some people, because they keep pushing to keep street food because it gives the city character,"" says Mr Carillo. ""The reality is that selling street food is very hard work.""
""What is changing is job opportunities are coming up, and people simply are stopping to do this very hard work"" he says. One woman hawker in Bangkok he interviewed starts shopping for ingredients at 3am, goes to her stall at 7am and then sells food for eight to 10 hours.
""If she gets another opportunity to do another job of course she's going to stop,"" he says.
The same is true in Singapore, as the first generation of hawkers, now in their 60s and 70s retires. It is proving difficult to persuade millennials, many of whom have degrees, and aspire to be entrepreneurs or work in Singapore's air-conditioned high-rises, to take up the baton. It's not what their parents want for them either.
Melvin is an exception. ""Initially my mother was very against her children being hawkers because of the long hours,"" he says. ""She wanted me to work in an office."" When his father passed away Melvin couldn't bear to think of the family business closing but they now take home only around 6,000 Singapore dollars (US$4,200; Â£3,500) a month between them for a six-day working week.
""There are so many challenges, and these are very stacked up against the hawkers,"" says KF Seetoh. He adds that he's been ""shouting and crying about the impending demise of this food culture"" for some time - all because of this generational threat that no-one seems to know how to tackle.
There are bright spots of hope though - newcomers such as Michelle Yee Yuan and her husband Alan who gave up office jobs to open a stall not far from Melvin's. They serve a Korean-style ham cha, a mix of vegetables, peanuts, and rice combined with a bitter herb soup.
The ingredients are designed to appeal to health-conscious younger consumers, and they work hard to push their presence on social media, fighting for every customer.
""To get a new person to try our food is one of the challenges,"" says Michelle. She says it has been hard, working 12-14 hours a day sometimes, at the beginning she was so exhausted she fell ill a lot. She and Alan are taking home about half of their previous joint income.
Everything, says Mr Seetoh, is stacked up against new entrants like Michelle and Alan. And yet Michelle says she loves the job, the environment and working alongside her husband all day.
""And I am working for my own creation,"" she says.

"**Farming leaders have said it would be ""insane"" to sign a trade deal that allows the import of food that would be illegal to produce in the UK, such as chlorinated chicken.**
The National Farmers Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, said allowing these imports would be ""morally bankrupt"".
The NFU called for rules on minimum standards for imports to be made law.
Downing Street said food standards would be protected in any trade deal.
At the NFU's annual conference on Tuesday, Ms Batters said: ""This isn't just about chlorinated chicken. This is about a wider principle.
""We must not tie the hands of British farmers to the highest rung of the standards ladder while waving through food imports which may not even reach the bottom rung.""
She said: ""To sign up to a trade deal which results in opening our ports, shelves and fridges to food which would be illegal to produce here would not only be morally bankrupt, it would be the work of the insane.""
Ms Batters called for rules in the Agriculture Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, to ensure that food that would be illegal to produce here will not be imported.
In countries such as the US, chicken is sometimes washed in chlorine or other chemicals to remove harmful bacteria.
This practice was banned in the European Union in 1997 over food safety concerns.
The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The UK has long been a world leader in food safety and animal welfare and we will continue to uphold our high food safety standards in all future trade deals.""
The EU will demand that the UK keeps its ban on chlorinated chicken as a requirement for a trade agreement with Brussels, the Guardian reported, citing documents it has seen.
The move is to protect European meat exports, but it could prove to be a potential stumbling block in any deal with the US.
Last month, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the US wanted to agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK in 2020.
New environment secretary George Eustice drew criticism on Sunday after refusing to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US under a new deal.
But the EU believes that relying on chlorine at the end of the meat production process could be a way of compensating for poor hygiene standards - such as dirty abattoirs.
In 2020, the UK will be negotiating a trade deal with Brussels for when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December.
According to reports in the Guardian newspaper, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on chlorinated chicken as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc.
Mr Eustice's predecessor, Theresa Villiers, had previously told the BBC that the current European Union ban on chlorine-washed chicken would be carried over into UK legislation after Brexit."
" Sept. 19, 2019Canadians Bamboozled by ‘Meaningless’ Climate Models(CALGARY) Blacklock’s Reporter tweeted a report on Sept. 16, 2019 that Environment Canada ‘omits 100 years of records and uses simulated, not actual data to come up with frightening climate change graphs,’ referring to the new ClimateData.ca collaboration site. Sheila Gunn Reid of The Rebel Media did her own damning investigation as a follow-on to Blacklock’s report, showing that the hottest and coldest temperature data in Canada has been deleted from the new ‘modelled’ (simulated) representations.Models Completely Meaningless – Japanese Scientist On a global scale, climate models were denounced as inaccurate in a new book released this week on Kindle in “Confessions of a climate scientist: The global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis (Japanese Edition with English section)” by scientist Mototaka Nakamura.  In the ebook, he states: “… changes and variations in climate predicted by those models are completely meaningless even if they were tuned to reproduce the current climate very accurately. By the way, none of the climate simulation models used for predictions can reproduce the current climate accurately despite the heavy tuning and engineering efforts by climate researchers. The models are tuned to produce the “best compromise” and used for various experiments.” Unfortunately, Canadian greenhouse gas reduction targets to meet the mythical 1.5°Celsius temperature and related climate policies are all based on these ‘completely meaningless’ models.Critical Election Incident Public ProtocolIronically, Canada’s Green Party platform, released the same day as the Blacklock’s report, calls to “Mandate Elections Canada to develop a truth in advertising framework for election campaigns that empowers the Commissioner of Elections to investigate citizens’ complaints related to campaign advertising and impose sanctions if the complaints are found to be justified.”Statements that there is a climate emergency are based on projections of faulty climate models. Demands that fossil fuels must be phased out to ‘stop global warming’, that carbon taxes must be higher or GHG targets more stringent mean that environmental groups and climate emergency-crazed politicians should be investigated for false and misleading campaigns, fearmongering and abuse of the public trust.Certainly, based on the Blacklock’s revelations, Canadian media, politicians and foreign-funded environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) that are trumpeting a climate emergency and demanding a shut down of the existing fossil fuel-based economy likely violate the “Critical Election Incident Public Protocol”, of the recently enacted Digital Charter, outlined by Poynter Institute.The same may be true for media that are participating in the global “Covering Climate Now”. This exercise in media groupthink is inciting mass public delusion, contrary to the media’s mandate of Freedom of the Press, to report diverse and dissenting views in society and to investigate important issues, as Blacklock’s has done.Canadian Taxpayers Are Being Fleeced – Policies Turned Upside DownENGO ‘charities’ rely on these overheated, inaccurate models as the basis for fund-raising and millions in government ‘climate change’ grants as outlined in Friends of Science series of ‘green charity’ reports.  The Green Party is campaigning on the basis of a climate emergency and demanding a World War II-style managed economy based on climate model misinformation.  Pollsters like Abacus and Environics are having a field day conducting surveys on climate change that are unrelated to reality. ENGOs like Ecojustice are demanding that unattainable greenhouse gas reduction targets be fixed in law; other tax-subsidized charities like David Suzuki Foundation are terrifying children and demanding that 8 to18 year-olds be allowed to vote. Environmental Defence uses these frightening but fake climate forecasts to demand a shut down of the oil sands as part of the Tar Sands Campaign. Canadian law professors are planning to sue oil companies based on faulty climate models. Such climate and energy illiteracy must not be enshrined in law.“Mickey Mouse” Thinking – GHG Reduction to Stop Climate ChangeMototaka Nakamura points out that there is no reliable global temperature record beyond perhaps the past 50 years, thus temperature targets are elusive, as are claims of global warming.  Likewise, he states that claiming carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas reductions alone will alter climate or temperature is “Mickey Mouse” thinking.  According to Mototaka Nakamura, climate change entails such a complex dynamic interaction between the atmospheric and ocean variabilities alone, that no reliable forecasts can be made using computer models.  He points out that the elusive nature of water vapor, the most influential greenhouse gas, cannot be modelled.  Neither can cloud formations which are highly influential in climate.Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Temperature Signal Not EvidentA recent more technical paper by Paul Frank, published Sept. 6, 2019 on the topic of “Propagation of Error and the Reliability of Global Air Temperature Projections” concludes: “At the current level of theory an AGW signal, if any, will never emerge from climate noise no matter how long the observational record because the uncertainty width will necessarily increase much faster than any projected trend in air temperature. Any impact from GHGs will always be lost within the uncertainty interval. Even advanced climate models exhibit poor energy resolution and very large projection uncertainties….The unavoidable conclusion is that a temperature signal from anthropogenic CO2 emissions (if any) cannot have been, nor presently can be, evidenced in climate observables.”Provinces that are engaged in a court challenge over carbon taxes may be vindicated by these revelations.ContactMichelle StirlingCommunications Manager TOLL FREE 1-888-7899597 / media@friendsofscience.org AboutFriends of Science Society is an independent group of earth, atmospheric and solar scientists, engineers, and citizens who are celebrating its 17th year of offering climate science insights.

"Cinderella CO2
A steam train in a tunnel – that’s a clear case of pollution
Air’s black as pitch, your nostrils twitch, but what a great solution
Electric trains proved right as rain, the power’s from a station
Where chimney flues scrub out all hues of soot particulation.
The only vapours from the site are CO2 and water
When carbon mates with oxygen, they have a lovely daughter
Her beauty though is not for show, her hidden charms unlisted
Like Cinderella pre the ball, soot-faced and ugly-sistered.
There is no doubt a glass of stout is good for our well being
And that there brew needs CO2 to make the cork worth freeing
And soda water isn’t short’a carbonated gases
Or do you think that CO2 pollutes our lads and lasses.
The dry ice in your Esky won’t contaminate your food
It’s CO2 in solid form, its gas will not intrude
Solid CO2 won’t melt, it sublimates instead
And doesn’t turn to water which would soak your picnic bread.
The great sponge cakes your mother makes need CO2 for lightness
Champagne contains some CO2, to stimulate its brightness
So what about that greenhouse gas, the monster that we fear
It’s harmless as that self-same gas that frothifies our beer.
This greenhouse thing has gone too far, the hoax must be exposed
A greenhouse is a building with glass ceilings interposed
Allowing sunlight to come in to power photosynthesis
Where Cinderella has a ball and plants can only win with this.
The heat is trapped, and heat transfer obeys the laws of heat
Conduction is through contact, that’s a hot-cold, one-way street
Convection only happens within liquids and with gases
Radiation’s wild and free, but slows down in molasses.
Our planet is no greenhouse and for that we’ve gotta thank it
Its atmosphere is mostly clear and wraps us in a blanket
And H2O it rules you know, in fact it’s pretty neat
If you meet an iceberg please respect its latent heat.
The blanket that surrounds us is a blanket in a squillion
The CO2 part’s pretty thin, four hundred parts per million
When yarns are stretched as thin as that, it’s like a nylon stocking
It’s measured by deniers, what it covers up is shocking.
King Coal has brought us from the slums, to fortune and to favour.
The real deniers criticise. King Coal’s supporters waver.
But truth will win and then the fraud of taxing carbon users
And trading air to our despair, will join the list of losers.
The fragrance of the sweet fresh rain, the moisture, drops and dew
Owe so much of their sparkle to our friend called CO2.

"**Thousands of Greggs staff are set to get a Â£300 one-off payment after a ""phenomenal year"", the firm said.**
Sales growth had been helped by strong demand for its traditional snacks and Greggs' ""now iconic"" vegan sausage rolls, the bakery chain said.
Greggs staff will share a Â£7m payment after shareholders received a Â£35m special dividend in October.
The firm expects underlying annual pre-tax profit to be ahead of its expectations when it reports in March.
The 19,000 Greggs staff who have been with the chain since before 31 March will get a Â£300 windfall at the end of January, while the remaining 6,000 will get Â£75 for each quarter they have worked for Greggs.
The one-off payment to staff will be on top of the profit-sharing scheme that Greggs already has, a spokeswoman said. The bakery chain already shares 10% of profits with employees, she said.
""Our record financial performance in 2019 has enabled us to enhance returns to shareholders,"" said chief executive Roger Whiteside.
""I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year.""
The bonus comes a year after Greggs launched its vegan sausage roll snack, which is made from meat substitute Quorn.
Its launch has been followed by other initiatives such as a vegan steak bake and a vegan doughnut.
When store manager Victor Connor and workers James Compton and Stephen Green heard about the bonus they started screaming and shouting.
""It genuinely feels like a thank you,"" Victor said. ""Quite a few customers have said: 'To be fair you guys deserve it'.""
Stephen said it was particularly welcome just after Christmas: ""They don't need to give it us, something for all our hard work.""
""But it makes the staff feel more appreciated- everyone here is made up,"" he added.
It isn't uncommon for workers to benefit from a share in the profits. Other UK retailers that have staff bonus schemes include John Lewis and Waitrose, Sainsbury's, and Sports Direct for shop floor workers.
Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at GlobalData, said offering a staff bonus reflected a growing trend amongst firms to want to appear ethical.
""This is a great way for Greggs to maintain the loyalty of the workforce and creates a very inclusive culture, as the benefits of its success is being shared with everyone.
It was also good ""PR"" she added ""something Greggs is excellent at.""
Greggs, like other retailers, will face higher costs in 2020 from a boost to the National Living Wage and higher pork prices, the firm added.
Greggs opened 138 new shops over the last year and closed 41, bringing the total to 2,050 across the UK. It said it planned to open about 100 new shops in 2020.
Like-for-like sales grew 9.2% in 2019, compared with 2.9% growth in 2018."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to two just-published studies in medical journals and one anecdotal report from a COVID-19 hotspot, at least 350 patients with the COVID-19 have been successfully treated with Hydroxychloroquine. A New York City physician reports a 100% efficacy rate, meaning zero of the “hundreds” of infected patients receiving the treatment required hospitalization.

For those who do ultimately recover, the duration of the recovery period from the COVID-19 viral infection is 20 days on average.
A clinical trial reported in a new study (Gautret et al., 2020) with a small sample size (36) shows Hydroxychlorine and Azithromycin treatment led to a “reduction/disappearance” of COVID-19 infection in 3-6 days for 100% of the patients receiving treatment.

Another new study (Gao et al., 2020) from February tested more than 100 patients infected with COVID-19 in China.
The results revealed a “marked efficacy and acceptable safety” or “potent efficacy in treating patients with COVID-19” with Chloroquine in clinical trials.

Image Source: Gao et al., 2020
Although not an official “clinical trial”, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko has conducted an anecdotal study of “hundreds” of the COVID-19-infected patients he’s treated with Hydrochloroquine in the early, “pre-hospital” stage of infection just within the last week. He estimates there are 20,000 cases in the region he serves.
Of those who he has administered the treatment for use in their own home, 100% have successfully avoided viral symptom exacerbation necessitating hospitalization.
Due to the “tremendous positive results”, Dr. Zelenko created a YouTube video recommending widespread usage of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
Edit: After 3 days and 100s of thousands of views, this video has curiously been removed by YouTube with the message:
“This video has been removed for violating YouTube’s Community Guidelines.”
It is unclear what “community guidelines” would have been violated with the provision of much-needed information about the efficacy of a medication that has such a high treatment success rate – especially at a critical time like this in the heart of New York City.
For the record, the text on the image beneath the sub-heading for this article remains and contains the quoted information provided in the video by Dr. Zelenko.

Share this...FacebookTwitter!!! UPDATE 1 – GOOD NEWS !!!
EIKE informs they managed to find an appropriate place in Munich, on time and that all the reservations as well as dates remain valid. Unfortunately, for safety reasons, they have to keep the location secret. Free speech in Germany! (But only if you do it in secret).
========================================
Just like the 1930s. There’s no question that freedom of science and speech are under heavy attack in Germany after dozens of distinguished but dissenting scientists have seen their long planned science conference cancelled due to intimidation by leftwing extremists.

Germany caving in to leftist extremists. A skeptic climate conference gets cancelled at last minute due to coercion. Image: Antifa action in Phoenix, 2017, cropped from Carptrash – I, Einar Kvaran, License:  CC BY-SA 4.0
This latest climate conference cancellation comes just after leftists coerced the University of Hamburg to disinvite political leaders from making on-campus appearances.
The same has also just occurred at the famed University of Göttingen.
The problem of suppressing open discussion has deteriorated to such an extent across Germany over the recent years that even according to leftist Spiegel: 75% of journalists and writers are “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” about the state of free speech in Germany!
Free speech in Germany is in state of crisis.
Munich NH Congress Center bullied, cancels at last minute
The latest free speech suppression and intimidation has unfolded in Munich: The 13th International Climate and Energy Conference, sponsored by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and CFACT, has seen its contractual agreement torn up, and the event was booted out of the conference facility at the last minute.
Pressured by “left-green mob”
According to EIKE spokesman, Prof. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, “a left-green mob” pressured the hotel management of the NH Congress Center in Munich(Aschheim) “to illegally cancel the accommodation contract”.
EIKE had gone to court and demanded revocation of the termination in an emergency motion. However, today, a Bavarian court ruled in favor of the NF Conference Center, citing “security reasons”. German law is no longer able to protect.
EIKE is a non-profit organization, like the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The Jena-Germany based EIKE plans every year a scientific conference on current climate and energy topics. This year it was planned to take place in Munich on November 22nd. But now its attendees will have to make new last minute plans.
More than 200 scientists and attendees had booked, many paid
More than 200 international scientists and experts had long since booked and paid for their travels, as well as their hotels – many of them in the conference hotel NH Congress Center itself. Some of them were planned to come from overseas, the USA, Canada and Australia. Media representatives also asked to be accredited, this year much more than usual.
Distinguished scientists were to appear
But the problem is that the 13th International Climate and Energy Conference is one that allows alternative – NON-ALARMIST – views on climate science to be presented, for example by distinguished scientists such as astrophysicists Nir Shaviv of Israel and Prof. Henrik Svensmark of Denmark. More than a dozen were slated to speak.
Antifa intimidates NH Conference Center
However, this open scientific discussion was too much to take for the far left-green Antifa and other like-minded radical organizations. This time they really mobilized against the “climate change deniers”.
At its Facebook site the radical leftwing Antifa organization recently called on its followers to take aim at the Munich NH Congress Center for hosting the EIKE event, posting at its site the following comic image:

Antifa posting: “Strike against EIKE! Put the heat on climate deniers!”
EIKE has published scientific works and peer-reviewed publications and is involved in the promotion of scientific education. The conference was intended to continue extend this work.
The agreement to host the conference at the NH Congress Center Munich was duly signed by both parties already back in May and was followed shortly afterwards by a “substantial down payment”, according to EIKE. Everything was settled. Then came the science brownshirts.
Mob descends on NH hotel, disturbed guests, staff
The initial spark setting off the protest of the NH Congress Center Munich (Aschheim) hosting the EIKE climate conference was launched by editor Paul Gäbler of the Berliner Tagesspiegel, who publicly slandered EIKE as an “AfD-near climate denier think tank”. The AfD is Germany’s new and growing right party that has has been surging in recent polls and elections nationwide. It’s the only party in Germany that challenges alarmist climate science and acknowledges natural climate drivers.

Intimidation by journalists
In September, Gäbler called the management of the NH conference hotel and asked if the positions of EIKE were known to them.” At first NH management declined to comment, but “journalist” Gäbler persisted and the NH caved in, issuing a delcaration: “Denial of man-made climate change is not compatible with the values of the NH hotel group.” and said it would review the matter.
Mob descends on the conference facility, management caves
But it remained quiet for a while. Requests by EIKE as to whether the accommodation contract was endangered remained unanswered on the part of the NH management in Berlin. But then NH management panicked after Munich Antifa and auxiliary groups from the environmental scene mobilized. On November 9th, a mob of 15-20 people appeared inside the hotel and disturbed guests and employees.
They mixed in with the guests in the lobby and distributed a flyer to employees and guests, announcing further activities in case the conference took place.
According to the hotel management of the NH Congress Center in Munich (Aschheim), they apparently “forced” them to cave in “by singing songs and distributing leaflets”.
NH Munich Conference Center gets a hate letter
At about the same time, an open letter from the Munich Environmental Institute was sent to the NH Munich Conference Center management demanding they not make conference rooms available to EIKE.

The letter begins by telling the NH Munich Conference Center how influential the Institute fancies itself to be, and claims “EIKE denies man-made climate change and is trying to influence political parties and public opinion.”
The letter ends by demanding the NH Munich Conference Center management  “not provide the climate change deniers any space.”
“Please disinvite EIKE.”
Thus the NH management terminated the contract (in spite of the previously granted contract extension) due to a perceived “danger to its guests and employees.”
Big win for violent radicals, loss for free speech
The Berliner Tagesspiegel (TS) reported triumphantly at the news: “NH hotel group disinvites EIKE, climate change deniers have to find a new venue,” was the triumphant headline in the leftist Tagesspiegel.
“This is comparable to the behaviour of arsonists who first set a fire and then proudly report about it,” commented EIKE.
German court green lights coercion, suppression of speech
All attempts by the EIKE Board to avert the contract cancellation, which was demonstrably based on defamation and lies, did not alter the NH Conference Center decision. EIKE took immediate legal action against this, hiring well-known law firm Steinhöfel, but to no avail. The conference is cancelled.
German rule of law is failing
At its site, EIKE called the coercion and intimidation to force NH to shirk its contractual obligations a “particularly serious case of coercion and blackmail for the suppression of scientific facts.”
“If the rule of law still works in this country, the court should make a decision in our favour,” EIKE wrote.
No longer a constitutional state
With that, the German court has de facto ruled it can no longer protect and uphold the rights of persons to dissent and to speak freely. The court ruling sends a dangerous signal to radical leftwing organization, hinting to them s that it’s open season on dissenters.
Climate of fear
EIKE writes that all hotels and conference centers throughout Germany “are already so afraid of Antifa and their thugs, as well as their green auxiliary troops, that they have no more confidence in the protection by our constitutional state. This makes them willing opportunists. A constitutional state that allows this is no longer a constitutional state.”
On the brink of leftist anarchy
The last minute, sudden cancellation by the Munich NH also results in hefty damages to a number of parties involved in the conference. “Travel expenses have now been spent in vain,” EIKE says. “Perhaps the NH-Conference Center would even come to its senses, recall the rule of law and bring charges against the Antifa (Unknown).”
Caving in to extreme leftist pressure sends the wrong signl, EIKE warns. “The reputation to have given way to the pressure of the street will perhaps deter more future visitors of the NH Conference Center than visitors who have apparently forgotten where it leads if fascists of all colours, whether left, green or brown, are not fought with all means of our constitutional state and immediately brought before the judge.”

President Obama is determined to do something about global warming, telling Congress in his State of the Union address that if they won’t act on it, he will.



The president’s refrain is familiar, but unfortunate. Obama continues to ignore new science suggesting that the threat posed by human‐​caused climate change is substantially less than previously thought.



Obama’s brand‐​new pick to head the EPA, Gina McCarthy, is a fresh signal that the administration favors knee‐​jerk policies to restrict emissions, even when they are unsupported by available data and would hamper the economic recovery.



Congress, with its wait‐​and‐​see attitude, has taken the right approach. Now, if only the president and his EPA would see the light.



A good place to start is a just‐​published study by a research team led by Dr. Peter Stott, a climate expert from the U.K.‘s Met Office Hadley Center, which finds that climate model projections of an alarming temperature rise are inconsistent with past observations.





New science is telling us that the old science was unjustifiable and overly extreme.



When Stott and his colleagues forced the amount of global warming predicted by climate models to equal the amount of warming that has actually been observed, the future temperature rise projected to accompany human greenhouse gas emissions dropped rather substantially. In other words, the better climate models match the past, the less scary the future looks.



Big surprise: My colleagues and I published the same thing in the scientific literature more than 10 years ago.



What makes the new findings particularly interesting is that Dr. Stott was an author of the most recent climate assessment report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Stott specifically contributed to the chapter on global climate projections, which included the possibility that human greenhouse gas emissions could lead to rapid increases in global temperatures.



His new work now indicates that the IPCC climate projections have been exaggerated on the high side.



Stott is not alone in his findings. Within just the past two years, no fewer than seven peer‐​reviewed studies have been published in the scientific literature that have concluded that the earth’s climate sensitivity—that is, how much warming that will accompany a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration — is likely to be substantially lower than the IPCC’s determination.



All of these studies have largely ruled out entirely the IPCC’s high‐​end values.



James Annan, a leading researcher into constraints on estimates of climate sensitivity, and author of several of the new studies on the topic, has long thought that the IPCC high‐​end climate sensitivity values were unjustified.



Annan suggests that the IPCC is increasingly acting in a wholly unscientific manner, accusing the IPCC of “having firmly wedded themselves to their politically convenient long tail of high values, their response to new evidence is little more than sticking their fingers in their ears and singing ‘la la la I can’t hear you.’ ”



This would perhaps be amusing if the IPCC were not considered by many — including the president and the EPA — to be the leading authority of climate change, past, present and future.



To base its findings that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations” and to justify regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA relies strongly on the IPCC reports.



When the president says that it is “the overwhelming judgment of science” that our greenhouse gas emissions are making all manner of extreme weather worse, he is referring largely to the IPCC reports.



Since the IPCC is erring on the high side of things, so too must be the EPA and the president.



This situation is unacceptable. It is time to step back and take stock, not rush into action.



The earth’s average temperature has largely remained unchanged over the past 16 years. During this same period, the annual global emissions of greenhouse gases have increased by nearly 50%.



Together, this combination is straining the credibility of climate change alarmism predicated on the idea that the earth’s climate is extremely sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels to produce our primary energy supply.



Increasingly, both Mother Nature and the science of her behavior are telling us that climate change and its impacts will be moderate, making global “lukewarming” the more apt description. Adaptation is a more preferable course than mitigation.



The more time we give climate science the chance to explain climate observations, the better and more accurately informed we become.



New science is telling us that the old science was unjustifiable and overly extreme. We should make sure that any attempts at climate action don’t prove to be the same.

" Contributed by Donald Lee © 2019In this op-ed submission, a citizen expresses their outrage over the declaration of a “Climate Emergency” in Canada.by Donald LeeRecent political news has continued to follow Pareto’s 80-20 rule: 20% sense and 80% nonsense. Our emperor in Ottawa and his Comic Courtiers have declared a Climate Emergency. Really? Perhaps I’m just a country bumpkin and my personal experience is merely “anecdotal” in the grand Sea of Scientific Seriousness in which I can only dip my toe. But my grandchildren are growing up in an Alberta climate today not observably different from the Alberta climate in which I grew up half a century ago. What emergency?Yet our emperor insists that something is rotten in the State of Climate and he’s going to fix it with – wait for it – taxes! Really? Setting all the scientific questions aside for the moment, as an economist, I can tell you there is absolutely no way you can change the climate of the entire planet with taxes. The earth’s climate does not respond to taxes. Taxes just don’t do that. That’s the truth. Taxes raise money for governments. They don’t do much of anything else except make life more difficult and expensive for all the rest of us. Politicians, and their economist lackeys, think they create whatever dystopic vision of society they want with tax incentives and disincentives. The truth is – it ain’t so. There is precious little real economic evidence to suggest that taxes do any of the other things they’re purported to do. Even high taxes only marginally affect human behaviour. High booze taxes have not reduced the inexorable rise in per capita alcohol consumption. High tobacco taxes did not reduce cigarette smoking. The gradual realization that smoking kills you did that. And millions of people blithely continue to slowly kill themselves anyway. Fuel taxes have not induced people to park their cars when they need to travel, to turn off their furnaces when they need to warm up, or to shut off their lights when they need to see in the dark. Perhaps our emperor has forgotten that Canada is cold and dark for half the year.To solve the fantasy Climate Emergency, our emperor has settled upon the one thing governments do well – tax and spend. A carbon tax. Really? Every living thing is made of carbon – every human, animal, fish, bird, every tree and every blade of grass. Are we taxing all these? No. Ninety percent of the earth’s carbon is tied up in sedimentary rocks. Are we taxing the rocks? No. So even though carbon is the sixth most abundant evil element in the universe, we’re not going to make any money by taxing it.  It’s not a tax on carbon. That’s just lying propaganda. It’s a tax on fuel, plain and simple. We’ve had fuel taxes for 100 years and they haven’t changed the climate yet. Neither will this one. That’s the truth. Any possible impact of higher fuel taxes in Canada on global CO2 production will be so infinitesimally small as to be indistinguishable from zero. Carbon taxes cannot possibly affect the climate.So it seems that our emperor and his Comic Courtier Economists, drunk on the wine of their own grandiose economic omnipotence, have taken a new and bold step in their Religion of Social Engineering. Not only do they believe they can change human society to suit themselves (hiding behind the curtain and pulling the levers of tax incentives like the Wizard of Oz), they believe they can change the physical universe! (And some people think I have strange beliefs.) Surely the climate will respond to tax incentives – in exactly the way we believe it will. The fact that it’s never been done before, or that there is no real scientific evidence to suggest it will work (lots of speculation, but no evidence), are mere incidentals that only a non-believer would quibble over.Nor does it matter that even the brightest among us don’t actually know how the climate works, since no one has yet come up with a general theory of climate. It’s of no import that no one can even explain the scientific climate evidence. What causes ice ages to start? Or end? No one knows. Or what about minor climate changes like the Little Ice Age. The earth spent about five centuries getting gradually colder (1200-1700) and has since spent about three centuries unraveling that change. Nobody knows why. But it doesn’t matter because, with confidence born of ignorance, our emperor is going to change the earth’s climate with taxes. And you’re going to pay them! If changing the earth’s climate is as easy as “putting a price on pollution”, then surely we could simply put a tax on water, thereby discouraging it and causing the sea level to fall.A Climate Emergency? The true evidence shows there is no increase in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events anywhere in the world. The true evidence shows no change in the rate of sea level rise over the past 150 when records have been kept. The geologic evidence suggests the rate hasn’t changed for the past 12,000 years. What emergency? Some of us are old enough to remember that the same apocalyptic disasters that are now supposed to happen by 2030 were supposed to have happened already. No apocalypse yet. What emergency?Once again, our emperor and his Comic Courtiers have instituted a solution that cannot possibly solve the imaginary problem it is purported to solve. Are they ignorant or deceitful? Those are the only two possibilities I can think of. Either they have no idea what they’re doing, or they know exactly what they’re doing and it’s not what they say they’re doing. (Did ya follow that?) Can any of this supposed environmental nonsense be of any benefit to sea turtles, or burrowing owls, or polar bears? Nope. How about the homeless? Nope. How about people who built homes in swamps or on eroding shorelines? Nope.The only possible beneficiary of carbon taxes is the government bureaucracy itself. Once again, hundreds of freshly minted Humanities majors and under-employed housewives will find gainful employment and a steady paycheque shuffling paper in Ministry of the War on the State of Climate. J.K. Rowling would approve the new fantasy ministry.Our Climate Barbie says she’s doing the right thing by taxing pollution. Really? Why then do municipalities in Liberal ridings continue to dump raw sewage into Federal waterways without consequence? Isn’t that pollution? It contains carbon. And we do know how to solve that problem. In fact, it’s easy. That’s the truth.It’s a famous tactic of failing politicians to pick fights with neighboring countries, to distract the public’s attention from their domestic policy failures. Since Canada has no readily-available neighbors we could beat up, our emperor has found some indefensible entities to attack – the vile State of Climate and the insidious Principality of Plastic Straws. Surely if we legalize hallucinogens, write the scripts for the town criers, and wage successful wars against imagined enemies, the people will love us. Now we can create a new Ministry for the War on Plastic Straws. Our Elites are incredibly out of touch, not only with ordinary people but with reality as well.I don’t think our emperor could recognize an emergency if it sat up in his cannabis-infused Cheerios and said, “Good morning.” There are certainly crises in our society, as always, but our Elites cannot distinguish the crucial from the trivial. While they pathetically battle Plastic Straws and Climate Change like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, they’re oblivious to the fact that half of Albertans would vote for secession today because we’re so disgusted with trying to be a part of this dysfunctional nation, and sick and tired of being squished under the heel of its idiotic rulers.The emperor has no clothes. That’s the naked truth. Donald Lee is an author and retired teacher. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "

As the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.

It is interesting that **global cooling** was going to bring an increased frequency and amplitude of weather anomalies. Now the ‘experts’ assure us that **global warming** is going to do exactly the same.

"Many thousands of women are expected to converge on the nation’s capital for the Women’s March on Washington the day after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. Jennifer Willis no longer plans to be one of them. Ms. Willis, a    wedding minister from South Carolina, had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march. Then she read a post on the Facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white. The post, written by a black activist from Brooklyn who is a march volunteer, advised “white allies” to listen more and talk less. It also chided those who, it said, were only now waking up to racism because of the election. “You don’t just get to join because now you’re scared, too,” read the post. “I was born scared. ” Stung by the tone, Ms. Willis canceled her trip. “This is a women’s march,” she said. “We’re supposed to be allies in equal pay, marriage, adoption. Why is it now about, ‘White women don’t understand black women’?” If all goes as planned, the Jan. 21 march will be a momentous display of unity in protest of a president whose treatment of women came to dominate the campaign’s final weeks. But long before the first buses roll to Washington and sister demonstrations take place in other cities, contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers, exhilarating some and alienating others. In Tennessee, emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from “Women’s March on  ” to “Power Together Tennessee, in solidarity with Women’s March on Washington. ” While many applauded the name change, which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in Nashville, some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women. In Louisiana, the first state coordinator gave up her volunteer role in part because there were no minority women in leadership positions at that time. “I got a lot of flak locally when I stepped down, from white women who said that I’m alienating a lot of white women,” said Candice Huber, a bookstore owner in New Orleans, who is white. “They said, ‘Why do you have to be so divisive? ’” In some ways, the discord is by design. Even as they are working to ensure a smooth and unified march next week, the national organizers said they made a deliberate decision to highlight the plight of minority and undocumented immigrant women and provoke uncomfortable discussions about race. “This was an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep places,” said Linda Sarsour, a Muslim who heads the Arab American Association of New York and is one of four   of the national march. “Sometimes you are going to upset people. ” The post that offended Ms. Willis was part of that effort. So was the quotation posted on the march’s Facebook page from Bell Hooks, the black feminist, about forging a stronger sisterhood by “confronting the ways women  —   through sex, class and race  —   dominated and exploited other women. ” In response, a New Jersey woman wrote: “I’m starting to feel not very welcome in this endeavor. ” A debate then ensued about whether white women were just now experiencing what minority women experience daily, or were having a hard time yielding control. A young white woman from Baltimore wrote with bitterness that white women who might have been victims of rape and abuse were being “asked to check their privilege,” a catchphrase that refers to people acknowledging their advantages, but which even some liberal women find unduly confrontational. No one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the Trump presidency. “I will march,” one wrote on the march’s Facebook page, “Hoping that someday soon a sense of unity will occur before it’s too late. ” But these debates over race also reflect deeper questions about the future of progressivism in the age of Trump. Should the march highlight what divides women, or what unites them? Is there room for women who have never heard of “white privilege”? And at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won  —   with half of white female voters supporting him  —   is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down? “If your   goal is to get as many people as possible at the march, maybe you don’t want to alienate people,” said Anne Valk, the author of “Radical Sisters,” a book about racial and class differences in the women’s movement. “But if your   goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change, then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege. ” The discord also reflects the variety of women’s rights and liberal causes being represented at the march, as well as a generational divide. Many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted. Many young activists have spent years protesting police tactics and criminal justice policies  —   issues they feel too many white liberals have ignored. “Yes, equal pay is an issue,” Ms. Sarsour said. “But look at the ratio of what white women get paid versus black women and Latina women. ” For too long, the march organizers said, the women’s rights movement focused on issues that were important to   white women, such as the ability to work outside the home and attain the same   positions that men do. But minority women, they said, have had different priorities. Black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the White House. Undocumented immigrant women might care about abortion rights, they said, but not nearly as much as they worry about being deported. This brand of feminism  —   frequently referred to as “intersectionality”  —   asks white women to acknowledge that they have had it easier. It speaks candidly about the history of racism, even within the feminist movement itself. The organizers of the 1913 suffrage march on Washington asked black women to march at the back of the parade. The issue of race has followed the march from its inception. The day after the election, Bob Bland, a fashion designer in New York, floated the idea of a march in Washington on Facebook. Within hours, 3, 000 people said they would join. Then a friend called to tell Ms. Bland that a woman in Hawaii with a similar page had collected pledges from 12, 000 people. “I thought, ‘Wow, let’s merge,’” Ms. Bland recalled. As the effort grew, a number of comments on Facebook implored Ms. Bland, who is white, to include minority women on the leadership team. Ms. Bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do. Within three days of the election, Carmen Perez, a Hispanic activist working on juvenile justice, and Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control activist who is black, joined Ms. Bland. Gloria Steinem, honorary   of the march along with Harry Belafonte, lauded their approach. “Sexism is always made worse by racism  —   and vice versa,” she said in an email. Ms. Steinem, who plans to participate in a town hall meeting during the march with Alicia Garza, a   of Black Lives Matter, said even contentious conversations about race were a “good thing. ” “It’s about knowing each other,” she wrote. “Which is what movements and marches are for. ” But the tone of the discussion, particularly online, can become so raw that some   marchers feel they are no longer welcome. Ms. Willis, the South Carolina wedding minister, had been looking forward to the salve of rallying with people who share her values, a rarity in her home state, where she said she had been insulted and shouted at for marrying gay couples. But then she read a post by ShiShi Rose, a    blogger from Brooklyn. “Now is the time for you to be listening more, talking less,” Ms. Rose wrote. “You should be reading our books and understanding the roots of racism and white supremacy. Listening to our speeches. You should be drowning yourselves in our poetry. ” It rubbed Ms. Willis the wrong way. “How do you know that I’m not reading black poetry?” she asked in an interview. Ms. Willis says that she understands being born white gives her advantages, and that she is always open to learning more about the struggles of others. But, she said, “The last thing that is going to make me endeared to you, to know you and love you more, is if you are sitting there wagging your finger at me. ” Ms. Rose said in an interview that the intention of the post was not to weed people out but rather to make them understand that they had a lot of learning to do. “I needed them to understand that they don’t just get to join the march and not check their privilege constantly,” she said. That phrase  —   check your privilege  —   exasperates Ms. Willis. She asked a reporter: “Can you please tell me what that means?”"
" Foreign-funding for “No” vs “Pro” Conventional Energy in CanadaLINK to Report:  https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-1.pdfExecutive SummaryIn their campaigns to address alleged human influences on global warming, many environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) in Canada have chosen to take actions that harm the Canadian economy – blocking necessary energy infrastructure, promoting increased reliance on expensive intermittent sources of electricity supply, urging the imposition of carbon taxes that raise the costs of everything for consumers, and constantly increasing regulations. They say “No” to hydrocarbon energy development. People need to know more about why these policies are being promoted and adopted, and who is influencing this. We can begin to understand more, if we answer three questions:How large is the funding of environmental organizations in Canada, especially those that, in the name of addressing allegedly human-induced global warming, have harmed Canada’s resource economy?How much of this funding comes from foreign sources?How balanced is the debate between the adversarial positions? In other words, how does the funding of those who say “No” compare to the funding of non-governmental organizations that take positions in favour of resource development and especially those that are skeptical about claims of human-induced climate catastrophe? Over the period from 2000 to 2017, the 18 largest ENGOs in Canada took in almost $6.8 billion in revenues, according to public records. Many of them received large amounts of foreign funding, especially from the Moore Foundation, the Packard Foundation, the Tides Foundation, the Wilburforce Foundation and the Bullitt Foundation. For example, the Moore foundation donated over $9.5 million to the David Suzuki Foundation alone. While the Canadian petroleum industry is very large and spends billions of dollars in Canada, this says nothing about whether or how it influences public policy. Based on the registry of lobbying of the federal government, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers is very active in lobbying the federal government about policies, laws and regulations that affect it. By checking this database, however, one can find little if any evidence that the petroleum industry has directly challenged the global warming catastrophe thesis. One will find ample evidence that the lobbying by the ENGOs more than matches the lobbying by the petroleum industry. The oldest non-governmental organization in Canada that directly challenges the catastrophe thesis, is the Friends of Science Society, operating since 2002. We review, as a case in point, the claims of Ecojustice, who called for an inquiry into this group and said there are “deep pockets” supporting the Friends of Science. The annual revenues of this organization have been around $150,000 per year on average since 2011. Ecojustice, in contrast, has taken in more than $81 million in revenues since 2000, or about $4.8 million on average per year (based on available public records). The public debate on the global warming and related energy issues (i.e. coal phase-out, renewables, pipelines) is being skewed by the preponderance of finance on one side of the issue. The charity status granted to many ENGOs that allows them to avoid income taxation while still carrying extensive political activity and lobbying is anomalous. This raises questions vis a vis Canada Revenue Agency Charities Directorate policy related to ‘net public benefit’ versus ‘public harm.’[1] These ENGOs have the right in a democracy to lobby for their views, but why on the backs of taxpayers?[1] “when benefit is proven, it must be weighed against any harm that may arise from the proposed activity and a net benefit must result”  https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html#toc3Big Green Money NO vs PRO FINAL RevB FEB 12 2019DownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"**Gary Rhodes, who has died at the age of 59, was one of Britain's most popular chefs on and off screen - showing his love of good British food on numerous TV shows, and winning Michelin stars for his restaurants.**
Rhodes grew up in Kent and began cooking at the age of 14, when his mother went back to work and asked him to cook his younger sister's dinners.
His first kitchen job was at the Hilton in Amsterdam. While there, he was hit by a van and needed brain surgery, but he recovered and returned to England. He made his first TV appearance on Keith Floyd's Floyd on Britain and Ireland in 1988.
His first full series for the BBC, Rhodes About Britain, was broadcast in 1994, and a second series followed a year later.
Then came programmes like Open Rhodes, Gary Rhodes's New British Classics and Classic Rhodes.
By the time he opened his first restaurant, City Rhodes in 1997, he was a household name, and his trademark spiky hair made him one of TV's most recognisable celebrity chefs.
City Rhodes won its Michelin star within 12 months. In 1998 he opened Rhodes in the Square, in Pimlico, which also won a Michelin star.
In 2001, the BBC chose Rhodes to take over as host of MasterChef from Lloyd Grossman, who had been at the helm for 10 years.
But Rhodes' incarnation of the show lasted just one series before being cancelled. It was later relaunched - without Rhodes - in 2005.
His other TV shows included Gary Rhodes at the Table, Cookery Year and Rhodes Across India, while he published more than 20 cookbooks.
He often said he disliked the reputation he had among some food writers (""all this cheekie-chappie rubbish""), which was embodied by his spiky hair. But he said: ""I think it wouldn't matter if I changed my hairstyle tomorrow, they wouldn't like the next hairstyle either.""
When Rhodes was made an OBE for services to the hospitality industry in 2006, he said the honour was more exciting than receiving a Michelin star.
""As a young lad growing up you would hear about these people getting these honours and think how proud they must feel. I never thought something like this would happen,"" he said.
He took part in the sixth series of Strictly Come Dancing in 2008, partnered with Karen Hardy. But his dancing wasn't quite up to the standard of his cooking - they were the third couple to be voted off.
He's pictured here on St George's Day 2009 with Boris Johnson - then mayor of London, now prime minister. Rhodes is wielding a bread and butter pudding, and once said he was most proud of redeeming the humble dish's reputation.
He's pictured with fellow chefs Heston Blumenthal (left) and Michel Roux Jr (centre), who were judging chefs competing to win a Roux Scholarship in 2009.
He championed tomatoes on BBC Two's Great British Food Revival in 2012.
Rhodes' family said he died on Tuesday in Dubai, which had become his home and where he ran two restaurants.

"**Hundreds of migrants have been removed by police from a crowded dock in Spain's Canary Islands, following a sharp rise in the number of people arriving there from Africa.**
A group of 225 people were evicted from the ArguineguÃ­n port in Gran Canaria on Tuesday, but thousands still remain.
It follows protests over conditions at the port, which an immigration judge earlier described as ""inhumane"".
A total of 16,700 migrants have reached the Canary Islands so far this year.
That is a rise of more than 1,000% on the same period last year, according to official data seen by the Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.
More than half of this year's arrivals took place over the last month, the data shows. The island chain is just 100km (60 miles) off the coast of North Africa.
Police evicted the migrants from the emergency camp at ArguineguÃ­n on Tuesday, and video showed many of them wandering around the small fishing village. The move was instigated by the national government, and local authorities were quick to criticise the plan.
""The [migrants] have been left without food, drink or [a] destination to go to,"" one local official told the Efe news agency.
Shortly after their removal, the island authorities arranged buses to take the migrants to a reception facility in the capital city Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Many of the arrivals are believed to be young men from Morocco and the country's consulate is in the city.
The eviction exposed apparent tensions between the authorities on the island and the Spanish government in Madrid over how best to respond to the recent spike in migrant arrivals.
""We denounce this continued contempt for migrants and this island by the Ministry of the Interior,"" the island's president Antonio Morales wrote on Twitter. ""We demand the resignation of those responsible.""
""Migrants cannot be put on the street without any type of accommodation or food,"" a statement from the Unified Police Trade Union said.
The government in Madrid is investigating how the decision to evict the migrants was made, sources at the interior ministry told the El PaÃ­s newspaper.
The route from West Africa to the Canary Islands has grown in popularity since 2018. A previous peak, in 2006, saw 35,000 migrants arrive in the archipelago, the UN says.
Last month at least 140 migrants bound for Europe drowned after a boat carrying about 200 people sank off the coast of Senegal. The boat caught fire and capsized shortly after leaving the town of Mbour, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.
It is believed the migrants were attempting to reach mainland Europe via the Canary Islands."
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who spent 27 years as a public servant in senior policy advisory roles related to Kyoto and GHG reductions; prior to that, he was a diplomat for 10 years. The Narwhal piece discussed below was linked within a David Suzuki Foundation blog post of May 23, 2019 entitled “True leaders work for us, not the fossil fuel industry.”In a March 29, 2018 opinion piece recycled in The Narwhal, Emma Gilchrist took great umbrage at the research findings of Vivian Krause. Vivian Krause and others have documented the extremely large funding provided by foreign private foundations to support the efforts of Canadian environmental groups to halt the further development of Canada’s oil and natural gas industries. In a somewhat rambling fashion, Ms. Gilchrist made the following arguments (I paraphrase):The funding provided by foreign foundations was not clandestine.“Science” justifies harming Canada’s oil and gas industry because (somehow, unexplained) doing so will save the planet (The implied proposition is that reducing the growth in Canada’s oil and gas supply will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, although that is never clearly articulated, merely stated as a code that everyone believes).The British Columbia government does not adequately regulate foreign contributions to political parties’ election campaigns.As a result, 48 “fossil fuel companies” (undefined and unlisted) donated $5.2 million to B.C. political parties between 2008 and 2015.The company that proposed to build the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion was foreign-owned, as are many of the companies that own and operate oil sands and LNG projects.The federal government formerly welcomed a $40 million contribution from U.S. foundations to the Great Bear Rainforest.How environmental organizations are funded is not a worthy topic of political debate in Canada.The oil industry is not an underdog in this discourse.Before I address these contentions, let me, as someone who has written previously in support of Vivian Krause’s thesis,  establish what is not at issue. No one disagrees (I believe) that U.S. private foundations have spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding Canadian environmental groups and their frequent collaborators in the indigenous communities. The numbers are well documented in the filings of annual reports by the private foundations to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and, to a lesser extent, in the filings by the receiving Canadian organizations to the Canada Revenue Agency. The total amount of foreign funding over the last 20 years may not be known, but two examples may serve to illustrate the magnitude. First, consider the Tides Canada Foundation Payments on one campaign, as listed in Table 1:Table 1Tides Canada Foundation Payments under the “Tar Sands Campaign” 2012 to 2016RecipientPayments ($)Canadian Climate Action Network168,000Council of Canadians71,300Dogwood Institute721,200Ecojustice768,100Environmental Defence Canada, Inc.1,342,000Equiterre540,700Great Bear Rainforest Initiative260,900Greenpeace Canada689,900Living Oceans Society172,400Pembina Institute682,400Sierra Club of British Columbia253,800Sierra Club of Canada Foundation101,100Sisu Society1,761,100Tseil-Waututh First Nation191,000West Coast Environmental Law Association227,100350.org451,100Earthjustice350,000Earthworks388,000Friends of the Earth61,300Indigenous Environmental Network291,000New Venture Fund380,000Sierra Club Foundation736,000Sourced from public records.The Tides Foundation is not the only U.S. Foundation actively involved in trying to shape the global warming debate in Canada. Krause’s research has found that the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is the largest funder of environmental activism in British Columbia, and has granted more than $190 million to First Nations, environmental and other organizations working in B.C. By far the largest recipient of funds from the Moore Foundation is Tides Canada, which has been granted at least $70 million, and then regrants it to other groups.There is no doubt that, of all the foreign presences, Tides and the Tides Canada Foundation historically have had the most far reaching effects on the Canadian economy. Tides Canada Foundation is a registered Canadian charity and is equivalent in law to a 501 c 3 charity in the United States. A significant share of the revenue of Tides Canada is from the U.S. In 2015, for example, 70 % of the total revenue of Tides Canada Foundation was from outside Canada, most of it from the United States. Over the past decade, the total assets of Tides Canada have soared to $58 million and it has made expenditures of more than $250 million. With over 200 employees, Tides Canada is a hub of activism and has funded major campaigns against all of Canada’s main resource-based industries: forestry, mining, oil and gas, and salmon farming.Other “givens”, I believe, are that:The funding itself is a matter of public record, at least to the extent that someone is willing to doing extensive research to find it.The practices of government in regulating financial contributions to political parties varies considerably across Canada, with British Columbia having perhaps the least restrictive regime. The Canadian federal government, in contrast, has very restrictive regimes governing both the amounts of donations that different parties might make and the registration and reporting of lobbying activity.No one regulates the much more pervasive political activities involved in advertising and propagandizing for contending views on public policy, the organization of demonstrations, blockades and legal opposition to lawfully authorized energy infrastructure, and other actions intended to influence public opinion and to pressure politicians in periods between elections. Such allegedly “non-partisan” political activities operate essentially without any government control and are the primary domaine of the environmental organizations and their legal counterparts.There is no doubt that foreign private investors (and some foreign public investors in the case of China) play a large role in the Canadian economy, as do Canadian investors who own shares in companies abroad.Much of the funding of Canadian environmental organizations, including at least some of the foreign funding, goes to support legitimate environmental protection.What remains very much at issue is the question of whether the large foreign funding of Canadian groups, and especially those engaged in the “Tar Sands Campaign” is an unwarranted and harmful intrusion into Canadian domestic energy policy, unjustified by the alleged environmental threat.The Issue of Principle If a group of Nazis resident in Argentina spent millions of dollars to influence Canadian policy on race relations, would that be unobjectionable? If a group of influential Russians or Communist Chinese paid millions of dollars to influence a local or provincial election or to lobby the electorate between elections, would that pose no problem? In the United States, the allegation of Russian meddling in the 2015 Presidential election has absorbed the attention of millions of people and many politicians ever since. In most countries, the intrusion of foreign influences whose objectives are contrary to the domestic national interest is properly regarded as inappropriate, regardless of whether or not the intrusions are by governments.This has been recognized here, too. The Trudeau government in January 2019 issued an announcement on the need for Canada’s political systems to combat a growing foreign threat to Canada’s political systems, because “new technologies and advances in how we consume information may potentially allow adversaries to use cyber-enable means to influence Canada’s democratic processes.”Foreign governments are not the only threat. The globalization that Emma Gilchrist celebrates means that very large and well-funded organizations of all kinds can use their spending power to shape political conditions in Canada, especially views about particular issues. By funding one set of viewpoints over others, they can upset the political balance that otherwise exists, and fundamentally alter our democracy. We would be naïve and foolish to ignore this threat. The foreign private foundations deserve far more scrutiny and regulation in their activities, not least of all because most of them are registered charities. This enables them to benefit from tax-free status and to present themselves as providers of a public service, even they are heavily involved in political activities that have little or nothing to do with their allegedly charitable objectives.Ms. Gilchrist seems to say that large-scale foreign funding of environmental causes in Canada is okay because the causes being funded by the foreign influences is a good one. Let’s deal with that.The Non-Link between Alleged Catastrophic Global Warming and Canadian Hydrocarbons Production There are many scientists and others who believe the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming. There are also a large number of scientists and others who consider that this thesis is flawed, as is the modelling that projects the results of likely emissions growth a century hence. In fact, many excellent papers demonstrate the flaws of the science and the highly politicized nature of the work by international organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).If readers with an objective mindset wish to read a single document that presents the problems with the science in a very balanced way, it might be Michael Hart’s 2015 book entitled, Hubris – The Troubling Science, Economics, and Politics of Climate Change. While excellent, it is a long read. Those preferring shorter, but still expert, overviews might read the presentation given by Dr. Judith Curry to the U.S. Congress on the differences in views among scientists. You can find it here:https://judithcurry.com/2018/06/12/the-debate-mann-titley-moore-curry/For those more given to examining data and the metrics by which climate might be measured, but still want a readable text, I suggest John Christy’s The Tropic Skies: Falsifying Climate Alarm. It can be read here:https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/05/JohnChristy-Parliament.pdfIn this short article, I do not plan to revisit the scientific debate. That is not my area of expertise. Rather, I would like to offer some factual data that shows that the emissions reductions that the United Nations is calling for are simply not going to happen, not because of what we do in Canada, but what is occurring around the world.Let’s start at the beginning. Carbon dioxide emissions are the natural by-product of the production, transportation and use of fossil fuels used to produce energy services. The energy services are heat, light, air-conditioning, mobility and all the various uses of electricity when generated from the burning of fossil fuels.It is the human demand/need for energy services that has given rise to and continues to support the growth in use of fossil fuels. Those energy services are central to the modern way of life and the standard of living that we enjoy in modern society.There are six broad categories of energy services that must be supplied, corresponding to the sectors of the economy: transportation, industrial production, electricity generation, commercial activity, residences and others. The proportions represented by each of these sectors varies by geographic region.Twenty years ago, two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world occurred in the developed countries, the more industrialized members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and one-third occurred in the developing, or non-OECD, countries. Today, the roles are almost reversed. See the following table:Table 2Grouping2007 Mt2016 Mt2017  MtGrowth Rate2006-2016 (%)OECD136301239912448-0.8Non-OECD1644920619209962.9World3007933018334441.3Source: BP Statistical Review of World EnergyAs you can see from the table, global emissions of GHGs were about 33 billion tonnes in 2017, an increase of 57% since governments first began claiming that they would reduce emissions in 1990. The non-OECD region alone accounts for 21 billion tonnes annually, almost two-thirds of the total, and steadily rising. Canada’s entire emissions represent 1.6%.Despite all the alarm and expensive emissions reductions activity, not a single one of the emissions reductions goals set by international organizations has ever been met. Why? Because the developing countries want the same energy services that we enjoy in the developed countries, and fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) are the most affordable way to have that. After 28 years of international target setting and trillions of dollars in expenditures by governments on renewable energy sources, other energy alternatives and energy efficiency, fossil fuels still provide 84% of the world’s energy supply.Here’s the kicker. The IPCC, in its Special Report 15, issued in September 2018, claimed that its previous goals were not stringent enough, so the world had to accelerate its (non-existent) emissions reduction so that global emissions will be down to 17 billion tonnes in 2030 and zero in 2050. By 2030, based on current trends, the emissions of China and India combined will be much higher than 17 billion tonnes. So, all the 195 other countries in the world would have to completely eliminate their GHG emissions by 2030, a little over eleven years.Is the impossibility of these goals becoming clear yet?I will add one more set of facts to the consideration. About 80% of the GHG emissions from either oil or natural gas fuel cycles (i.e. from production to final use) occur at the final combustion stage. So, reducing emissions would logically focus there, on consumers. Actions to curtail Canada’s oil and gas production do nothing to reduce global consumption. The countries that would otherwise be served by Canadian oil will simply buy it from elsewhere.Global oil demand has been rising at the rate of more than one million barrels per day every year since 2012. Today, it is at its highest level in history, at over 100 million barrels per day, and shows no sign of deceasing in the foreseeable future.Attacking the Canadian oil industry and harming its access to markets and investment therefore will contribute nothing to reducing global emissions. If one wants to harm economic development in western Canada, reduce the revenues to oil companies and the governments that tax them, injure one’s fellow Canadians, politicize all discussions of energy, and harm national unity, it is a good tactic, but one should not pretend it is being done for a global cause.The Oil Industry’s Interests are Not the Issue Emma Gilchrist commented that the oil industry is not the underdog in the controversy over foreign funding of the Tar Sands Campaign and other attacks on the Canadian energy economy. On this, she is right, but it totally misses the point.The Canadian oil and gas industry, for all its billions of dollars in annual revenues, focuses on investing and operating in a policy and regulatory environment that offers certainty, but it plays no funding role at all in challenging the climate catastrophe thesis.Those who seek to inject balance into the discussions of energy policy goals, so that economic development and the widespread dissemination of economic benefits from energy production and use will take at least equal place with environmental considerations – those are the ones who are the underdogs. The few private organizations that seek to demonstrate to Canadians the importance of energy in the economy and the pointlessness of trying to solve a global problem by attacking our own industry – those are the ones being disadvantaged, as are the large number of Canadians affected.Unlike the environmental groups with hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal, the few organizations who contest the political claims of the climate lobby have funds measured in the few hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, and none of it is from the oil and gas industry.Canada’s interests are the issue. Fair play in our democracy is the issue.The Results of Climate Change Policies  Finally, what have been the effects of emission reduction measures to date? Actually, we know that they have had seriously adverse consequences. As Matt Ridley puts it, ‘Building wind turbines, growing biofuels and substituting wood for coal in power stations — all policies designed explicitly to fight climate change — have had negligible effects on carbon dioxide emissions. But they have driven people into fuel poverty, made industries uncompetitive, driven up food prices, accelerated the destruction of forests, killed rare birds of prey, and divided communities… globally nearly 200,000 people are dying every year, because we are turning 5 per cent of the world’s grain crop into motor fuel instead of food: that pushes people into malnutrition and death’. In Canada, largely due to the influence of partly foreign-funded environmental groups, we have gone further and blocked or significantly delayed the construction of pipeline infrastructure badly needed to provide market access, depriving Canadians of the current economic benefits of infrastructure construction and western Canada of the long-term income, employment and revenue benefits of increased oil and gas production and sale. We have been implementing climate policies that have probably been net-harmful to humans and the environment on the questionable premise that emissions might become net-harmful many decades in the future. ~~~~Related:No Pipeline is a Problem – A Challenge to DemocracyClimate Change Policy – A Threat to CanadaCan Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?

" Contributed by Howard Dewhirst, FGS © 2019Howard Dewhirst is part of a group of Fellows of the Geological Society of London who have challenged the society’s position on human-causation of global warming.Friends of Science Society spoke with him at the Basic Science of a Changing Climate Conference in Porto, Portugal,  September 2018.Despite 30 years of effort and many billions of dollars spent, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and  the world have failed utterly to stop the rise of human CO2 emissions. Is this because people don’t care, or is it becoming more and more obvious that the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) hypothesis is flawed? Warming has undoubtedly occurred and this century is warmer than the last two, but the world’s average temperature has hardly moved since 1998, while CO2 has increased by 30%.Half of the warming post the Industrial Revolution had already occurred by 1943, before the increase in human CO2 emissions that began around 1950, so what caused this warming?Since the start of the last century, there have been two periods of warming, the first without increased CO2, the second post 1978, with sharply increasing CO2 emissions. There have also been two periods of cooling/lack of warming, both of which were accompanied by increasing CO2. If CO2 causes warming, the world should have continued to warm since ~1950 when CO2 emissions began climbing higher and higher, but it did not. This discrepancy suggests that the IPCC AGW hypothesis, that human CO2 emissions cause warming, may be wrong.What the increase in atmospheric CO2 has done, is increase crop yields world-wide, by ~30%, with as yet, few serious side effects; so why do we need to cut emissions now? And if Australia reduced its current 407 Mt CO2 emissions to zero, what difference would it make? World human CO2 emissions in 2017 were 33,444 Mt (= just 4.3ppm gross addition to the atmosphere), with China contributing 9,330 Mt and USA 5,100 Mt.  Australia produced 427 Mt (~= 0.05ppm). And what would its removal cost us? Just look at South Australia where the price of electricity is double what it is in Canberra, and three times the price in the US; and the state’s share of the Australian economy has fallen from 8% in 1986 to 6% in 2017 as more and more factories close; now apply that to the whole country.Daily we are told that Climate Change disasters are crippling the planet, as weather becomes more and more extreme, but it is not. 2018 is the first year ever, without severe (>F3) tornadoes in USA; Australian cyclone frequency has fallen since 1971, droughts and rainfall are not more frequent or severe, bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef is not increasing, nor are el Niños. Cold oceans absorb CO2 so the warmer the seas get, the less so-called ‘acidification’ there is. Fire damage in California is increasing but not the numbers of fires, suggesting forest management is the problem, as it has been in Australia. The average number of very hot days in USA and Australia is not increasingSea level rise at Sydney harbour is a steady 7.5 cm per 100 years, and shows no sign of being affected by increasing CO2. Malaria will not spread as the globe warms, as it is not a solely tropical disease, (the world’s largest known epidemic was in Siberia in 1920s). Alpine glaciers are retreating – and have been doing so since about 1825; global warming began around 1695 at the beginning of the end of the Little Ice Age and sea level rise began around 1795, all well before human CO2 made an appearance.Arctic sea ice is shrinking (but has not disappeared as famously promised by Al Gore), Antarctic ice is getting thicker and polar bear numbers are increasing, as is Antarctic sea ice. Overall the claimed impacts of human induced CO2 emissions are not happening.Endlessly we are also told that 97% of scientists agree that human CO2 is the cause of global warming; the analysis was skewed.  Al Gore made it famous in his ‘Inconvenient Truth’ video, but it is a deception.https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf There probably is 97% agreement that CO2 emissions are increasing and that the planet has warmed, only dictators get a higher percent of support than that. What is not agreed is that the warming is dangerous and was caused by human CO2 emissions.Wrapped up in the 97% debate is another even more blatant manipulation of data to give false support to the IPCC AGW hypothesis – Climate Gate. In 2009, a few thousand emails were hacked from the University of East Anglia department that produces one of the five or so sets of international climate data that are used to measure the world’s average temperature.  The most relevant is from Phil Jones ‘I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temperatures to each series for the last 20 years (i.e. from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s, to hide the decline’  What used to be called the Nuclear Winter, was a period of declining world temperature from 1943 to 1978 which the authors of the emails identified as a problem for their IPCC warming story, and which was eventually removed from the record. Slowly but surely the world’s temperature data sets were massaged to make them fit the IPCC song sheet; called homogenisation, temperature data from earlier years were made colder and data from later periods was made warmer, to give the erroneous impression that the world’s average temperature had always increased since the start of the Industrial Revolution.The Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which saw the Vikings settle in Greenland as farmers, is well documented and appeared in the First Assessment Report in 1990 of the UN climate panel report (IPCC). In a later IPCC report, the now infamous ‘Hockey Stick’ was featured and also saw the light of day in Al Gore’s video. That representation erased that MWP period and showed temperatures declining slowly from 1000 AD, with a sudden up-tick when CO2 started to increase. This representation is now hotly debated, but it was very effective in the video in selling the idea that it was all human CO2 and all our fault.For:https://news.psu.edu/story/344876/2015/02/14/research/iconic-graph-center-climate-debate Against:https://climateaudit.org/2005/04/08/mckitrick-what-the-hockey-stick-debate-is-about/ Here is how the Medieval Warm Period was represented in the 1990 IPCC report.Much of the IPCC argument about CO2 driven global warming, is derived from computer models, and it is to honour the routinely wrong projections from these models that other players fudge and fiddle with temperature data. What is truly astonishing is that all but one of the 100 plus models used by the IPCC to sell their story, predict a much warmer future than actually occurs. Yet it is these models that governments use to define/decide climate and emissions policy.The IPCC’s AGW hypothesis claims that human CO2 alone has upset the balance of the world’s carbon budget, and this alone, drives global warming and climate change; however polar ice core data covering the last 800,000 years shows that atmospheric CO2 always responds to changes in temperature, in other words atmospheric CO2 is a result of global warming/cooling, not the driver. This is the inconvenient fact which all of the data manipulation above is designed to counteract. And it is not just the recent past that is inconvenient as the AGW idea can’t explain why the Ordovician/Silurian ice age took place when atmospheric CO2 was ten times higher than today, nor for the Late Jurassic ice age when CO2 was 6 times higher. Nor does it explain how CO2 rose 25 ppm from the beginning of the Holocene while the average temperature declined. The geological record is endlessly clear, CO2 does not cause warming – unless you want it to, and are prepared to ignore or manipulate inconvenient facts.The scientific method shows that “If a theory rules out certain possible occurrences, … it will be falsified if these possible occurrences do in fact occur.” CO2 lagging temperature for over 500 million years falsifies the untested AGW hypothesis again and again.The latest IPCC report claims that it needs just $2.4 trillion per year for 30 years to ‘prevent’ climate change, this is the prize money that keeps the global warming/Climate Change gravy train lubricated. And their failure to achieve any reduction in emissions despite 30 years of effort suggests that they will not succeed in the future, no matter how much money is spent.The question is, where have these IPCC based predictions ever been correct?All models predict warmer temperatures than occur, but less than AGW Hypothesis (it I NOT a theory) projectsModels predict tropical tropospheric warming which has never been detectedModels fail to hindcast or forecast any multi-decadal oscillations such as el NinoModel projections fail to agree with any balloon and satellite temperature dataModels fail to explain warming pre-1943 when human CO2 negligible, cooling from 1943 – 78 and from ~1998 when CO2 was increasingModels fail to explain high CO2 during interglacials and subsequent coolingModels fail to explain drop in hurricane frequency from ~1969 to 1994Models cannot explain lack of clear trends in rainfall patternsModels fail to explain how Human CO2 behaves differently to natural CO2Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"The Percival Effect
Correlations, Causes and Dis-proofs
Every morning just before dawn our rooster crows and soon afterwards the sun comes up. We have observed no exceptions over three months – clear evidence of perfect correlation. Therefore we have concluded that the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise.
My wife Flora (who believes that the Cooee birds bring the rain) said: “I knew that ages ago – Professor Percival told me.”
So I consulted Professor Percival, our neighbour. He is Professor Emeritus in the “Science in Society” Department at Top-Line University. He specialises in the effect of sound waves on atmospheric transmissivity. He says that some roosters produce sound waves of just the right frequency to affect the dawn visibility through the thick morning atmosphere. He has written pal-reviewed papers on the subject which has been named “The Percival Effect”. In all the hallowed halls, it is regarded as “settled science”.

Cartoon credit: http://stevehunterillustrations.com.au/political-cartoons/
However, we decided that our rooster was not doing his day job, so he ended up as roast dinner last night.
Flora was very concerned – “what if the sun does not appear at all tomorrow?” she wailed.
But the sun rose as normal.
Flora was relieved but a concerned Professor Percival went off to check his calculations “for feedback loops”. He is still checking.
One thing was proved conclusively in just one day – the rooster’s crowing does not make the sun appear. Something else causes the sun to rise. Our ninety-two correlations did not prove causation. But just one disproof was needed to kill the Percival Effect.
So it is with the Greenhouse Effect. For about 20 years now, carbon dioxide levels have risen steadily but global temperatures are trending level. Therefore CO2 does not control global temperature.
One disproof is all that is needed.

"**We've probably all got a favourite smell - maybe one that's tied up with a particular memory or person, or lets you know a good plate of food is on the way.**
Gabriella Sanders has never had the use of her smelling senses - and it affects more than just her nose.
""I don't know what food tastes like. I can't taste hot drinks or anything sweet and spicy,"" the 22-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
It's not something that many people can relate to, with around 5% of the population suffering from a smell disorder.
But not having a sense of smell can have different types of impact - practical and emotional - on someone's life, according to a new study from the University of East Anglia. Think childhood fears and awkward teenage moments, to a feeling of failure when not being able to tell your baby's nappy needs changing.
""I've never been able to smell anything. It's weird because nobody else in my family history has had this - it's just me and my sister - so it must be something genetic.""
Gabriella remembers ""feeling really left out"" during a particular school project when she was young.
""It was about senses and everyone was talking about smelling things.
""That was when I realised I couldn't smell. Everyone was giving examples but I had no idea what was going on.""
It caused some childhood issues Gabriella might otherwise not have had.
""I had a massive phobia of fire. I had this big anxiety that I wouldn't wake up when the house was on fire because I wouldn't be able to smell it,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
""That definitely affected me when I was younger, but I've grown out of that.""
Gabriella had that fear for a serious reason - not being able to smell gas or smoke is a ""really big problem"" that's resulted in ""serious near misses for some"", according to Professor Carl Philpott, one of the researchers of the UEA study.
Gabriella can relate.
""I remember one time when I was cooking at home. My mum came home and said the whole house smelt like gas. So that was really worrying.
""Things like that, I've kind of grown up being scared of. But I'm a lot more cautious now and take precautions.""
It's not just smells from the outside world that are useful to pick up though - the UEA study found that personal hygiene ""was a big cause for anxiety and embarrassment"", because participants couldn't smell themselves.
As a teenager though, Gabriella came up with a solution.
""My parents and I created code words.
""So if I came home with a friend and smelt really bad, they would tell me so I could quickly run off and sort it out.""
Now Gabriella is a contemporary dancer, which is obviously a pretty active lifestyle.
""In terms of perfumes and stuff, I've never really owned anything like that. Things like nice flowers or even bath bombs, it's never interested me.
""But I use deodorant because I dance everyday, even though I'm not into that stuff.""
It might feel awkward to talk about but Gabriella says not being able to smell is nothing to be ashamed of.
""I think being open with your friends and people around you is important - telling people to be comfortable in telling you if you smell bad.
""I've always made sure that people around me know I can't smell. So I say to them 'Please tell me and I won't take offence'.
""I'd rather know than make it unpleasant for everyone else.""
Does Gabriella wish she could smell things?
""It's not something I need because I've never had it, so I don't know what I'm missing.
""But, I'd love to experience it - and have that feeling of tasting things.""

"**At least 74 migrants have died after the ship carrying them was wrecked off the coast of Libya, the UN says.**
Rescuers managed to bring 47 survivors to shore, staff from its International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said.
Libya has been a major transit point for migrants from many countries trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
The IOM says at least 900 people have drowned on this route this year, with another 11,000 returned to Libya, where it says they face detention and abuse.
Five migrants died on Wednesday and 100 were rescued when their boat capsized off the Libyan coastal town of Sabratha, not far from the Italian island of Lampedusa.
Migrants have also died trying to reach Spain's Canary Islands from West African shores. Some 140 drowned last month off the coast of Senegal when their boat caught fire and capsized.
The IOM says it took place off the coast of Khums in Libya on Thursday.
It said the boat was reported to be carrying more than 120 people, among them women and children. The coast guard and fishermen brought the survivors to shore.
There have been at least nine migrant shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean since 1 October, the IOM says.
Federico Soda, IOM Libya chief of mission, said: ""The mounting loss of life in the Mediterranean is a manifestation of the inability of states to take decisive action to redeploy much needed, dedicated search and rescue capacity in the deadliest sea-crossing in the world.""
The IOM does not believe Libya is a safe point of return for migrants rescued at sea, fearing they face human rights violations, trafficking and exploitation.
Mr Soda said: ""Thousands of vulnerable people continue to pay the price for inaction both at sea and on land.""
Libya has had no stable government since the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, although there are hopes current UN-led talks could lead to a transitional government and then elections."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new reconstruction of Arctic (NW Greenland) sea ice cover (Caron et al., 2019) reveals modern day sea ice is present multiple months longer than almost any time in the last 8000 years…and today’s summer sea surface temperatures are among the coldest of the Holocene.
Yet another new study (Caron et al., 2019) shows today’s Arctic sea ice cover is still quite extensive when compared to the last several thousand years, when CO2 concentrations ranged between 260 and 270 ppm.

Image Source: Caron et al., 2019
Regional (northwest Greenland) sea surface temperatures were about 2°C warmer than at present for most of the last 6000 to 8000 years.

Image Source: Caron et al., 2019
Other new Arctic sea ice reconstructions from the north of Iceland (Harning et al., 2019) and Barents Sea (Berben et al., 2019) regions indicate a) modern sea ice extent has changed very little in the last several hundred years, or since the Little Ice Age, and b) the Early Holocene had millennial-scale periods of sea-ice-free and open water conditions, which is in stark contrast to “modern conditions” – the “highest value” or furthest extent of the sea ice record.
“[T]he PBIP25 values [proxy for sea ice presence] reach their highest value (0.87) of the record at ca. 0 cal yr BP. An increase in PBIP25 suggests a further extension in sea ice cover, reflecting Arctic Front conditions (Müller et al., 2011), most similar to modern conditions.” (Berben et al., 2019)

Today we plot NASA Version 4 data for 19 Antarctic stations going back to 1988 (including volcanoes areas of West Antarctica and Peninsula), see map below.
The 19 stations were chosen because they have both Version 3 and Version 4 data available.

We plot the data on 4 different charts for the purpose of clarity. Included are also the volcanic areas of West Antarctica and the West Antarctic Peninsula.
Of the 19 stations plotted, 9 show no warming using NASA GISS Version 4 data. Version 3 the number is 10 not showing any warming. The stations that are cooling/stable are underlined in blue on the map above.
What follows are plots of the first 7 (warmest) stations:

The above chart shows the data for the stations located at the West Antarctic peninsula. The data over the past 30 years show no unusual changes happening.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The next chart depicts 8 additional stations whose mean annual temperature is around -10°C.

Also here we see no unusual activity from the NASA data. Most are cooling a bit, or near stable.

Above Halley shows a cooling trend, while the fragmented data from Mcmurdo Sound show warming, though nothing out of the ordinary.
Finally plots of the 2 remaining (coldest) stations, Amundsen and Vostok, are shown:

As you can see, the incomplete data of these two frigid stations suggest some moderate warming. But at those ranges, even slight atmospheric perturbations can have notable effects on temperature there.
At -49°C and -55°C respectively, they are pretty much stuck at rock bottom and suggest no sign of any unusual warming. For those waiting for signs of global climate change coming out of Antarctica, you might be waiting quite awhile longer.

From Dr. Roy Spencer’s blog
June 27th, 2019 by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.
It is a truism that any observed change in nature will be blamed by some experts on global warming (aka “climate change”, “climate crisis”, “climate emergency”).
When the Great Lakes water levels were unusually low from approximately 2000 through 2012 or so, this was pointed to as evidence that global warming was causing the Great Lakes to dry up.
Take for example this 2012 article from National Geographic, which was accompanied by this startling photo:

The accompanying text called this the “lake bottom”, as if Lake Michigan (which averages 279 feet deep) had somehow dried up.
Then in a matter of two years, low lake levels were replaced with high lake levels. The cause (analysis here) was a combination of unusually high precipitation (contrary to global warming theory) and an unusually cold winter that caused the lakes to mostly freeze over, reducing evaporation.
Now, as of this month (June, 2019), ALL of the Great Lakes have reached record high levels.
Time To Change The Story
So, how shall global warming alarmists explain this observational defiance of their predictions?
Simple! They just invoke “climate weirding”, and claim that the climate emergency has caused water levels to become more erratic, to see-saw, to become more variable!
The trouble is that there is that there is no good evidence in the last 100 years that this is happening. This plot of the four major lake systems (Huron and Michigan are at the same level, connected at the Straits of Mackinac) shows no increased variability since levels have been accurately monitored (data from NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory):

This is just one more example of how unscientific many global warming claims have become. Both weather and climate are nonlinear dynamical systems, capable of producing changes without any ‘forcing’ from increasing CO2 or the Sun. Change is normal.
What is abnormal is blaming every change in nature we don’t like on human activities. That’s what happened in medieval times, when witches were blamed for storms, droughts, etc.
One would hope we progressed beyond that mentality.

"By Keith DeLacy AM, Queensland business identity and former Labor Treasurer of Queensland.
First published by The Australian [$ Paywall]
One policy which seems to have escaped scrutiny during this election campaign is Labor’s commitment to increase the Renewable Energy Target (RET) to 50% by 2030.
I am surprised because it is a proposal that has enormous ramifications for economic growth and living standards, and disproportionate impacts on traditional Labor constituencies.
The problem we have in Australia is when we talk renewable energy we are talking wind and solar only – low value, expensive, unreliable, high capital cost, land hungry, intermittent energy. 
According to the Department of Industry and Science wind currently generates 4.1% and solar 2% of Australia’s electricity. But even this is highly misleading because it is such low value power. You could close it down tomorrow (which it regularly does by itself) and it would make no difference to supply.
If we talk about total energy, as opposed to just electricity, wind and solar represent 1% of Australia’s energy consumption. This despite  billions of dollars of investment, subsidies, creative tariffs, mandates, and so on. 
Solar and wind simply don’t work, not here, not anywhere. The energy supply is not dense enough. The capital cost of consolidating it makes it cost prohibitive.

But they are not only much more expensive because of this terminal disadvantage, they are low value intermittent power sources – every kilowatt has to be backed up by conventional power, dreaded fossil fuels. So we have two capital spends for the same output – one for the renewable and one for the conventional back up. Are you surprised it is so much more expensive, and inefficient, and always will be!
So wind and solar, from a large scale electricity point of view, are duds. Now I know that will send the urgers into paroxysms of outrage. But have you ever seen an industry that so believed its own propaganda. Note, when they eulogise the future of renewables they point to targets, or to costly investments, never to the real contribution to supply.
Let’s look overseas where there are many countries that have been destroying their budgets and their economies on this illusion for longer and more comprehensively than we in Australia.
The Germans are ruing the day they decided to save the world by converting to solar and wind. Germany has spent US$100 billion on solar technology and it represents less than 1% of their electricity supply. Energy policy has been a disaster.  Subsidies are colossal, the energy market is now chaotic, industry is decamping to other jurisdictions, and more than 1 million homes have had their power cut off.
It is reported that electricity prices in Germany, Spain and the UK increased by 78%, 111% and 133% between 2005 and 2014 as they forced additional renewable capacity into their electricity markets.
Sunny Spain used to be the poster boy for renewables in Europe – photovoltaic cells and wind turbines stretching on forever. Now they are broke, winding back subsidies, even the feed-in tariffs which were guaranteed for 20 years. 
But wait, what about the green energy jobs that everybody gushes about? Spain has an unemployment rate of 21% with a youth rate of 45.5%.
The UK is little better. Subsidies are being wound back, and a Department of Energy report points out that in 2013, the number of households in fuel poverty in England was estimated at 2.35million representing approximately 10.4% of all households. 
It is no better in the US either. States with Renewable Energy Mandates (REMs) are back-tracking faster than Sally Pearson can clear hurdles! 
Ohio has halved its mandate level (was 25% by 2025) because of high costs. West Virginia has repealed its REM because of high costs, and New Mexico has frozen its mandates.  Kansas was repealing its mandate which reportedly would save ratepayers $171 million, representing $4,367 for each household, and so the dismal story goes on.
The US Department of Energy has found that electricity prices have risen in States with REMs twice as fast as those with no mandate.
As of 2013 California was the only State to adopt a feed-in tariff for solar power. It was immediately dubbed a failure by the renewable energy community because it offered only 31 US cents per kwh, only 5 times the rate for conventional base load power!
Ah but Asian countries are jumping on the band wagon! Maybe. China built one new coal fired power plant every week in 2014, and India’s coal powered investment in that same year equaled the total electricity capacity of NSW and Qld.
To summarize – with all of the trillions spent world wide on wind and solar, wind currently (2015) represents 1.2 % of global consumption of energy, and solar 0.2%. 
The good news, it is possible to reduce fossil fuel use in electricity generation – through hydro-electricity and nuclear fuel. Plenty of countries have done it – Canada 60% hydro and 15% nuclear; Sweden 45% hydro and 48% nuclear; Switzerland 54% hydro and 41% nuclear; France 11% hydro and 79% nuclear.
But Australia has zero tolerance of these two workable alternatives to fossil fuels. At least we are consistently inconsistent!
So where does that leave us.  On the basis of evidence everywhere we could easily double the price of electricity and get nowhere near the 50% target. What would that mean? 
Firstly, it means rapidly disappearing blue collar jobs in high energy industries like manufacturing, car and ship building, smelting and refining, steel making and food processing. There may be still some construction jobs, but they will largely be assembly only, as all of the components will come from those countries more interested in growing the economy and eliminating poverty than stoking the warm inner glow!
Make no bones about it, a clean green economy has no place for high viz shirts! 
Secondly, rapidly rising electricity prices and the subsequent increase in the cost of living, disproportionately affects those at the bottom of the income scale.
Policies like this are OK for the Greens. They can keep their virtue intact because they never have to deliver. As Gough Whitlam once said, only the impotent are pure. 
Mainstream parties don’t have that luxury. They need to look at the true costs, and benefits, of all policy proposals.

Climate Change, Climate Weirding, Climate Destruction, CLIMATE EMERGENCY!
And now, our new and improved….
From Breitbart
Climate change alarmists are pushing for a change in vocabulary to scare people into taking global warming more seriously, starting with terms like “global meltdown” and “climate collapse.”
Writing for AdAge this week, Aaron Hall argues that in order to get people to “take action” against climate change, “rebranding” is crucial, since people have gotten too used to the idea that climate is changing and need to be shocked into the notion that the world as we know it is ending.
Aaron steps up the rhetoric, up to eleven!
What he and his marketing team came up with was a series of much more frightening labels to stick on climate change in the hope of jolting people into meaningful engagement.
The terms “Global Meltdown” or “Global Melting,” for instance, deliver a more negative image than mere “Global Warming,” he contends. “The names signal that ice caps are melting, but also create a more visceral image in the mind — that real feeling of ‘melting’ when it’s too hot outside. A meltdown is a disastrous event that draws from the ultimate terror of a nuclear meltdown, an apt metaphor for global destruction.”
“Climate Collapse” and “Climate Chaos,” on the other hand, “instill a clear message or even a direct call to action,” Hall notes, adding that “there’s nothing neutral about collapse or chaos.”
To up the rhetoric even more, Hall proposes the weaponized term “Scorched Earth.”
Of course Mr Hall feels no shame.
Mr. Hall’s contention that it does not matter if what is said is true as long as it elicits the necessary response is reminiscent of similar assertions by leaders of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) movement.
Thomas Williams of Breitbart warns of the the opposite occurring.
While it is clearly true that “alarmist language works” in some cases, it is also true that people tend to resent being lied to and manipulated.
Like Aesop’s fable of the Boy Who Cried Wolf, climate alarmists may wake up one fine day to find that nobody believes them anymore.

"**High in the hills above Pitlochry in Perthshire a former soldier has embarked on a new mission to revive an ancient Scottish drink.**
Mead, which is made from fermented honey, was much loved by Celtic tribes and Viking warriors.
But, over the last few centuries it has largely disappeared with beer, wine and whisky knocking it off its pedestal.
However, Christopher Mullin has now restarted mead brewing in Scotland and is recreating recipes dating back thousands of years using archaeological evidence.
His army career as an intelligence officer took him to numerous military headquarters around the world, but after retiring from the armed forces he has now set up his own base, the Rookery, in a converted stable building amid the hills and forests of Glen Brerachan.
Christopher's interest in mead stems back to his time studying Gaelic at the University of Aberdeen when he learned about it through studying Beowulf and other early literary works from across the British Isles.
There was one other key reason for its appeal - honey.
Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Kitchen CafÃ© programme, he said: ""The process I use is not unlike making wine as I ferment the sugars in water but my sugar source is honey. That's absolutely sacrosanct. It must be honey.
""I don't add white sugar. I don't add anything else as a fermentable. ""
He added: ""Honey is almost like a magic potion. It's an amazing product to work with. It's malleable, it lasts forever, you can get different varieties of flavour, it's resistant to infection and it is anti-bacterial.
""One of the things I am really proud of is I don't use any chemicals in my production process. I don't use fining agents but more importantly I don't use sulphates or preservatives because honey itself is a preservative. It's just a wonderful thing to work with.""
Much of the honey used is sourced from an apiary just a few miles down the road from the Rookery. The location of the business also makes it an ideal location for foraging for other key ingredients.
""I add adjuncts which is a brewing term for things to give the mead additional flavour,"" said Christopher.
""Most of these come off the hill that we brew on. Most of my adjuncts are native species, such as mountain ash berries or hawthorn berries, because I am really interested in the history and archaeology of Britain.
""Most of what I do either was definitely done by our ancestors or probably done by them. The evidence I use goes back 4,500 thousand years and people have been around here for a good 10,000 years before that. I gather things our ancestors were out picking at similar times of year to me to make similar products.""
In the Rookery a new concoction with its origins in the Bronze Age is currently brewing. It is based on archaeological evidence of mead production gathered from the Machrie Moor standing stone site on the Isle of Arran.
Christopher said: ""It is a honey and grain and flour brew which is what most of those really old brews were. I have brought together two of my hobbies - making booze and archaeology.
""Sometimes it is an interpretation so I am getting close to what was maybe being made thousands of years ago. But this one, which should be getting released next year, is as close as possible. It is not an interpretation it is practically a reconstruction. ""
Mead was the drink of choice for the elite for the early people of the British Isles, but by the Middle Ages imported wine from the Mediterranean had become more common.
However, Christopher said the real decline in mead's popularity can be linked with changes in the way beer was produced, which vastly increased its shelf life.
He said: ""The big game changer for mead is the introduction of hops. Once hops comes in beer lasts longer. It now becomes a commercially viable product made by men rather than women at home.
""Beer becomes cheaper so you can now get drunk on a penny instead of a shilling. And economics takes over.
""So mead falls by the wayside and becomes a niche historical curiosity. And that takes us to the modern day where you have got in the UK probably about five or six of us making properly made meads and I am the only one in Scotland. I am the Scottish mead industry right now.""
And Christopher said it is something that is definitely worth bringing back.
He said: ""The flavours that are possible are just legion. From dry and herbal through wine like and sharp. Through fruity through complex through focused through sweet. It's just a great thing to be experiment with and play with.
""It's great in cooking too. Where you can use beer, wine, sherry you can use meads. The best bit though is you get to taste the past."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterFrom 2008 to 2016 a widespread cooling ranging from 0.6°C to more than 2.0°C has chilled effectively the entire oceanic region from E. Canada to N. Iceland to S. Europe. The cooling persists year-round and extends from the surface down to depths of 800 m.

A year ago scientists revealed a large swath of the North Atlantic surface had cooled at a rate of -0.78°C per decade between 2004 and 2017 (Fröb et al., 2019).

Image Source: Fröb et al., 2019
The cooling has recently sprawled into the Arctic regions, as the upper ocean waters in Disko Bay (West Greenland) have just been hit with a ~2°C cooling since 2014 (Khazendar et al., 2019).

A new study (Bryden et al., 2020) suggests the magnitude, rapidity, and extent of this cooling may have been underestimated.

A cooling of “more than 2°C” in just 8 years (2008-2016) has been reported for nearly the entire ocean region south of Iceland.
The cooling persists year-round and extends from the “surface down to 800 m depth”.
From 40°N to 70°N, and from 40°W to 0°W, average temperatures have plunged 0.6°C from 2008 to 2016 – also to depths of 800 m.
To put these thermal changes into perspective, consider it took the global oceans 55 years (1955-2010) to warm 0.18°C (0.27 W/m²) in the 700 m layer (Levitus et al., 2012).
It is unknown to what extent the cooling will permeate other regions of the ocean. Nor is it known how long the cooling will persist. Or worsen.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
“Climate sensitivity” is the amount that the average global surface temperature will rise, given a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere from its pre‐​industrial value. This metric is the key to understanding how much global warming will occur as we continue to burn fossil fuels for energy and emit the resultant CO2 into the atmosphere.   
  
  
The problem is that we don’t know what the value of the climate sensitivity really is.   
  
  
In _its Fourth Assessment Report_ , released in 2007, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had this to say about the climate sensitivity:   




It is _likely_ to be in the range 2°C to 4.5°C with a best estimate of about 3.0°C, and is _very unlikely_ to be less than 1.5°C. Values substantially higher than 4.5°C cannot be excluded…



In IPCC parlance, the term “likely” means a probability of greater than 66% and “very likely” means a greater than 90% change of occurrence. The IPCC’s 90% range for the climate sensitivity includes values at the low end which, if proven true, would engender very little concern over our use of fossil fuels as a primary energy source, and values at the high end would generate calls for frantic efforts (which would likely fail) to lower carbon dioxide emissions.   
  
  
While there has been a lot of effort expended to better constrain estimates of sensitivity over the past several decades, little progress has been made in narrowing the range. The IPCC’s _First Assessment Report_ , released back in 1990, gave a range of 1.5°C to 4.5°C. It’s not that climate science hasn’t progressed since then, but just that the advanced understanding has not led to substantially better constraints.   
  
  
But what _has_ occurred over the past several decades is that greenhouse emissions have continued to rise (in fact, half of the total anthropogenerated carbon dioxide emissions have been since the mid‐​1980s), and global temperature observations have continued to be collected. We now have much more data with which to use to try to determine the sensitivity.   
  
  
While global carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise year‐​over‐​year (primarily driven by the rapid growth in developing countries such as China), global temperatures have not kept up—in fact, there has been little to no overall global temperature increase (depending upon the record used) over the past decade and a half.   
  
  
That doesn’t bode well for the IPCC’s high‐​end temperature sensitivity estimates. The scientific literature is now starting to reflect that reality.   
  
  
Never mind that Pat Michaels and I published a paper in 2002 showing that the sensitivity lies near the low side of the IPCC’s range. This idea (and those in similar papers subsequently published by others) had largely been ignored by the “mainstream” scientists self‐​selected to produce the IPCC Assessments. But new results supporting lower and tighter estimates of the climate sensitivity are now appearing with regularity, a testament to just how strong the evidence has become, for such results had to overcome the guardians of the IPCC’s so called “consensus of scientists”, which the Climategate emails showed to be less than gentlemanly.   
  
  
Figure 1 shows the estimates of the climate sensitivity from five research papers that have appeared in the past two years, including the recent contributions from Ring et al. (2012) and van Hateren (2012)—both of which put the central estimate of the climate sensitivity at 2°C or lower, values which are at or beneath the IPCC’s current “likely” range.   






Figure 1. Climate sensitivity estimates from new research published in the past two years (colored), compared with the range given in the IPCC _Fourth Assessment Report_ (black). The arrows indicate the 5 to 95% confidence bounds for each estimate along with the mean (vertical line) where available. Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The right‐​hand side of the IPCC range is dotted to indicate that the IPCC does not actually state the value for the upper 95% confidence bound of their estimate. The thick gray line represents the IPCC’s “likely” range.   
  
  
The IPCC is scheduled to release its _Fifth Assessment Report_ in 2013. We’ll see whether these new, lower, and more constrained estimates of climate sensitivity that are increasing populating the literature result in a modification of the IPCC estimates, or whether the IPCC authors manage to wave them all away (or simply ignore them, as was the case with our 2002 paper).   
  
  
Regardless of how the IPCC ultimately assesses climate science in 2013, the fact of the matter is that there is growing evidence that anthropogenic climate change from the burning of fossil fuels is not going to turn out to be as much as climate alarmists have made it out to be.

"**My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here, Joy Sterling from South Gloucestershire records her spending over a week and shares tips for saving.**
**Following an accident in 2016, Joy was forced to change her lifestyle and spending habits. Over to Joy....**
I live in South Gloucestershire with my 16-year-old daughter, Sophie and our 11-year-old, mad-as-a-box-of-frogs black labrador, Bailey.
In 2016 I had an accident. Fractured skull (bleed on the brain), cheekbone, eye socket and wrist. Three ops on my right wrist have left me with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. The brain damage has left me with short term memory issues, cognitive issues, attention deficit disorder, and I don't process or retain new information.
I already had fibromyalgia, slipped neck discs, and HMS (hypermobility syndrome) diagnoses, but the accident (and subsequent brain damage) was the one to send me fully into disability land.
I lost both my job and home after the accident, as the home came with the job and I was made redundant.
The last few years financially have been, well, not great! I had two new dresses for Christmas and I swear it was my best Christmas ever!
One benefit of not having money is that I really do appreciate every single little thing.
I receive disability allowance (Â£125 a week), child tax credit (Â£62 a week) and housing benefit (Â£151 a week). My rent is Â£910 per month, plus bills.
For the last three months the Discretionary Housing Fund paid 6 weeks at 100% of my rent shortfall and then 6 weeks at 50% but said they won't pay it any longer than that. It's just finished.
This was the only property I could find that would allow housing benefit recipients, pets and Sophie could walk to school. I don't get Personal Independence Payments, I pay tax and insurance for a 14-year-old car. Dreading the MOT next month.
We're both vegetarian.
I'm not that great at keeping tabs on spending as I forget things from second to second. Hopefully this diary will get me on track rather than always being too scared to check the bank balance.
Breakfast: I don't do breakfast.
Sophie doesn't go to college on Mondays so every few weeks I do a 'big' shop at Aldi if I remember. I can push a trolley around but struggle with the lifting, so she does all that.
A five minute walk away from home is Sainsbury's and Lidl. Always have to pop into Sainsbury's for forgotten (or unavailable at Aldi) items. I would go in Lidl but don't always have the patience to wait three days to be served. Standing still hurts and I start to get panicky having people close to me. Thanks, brain injury!
Bread flour is currently on offer for 50p at Aldi. I can get two large loaves and six pizza bases from one bag. I used to make bread daily pre-accident but they're fewer and far between these days.
Aldi **Â£30.60**
Sainsbury's **Â£12.30**
Lunch: Umm, forgot. Do this often, never feel hungry, but did have a pain aux raisins at some point.
Back to Sainsbury's to collect yet more things I'd forgotten (another **Â£6.45** ).
Dinner: One of my favourite easy meals: Veggie pasta. I use frozen Mediterranean vegetables, put them in a dish with a drizzle of olive oil, in the oven for 15/20 mins. While that's cooking, I boil pasta.
The pasta gets added to the roasted vegetables with a tin of tomatoes, grated mozzarella and a bit of cheddar on top, back in the oven for 15 minutes or until cheese has melted. Added pea shoots, sometimes add baby spinach.
We get four meals out of it and costs approx **55p** per serving
I give Sophie **Â£10** for bus fare.
And nipped into Poundland to buy bird seed. A blackbird keeps hopping into the garden and I feel bad there's nothing for him to eat. Can't afford a proper bird feed holder but I found a flat colander in there which can perch on garden box under tree, together with some dried worms. Total cost **Â£3.**
**Total spend: Â£62.90**
8:30 Sophie bought me a filter coffee machine for Christmas. Think it was about Â£23. No frills, but you can set the timer so we always wake up to fresh coffee.
It really is the little things! Favourite is an Italian blend from Aldi and was on offer this week for Â£1. I could cry if I start to think about how much money I wasted on takeaway coffees pre-accident.
9:45 It's annual haircut time. Wish I was joking!
Money's too tight to mention. Before my accident it was a regular thing, every six to eight weeks to get roots touched up. And sometimes just a blow-dry before an evening out (now it's ""What's an evening out?!""). On the plus side it's really grown and I prefer being brunette. Every cloud! ( **Â£26** )
11:00 Hannah arrives. We've been friends for 30 years. Our twenties were a riot. Then we had children, and behaved ourselves. We do a 10 minute dog walk, a quick cup of tea and she's off.
Lunch: Peanut butter on seeded bread toast. Usually slice banana on top, but not yet ripe.
12:30pm I make a Victoria sandwich for Pen using a hand mixer and the bowl on my lap. Mess everywhere. And I forgot to whip the cream so it dripped all down the cake!
Pen is an old clubbing friend and we came across each other on Twitter a while back. As luck would have it, he's a computer whizz and has been giving me website design lessons for cake. He'd do it for free but I like to pay him in cake. It's my currency post-accident.
The plan is to hopefully try and generate some money from adverts on my blog although it's a slow process trying to type.
So far the blogs are about my accident and everything post-accident with a few one-handed recipes as well. If you'd like to have a nosey you can find them at ahwellnevermind.com. I made **Â£4.86** from ads last week. Watch out Richard Branson, I'm coming!
3:00pm That's me done. Chronic brain fatigue and pain time. Grab an apple and rest.
**Total spend: Â£30.86**
I'm tired. Woke at 4:00.
I haven't washed the previous day's dishes (and Sophie wasn't here) so I moan (to myself!) all the way through it.
Have about five seconds use of my right hand before pain is excruciating. Dishwashing takes forever, also get pain in left hand (due to the slipped neck discs) which involuntarily releases.
Oh! to have a dishwasher.
I put a washing load on and hang it on the airer. My dirty laundry basket is halfway to the ceiling but I don't have a tumble dryer.
Heart-stopping moment when the washing machine won't start. The instant panic of ""I'll have to wash everything by hand forever!"" because no idea how I'd pay for a new one.
11:15 I fill the car with **Â£20** petrol (dead on - skills!) that will last (hopefully two weeks) and off to visit my cousin, Carmen. Her dog is pleased to see me and the feeling is mutual.
The plan was to pop round for an hour but her sofa is comfy and I stayed for three and a half. The pair of us could chat the hind legs off a donkey but it takes its toll (I get tired from talking - I know! How's my luck?!).
As soon as I'm home it's back on bed for an hour's rest. Headache kicks in.
Dinner is bean casserole that I've taken out of the freezer. No energy to cook.
Every night at 7:55pm my phone goes off to remind me to take meds. And every single night I hear it and think ""Oh! Who's texting me?"" Every. Single. Night.
**Total spend: Â£20**
More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series:
I'm out of bed at 8:00, feeling like death, banging headache but Thursday mornings are my favourite time of the week.
My friend Imogene goes to the MS centre for a dive in the oxygen tank on Thursday mornings.
Her son Lowan (aged 10) has disabled riding lessons and his school is in the opposite direction. I get to the stables, manage to have a good 20 minute chat with Imogene and then take him to school.
She did have someone who she paid to do it but they left. Imogene lent me money when I was in a complete fix a couple of years back (DWP stopped payments and rent was due) so I'm paying her back.
I love it! I'd do it for free anyway.
Those 15/20 minutes I'm driving Lowan to school are so much fun. He's got the most infectious laugh. When the sun is shining it's a beautiful drive along the Portway, under Clifton Suspension Bridge.
Lunch is defrosted homemade vegetable soup that I make usually every Monday with any veg 'on the turn' and add a bit of onion and garlic. Try hard not to waste anything.
I nip to Boots to buy some long-lasting ibuprofen. Supposed to last for 12 hours. Waking every night in pain is no fun. Let's see if this will work. Cost **Â£3.55**
Return home and lie on bed. Can't snooze because I get a text from Sophie. Can I get her from college? One day a week they go to a different campus and it takes her 2 and a half hours to get home on 2 buses, that takes me 20 minutes each way.
Dinner: Too pained and drained to cook. Send Sophie to our new local chip shop. We have battered halloumi and chips between us. Both have small appetites, couldn't imagine ever buying a portion of chips each. They're perfection - crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle.
I add baked beans and have yoghurt for dessert. **Â£5.20**
**Total spend: Â£8.75**
I wake at 03:18 and 06:38. Manage to eventually fall back to sleep both times. Bright full moon. Was I a wolf in a previous life?!
I remembered my friend Emma who is coming for lunch might not be able to eat certain foods. Went to Sainsbury's for paninis, roasted veg couscous, hummus, cucumber and tiny pitta breads on offer ( **Â£4.55** ).
Lunch: Toasted cheese and mushroom paninis
Mid-afternoon I popped over to Boots and Poundland to buy moisturiser ( **Â£2.14** half price) and fudge ( **Â£1** ) as a little valentine's gift for Sophie.
We eat couscous, hummus, salad, pittas and more halloumi (fried for a minute each side). Usually this is a summer dish but it's easy to pull together, lasts for multiple meals and sometimes needs must.
**Total spend: Â£7.69**
I wake at 4:14. A whole week of this and it's getting on my nerves now.
As Sophie's boss is on holiday it's a 7:30 wake up to drive her to work. She only earns Â£4.20 an hour for four hours. If I had the money I'd give it to her rather than drive.
Lunch: toasted hot cross buns, one day out of date. I'd put them in the cake tin but forgot about them.
3:20pm Wrist is swollen and throbbing but there's washing to be done, a dog to be walked in Storm Dennis (because he won't poo in his own garden, he's so special) and dishes to wash.
5:00pm Made some pizza dough and left it to prove.
8:00pm pizza is in the oven. Tomato passata, grated mozzarella and cheddar with (defrosted chopped) basil.
**Total spend: Â£0.00**
Ah the day of rest. Storm Dennis was raging so we stayed in PJs for most of the day. Sophie chopped and prepared the veg for our meat-free roast.
I make either cauliflower and broccoli cheese or cheesy leeks as a meat replacement, with homemade Yorkshire puddings and stuffing.
The sun came out at 4:00pm, then we were straight to the rabbit field with Bailey. Spent a lot of time last year watching rabbits hopping around. Free entertainment!
5:00pm: I discovered how to make custard last week and it's my new addiction. Was looking for something to make with leftover egg yolks after I'd used the whites in meringues. Oh my. What a taste sensation.
So even though I don't want meringues I made some purely so I could make more custard.
Apple and blackberry turnovers using shop-bought puff pastry **Â£1.45** , dessert apple from fruit bowl that was going soft, and defrosted blackberries that I picked at the woods last year. I picked a LOT of berries last year. FREE FOOD!
**Total spend: Â£1.45**
**Weekly total spend: Â£131.65**
I have got to stop running to Sainsbury's for odd things! All those little bits add up don't they? And I don't realise. But that is two weeks' worth of food I've bought, only need to top up with milk this week and the Â£26 haircut was a one-off so it's not too bad.
Poor in money but rich in friends.
Busy week. Sometimes I can go a fortnight without seeing anyone.
We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. We're particularly keen to hear from disabled people about the extra cash your disability costs you. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (World) Facebook group, or if you live in the UK, please join our My Money (UK) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you."

 _The_ Current Wisdom _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science, reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press._   
  
Our periodic compilations of low equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) estimates have become a big hit.   
  
In our on-going effort to keep up with the science, today we update our previous summary with two additional recently published lower-than-IPCC climate sensitivity estimates—one made by Troy Masters and another by Alexander Otto and colleagues (including several co-authors not typically associated with global warming in moderation, or “lukewarming”). There is also a third paper currently in the peer-review process.   
  
The new additions yield a total of at least 16 experiments published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature beginning in 2011 that have found that the most likely value of the ECS to be well below the (previously?) “mainstream” estimate from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Since the negative impacts from global warming/climate change scale with the magnitude of the temperature rise, lower projections of future warming should lead to lower projections of future damages. We say “should” because one way around this, as the federal government has figured out, is to ignore all the new science indicating less expected future warming when calculating future damages, and inexplicably doubling the damages estimated to be caused by a given increment of carbon dioxide (a.k.a., social cost of carbon).   
  
Here is a quick summary of the two new papers:   
  
Examining the output of climate models run under increases in human emissions of greenhouse gas and aerosols, Troy Masters noted a robust relationship between the modeled rate of heat uptake in the global oceans and the modeled climate sensitivity. With this relationship in hand, he then turned to the observations to determine what the observed rate of oceanic heat uptake has been during the past 50 years or so. From the observed behavior, he was able to determine the climate sensitivity, and found it to be substantially less than that in the vast majority of the climate models. He found that the most likely value of the ECS from the observations was 1.98°C with a 90 percent range extending from 1.2°C to 5.15°C. He notes that the high end is driven by uncertainties in the oceanic heat uptake data earlier in the record.   
  
Otto and colleagues used a simple energy budget model to relate observed global temperature changes to changes in the radiation climatology and the heat uptake in the earth system as humans have heaped various substances into the atmosphere. They conclude that the at best estimate for ECS is 2.0°C with a 90 percent range from 1.2°C to 3.9°C.   
  
Both studies come with a long list of caveats relating to data quality, etc., that are common to all studies trying to estimate the ECS.   




[Note: As mentioned, the third paper, which uses a similar methodology, is currently making its way through the peer-review process. The paper, authored by Ragnhild Skeie and colleagues finds the equilibrium climate sensitivity to be 1.8°C with a 90 percent range extending from 0.9°C to 3.2°C. If and when this paper is accepted, we’ll be sure to add the results to our chart. The paper is going through an open peer-review process, so you can follow its progress here.]   
  
We’ve included these new results into our chart below (near the top just beneath the IPCC estimates; Otto et al. in red, Masters in dark purple).   








_Climate sensitivity estimates from new research beginning in 2011 (colored, compared with the range given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (gray) and the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5; black), which has yet to be published. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95 percent confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The right-hand side of the IPCC AR4 range is dotted to indicate that the IPCC does not actually state the value for the upper 95 percent confidence bound of their estimate and the left-hand arrow only extends to the 10 percent lower bound as the 5 percent lower bound is not given. The light grey vertical bar is the mean of the 16 estimates from the new findings. The mean climate sensitivity (3.4°C) of the climate models used in the IPCC AR5 is 13 percent greater than the IPCC’s “best estimate” of 3.0°C and 70 percent greater than the mean of recent estimates (2.0°C)._   
  
The average value of the best estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity across all the new studies is about 2.0°C. The average climate sensitivity of the climate models used by the IPCC to project future climate changes (and their impacts) is about 3.4°C— _some 70 percent higher than the recent studies indicate._   
  
As we have discussed, these new studies (which grow in number every couple of months) spell serious trouble for the IPCC and everyone else who shirks the responsibility of their own independent analysis and defers to the IPCC climate change projections instead (that finger would be pointing at _you_ , EPA).   
  
How long national and international organizations created to promote (i.e., the IPCC) or actually develop regulations (i.e., the EPA) can ignore the groundswell of new science, and instead continue with their charade that climate change is proceeding according to plan will surely be tested in the months to come. If this test does not come in the court of public opinion, in part from the growing community of scientists who recognize the disconnect between IPCC and the science, then it will almost certainly come from a court of law, where the challenges to the EPA’s callous indifference to new science and the regulations which have been and are being built upon it will certainly take place.

"The problem with wind power is that electric utilities have to be prepared at any time for their power production to just stop on short notice. So they must keep fossil fuel plants on hot standby, meaning they are basically burning fuel but not producing any power.tutuapp android Storage technologies and the use of relatively fast-start plants like gas turbines mitigates this problem a bit but does not come close to eliminating it. This is why wind power simply as a source contributing to the grid makes very little sense.

One of these activists in Germany is Carola Rackete, reports Michael Krüger here at Science Skeptical.
Rackete, the award-winning refugee rescuer and sea vessel captain, has found a new field of activity: now she is active for Fridays for Future and XR (the radical climate fighters who block streets and stick to things with superglue, or climb drones at airports) and block streets in Berlin and make speeches there.
Not long ago Ms. Rackete made some astonishing climate claims before an audience in Berlin, as the following video (in German) shows:

But let’s do a fact check.
On the claim Lake Chad and the Sahel are drying
Lake Chad on the southern edge of the Sahara is not drying out as a result of global warming, but is once again growing and greening. Here are satellite pictures and water level data:



Desert regions have also become greener, such as the Sahel on the border with the Sahara, the Fertile Crescent, which stretches across Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, and the former region of Carthage in North Africa, which used to be the granary of Rome.
These areas were already green and fertile in the climate optimum of the Holocene directly after the last ice age. From there, agriculture spread to Europe and Northern Europe in the course of the Neolithic revolution.
 
During the last ice age, the Sahara was a desert. In the period of 9,000-6,000 years before today, we had the warmest time of the Holocene, the sea ice of the Arctic had almost disappeared in summer and large parts of the Sahara were fertile grasslands.
There were large groups of crocodiles and there were even crocodiles where there is desert today. Even today rock paintings of the natives in the today’s desert testify to it.

The rock paintings of the Sahara have been created in North Africa for 12,000 years, at the end of the last ice age. For millions of years, the Sahara was a desert subject to extreme climatic fluctuations and at times turned green again during the warm periods.
3,500 years ago, the desert began to dry out, a process that continues intermittently to this day.
For a good four decades, however, the Sahel has since been greening.
  
This is shown by various studies which show the greening of the Sahel zone with the help of satellite data since 1982.
In 2018, Venter et al. recorded an eight percent increase in wood vegetation in sub-Saharan Africa over the last three decades using satellite images.
According to Wikipedia, the Sahara covers an area of around 9.2 million square kilometres. Eight percent of this corresponds to more than 700,000 square kilometres, an area that is almost as large as Germany and France put together!

2018, Venter et al.
On the ice-free Arctic
Arctic sea ice reaches its smallest annual extent and area at the end of summer. At the end of summer 2007 and 2012 particularly low values were reached, which caused the climate alarmist press to discuss the topic in the throughout the media.
In 2007 some media and experts even speculated over an ice-free Arctic Ocean by summer 2013. But at the moment the picture is completely different.

An ice-free Arctic in summer is therefore still far off. Carola  Rackete fancies a world as it pleases her. Yet, the “activists” like claiming they listen to science!

"**It could have been any gourmet food fair, with lots of delicious things to eat.**
The main hall at the Meadowlands Exposition Center, in New Jersey, was bustling with more than 6,000 attendees taking a look at 360 food and drink exhibitors from around the world.
The hundreds of products on show included everything from pizza bases made from cauliflower, to salsas, ice cream sandwiches, cider, beef empanadas (a Mexican pastry), Italian sorbets, gins, charcuterie, tequila, and even a range of biscuits infused with cannabis oil.
But this was no ordinary food and drink exhibition. For while there was a vast range on display, everything had one major thing in common - they were all certified kosher. Everything present conformed to kashrut, the Jewish dietary laws.
The event at the end of last year was the 31st annual ""Kosherfest"", a two-day gathering that touts itself as ""the world's largest and most attended kosher-certified products trade show"".
While Jewish-owned companies were proudly in attendance, many of the firms who were present are not owned or run by Jews, but had still chosen to go kosher. These included businesses from Pakistan, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Italy.
With the number of people attending up 800 from the year before, and 300 new products on display, Menachem Lubinsky, chief executive of event organiser Lubicom, said that demand for kosher food was growing strongly among non-Jewish shoppers.
""Kosher food appeals to a more health-conscious consumer,"" he says. ""It's like a new generation of kosher. It's different from those who have been there for many years, the basic kosher staples.""
The centre of the world's kosher food sector is the US. For while only 2% of Americans are Jewish, some 7.5 million people, a study by the Quartz business news website found that 41% of all packaged food in the US is certified kosher.
Explanations for this include a perception that kosher food is cleaner or healthier, or people's desire for assurance than a product does not include potential allergens such as shellfish. It also offers certainty for vegans, such as in the example of Oreo cookies, which prior to their switch to kosher in the late 1990s contained lard (pork fat).
More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:
Led by growing demand in the US, the global kosher food market is predicted to increase to almost $60bn (Â£40bn) of annual sales in 2025, up from $24bn in 2017. Given those vast figures, it is not surprising that a growing number of food businesses around the globe are seeking kosher accreditation.
""I think firms are coming from the basis that you can't produce an ingredient anywhere in the world, and hope to sell it in the US, without being kosher,"" says Mr Lubinsky. ""There's a significant market, and firms want a piece of it.""
But what exactly is kosher food? While most people understand that pork and shellfish are non-kosher, kosher animals such as cows and lambs need to be ritually slaughtered with a sharp knife. Meanwhile, food products cannot contain both meat and dairy. And not all parts of the cow can be consumed.
All kosher rulings have to be carried out by trained rabbis from a kosher certification agency. Richard Rabkin, managing director of COR, the largest such organisation in Canada, explains that the process is taken very seriously.
""Some people have this mistaken impression that we go there and bless the food, and that's all it takes,"" he says. ""No, it is more complicated than that.
""We have an initial conversation with a company and get an impression of what they're doing in the food, and take a look at all the ingredients, and find out whether it's kosher or not. Once we have a picture of that, then we inspect the facility itself... We are guarding against cross contamination.
""Once we ensure all of that, there's an inspection to make sure everything is followed according to kosher standards, and then certification's granted. [But], inspection isn't just time to time, it's an ongoing basis.""
Back at Kosherfest in New Jersey, Dakshin Thilina was representing Sri Lankan food group Nexpo Conversion, and its kosher dried coconut milk powder and coconut oil. He explains that unlike some of his company's rivals it doesn't use any sodium caseinate, a milk-derived food stabiliser.
""Without that component our products are lactose-free,"" he says. ""And because they are non-dairy, kosher Jews can use them any time, alongside meat.""
Another Asian firm in attendance was Dewan Sugar Mills from Pakistan, which makes ethanol for mouthwashes. ""We wanted to tell people that there's nothing not kosher that ever comes into contact with what we make,"" says general manager Adnan Pirzada.
And there from Dubai was South African expat Elli Kriel who runs a kosher catering company - Elli's Kosher Kitchen. ""I was producing kosher food for our family, and people started reaching out to me,"" she says. ""Travellers in particular, moving through the city, needed kosher food.
""I used to invite them to eat in our house, but I realised, when more and more people began reaching out, that I was in a good position to offer kosher catering.""
Mr Lubinsky says he is pleased to see kosher food branch out from the Jewish classics and ""go upscale"". ""It's not your chopped liver and stuffed cabbage any more,"" he adds."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA growing proportion of Sweden’s energy is derived from burning biomass (wood), which increases CO2 emissions 65% and 285% more than coal and natural gas energy generation, respectively. And yet because governmental policy – not science – has (wrongly) declared biomass burning “renewable” and “carbon neutral”, Greta Thunberg’s Sweden is falsely credited with reducing its carbon footprint.

Sweden’s CO2 mitigation advocate Greta Thunberg. Image Source: Greta’s Twitter site
In an effort to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel energy, Sweden has rapidly expanded biomass (wood) burning in recent decades (Ericsson and Werner, 2016).

Image Source: Ericsson and Werner, 2016
Biomass burning is heavily subsidized by governments in the developed world, as it is characterized as “renewable” and “carbon neutral”.
Yet scientists continue to vociferously point out that biomass burning is actually worse than coal with regard to CO2 mitigation.
The net effect of switching from coal to biomass burning is to significantly increase CO2 emissions (Norton et al., 2019, Sterman et al., 2018).

Specifically, biomass burning results in 65% more CO2 emissions than coal and 285% more CO2 emissions than natural gas (Fanous and Moomaw, 2018).
Ironically, fossil fuels actually serve to reduce CO2 emissions far more than “renewable” biomass energy generation does.

Perhaps Greta Thunberg and other climate activists should listen to the scientists and focus on reducing CO2 emissions at home in Sweden before traveling abroad to stump for CO2 mitigation policies in other countries.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Physicist and climate skeptic Freeman Dyson has sadly passed away following a fall earlier this week.
RIP Freeman Dyson: The super-boffin who applied his mathematical brain to nuclear magic, quantum physics, space travel, and moreScience’s civil rebel dies aged 96 By Katyanna Quach 28 Feb 2020 at 22:53Video Freeman Dyson, the eminent British-American physicist and mathematician best known for his theoretical work in quantum electrodynamics, died today. He was 96.His death was announced by his daughter Mia Dyson via Maine public television and the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS) – the top research hub in Princeton, New Jersey, once home to Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and other giants of science and technology.Mia said her father accidentally fell on Wednesday during one of his regular visits to his office at the IAS, where he had worked from 1953 until 1994. He died from his injuries at a hospital on Friday morning.“No life is more entangled with the onstitute and impossible to capture — architect of modern particle physics, free-range mathematician, advocate of space travel, astrobiology and disarmament, futurist, eternal graduate student, rebel to many preconceived ideas including his own, thoughtful essayist, all the time a wise observer of the human scene,” said Robbert Dijkgraaf, the Director and Leon Levy Professor at the IAS. “His secret was simply saying ‘yes’ to everything in life, till the very end.”…Read more: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/28/freeman_dyson/
Dyson was a giant of 20th century physics. The most memorable thing about Dyson from my point of view was his fearlessness; he was always someone who chose his own path, a rebel to the very end. 
Dyson’s views on climate change and politics were complex. Dyson was a climate skeptic but he also strongly supported President Obama. He thought President Obama’s support for climate action was an unfortunate mistake in an otherwise excellent policy programme.
Climate activists were frequently triggered by Dyson’s outspoken views; because of his scientific reputation, because of his bipartisan fan base, because he was always ready to speak his mind, Dyson was an ongoing thorn in their sides, a significant impediment to their efforts to convince the world to embrace climate action.
I loved reading Dyson’s visionary articles and work, his son George Dyson’s book about Project Orion shows how close Dyson and his fellow scientists came to opening our way to the stars. They developed a known technology space drive with capabilities straight out of science fiction, so powerful yet affordable it could conceivably have propelled a manned mission to Alpha Centauri, or boosted space colonisation efforts by transporting entire cities to other planets or the Asteroid belt. 
Project Orion was killed off by President Kennedy, when he signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
For his fearlessness, his vision, and many other reasons, Freeman Dyson’s legacy will endure; he will be remembered as one of the giants of the 20th Century.

"**Stockpiling groceries over coronavirus fears will hit the ""most vulnerable"" hardest, a food bank boss has warned.**
Sarah Broughton, project manager at Bedford Foodbank, said the charity was well-stocked but warned supplies would dwindle if donations dried up.
""If people stop giving in the next six weeks, we will have run out of food,"" she said.
Stockpiling for ""an emergency that may happen"" was unfair to people already in crisis, she added.
""The items people stockpile are the items we hand out, and the most vulnerable people we help are not able to stockpile... people who are experiencing crisis need the food now.""
Items such as pasta, toilet roll and soups were most in demand among people ""not able to stockpile"", she said.
The charity's warehouse currently has 22 tonnes of food, but if no more toilet rolls are donated, it expects to run out in a week's time.
The food bank received 13 tonnes of donations in January, thanks largely to the ""fantastic success"" of its reverse advent calendar initiative, devised to counter the traditional post-Christmas dip.
But it handed out eight tonnes of food in February.
""Now we are just ticking over. We haven't got a huge amount - this is the slacker time of year."" said Ms Broughton.
""We need donations continuously.""
Carly Smith, from Bedford, who has used food banks in the past said: ""They were a godsend and a lifeline when you feel like you are failing as a parent and you are feeling sick due to not eating.
""Items such as pasta - which is a cheap food item - is what I relied on when I needed it.
""By stockpiling people are taking this away from struggling people and families.""

How the sun impacts European climate
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P Gosselin)

Images: NASA Observatory
The gigantic nuclear fusion power plant of the sun reliably supplies the earth with energy.
However, the IPCC’s current doctrine is that fluctuations in solar activity have no effect whatsoever on the Earth’s climate. Some climate scientists disagree with the IPCC and see a significant influence of the sun on the earth’s climate.
On July 1, 2019, a study by Bhargawa & Sing appeared in Advances in Space Research:
Solar irradiance, climatic indicators and climate change – An empirical analysis
Since the Sun is the main source of energy for our planet therefore even a slight change in its output energy can make a huge difference in the climatic conditions of the terrestrial environment. The rate of energy coming from the Sun (solar irradiance) might affect our climate directly by changing the rate of solar heating of the Earth and the atmosphere and indirectly by changing the cloud forming processes. In the present paper, based on stability test of Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) model, we have used the impulse response functions and the variance decomposition method for the analysis of climate variability. We have examined the possible connections among the solar irradiance and some climate indicators, viz., the global temperature anomaly, the global mean sea level, the global sea-ice extent and the global precipitation anomaly occurred during last forty years (1978–2017). In our investigation, we have observed that the impact of solar irradiance on the global surface temperature level in next decade will increase by ∼4.7% while the global mean sea level will increase about 0.67%. In the meantime, we have noticed about 5.3% decrement in the global sea-ice extent for the next decade. In case of the global precipitation anomaly we have not observed any particular trend just because of the variable climatic conditions. We also have studied the effect of CO2 as anthropogenic forcing where we have observed that the global temperature in the next decade will increase by 2.7%; mean sea level will increase by 6.4%. Increasing abundance in CO2 will be responsible for about 0.43% decrease in the sea-ice extent while there will not be any change in the precipitation pattern.”
In May 2018, Chassiot et al. had already reported a characteristic millennium cycle from the Central Massif of France, apparently driven by solar fluctuations and ocean cycles:

A 7000-year environmental history and soil erosion record inferred from the deep sediments of Lake Pavin (Massif Central, France)
A 14-m long sedimentary sequence (core PAV12) was collected in the deepest part of Lake Pavin, a maar lake located in the French Massif Central. The PAV12 sedimentary sequence documents the lake’s environmental evolution since its formation 7000 years ago. The relationships between the catchment’s vegetation cover, erosion processes and changes in trophic status were shown using a multi-proxy characterization of mineral and organic fractions supported by palynological data. The record shows a succession of lithological units starting at the base with volcanoclastic material corresponding to the early stage of Lake Pavin. The deposition of organic-rich and diatomaceous sedimentary units above volcanoclastic material indicates an evolution toward a pristine lacustrine state. The Late Holocene environmental history of this lake is marked by two tipping points reflecting major environmental disturbances at ca. 4000 cal BP and after the deposition of erosive mass-wasting deposits (MWDs) at 1350 cal BP (AD 600) and 650 cal BP (AD 1300). The upper unit of core PAV12, which corresponds to the past 700 years, indicates that one of these MWDs was likely the driving force behind a major limnological change marked by a shift in redox-sensitive elements (i.e., current meromictic lacustrine state). The palynological diagram indicates a forested catchment where woodland clearances and agro-pastoral activities have remained limited except over the last 700 years. These findings suggest restricted human impact within the watershed compared to other regional archives. The reconstruction of the Lake Pavin erosion record determined from titanium and red amorphous particle fluxes highlights phases of enhanced erosion at ca. 6.5–5.5, 4.1–3.8, 3.5, 2.8–2.6, 1.6–1.4 cal kyr BP and during the Little Ice Age (LIA). A comparison between this erosion record, palaeoenvironmental archives from Western Europe and palaeoclimatic data supports an Atlantic signal driving precipitation patterns over Lake Pavin at centennial to millennial timescales. The influence of local human activities, even on a small scale, cannot be completely discounted as their impact on erosional processes may be amplified in a steep catchment such as that found in Lake Pavin.
In their conclusion they write:
[…] Consequently, the Lake Pavin erosion record appears primarily related to hydroclimatic fluctuations. The matching of enhanced terrigenous inputs with NAO negative phases and low TSI values supports both Atlantic and solar forcing at a centennial to millennial scale over the Holocene.
The Romanian climate also seems to be influenced by solar radiation, as Sfica et al. documented in 2018:
Solar signal on regional scale: A study of possible solar impact upon Romania’s climate
The topic of this paper is to investigate whether a solar signal can be identified in the variation of climatic parameters at regional scale. This was done using eight climate parameters recorded in Romania during 1961–2013 which corresponds with four cycles of solar activity. The methodology is based on trend, composite and wavelet analysis. A weak solar influence with a clear spatial pattern was identified, especially during the cold season, on temperature and cloud cover.  During the warm season, the influence seems to be spurious. A clear difference between the north-eastern Romania and the rest of the country was found in the response of local climate to solar trigger. The mountain chain induces persistent disparities in the distribution of the most parameters, which supports the fact that orography is an important feature to be considered when analysing solar imprint at regional scale. Possible mechanisms for the solar influence on climate at regional and local scale are proposed.
This paper by Moreno et al., which deals with climate change in Portugal, dates from March 2019. In this case, the sun modulates spring and summer temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO):
Foraminiferal evidence of major environmental changes driven by the sun-climate coupling in the western Portuguese coast (14th century to present)
New paleoclimatic data from the Casa Branca salt marsh, in the southwest coast of Portugal, are compared with records previously published on the northwest coast (Caminha salt marsh) to offer a more comprehensive overview of the environmental evolution of the west Iberian margin over the last six centuries. These reconstructions are based on the foraminiferal records of two dated sediment cores retrieved from the high marsh settings and supported by geochemical-sedimentological data. Both marshes were originally formed in the AD 1300s, between the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA), highlighting a major episode of increased sediment supply in lower estuaries linked to climate-driven changes in continental runoff. Afterwards, the two marshes evolved under different climatic regimes as reflected by their foraminiferal assemblages. The environmental conditions are characterized by higher salinity in Casa Branca (southwest), with Jadammina macrescens and Trochammina inflata as dominant species, than in Caminha (northwest), where Haplophragmoides spp. dominates. We suggest that a long-term trend of a net gain in evapotranspiration at Casa Branca inducing a higher marsh salinity baseline may explain this microfaunal contrast. Trochammina inflata seems to be a good indicator of drier periods in the studied area, connected to key events of aeolian large-dust input to the southwest coast of Portugal. The influence of the most important climate drivers  was assessed, namely external (solar) and internal (North Atlantic Oscillation – NAO) forcings. Spectral and wavelet transform coherence analyses were used to detect solar footprints on foraminiferal and climate-related time series. A main significant quasi-periodicity was identified within the range of the secular Gleissberg cycle of solar activity modulating the annual NAO and regional spring-summer (simulated) temperatures after AD 1700. This stronger solar-climate coupling may be related to the known upward secular trend in the total solar irradiance after the Maunder Minimum.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA has conceded that climate models lack the precision required to make climate projections due to the inability to accurately model clouds. 
Clouds have the capacity to dramatically influence climate changes in both radiative longwave (the “greenhouse effect”) and shortwave.
Cloud cover domination in longwave radiation
In the longwave, clouds thoroughly dwarf the CO2 climate influence. According to Wong and Minnett (2018):
• The signal in incoming longwave is 200 W/m² for clouds over the course of hours. The signal amounts to 3.7 W/m² for doubled CO2 (560 ppm) after hundreds of years.
• At the ocean surface, clouds generate a radiative signal 8 times greater than tripled CO2 (1120 ppm).
• The absorbed surface radiation for clouds is ~9 W/m². It’s only 0.5 W/m² for tripled CO2 (1120 ppm).
• CO2 can only have an effect on the first 0.01 mm of the ocean. Cloud longwave forcing penetrates 9 times deeper, about 0.09 mm.

Image Source: Wong and Minnett, 2018
Cloud cover domination in shortwave radiation
In its shortwave albedo capacity, cloud cover modulates the amount of solar radiation that warms the ocean. Changes in the Earth’s radiation budget “are caused by changes in tropical mean cloudiness.” (Wielicki et al., 2002).
When cloud cover increases, less shortwave radiation reaches the surface, leading to cooling. When cloud cover decreases – as it has since the 1980s – more solar radiation is absorbed.
The decrease in cloud cover in recent decades can therefore explain the 1979-2017 warming (Herman et al., 2013, Poprovsky, 2019, Loeb et al., 2018).

The IPCC has admitted there is a great deal of “continuing uncertainty” in the sign and magnitude of the cloud influence. Most models indicate a positive feedback (more warming), but this “is not well understood” and the IPCC scientists “are not confident that it is realistic.”

Image Source: IPCC (2013)
NASA has been even more candid about the massive uncertainties associated with cloud climatology.
Some clouds “cool more than they heat” and other clouds “warm more than they cool.”
In some models “clouds decrease the net greenhouse effect, whereas in others they intensify it.”
Because the uncertainties are so pervasive, NASA concludes that “today’s models must be improved by about a hundredfold in accuracy” if we wish to make climate projections.

Image Source: NASA
Uncertainty in the effects of cloud forcing are 20-40 times larger than the projected greenhouse gas warming for the next century
Due to the enormous uncertainties associated with cloud cover changes, the IPCC’s CO2 emission scenarios used to calculate warming are reduced to the realm of nearly evidence-free presumption.
Using the IPCC’s emission scenarios, for example, the projected greenhouse gas-induced warming by 2100 is 3.7°C. Due to cloud forcing errors, the uncertainty in this projection is ±130°C!
“When both the cloud and the forcing uncertainties are allowed to accumulate together, after 5 years the A2 [greenhouse gas-induced] scenario includes a 0.34°C warmer Earth but a ±8.8°C uncertainty. At 10 years this becomes 0.44±15° C, and 0.6±27.7°C in 20 years. By 2100, the projection is 3.7±130°C.”

Image Source: Frank, 2008
Unless we can model clouds, we cannot model climate with any precision
Due to the dominant influence of cloud cover in facilitating climate change, dramatically improving our woefully insufficient capacity to model clouds is both necessary and fundamental.
Climate science should rise to the challenge rather than continuing to gloss over or even dismiss the profound cloud modeling problem undermining climate projections.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer Iceland Prime Minister fed up with climate tourism: Glaciers used to be smaller than today
By Die kalte Sonne
[German text translated by P. Gosselin]

Many glaciers are currently shrinking, as they have always done in the past when the climate warmed up. What’s the news on the glacier front?
In August 2019, the Okjokull Glacier disappeared in Iceland with great media attention. The BBC reported:
Climate change: Iceland holds funeral for melted glacier
The glacier called Okjokull, is the first in the country to be lost to climate change, after the warmest July ever on record. Iceland loses about 11 billion tonnes of ice per year, and scientists have warned that there are about 400 other glaciers also at risk. They fear all of the island’s glaciers will be gone by 2200. Glaciers cover about 11% of Iceland’s surface.”
Read more at the BBC.
However, the glacier had not formed until the Little Ice Age. See our article “The cycle is full: death of an Icelandic glacier that did not exist even during the Medieval Warm Period“. Iceland’s prime minister from 2013-2016, David Gunnlaugsson, dislikes activism. In The Spectator, Gunnlaugsson wrote on November 23, 2019:
Iceland’s melting glaciers are nothing to panic about
It is a spectacle we have witnessed since the country’s first settlers arrived in the ninth century […] My home country is a young country; it was first settled just over 1,000 years ago. As a result, it offers unique insight into the relationship between man and nature, albeit not in the way commonly presented in the media. Take Iceland’s melting glaciers. Troubling as a calving glacier might seem, such a phenomenon is by no means out of the ordinary. In fact, this process defines a glacier: they move. Glaciers shed ice at their edges as ice builds up closer to the centre. It is a spectacle we have witnessed in Iceland since the first settlers arrived in the ninth century. […] In 1901, it measured 38 sq km in size; in 1978, it was just three sq km. So the glacier that had its last rites read in August had, in fact, more or less disappeared half a century ago. That might still seem to be a sad fate for a glacier that had only reached the age of 700. But some of Iceland’s glaciers are now considerably larger than when the country was first settled over a millennia ago. Iceland’s glaciers reached their peak around 1890. When the glaciers were expanding, laying waste to what had previously been green meadows and farmlands, the people who lost their homes would hardly have been grief-stricken by the thought that one day that trend might be reversed.”

Next we move on to the Alps. There man-made soot has contributed to the melting of the glaciers. However, the Alpine glaciers began to melt even before the massive influx of soot, Sigl et al. found in 2018. Soot influx did not begin until around 1875, when 80% of the glacier melt of the 19th century had already been completed. Abstract:
19th century glacier retreat in the Alps preceded the emergence of industrial black carbon deposition on high-alpine glaciers
Light absorbing aerosols in the atmosphere and cryosphere play an important role in the climate system. Their presence in ambient air and snow changes the radiative properties of these systems, thus contributing to increased atmospheric warming and snowmelt. High spatio-temporal variability of aerosol concentrations and a shortage of long-term observations contribute to large uncertainties in properly assigning the climate effects of aerosols through time.
Starting around AD 1860, many glaciers in the European Alps began to retreat from their maximum mid-19th century terminus positions, thereby visualizing the end of the Little Ice Age in Europe. Radiative forcing by increasing deposition of industrial black carbon to snow has been suggested as the main driver of the abrupt glacier retreats in the Alps. The basis for this hypothesis was model simulations using elemental carbon concentrations at low temporal resolution from two ice cores in the Alps.
Here we present sub-annually resolved concentration records of refractory black carbon (rBC; using soot photometry) as well as distinctive tracers for mineral dust, biomass burning and industrial pollution from the Colle Gnifetti ice core in the Alps from AD 1741 to 2015. These records allow precise assessment of a potential relation between the timing of observed acceleration of glacier melt in the mid-19th century with an increase of rBC deposition on the glacier caused by the industrialization of Western Europe. Our study reveals that in AD 1875, the time when rBC ice-core concentrations started to significantly increase, the majority of Alpine glaciers had already experienced more than 80 % of their total 19th century length reduction, casting doubt on a leading role for soot in terminating of the Little Ice Age. Attribution of glacial retreat requires expansion of the spatial network and sampling density of high alpine ice cores to balance potential biasing effects arising from transport, deposition, and snow conservation in individual ice-core records.”

Also a glacier history of the Alps since the end of the last ice age was published in 2009 by Susan Ivy-Ochs and colleagues. Between 10,500-3300 years before today, glaciers were mostly smaller than today and ended 200 meters above modern levels. The Alpine glaciers expanded during the cold period of migration and the Little Ice Age.
Want to know more about glacier history? Here’s the abstract:
Latest Pleistocene and Holocene glacier variations in the European Alps
In the Alps, climatic conditions reflected in glacier and rock glacier activity in the earliest Holocene show a strong affinity to conditions in the latest Pleistocene (Younger Dryas). Glacier advances in the Alps related to Younger Dryas cooling led to the deposition of Egesen stadial moraines. Egesen stadial moraines can be divided into three or in some cases even more phases (sub-stadials). Moraines of the earliest and most extended advance, the Egesen maximum, stabilized at 12.2 ± 1.0 ka based on 10Be exposure dating at the Schönferwall (Tyrol, Austria) and the Julier Pass-outer moraine (Switzerland). Final stabilization of moraines at the end of the Egesen stadial was at 11.3 ± 0.9 ka as shown by 10Be data from four sites across the Alps. From west to east the sites are Piano del Praiet (northwestern Italy), Grosser Aletschgletscher (central Switzerland), Julier Pass-inner moraine (eastern Switzerland), and Val Viola (northeastern Italy). There is excellent agreement of the 10Be ages from the four sites. In the earliest Holocene, glaciers in the northernmost mountain ranges advanced at around 10.8 ± 1.1 ka as shown by 10Be data from the Kartell site (northern Tyrol, Austria). In more sheltered, drier regions rock glacier activity dominated as shown, for example, at Julier Pass and Larstig valley (Tyrol, Austria). New 10Be dates presented here for two rock glaciers in Larstig valley indicate final stabilization no later than 10.5 ± 0.8 ka. Based on this data, we conclude the earliest Holocene (between 11.6 and about 10.5 ka) was still strongly affected by the cold climatic conditions of the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal oscillation, with the intervening warming phase having had the effect of rapid downwasting of Egesen glaciers. At or slightly before 10.5 ka rapid shrinkage of glaciers to a size smaller than their late 20th century size reflects markedly warmer and possibly also drier climate. Between about 10.5 ka and 3.3 ka conditions in the Alps were not conducive to significant glacier expansion except possibly during rare brief intervals. Past tree-line data from Kaunertal (Tyrol, Austria) in concert with radiocarbon and dendrochronologically dated wood fragments found recently in the glacier forefields in both the Swiss and Austrian Alps points to long periods during the Holocene when glaciers were smaller than they were during the late 20th century. Equilibrium line altitudes (ELA) were about 200 m higher than they are today and about 300 m higher in comparison to Little Ice Age (LIA) ELAs. The Larstig rock glacier site we dated with 10Be is the type area for a postulated mid-Holocene cold period called the Larstig oscillation (presumed age about 7.0 ka). Our data point to final stabilization of those rock glaciers in the earliest Holocene and not in the middle Holocene. The combined data indicate there was no time window in the middle Holocene long enough for rock glaciers of the size and at the elevation of the Larstig site to have formed. During the short infrequent cold oscillations between 10.5 and 3.3 ka small glaciers (less than several km2) may have advanced to close to their LIA dimensions. Overall, the cold periods were just too short for large glaciers to advance. After 3.3 ka, climate conditions became generally colder and warm periods were brief and less frequent. Large glaciers (for example Grosser Aletschgletscher) advanced markedly at 3.0–2.6 ka, around 600 AD and during the LIA. Glaciers in the Alps attained their LIA maximum extents in the 14th, 17th, and 19th centuries, with most reaching their greatest LIA extent in the final 1850/1860 AD advance.”
Hormes et al. 2006 also dealt with Holocene glacier history, namely in the Swiss Alps. Several times the Swiss Alpine glaciers were smaller than today, each for 320-2500 years. The authors see a relationship between glacial changes and solar activity. Abstract:
A geochronological approach to understanding the role of solar activity on Holocene glacier length variability in the Swiss Alps
We present a radiocarbon data set of 71 samples of wood and peat material that melted out or sheared out from underneath eight presentday mid‐latitude glaciers in the Central Swiss Alps. Results indicated that in the past several glaciers have been repeatedly less extensive than they were in the 1990s. The periods when glaciers had a smaller volume and shorter length persisted between 320 and 2500 years. This data set provides greater insight into glacier variability than previously possible, especially for the early and middle Holocene. The radiocarbon‐dated periods defined with less extensive glaciers coincide with periods of reduced radio‐production, pointing to a connection between solar activity and glacier melting processes. Measured long‐term series of glacier length variations show significant correlation with the total solar irradiance. Incoming solar irradiance and changing albedo can account for a direct forcing of the glacier mass balances. Long‐term investigations of atmospheric processes that are in interaction with changing solar activity are needed in order to understand the feedback mechanisms with glacier mass balances.”
On the mountains of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, a mysterious glacier melt occurred during the last ice age, although it was quite cold. There was a lack of precipitation, according to the University of Washington.
The Lewis Glacier on Mt Kenya has been shrinking for the last 150 years. Again, a lack of moisture plays a role as Prinz et al. reported in 2016.
The Brewster Glacier in New Zealand has grown strongly over the last 40 years, documented by Sirguey et al. 2016, but since 2008 the glacier has been shrinking again. Scientists see a connection between glacier development and the PDO (Pacific Decade Oscillation). Abstract:
Reconstructing the mass balance of Brewster Glacier, New Zealand, using MODIS-derived glacier-wide albedo
In New Zealand, direct measurements of mass balance are sparse due to the inaccessibility of glaciers in the Southern Alps and the logistical difficulties associated with maintaining a mass balance record. In order to explore the benefit of remotely sensed imaging to monitor mass balance in the Southern Alps, this research assesses the relationship between measurements of glacier surface albedo derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and mass balance observations using the glaciological method on Brewster Glacier over the 2005–2013 period. We confirm that minimum glacier-wide albedo is a reliable predictor for annual mass balance in this maritime environment (R2 = 0.93). Furthermore, we show that regular monitoring of glacier-wide albedo enables a new metric of winter accumulation to be derived, namely the cumulative winter albedo, which is found to correlate strongly with winter mass balance (R2 = 0.88), thus enabling the reconstruction of separate winter and summer mass balance records. This allows the mass balance record for Brewster Glacier to be extended back to the start of MODIS observations in 2000 and to confirm that the annual balance of Brewster Glacier is largely controlled by summer balance (R2  =  92 %). An application of the extended record is proposed whereby the relationship between mass balance and the photographic record of the end-of-summer snowline altitude is assessed. This allowed the annual balance record of Brewster Glacier to be reconstructed over the period 1977–2013, thus providing the longest record of mass balance for a glacier in New Zealand. Over the 37-year period, our results show that Brewster Glacier gained a significant mass of up to 14.5 ± 2.7 m w.e. by 2007. This gain was offset by a marked shift toward negative balances after 2008, yielding a loss of 5.1 ± 1.2 m w.e., or 35 % of the gain accumulated over the previous 30 years. The good correspondence between mass balance of Brewster Glacier and the phase of the Pacific (Inter-)Decadal Oscillation (PDO/IPO), associated with the fast terminus retreat observed between 1978 and 1998, strongly suggests that the observed mass gain of Brewster Glacier since 1977 is only offsetting a longer sequence of dominantly negative balances.”
Growing New Zealand glaciers were also described by Mackintosh et al. 2017. The cause was cool temperatures and not low precipitation. Abstract:
Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming
Glaciers experienced worldwide retreat during the twentieth and early twenty first centuries, and the negative trend in global glacier mass balance since the early 1990s is predominantly a response to anthropogenic climate warming. The exceptional terminus advance of some glaciers during recent global warming is thought to relate to locally specific climate conditions, such as increased precipitation. In New Zealand, at least 58 glaciers advanced between 1983 and 2008, and Franz Josef and Fox glaciers advanced nearly continuously during this time. Here we show that the glacier advance phase resulted predominantly from discrete periods of reduced air temperature, rather than increased precipitation. The lower temperatures were associated with anomalous southerly winds and low sea surface temperature in the Tasman Sea region. These conditions result from variability in the structure of the extratropical atmospheric circulation over the South Pacific. While this sequence of climate variability and its effect on New Zealand glaciers is unusual on a global scale, it remains consistent with a climate system that is being modified by humans.”
Finally, a reference to the melting Totten Glacier in the East Antarctic. This glacier is apparently shrinking due to strong winds that bring warm uplift water to the glacier. But of course, the wind changes are also said to be anthropogenic in origin. Of course, what else would it be!

"**I've just watched a fresh turkey being covered in fragments of cheese-flavoured crisps and then stuffed with what looks like three kilos of cheddar.**
The video has more than four million views on YouTube. Call it a stunt, call it a travesty, whatever you make of it this is food - but not as you know it.
It's an extreme example of a so-called ""food porn"" video, a viral clip of an excessively indulgent recipe designed to shock or delight in equal measure.
While responses to the cheese-stuffed turkey video were mixed to say the least, videos that revel in stringy, gooey melted cheese, lashings of melted chocolate, or heinous quantities of barbecue sauce are all the rage. Observe a rainbow bagel filled with cream cheese or a 100-layer lasagne in the making.
They are shared far and wide on social media and evidence is growing to suggest that they are changing consumer expectations. Some of the most well-known creators behind these videos include Tasty, BuzzFeed Brand, Twisted, Spoon University and Chefclub.
Their clips take the form of visual recipes, usually filmed in a top-down format, focusing entirely on the food itself and cooking utensils. The final shots often show slow-motion close-ups of the resulting dish.
""For me, watching those kind of things the initial reaction is, they're disgusting, they're so gross, they're also incredibly wasteful, they're ludicrously unhealthy,"" says Thom Eagle, food writer and freelance chef.
""The term 'food porn' is apt because it's completely unrealistic.""
And yet Mr Eagle, who specialises in modern restaurant cuisine and fermentation recipes, has witnessed the power of social media. Stick a dish on Instagram, he says, and the punters will come looking: ""That's what sells the most the next day at the restaurant.""
People nowadays like to eat exactly what they want, when they want it, and are - for instance - increasingly using food delivery apps for that purpose.
More Technology of Business
The meal delivery market in the UK grew 13.4% year-on-year in 2018 and is up again this year, according to industry data, says Kim Malley at the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB).
It's a safe bet that apps have revolutionised the sector, she says.
But what about videos of food? There are clues there too. The AHDB tracks consumer opinion on cooking and food purchasing habits. The body asks what sources people use to inspire their cooking at home.
""12% claim that they've looked at YouTube for recipe inspiration,"" she says. ""To put that into perspective, in 2015 that was only at 4%.""
Firms that make the ingredients we cook with are keen to cash in on the eye-popping food craze. One marketing agency that works with brands to make social media videos in this style is Dish Works, based in Pennsylvania.
""I think that cheese is maybe one of the sexiest things you can use in a video,"" says Mary Bigham, president and co-founder.
""When you see cheese pulls and melty, bubbly cheese, you gotta stop and look at it.""
She calls it ""stretch appeal"" and says her team have a heat gun in their studio so that when pizzas, tacos or quesadillas are being filmed, the cheese can be coaxed to just the right level of lusciousness.
This visual language is not confined to cheese. Ms Bigham says that condiments like ketchup or mayonnaise, dressings and unctuous sauces poured in slow motion can all improve the likelihood that viewers will salivate over of the final video.
One New York restaurant capitalised on exactly this a few years ago. Raclette NYC serves raclette, a Swiss cheese that is usually brought to the table heated and melting. It is then scraped on to other things on your plate.
Raclette NYC posted a video showing off its dishes online and was immediately swamped with eight million views online overnight. The next day, the restaurant was overwhelmed with customers and the head chef had to hire 10 new staff members to cope with demand.
This is the effect food companies, restaurants and influencers are all chasing.
Ms Bigham says that the general goal for many purveyors of food porn is to nudge the viewer into wanting to try to make the dish at home for themselves. It looks delicious - and straightforward to make - so why not?
That does raise a question, though. As Mr Eagle points out, a lot of these recipes are unhealthy. Cheese is high in salt and saturated fat - a little goes a long way. Plus, the portion sizes in many viral food videos are gargantuan.
For her part, Ms Bigham argues she's never had a client request a video that she felt was unreasonably unhealthy.
But if excess is part of what makes many food videos go viral, that could be bad news for the obesity epidemic.
""My opinion is that these videos, they really show recipes which are calorific, they contain an excessive amount of fat,"" says Roberta Alessandrini, a nutritionist at Queen Mary University of London, referring to widely shared clips of deep-fried pizzas and towering burgers.
""They don't really depict an idea of what a healthy diet should be. On the other [hand] I think that cooking is a positive thing.""
Dr Alessandrini says research indicates that people who cook at home often have better diets overall.
If constructing the occasional 100-layer lasagne gets them into the kitchen, perhaps the overall effect might be a good one?"
" Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and former diplomat for 10 years prior.The Global Warming Policy Foundation has just published a report by Patricia Adams entitled The Road from Paris: China’s Climate U-Turn. It is an account of the changes in China’s energy policy since the signing of the COP21 Climate Change Agreement in Paris in December 2015. The full version of the report, including its sources, can be found here: https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2018/12/China-U-Turn.pdf This article provides a summary of the report. Overview China’s signature of the Paris Climate agreement was hailed by the press as evidence that the world was fully committed to moving towards a non-carbon dioxide future. As the world’s largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, China was viewed as a global leader that would add momentum to the emissions reductions called for by the United Nations. A series of events have served to end China’s image as the “climate savior”. Most importantly, China has had to come face-to-face with how it will meet its own energy needs and assure its security of supply. Further, the clear lack of progress in the funding of the Green Climate Fund, to which OECD countries were expected to contribute at least $100 billion per year by 2020 and from which China hoped to benefit has signaled that the UN climate apparatus is unlikely to serve China’s financial objectives. China’s Energy Needs In the emissions reduction plan it submitted to the UN in 2015, China committed to “peak” its GHG emissions by 2030 and to progressively improve the energy intensity of its economy. Instead, the country has found itself scrambling to find ever more sources of energy to support its economic growth. Demand for energy has increased sharply, as much as 15% for natural gas over the past year. China’s “Belt and Road” (BRI) development initiative has focused on increasing energy supply through building pipelines, power facilities and ports in more than 70 countries, with a heavy emphasis on oil and natural gas, LNG and nuclear energy. China has quickly expanded its fleet of nuclear facilities and now has 45 operating reactors and 15 under construction.Coal remains the mainstay of China’s electricity generation system, even though it aims to reduce its reliance on coal over time to improve local air quality. China is already the world’s largest coal producer and consumer. According to Bloomberg and Wood Mackenzie,  it plans to add more mines, perhaps as much as 400 million tons of capacity by 2020. In terms of coal consumption, satellite imagery shows that many coal-fired power plants that were formerly halted have quietly been restarted. In total, 4.7 gigawatts (W) of new and restarted coal-fired power plant construction are either generating power or will soon be operational, expanding capacity by 4%. In other countries, China is involved in 240 coal-fired power projects in 25 BRI countries with a total installed capacity of 251 GW. China’s Local Air Quality Needs China’s planners had placed great hopes on increased use of wind and solar electricity generation to replace coal-fired generation and thus reduce local air pollution. As a result of large investments, the country now has the largest wind and solar generation capacity in the world. However, according to reports from the U.S Energy Information Administration, wind and solar account for only 2.7% and 0.5%, respectively, of China’s actual generation. This is partly because Chinese curtailment rates are the worst in the world (Bloomberg New Energy Finance). When several western countries abandoned the subsidies to solar and wind power and enforced anti-dumping policies on imports of Chinese equipment, Beijing responded with new subsidies that increased domestic installations. The subsidies, however, were so large and the market so undisciplined that the Ministry of Finance is now left with a subsidy backlog (money it owes the industry) of US $18.71 billion. The subsidy regime is now ending. At the same time, China is introducing a renewable energy quota system, which will require each province or energy retailer to source a certain percentage of electricity from renewables or to buy green energy “certificates” from renewables developers who are unable to bring their power to market, in effect downloading the cost of renewable power onto market actors, such as power networks and electricity suppliers and ultimately onto electricity consumers. The Chinese government last year ordered centralized district-heating plants in 28 northern cities to burn natural gas instead of coal, only to discover that the infrastructure to deliver and use the gas did not exist. This year, it has changed course, allowing coal consumption as needed in the northern cities, but banning new smog-producing industrial facilities in key cities and permitting increased coal-burning and smog pollution in parts of the country where air quality is a lower political priority. The average levels of pollution for the country as a whole remain 72% higher than guidelines set by the World Health Organization. Carbon Dioxide Emissions China’s GHG emissions increased by 1.7% in 2017 and are projected to grow by 4.7% in 2018. China’s carbon market has been scaled back and is now “low key”. The Green Climate Fund, which was supposed to receive at least $100 billion per year in contributions from the “Annex II” (i.e. mostly, OECD) countries, has received only a small portion of the promised commitments, and the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement virtually assures that it will not receive anything close to what the developing countries, including China, had hoped they could access. The fund is now beset with internal conflict and has approved only a relatively small number of projects. China thus is losing much of its motivation to keep up the pretense that it is committed to its emissions reduction plan. The failure of the Green Climate Fund gives China (and other countries that submitted emissions reduction plans to the UN) an “out”. All that will be left is the propaganda.~~~~Related:  “Where will the UN get its climate money now? ” Insights on the Green Climate Fundhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/04/where-will-the-u-n-get-its-climate-money-now/  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
" For an evidence-based climate agenda and the real interests of society(translation of original, from the signatories)Open letter to the Minister of the Environment, Ricardo de Aquino SallesCc:– Your Honor Mr. Antônio Hamilton Martins Mourão – Vice President of the Republic;– Your Honor Mr. Marcos Cesar Pontes – Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications;– Your Honor Mr. Bento Costa Lima Leite de Albuquerque Júnior – Minister of Mines and Energy;– Your Honor Ms. Tereza Cristina Corrêa da Costa Dias – Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply;– Your Honor Mr. Gustavo Henrique Rigodanzo Canuto – Minister of Regional Development;– Your Honor Mr. Tarcisio Gomes de Freitas – Minister of Infrastructure;– Your Honor Mr. Fernando Azevedo e Silva – Minister of Defense;– Your Honor Mr. Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira – Chief Minister of the Institutional Security Office;– Your Honor Mr. Ernesto Henrique Fraga Araújo – Minister of Foreign Affairs. Your Honor Mr. Ricardo de Aquino Salles: The positions expressed by Your Honor in several interviews, before and after assuming the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), reinforce the expectation that its management may represent a decisive turning point in the orientation of Brazilian environmental policy, aiming at confronting the real problems of the Country and the performance of the MMA as a catalyst for synergistic actions with the other organs of public administration, as well as promoting an objective, pragmatic and non-ideological vision of environmental issues in society in general.In this context, the present signatories reiterate that the discussions and formulation of public policies on climate issues have been predominantly based on mistaken and narrow ideological, political, economic and academic motivations, not only from the basic principles of practice but also of the larger interests of society.It is noticeable that the extension of such interests and the international commitments assumed by the country to the “decarbonization” agenda of the world economy makes any abrupt attempt to reorient the national climate agenda, outside the “anthropogenic” scenario of climate change, to generate opposition from the sectors articulated around this scenario, including the powerful international environmental movement and a large part of the media, with considerable influence on internal and external public opinion.Nevertheless, some necessary course corrections are feasible in order to give a higher priority to certain initiatives of fundamental importance, both within the MMA and other ministries, to provide an effective improvement of the knowledge of the climate dynamics and an increase the general ability of society to cope with the most diverse meteorological and climatic phenomena that have always occurred in the past and will continue to occur in the future. We are convinced that such initiatives would represent better applications for much of the human and financial resources that have been mistakenly targeted for and depleted with the decarbonization agenda, particularly the National Climate Change Fund.Therefore, we offer you the following considerations, with the expectation that they may provide relevant subsidies for the MMA’s performance, taking advantage of the opportunity to formulate votes for success in its management. 1) There is no physical evidence of human influence on the global climateIn strictly scientific terms, the climatic question can be summed up in a single paragraph:Changes are the fundamental feature of climate, as evidenced by the evidence for the Earth’s entire geological history – that is, the climate is always changing (hence the term “climate change” becomes a pleonasm). As to the alleged human influence on the global climate, supposedly attributed to the emissions of carbon compounds from human activities, it would have to amplify the (gradient) rates of atmospheric and oceanic temperatures and sea levels recorded since the Industrial Revolution XVIII century. As there is no observed physical evidence that these latter variations are anomalous, relative to those recorded earlier, in the historical and geological past, simply, the human influence hypothesis cannot be proved in spite of all the fussing in this sense.All the prognoses that indicate exaggerated elevations of sea temperatures and sea levels in the coming decades, as well as other negative impacts attributed to the release of “anthropogenic” carbon into the atmosphere, are based on projections of mathematical models, which are only very limited simplifications of the climate system. Therefore, such alarmist scenarios should not be used to support public policies and long-range strategies with large socio-economic impacts, both nationally and globally.The human influence on the climate is restricted to the urban areas and their surroundings (the known effect of the “heat islands”), being these impacts very localized and without influence in the planetary scale.According to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR5 / IPCC) released in 2014, global average temperatures increased by 0.85 °C in the period 1880-2012, while average sea level rose by 0.19 m between 1901 and 2010.Now, even within the period of existence of humanity, there are records of much more marked numbers. Throughout the Holocene, the geological epoch corresponding to the last 11,700 years when human civilization has developed, there have been several periods with higher temperatures than today. In the Middle Holocene, 6,000-8,000 years ago, average temperatures were 2 °C to 3 °C above current levels, while sea levels reached up to 3 meters above current levels. Similarly, in the hot periods known as Minoan (1500-1200 BC), Roman (III BC-V AD) and Medieval (XIV-XIII AD), average temperatures of the planet were between 1-2 °C higher than current. And paleoclimatic data (ice cylinders from Vostok station, Antarctica) suggest that Earth’s temperatures were already 6 °C to 10 °C higher than the current ones, in the last three interglacial ones there are about 150,000, 240,000 and 320 thousand years ago.Between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago, in the cold period called Recent Dryas, atmospheric temperatures dropped by around 8 °C in less than 50 years, and by the end of that year they rose again in the same proportion in just over half a century.As for sea level, it rose about 120 meters, between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago, which equates to an average rate of 1 meter per century, fast enough to visually impact the successive generations of populations living on the continental shores. In the period between 14,650 and 14,300 years ago, there are records of an even faster rise, reaching about 14 meters in only 350 years, averaging 4 meters per century.In other words, such variations represent values ​​greater than an order of magnitude to observations made since the nineteenth century. Therefore, the latter fall well within the range of natural oscillations of climatic parameters and therefore cannot be attributed to the use of fossil fuels or to any other type of activity linked to human development.Although evidence such as these can be found in literally thousands of studies conducted on every continent by scientists from dozens of countries, duly published in the international scientific literature (see, e.g., the excellent site http://www.co2science.org), it is rare for any of these studies to have repercussions in the media, often more inclined to promote a sensationalist and disorienting alarmism. 2) The hypothesis of “anthropogenic” warming is a disservice to science and a risk to public policiesGood scientific practice presupposes a correspondence between working hypotheses and observed data that prove them. The “anthropogenic” climate change hypothesis is not based on physical evidence observed in the real world, since in the past, high temperatures occurred with low concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and vice versa. In addition, according to satellite data, the average global temperature (if any) has been stable over the past 20 years, although CO₂ emissions have increased by more than 11% over the same period. Therefore, despite the fact that a certain number of scientists have been added, their construction passes away from scientific methodology and the insistence on its preservation represents a great disservice to Science and its necessary placing in the service of the well-being of humanity.History records numerous examples of the ill effects of linking science to ideologies and other narrow interests. The prevailing commitment to imposing the “anthropogenic” hypothesis without the corresponding evidence has cost humanity dearly, in human, technical, and economic resources wasted with a nonexistent problem. Brazil is not unaware of this situation. On the contrary, there is an unreasonable commitment in the country to place it in a questionable position of “leadership” in the international negotiations on the climate.It is worth remembering that a number of leading countries have expressed contentious positions on the political guidelines based on such an unfounded hypothesis, in order to mitigate their impacts on their respective national economies.In addition, by giving CO₂ and other gases produced by human activities the role of climate dynamics players, the “anthropogenic” hypothesis simplifies and distorts extremely complex natural processes in which astrophysical, atmospheric, oceanic, geological, geomorphological and biological factors interact, which science only begins to understand in its scope and is still very far from being able to represent them in reliable mathematical models.Incidentally, the alleged 2 °C limit for raising temperatures above pre-industrial levels, which supposedly could not be surmounted and justified all the proposed restrictions on fossil fuels at international level, has no basis scientific basis. It is a “political” creation of physicist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research (PIK) and scientific advisor to the German government, as he himself admitted in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, published 10/17/2010.An example of the risks of this simplification to the formulation of relevant public policies is the real possibility that the period until the 2030s will experience considerable cooling of the atmosphere rather than heating due to the combined effect of a cycle of low solar activity (Cycle 25), the cooling phase of the Pacific Ocean (Pacific Decadal Oscillation-ODP), in a scenario similar to that observed between 1947 and 1976, and the trend of increasing global cloud coverage over the last 16 years. It is worth noting that, in that period, Brazil experienced a 10-30% reduction in rainfall, which caused problems of water supply and electricity generation, in addition to an increase in strong frosts, which contributed, for example, to eradicating cultivation of coffee in western Paraná. If such conditions are repeated in the immediate future, the country could have serious problems, including in the areas of expansion of the agricultural frontier of the Midwest, North and Northeast regions, and hydroelectric generation (particularly considering the proliferation of reservoirs of water “, imposed by the environmental restrictions of the last decades). 3) Obsession with CO₂ diverts attentions and resources from actual emergenciesThe sun, water and CO₂ are essential for photosynthesis and for life as we know it on planet Earth. That is, CO₂ is not a pollutant, but the gas of life!In addition, the obsession with reducing CO₂ emissions has led to an undesirable diversion of human and financial resources and attention from the real environmental problems affecting society today, whose solutions require public initiatives and investments and the awareness of broad social sectors. Not to stretch, some of the main ones are mentioned:– The lack of access to basic sanitation networks for more than 100 million Brazilians; about 34 million do not have access to treated water and only 45% of the sewage collected has some type of treatment, which generates losses estimated at R $ 56 billion per year, according to the “Trata Brasil” Institute.– Although a little more than 91% of the waste generated in the country is collected regularly, 41% of the solid waste collected is destined for inadequate landfills and landfills, generating large public health impacts, aquifer and water pollution and other problems (acc. to Panorama of Solid Waste in Brazil 2017).– According to the IBGE, 8.27 million people in 872 municipalities live in areas of risk – slopes, river floodplains and other unsuitable land for housing (Population in risk areas in Brazil, 2018).Unfortunately, despite their seriousness and urgency of confrontation, such problems are often not perceived as “environmental” by a considerable part of society and therefore do not receive even a fraction of the attention and publicity usually devoted to climate issues. 4) Better knowledge and greater resilienceInstead of the alarmism about global warming and the pseudo-panaceas “low carbon”, the climate agenda would have much to gain from a reorientation of priorities, favoring: a) a better understanding of the dynamics of the climate, with emphasis on paleoclimatic studies of the territory Brazilian; and (b) an increase in society’s resilience in dealing with extreme weather events and any future climate trends.The study of the climatic changes of the historical and geological past (paleo-climate) constitutes the most solid basis for the understanding of the climatic dynamics and its projections for the future. Particular attention should be given to the Quaternary period (the last 2.6 million years), in which the genus Homo has emerged and evolved. Within the Quaternary, the last 800,000 years have been marked by a succession of colder cycles, with an average duration of 90-100,000 years, and interglacial (warmer), with an average duration of 10-12 thousand years. Today, the planet is in an interglacial phase, beginning about 11,700 years ago, within which all human civilization has developed. Significantly, at least the previous three interglacial were warmer than the current one, and there is no evidence that the interglacial present can fail to be succeeded by a new glaciation. The most accepted explanation for the factors causing this dynamic is based on changes in cyclically-varying earth orbital parameters such as changes in the inclination of the axis of rotation and in the shape of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Therefore, it is evident that man is incapable of causing any minute influence on the cosmic factors and forces that govern it.In Brazil, Quaternary studies, although important and the existence of a reasonable number of research institutions and researchers dedicated to them, are still sparse and insufficient to allow the configuration of a paleoclimatic picture of the national territory and its continental environment, with the necessary depth to subsidize a consistent model of climate change to be defined for the country, that can provide relevant data to subsidize a global model more in keeping with reality. Therefore, this is a gap that needs to be considered in formulating a truly useful climate agenda, in which the MMA could act in consonance with the specific bodies of the MME and MCTIC. In addition, there is a need for local and regional studies, intermediates between the global / zonal and point scales of microclimates, which are of great importance for planning and territorial planning and should receive greater attention.As for resilience, this can be understood as the flexibility of the physical conditions of survival and functioning of society, as well as its capacity to respond to emergencies, allowing it to reduce its vulnerability to extreme weather phenomena, climatic oscillations and other natural phenomena which have occurred in the past and will certainly occur in the future.In this regard, two sets of factors stand out that contribute to reduce the vulnerability of society to meteorological and climatic adversities:a) an improvement in national weather forecasting capacity;b) the stimulation of research related to new advanced energy sources.In the first item, a key initiative would be to take the role of the project of a geostationary meteorological satellite of its own, essential for a country that occupies half of South America and has the responsibility of distributing meteorological information on a large part of the South Atlantic Ocean (the so-called METAREA-V) in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).Other relevant initiatives include:– the expansion and better territorial distribution of the network of meteorological stations, lower than the standards recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for a territory with the Brazilian dimension, with special emphasis on the work being developed by the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET);– increasing the number of meteorological radars and their interconnection with civil defense systems;– speeding up the consolidation of the national meteorological data base, part of which has not yet been digitized;– the establishment of a more efficient network for the dissemination of meteorological and oceanographic data to METAREA-V.The second item highlights the establishment of research lines for new energy sources, such as the use of thorium in nuclear reactors, nuclear fusion (with concepts that will be commercially available over the next decade) and sources based on new physical principles , such as chemically assisted nuclear reactions (so-called “cold fusion”), quantum vacuum energy (or “zero point”), and others, objects of research and development in several countries, but practically ignored in the country, which cannot give the luxury of being oblivious to them. For such research, Brazil has the necessary qualified human resources, distributed among academic research centers, state companies (Cenpes, Cepel, etc.), military personnel (IME, CTA, CTEx, IPqM) and some private technology companies. With regard to renewable sources, solar energy can be exploited, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast, but not with photovoltaic systems, of proven inefficiency, but with solar power (CSP), in particular those of parabolic troughs , in addition to the production of liquid fuels from algae and hydrogen from hydrogenase (reversible oxidation catalytic hydrogen molecular enzyme).All of these initiatives could benefit from the availability of some of the financial resources that have been allocated to programs linked to climate change along the wrong approach to reducing carbon emissions.An additional set of initiatives relevant to “climate resilience” involves physical infrastructure, in particular, food storage capacity, transport infrastructure, energy and communications, as well as other topics not directly within the scope of MMA, but potentially influenced Ministry’s guidelines and programs.In summary, the most rational and efficient way to increase society’s resilience in the face of inevitable climatic changes – warming or cooling – is the general elevation of their levels of human development and progress to the levels allowed by Science and the advancement of knowledge and the process of innovation. 5) “Decarbonization” is unnecessary and deleteriousSince “anthropogenic” carbon emissions do not produce verifiable impacts on the global climate, the entire “decarbonization” or “low carbon economy” agenda becomes unnecessary and counterproductive – indeed, it is a pseudo-solution to a problem nonexistent, at least as far as the climate is concerned (urban mobility incentive programs included in the Climate Fund, for example, justify themselves). The insistence on its preservation, by virtue of the inertia of the status quo, will not imply any effect on the climate, but will tend to deepen the many negative impacts of such guidelines.The main one is the unnecessary increase of a series of economic activities, due to:– subsidies for the exploitation of low-efficiency energy sources, such as wind and solar photovoltaic, already in decline in the European Union (EU), which invested heavily in them;– imposition of quotas and fees linked to carbon emissions, as the EU did to enable its carbon credits market, and countries such as Australia and France, where the great popular rejection forced its withdrawal;– imposing on various economic activities carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) measures that are totally useless from a climate and public health point of view, since CO₂ is not a toxic and polluting gas; It is worth to insist, it is the gas of life. The main beneficiaries of such measures have been speculators, equipment suppliers and CCS services and participants in the intrinsically useless carbon markets, which have no real economic basis and are based solely on an artificial demand created from a need nonexistent. 6) Looking at the futureFor the first time in history, mankind has a wealth of physical, technical and human knowledge and resources to provide the virtual totality of the material needs of an even larger population than today. This perspective makes it possible to universalize – in a fully sustainable way – the general levels of well-being enjoyed by the most advanced countries in terms of water infrastructure, sanitation, energy, transport, communications, health and education services and other achievements of modern civilized life. Despite the fallacious arguments against this perspective, the main obstacles to its realization, in less than two generations, are mental and political, not physical and environmental. Definitely, Brazilian environmental policy (including the climate agenda) needs to fit in with this perspective. Luiz Carlos Baldicero Molion(Retired) of the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), associate professor (retired) of the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), a professor of meteorology and postdoctoral researcher in Forest Hydrology, José Carlos Parente de OliveiraPhysicist, PhD in Physics and Post-Doctor in Atmospheric Physics, associate professor (retired) of the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), professor at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceará (IFCE) José Bueno ContiGeographer, PhD in Physical Geography and Professor of Climatology, Full Professor of the Geography Department of the University of São Paulo (USP) Fernando de Mello GomidePhysicist, titular professor (retired) of the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA) Ricardo Augusto FelícioMeteorologist, Master and Doctor in Climatology, Professor of the Department of Geography of the University of São Paulo (USP), member of the Brazilian Society of Meteorology (SBMET) Fúlvio CupolilloGeographer, Master’s in Applied Meteorology and PhD in Geography, Full Professor at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Minas Gerais (IFMG) Daniela de Souza OnçaGeographer, Master and PhD in Climatology, Professor of the Geography Department of the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC) Carlos Henrique JardimGeographer, master, doctor and postdoctor in Geography, professor of the Department of Geography of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Wellington Lopes AssisGeographer, Master and PhD in Geography, Professor of the Geography Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) João Bosco A. de MoraisGeologist, Master in Hydrogeology and PhD in Vulnerability of Aquifers, private consultant and advisor for the Environment of the Government of the State of Ceará Danilo Ericksen Costa CabralMeteorologist, Master’s in Meteorology, Executive Agency for Water Management of the State of Paraíba (AESA) Rômulo da Silveira PazMeteorologist, Master’s in Meteorology, PhD in Mechanical Engineering, Associate Professor, Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) Paulo Cesar Martins Pereira de Azevedo BrancoGeologist, senior researcher in Geosciences (retired) of the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM) Gildo Magalhães dos Santos FilhoElectronic Engineer, PhD in Social History and Professor of History of Science and Technology, Full Professor of the History Department of the University of São Paulo (USP) Thiago MaiaPhysicist, Master and PhD in Nuclear Physics and PhD in Astrophysics, petroleum engineer and private consultant Guilherme Polli RodriguesGeographer, Master in Climatology, environmental consultant Igor Vaz MaquieiraBiologist, specialist in Environmental Management Mario de Carvalho Fontes NetoAgronomist, editor of The Great Global Warming Swindle blog Richard JakubazskoJournalist, executive editor of Agro DBO magazine and co-author of the book CO₂ warming and climate change: are you kidding us?

 _A reader of The BFD has done some digging into who is behind the so-called student-led C limate marches, and this article is about what they discovered._



Contrary to popular belief, and the young people who falsely claim to be the organisers of a wholly student-led protest movement, those who really control things are extreme Left-wing organisations with direct links to Greenpeace, the Australian Workers Union, the Australian Green Party and Labor MP Bill Shorten among others.



School Strike 4 Climate is based in Australia, but it is also the power behind the New Zealand operation, as can be seen on each page of the New Zealand version of their website:



“Massive thanks to our Australian friends at [schoolstrike4climate.com](http://schoolstrike4climate.com/)“



So, just who is behind all this? Firstly, there is the Australian Youth Climate Coalition:



“A school strike today promoted as a “student-led protest” by thousands of children skipping classes to attend climate change rallies around the nation has been **organ­ised by a network of adult activists from climate campaign organisations.**



 **The primary backer** of the planned­ student walkout called School Strike 4 Climate Action is the Australian Youth Climate Coal­ition, a non-profit company registered as a charity with an **all-adult board and 68 adult staff.**



The AYCC was set up a decade ago to mobilise young people on climate action by Anna Rose, an **adult activist and the wife of former GetUp national director and Greens candidate Simon Sheikh.**



The adult-controlled AYCC has extensive links to other clim­ate action and anti-Adani groups with large campaign budgets, ­ **including the Sunrise Project, GetUp and Greenpeace.**



Another key group helping with organisation is the recently formed **Climate Leaders, members of the all-adult Climate Leaders board** include Django Merope Synge, a national campaigner for GetUp recently involved­ with Ms McPhail in the campaign to oust Tony Abbott at the expected May election, and Chris Cooper, a campaigner for **GetUp** offshoot group Purpose.”



What is ‘Getup’, and who is behind it?



“ **The founding board member of GetUp is Bill Shorten.** He was the head of the Australian Workers Union at the time and personally **authorised $100,000 in members’ funds** to be given as a donation to GetUp.



Another founding Board Member was Cate Faehrmann – she’s a **Greens NSW MP,** and before that was Chief of staff to Greens Leader Richard di Natale.



Australia’s **most militant union the CFMEU gave the largest single donation in GetUp’s history** with a $1.2 million gift to GetUp – which in turn campaigned against controls on union thuggery and lawlessness.”



Other major forces behind the movement are Charlie Wood and Alex Fuller.



“Wood is Australian Campaigns Director of [350.org](https://350.org/), an environmentalist activist organisation with a presence in 188 countries. It had a US$16.8 million total revenue in 2017, and public records show wealthy foundations such as the **George Soros-funded** Tides Foundation have collectively funneled in tens of millions of dollars to [350.org](https://350.org/) since its founding in 2007. The CEO of [350.org](https://350.org/) in Australia, Blair Palese, was a board member of **Greenpeace** Australia Pacific. Greenpeace has collectively received billions of dollars from establishment-run foundations such as the **Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Tides Foundation, and the Schmidt Family Foundation** established by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The late Lord Peter Melchett, heir to the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) fortune, was executive director of **Greenpeace UK.**



[…] Fuller is Communications Manager of **the Australian Youth Climate Coalition** (AYCC), which had a total income of **more than $2.8 million in 2017 alone.** The two co-founders of GetUp, Harvard graduates Jeremy Heimans and David Madden, both worked for the **Soros-funded** MoveOn.org in the USA.”



The platform that School Strike 4 Climate operates on over the internet is one that was **created solely for the promotion of Left-wing ideologies** ; this is something that they [openly admit](https://help.actionnetwork.org/hc/en-us/articles/203852955-Who-can-use-the-Action-Network-Only-progressives-).



Action Network is financed by The Action Network Fund, a 501(c) charitable organization dedicated to helping progressive organizations, and is, according to their own words, **a promoter of socialism**.



“The Action Network Fund is working to restore balance to our economy and to create shared prosperity and a more just society.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately we’ve been hearing reports of how Arctic sea ice has (unexpectedly) reached normal levels this winter. This is a bit of good news which the media avoid mentioning.
But the resurgence of Arctic ice has hardly been good news for global warming alarmists, and especially for the 300 crew members of German high-tech research vessel Polarstern of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), now currently on expedition in the mid Arctic.

Exchange of Polarstern research vessel crew will have to sit tight as Russian supply ice breaker gets held up. Image:  Alfred Wegener Institute. 
Yesterday NDR German public broadcasting reported that it appears the Polarstern’s crew will have to sit tight for awhile longer because a Russian ice breaker for exchanging the crew has had too much difficulty breaking its way through the ice to the research vessel. The sea ice is thicker than anticipated.
The NDR reports: “There are problems with the Arctic expedition of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven. The crew on the research vessel ‘Polarstern’ have to stay on site longer than expected.”
“Dense ice”

The problem is that the Russian supply icebreaker became bogged in “the dense sea ice of the Arctic” and now “is making little progress”. The ice has been too thick for the Russian ice breaker to make its way as planned.
The Polarstern research vessel of the AWI MOSAiC expedition departed mainland Europe last September and has since lodged itself in the middle of the Arctic ice through the winter as part of an Arctic research expedition. It will return back to its home-port of Bremerhaven in early October of this year.
The “MOSAiC” expedition is one of the largest Arctic expeditions ever with scientists from 20 nations studying “the climate processes of the central Arctic”. The crew of 300 on board the Polarstern is supplied and exchanged at about every three months by “an international fleet of icebreakers, helicopters and aircraft,” Radio Bremen reported.
Thick ice caused breaker to run out of fuel
Just recently Russian supply ice breaker “Captain Dranitsyn” was headed over to carry out a scheduled “crew exchange” but ended up consuming too much fuel trying to break through the “up to 160 centimeters thick” sea ice, Radio Bremen reported. Now the supply icebreaker “no longer has enough fuel for the return trip because of the high energy consumption in the ice.”
There were “few open or thin spots,” one official explained.
“According to a spokesperson, the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven is now looking for solutions, and several options already prepared for such situations are being examined,” writes Radio Bremen.
The cost of the Polarstern MOSAiC expedition is 160 million euros.

"We all know a new era dawns in Washington in approximately 12 days, but why should Hollywood wait? Kicking off the E! red carpet show at the 74th Annual Golden Globes on Sunday night, Ryan Seacrest served notice to all that as far as awards season goes, change starts now. “‘Who are you wearing?’ That’s so done,” he said, not long before admitting he was, as it happened, wearing a   tuxedo from his Ryan Seacrest Distinction collection. Conflict of interest issues aside, it was a provocative statement, even in a time when practically every day brings a new provocative statement over the Twitter superhighway. Could it be true? Would 2017 usher in a time when actresses (and actors) did not have to   their clothes as part of the price of entry? Dream on. The   complex is alive and well and serving its prime purpose: marketing a moment of fantasy and escape. Kerry Washington did her job by not only introducing her     dress as by Dolce  Gabbana but by announcing that it was their special couture line and had never appeared on a red carpet before. Never, in other words, been seen by the general public’s eyes. Sprinkle a little of that    diamond dust on all of us. She wasn’t the only one who could. Ruth Negga also modeled   gold: this time sequins, this time with a futuristic   cool, this time by Nicolas Ghesquière for Louis Vuitton. (It never hurts to send a subliminal message by modeling yourself after a statuette, perhaps the reason it was something of a trend.) When Lily Collins appeared in full   pink beaded Zuhair Murad, her oversize bun like a nest just made for some twittering Disney canaries to land in, it was clear as far as fashion went we were in, well, La La Land. There were trains, on Winona Ryder’s strapless black Viktor  Rolf ball gown and Claire Foy’s Titania dress. Pink was a dominant color, as seen on Felicity Jones, doing a kind of sexy Jane Eyre impersonation in trompe l’oeil Gucci, and Carrie Underwood, in a    top so was yellow (Natalie Portman’s maternity Prada, ’  and very Jackie) and yet more gold on Naomie Harris in an Armani column and Sarah Paulson in Marc Jacobs. Mandy Moore had a   chiffon cape attached to the back of her plunging Naeem Khan gown, the better to do some superhero billowing with a twirl. And if Nicole Kidman’s Alexander McQueen        slip dress was a bit of a medieval shipwreck, and Drew Barrymore’s Monique Lhuillier suggested she was about to transform into a superglamorous sea gull, Emma Stone’s     Valentino covered in stars hinted she could twinkle like a constellation all on her own. And so it went. Sarah Jessica Parker swept by in a   white Vera Wang   dress (not really, presumably). Ye olde Hollywood brigade was best represented by Brie Larson in full Veronica Lake waves and red strapless Rodarte gown with a beaded, corseted top Blake Lively in molded black velvet Versace with gold chain mail   trim and a host of liquid sequined columns on Viola Davis (  yellow, Michael Kors) Amy Adams (strapless, wine black, Tom Ford) and Kristen Bell (    black Jenny Packham). But then Evan Rachel Wood showed up in a   custom Altuzarra tuxedo, referencing both David Bowie and Marlene Dietrich, because “I wanted to make sure young women and girls understood they didn’t always have to wear dresses it’s not a requirement. ” Not that she was trying to “protest dresses,” she said. Ditto, presumably, Octavia Spencer, powerful in another custom tux, and also talking about inspiring the next generation of girls. By the time Pharrell Williams appeared in a white Chanel jacket from the “2012  ” women’s collection, the gender gauntlet was thrown. It made all the froth and familiar fantasia seem   and close to irrelevant. Sure there were few really silly looks (Janelle Monáe’s   Armani and Olivia Culpo’s folkloric      Zuhair Murad among them) but there weren’t a lot of memorable ones, either. Thandie Newton, in Monse, wore one of them.    strict and   the white dress was unadorned  —   except for a hint of   flames licking their way up from hem to calf. Just in case anyone forgot the somewhat incendiary nature of this particular time."

Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus at MIT, and now a Distinguished Senior Fellow in the Center for the Study of Science here at Cato, has just published a paper called “Science in the Public Square: Global Climate Alarmism and Historical Precedents.” The paper is in the _Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons_.   
  
  
Lindzen begins with what he calls “The Iron Triangle,” an analog to a very popular aphorism coined by Ronald Reagan, that describes the generic and mutually beneficial relationship between Congress, the media, and special interest groups. Lindzen’s version is between scientists who make “meaningless or ambiguous statements” on climate change, which are translated into alarmist declarations by the global warming lobby, to which politicians respond by shoveling more money to the scientists. Dr. Lindzen cheekily calls this version the Iron Rice Bowl, the same phrase coined by Mao Zedong to describe lifetime employment in exchange for support of the communist state.   
  
  
Lindzen, whose article is available here, notes this type of symbiosis supported two other particularly bad ideas. One was early 20th Century eugenics, which was enshrined by law in the United States, politically very useful in 1920s Germany, and institutionalized into the holocaust in the succeeding decade. For an exhausting and exhaustive insight on this process in Germany, you still can’t beat Robert J. Lifton’s 1986 book, _The Nazi Doctors_.   
  
  
A similar dynamic surrounded the institutionalization of the obviously incorrect paradigm of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics,” championed by Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko, under the enthusiastic support of Josef Stalin, who thought it would help bring about “The New Soviet Man,” by changing human nature _genetically_ through physical experiences of the organism. The logic is as simple as this: if one, say, pumped iron incessantly with just the left arm, your children would be born with muscular left arms. Hogwash, but effective for a public that both feared its government and was scientifically illiterate.   
  
  
“The Situation in Biological Science,” published (and translated) by the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in 1949 sits very close to Lifton’s book on my shelf at Cato. It is an exhaustive compendium on Lysenko’s “new genetics.” It claims authority, and if you spoke against it as a scientist, a trip to Siberia (or worse) wasn’t far away. With global warming alarmism, we are much more humane. Speak against it, and you will lose your government funding and maybe your job, but not your life.   
  
  
Lindzen finishes with a bit of optimism, noting that the eugenics and Lysenkoism lasted about thirty years, which would mean that the Iron Triangle of climate alarmism is getting a little long in the tooth (it started in1988).   
  
  
Methinks Professor Lindzen is a bit optimistic. After all, most regulation of ionizing radiation and carcinogens is based upon the obviously wrong notion that a single photon or a single molecule can induce cancer. That was enshrined in the 1950s and lives on today.

Listening to the apocalyptic shrieking of the Klimate Kids and the Extinction Rebellion nutters, it is clear that they are not only staggeringly ignorant of “the science” they fetishise, but completely and utterly divorced from anything approaching reality.



Like old-fashioned fire-and-brimstone preachers, scowling teenagers rant about the fire, tribulation and wailing and teeth-gnashing which awaits us climate sinners. But the strictly empirical evidence to date is that the mild warming of the 20th century has been extremely beneficial. The [world has greened](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/global-greening-another-triumph-for-economic-development/), [fires have declined dramatically](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/the-amazon-is-burning-pt-1-a-flaming-heap-of-bullshit/), natural disasters [like cyclones](https://theconversation.com/tropical-cyclone-frequency-falls-to-centuries-low-in-australia-but-will-the-lull-last-20814) have decreased, droughts have [remained stable or decreased](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00704-013-1019-5), and [food is ever-more abundant](https://www.thegwpf.com/global-warming-benefits-2017-sets-new-record-for-global-food-production/).



 **Those are the facts.** Not “projections”, but hard, empirical data.



The concern over climate change is not so much about the warming that has occurred over the past century. Rather, the concern is about projections of 21st century climate change based on climate model simulations of human-caused global warming, particularly those driven by the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration scenario.



Simulations and models should never, ever be confused with empirical data, let alone regarded as hard facts. And certainly not models which are [“useless pieces of junk or worse…when they are used for climate forecasting”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/climate-models-useless-junk/).



Politicians, media, and half-educated children, with scarcely even the most rudimentary grasp of such science basics, are easy, gullible targets for propaganda. Unfortunately, they’re being fed a steady diet of propaganda and told it’s “science” – and they believe it.



The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports have focused on assessing a likely range (>66% probability) for projections in response to different emissions concentration pathways. Oppenheimer et al. (2007) contends that the emphasis on consensus in IPCC reports has been on expected outcomes, which then become anchored via numerical estimates in the minds of policy makers.



In other words, IPCC reports “project” that, **on a worst-case scenario** , temperatures **might** rise by 3 or more degrees. This is filtered through politicians and media, to become: “temperatures are going to rise by 3 degrees!” Gullible, terrified children amplify that to “We’re all going to die!”



It’s a spectacularly idiotic outbreak of the madness of crowds, fuelled by a steady avalanche of ideologically-amped Chinese whispers.



In an influential paper, Weitzman (2009) argued that climate policy should be directed at reducing the risks of worst-case outcomes, not at balancing the most likely values of costs and benefits. Ackerman (2017) has argued that policy should be based on the credible worst-case outcome.



This is utter nonsense. There’s a worst-case possibility that Earth could be invaded by hostile aliens at any given time. Would anyone argue seriously that we must therefore, spend everything we can building giant space-laser defences to fend off the alien invasion?



Of course, the alien invasion scenario is barely credible. But then, so is climate catastrophism.



The issue then becomes how to judge what is ‘credible.’ It has been argued here that a useful criterion for a plausible (credible) worst-case climate outcome is that at most one borderline implausible assumption – defined as an assumption where experts disagree as to whether or not it is plausible – is included in developing the scenario.



[…]The largest rates of warming that are often cited in impact assessment analyses (e.g. 4.5 or 5 oC) rely on climate models being driven by a borderline implausible concentration/emission scenarios…Even the more moderate amount of warming of 3.1oC relies on climate models with values of the equilibrium climate sensitivity that are larger than can be defended based on analysis of historical climate change.



[…]The most extreme of the published worst-case scenarios require a cascade of events, each of which are extremely unlikely to borderline impossible based on our current knowledge base.



In other words, the science is **not** “crystal clear”. In fact, the catastrophist fantasies of idiot children and green politicians (tautology?) have no evidential basis whatsoever.



“Climate emergencies” are nonsense on the tallest, most rickety stilts imaginable.

Such declarations are based on the thesis that humans are causing potentially catastrophic changes in the global climate and that extremely large reductions in the more advanced countries’ emissions must be made within the next decade or two to “solve” this problem.The basis for such claims lies in the repeated statements of international organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and especially its Special Report 15 of October 2018.Unfortunately, climate change is a very complex issue. To understand it well, one must read a great deal about science, modelling, economics, and public policy. Few people have the time or patience to do that. For those who challenge the catastrophe thesis, the challenge is to tell a complex story in simple terms that people will understand. To that end, I here offer a set of counterpoints to the climate hysteria thesis.The Global SituationThe global climate is affected by both natural and human factors. On average, temperatures have been rising, but not at rates that demonstrate the likelihood of serious environmental damage.*There is no remotely compelling scientific evidence that extreme weather events have increased in frequency or intensity in post-industrial times.There is no remotely compelling scientific evidence that climate change has resulted in widespread species extinction.Sea levels are rising at the rate of 7-8 inches per century, a rate that has remained constant in spite of rising greenhouse gas emissions.From 1990 to 2016, carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from fuel combustion rose from 20.5 gigatonnes (Gt) to 32.3 Gt, a rise of 57 per cent.Today, emissions are not declining. In fact, carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 were 33.4 Gt compared to 30.0 Gt in 2007. So, emissions increased 11.3% over that period.Eighty-four per cent of the world’s primary energy needs are today provided by fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas).Important Emissions TrendsGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) declined at the rate of 123 megatonnes (Mt) per year over the period 2007 to 2016, or 0.8% per year. Meanwhile, the non-OECD countries increased their emissions during the same period at the rate of 417 Mt per year, or 2.9% annually. In other words, emissions growth in the developing countries is more than four times emissions reductions in the developed countries.In 2017, the non-OECD countries constituted 63% of global emissions, and the OECD countries constituted 37%. With every passing year, the non-OECD countries hold a larger share of the total.The Results of the Paris Conference (COP21) in 2015The COP21 Agreement imposed no legal obligation on the participating countries to reduce emissions and there are no penalties for failing to do so. The “commitments” countries made there were entirely political.If all countries honoured their commitments, global temperatures would be reduced in 2010 by 0.17 degrees C., compared to the notional target of avoiding a 2-degree C. increase.The United States has indicated that it will leave the agreement and few, if any, of the developing countries are adhering to their commitments.Neither China nor India committed to reduce emissions, only to eventually cap emissions intensity. By 2030, these two countries alone may have combined emissions of 23 Gt.IPCC Special Report 15This report stated that global greenhouse gas emissions must decline by 45 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and to zero by 2050, or else terrible things would happen.**A 45 per cent drop from current emission levels would take global emissions down to about 17 Gt. As China and India’s combined emissions by 2030 will exceed that total, the rest of the world (i.e. 195 countries) could reduce their emissions to zero and the IPCC goal still would not be met (i.e. this is impossible).Special Report 15 called for a global carbon tax of at least $880 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions; that exceeds the per capita annual average income of much of the developing world (i.e. such a tax is impossible).The report said that $2.4 trillion must be invested in non-fossil fuel energy every year from 2015 through 2035, an investment seven times current levels. The interest alone on that amount would be $200 billion per month – more than the whole world now spends on childhood education and environmental protection combined.The emissions reductions would be so disruptive of current lifestyles and so contrary to the choices people would make in free markets that they could be achieved only through massive government intervention and the widescale suspension of individual liberties.—–*Temperatures have risen since ~1860, but not at rates or range outside of previous warming cycles.**In fact the scientific report does not make catastrophic claims. The Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) and Headline summaries sound scary. Most commentators never read the scientific report, but rely on the SPM: https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/sr15_headline_statements.pdfRelated:No Climate Emergency:Faulty Premises=Poor Public Policy on Climate: Friends of Science Rebuttal to IPCC SR15https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Faulty-Premises-Poor-Public-Policy-on-Climate-Oct-30-2018-FINAL.pdf Faulty Premises – video:Futile FollyFutile Folly: Canada’s Climate Policy Goals in the Global ContextComposition of Global Emissionshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/11/17/the-composition-of-global-emissions/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) "
"In an effort to give back to his hometown community in Florida, Carol City, the   star Rick Ross decided to fulfill a childhood dream: He bought a Checkers   franchise. Why a Checkers? One reason seemed to rise above them all. “The No. 1 fries in the game,” Mr. Ross says in a   video released in December. The video shows Mr. Ross driving around town in his Ford truck, puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community, which is in the Miami area. At a certain point, Mr. Ross begins talking about the burger joint he frequented as a teenager, across the thoroughfare from the carwash where he worked. There was a McDonald’s that was closer, but Checkers, he says, was more affordable. “I made $30 a day from 8 in the morning to 8 at night,” Mr. Ross says. “I went to Checkers. ” Checkers does not typically pursue celebrity endorsements. But when Mr. Ross applied to purchase the Carol City franchise last summer, he seemed so genuine in his affection for the   chain that Checkers recognized a marketing opportunity as straightforward as a  . Still, it did not want a typical campaign. Scott Wakeman, director of marketing for Checkers   Restaurants Inc. and the company’s ad firm, Fitzgerald  Company in Atlanta, turned to the    digital media upstart Woven Digital. The firm has heavy traction among Mr. Ross’s primary audience  —   young men  —   on the entertainment sites that it owns, like Uproxx, Dime and BroBible. Woven has also specialized in   productions that, on the surface, do not feel like ads. To Mr. Wakeman, it seemed like a perfect way to take advantage of Mr. Ross’s charisma and authenticity. “It just felt like such a unique opportunity,” he said. The video, which is 3 minutes 31 seconds long, was filmed over two days in Carol City in late September, mostly as Mr. Ross drove his truck around. Spliced in is footage of pickup basketball games and bikers popping wheelies. The first mention of Checkers comes about halfway through the video. Checkers invests the bulk of its annual marketing budget, about $20 million, in standard television spots, Mr. Wakeman said. By contrast, the Rick Ross ad has been distributed only on social media channels and Uproxx. But Mr. Wakeman said he believed the unusual authenticity of the video  —   and the compelling way Mr. Ross related his story  —   would resonate with viewers more than anything Checkers had tried in the past. “We don’t think of it as an advertisement,” Mr. Wakeman said, adding of Mr. Ross, “We wanted to create a piece of content that captured his love for the brand. ” Last year, Woven teamed up with MillerCoors on a series of short documentary videos that profiled entrepreneurs with expertise in making items like watches and surfboards, or, in one case, doing calligraphy. The   series, sponsored by Coors Banquet beer and run across Uproxx, was intended to reach an audience that has become adept at avoiding traditional advertising. According to Brad Feinberg, senior director of media and digital marketing for MillerCoors, it was a success, receiving more than 33 million views. “This is content that people want to see they’re intrigued by it, they seek it out,” Mr. Feinberg said. “And putting it in long form is something you can do in the digital space that is very cost prohibitive in other places. ”   storytelling might sound incompatible with the   attention spans of millennials, but it can have its advantages. Young men in particular have demonstrated a willingness to sit through longer pieces of content if it aligns with their values and gives them something of value in return, said Leah Swartz, senior content specialist for FutureCast, a part of the Barkley agency of Kansas City, Mo. that focuses on research into millennials. Her team considers this a rewriting of the old ABCs of sales. Rather than the mantra “always be closing,” brands must now think about how they can “always be helping. ” “You have to think about helping your consumer, what you’re providing, what benefits you’re giving, how you’re making their lives more fulfilled,” Ms. Swartz said. For Checkers, turning a story about a hit rapper’s upbringing into a selling point for hamburgers and chicken wings was a bit of a gamble, Mr. Wakeman said. In the video, there are only a couple of references to Checkers’ products, such as Mr. Ross’s unequivocal praise of the French fries. But Mr. Wakeman said the documentary format allowed Mr. Ross’s true voice to shine through. “Food and value are our two big brand pillars, and I think they come through in the spot, in a cool way,” Mr. Wakeman said. “It wasn’t a script. It was just Rick talking about what he loves” about the place. The video also captures moments of spontaneity. The producers originally intended just to film Mr. Ross outside the Checkers, but on the way there, he sent out a message on Instagram offering free burgers to any fans who wanted to meet him in Carol City. About 200 people showed up, and the cameras rolled as he shook hands and ripped open bags of food. Benjamin Blank, the chief executive of Woven, said the company was not trying to conceal that the video was an advertisement. But he said he thought the content itself was meaningful and captivating enough that   viewers ultimately would not mind being sold to. “There were plenty of things Rick could have gotten involved with from a business standpoint,” Mr. Blank said. “But his reason for getting involved with Checkers was a great story. ”"
" How Tax-subsidized, Foreign-funded ENGOs Impact the Canadian Economy“Big Oil’s problem isn’t international philanthropy – it’s a changing market in the face of climate change.” Jessica Clogg, WCEL“We celebrated a great victory this year when our clients overturned the federal approval for the Northern Gateway pipelines and tankers project…”Jessica Clogg, Executive Director and Senior Counsel, West Coast Environmental Law Foreign philanthropies have dumped millions of dollars into environmental groups which in turn have had exceptional influence on Canada’s climate and energy policies.Read “Manufacturing a Climate Crisis” LINK: Manufacturing A Climate Crisis FINAL  West Coast Environmental Law (WCEL) – one of the foreign funded environmental groups – says it is ‘fighting back’ with a blog post by WCEL Executive Director and Senior Counsel, Jessica Clogg, claiming that it’s just ‘fear-mongering’ to say that foreign cross-border funding to ENGOs had any impact on Canada’s economy or pipeline construction.In Ms. Clogg’s blog, she claims that it’s okay for ENGOs to be foreign-funded because the oil and gas business has foreign investment, too.That’s faulty logic-a false equivalency. The foreign investment in oil, gas, mineral resource or forestry drives the economy. Jobs are created, taxes are paid, arts groups and social charities receive support, employee teams often volunteer to fill the coffers of good causes like the United Way. The company pays money for services, the company and its people pay taxes – in return the economy thrives.According to Bloomberg as quoted in the Financial Post, the total stock of accumulated foreign investment in Canada at the end of 2017, including debt, was $704 billion. However, the total stock in the oil and gas industry was $120 billion, having fallen by $16.6 billion, or 12.2 %, in 2017, the largest decrease in 17 years.The National Energy Board publishes annual data on total investment (i.e. domestic and foreign) in the upstream oil industry. Annual investment in 2017 was $40.9 billion, up from $34.9 billion in 2016. Investment in oil sands was $13.6 billion, down 60% from the peak level of annual investment of $33.4 billion in 2014.On Jan. 20, 2019, CBC’s Wendy Mesley finally aired a story on foreign-funding of Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations (ENGOs).  In response to this and a flurry of related media coverage, Jessica Clogg, Executive Director and Senior Counsel of West Coast Environmental Law posted a blog in which she said:“It’s no secret that funders from outside of Canada are contributing to the work of Canadian environmental organizations. The real question is – so what?” – Jessica Clogg, WCEL blog post Jan. 30, 2019With three major approved pipeline projects blocked by foreign-funded ENGOs thousands of unemployed, taxpaying Canadians want answers.

"**The number of officers patrolling French beaches will double from next week to help stop migrants crossing the Channel, the UK's home secretary has announced.**
It is part of further measures Priti Patel agreed in a meeting with her French counterpart on Saturday.
Officers will be aided by ""enhanced"" surveillance, such as drones and radar, to find smugglers and migrants.
Thousands of migrants have reached the UK in small boats this year.
The Home Office said 59 people on four boats crossed the Channel on Friday.
Ms Patel said that due to increased French patrols and intelligence sharing ""we are already seeing fewer migrants leaving French beaches"".
""The action we have agreed jointly today goes further, doubling the number of police officers on the ground in France, increasing surveillance and introducing new cutting edge technology, representing a further step forward in our shared mission to make Channel crossings completely unviable,"" she said.
In announcing the French patrols, the Home Office did not say how many more officers would be deployed.
Ms Patel also said there would be ""a new asylum system"" that is ""firm and fair"" and promised there would be new legislation for that next year.
But Saturday's announcement was criticised by Bella Sankey, director of humanitarian charity Detention Action.
""It is an extraordinary mark of failure that the home secretary is announcing with such fanfare that she is rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic,"" she said.
""No amount of massaging the numbers masks her refusal to take the sensible step of creating a safe and legal route to the UK from northern France, thereby preventing crossings and child deaths.
""Instead she throws taxpayers' money away on more of the same measures that stand no chance of having a significant impact on this dangerous state of affairs.""
According to figures collated by the BBC about 8,000 migrants in small boats have been taken into the care of Border Force officials, having reached UK shores or been intercepted in the Channel.
That is despite Ms Patel's vow in 2019 to make such journeys an ""infrequent phenomenon"".
**Analysis: Simon Jones, BBC News**
There have been a number of deals between Britain and France over the past couple of years to try to bring a halt to these crossings. On each occasion, the two countries pledged to work more closely than ever to tackle the issue.
But the number of migrants reaching the UK has continued to rise. The home secretary has been facing calls, not least from her fellow Conservative MPs, to get a grip of the issue.
Now she's had to put her hands in her pockets to provide more resources for the French. There will now be real pressure on them to deliver results.
In October a Kurdish-Iranian family of five died attempting to cross the Channel. The small boat they were heading to the UK in capsized in rough conditions just a few kilometres into its journey.
There have been nearly 300 border-related deaths in and around the Channel since 1999, according to a recent report by Mael Galisson, from Gisti, a legal service for asylum seekers in France.
At Saturday's meeting, Ms Patel and French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin also agreed on steps to better support migrants arriving in France to find appropriate accommodation ""in order to take them out of the hands of criminal gangs"".
They agreed on measures to increase border security at ports in northern and western France to target smugglers and avoid migrant crossings threatening freight traffic.
Co-operation between French and UK law enforcement had already stopped about 1,100 migrants from making the dangerous crossing and led to 140 arrests since July, the Home Office said."

Cooling August trends and stunningly early snows in Europe contradict global catastrophist warming claims.
Recently we heard reports of the earliest snowfall in Greta Thunberg’s Sweden in 20 years, and “stunning” snowfall in Norway. So it’s been strange to hear during these hysterical days of Fridays for Future (FFF) how snowfall is supposed to disappear even in the dead of winter.
Yet, Sweden’s and Norway’s early snowfall really should not come as a surprise when we look at the temperature trends for late summer in Sweden and elsewhere. The data are telling us that the opposite is happening: In reality autumn seems to be arriving earlier in Scandinavia.
Fall arriving sooner in Scandinavia
Using the untampered data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) from the 6 Swedish stations that offer close to complete datasets, we see that August has been seeing a late summer cooling trend across the Nordic country:

Six stations in Sweden show a cooling trend for August since 1995. Data: JMA
And when we look at the untampered data at stations in Europe, we find that there has not been any warming over the past recent decades.
Some people are just not being honest.
No warming Norway in August
Looking at August mean temperatures in other countries in Europe, we see the same similar trends. Let’s look at Norway. Plotted are 11 stations where the JMA data are near complete, since 1996:

Data source: JMA.
In Norway we find that a majority of the stations show cooling or steady temps for August. These results defy the spectacularly hyped statements we often hear from the Fridays for Future Fanatics (FFFF).

No real August trend in Portugal
Next we look at the Atlantic coastal country of Portugal. Here I’ve plotted the 5 stations that have near complete data, going back to 1997:

Data source: JMA.
In Portugal, some stations have warmed while others have cooled. In total, there’s been no statistically significant trend.
30 years of August cooling in Belgium
In Uccle in Belgium, the mean monthly temperature for August 2019 was 19.2℃. Here we observe that there’s been no warming trend for August since 1989.

The hottest August in Uccle, Belgium was back in 1997 with 21.2℃. The trend there is clearly one of cooling. Data source: JMA. 
Luxembourg cooling
Finally we look at a station Belgium’s tiny neighbor of Luxembourg: Here the mean monthly temperature for August 2019 was 19.5℃, and so there has been no warming since 1990 for August
 
Data source: JMA.
Though the globe has warmed over the 20th century, and it may be warming a bit this century, the data show us none of it resembles the scary, panic-fanning tales we’ve been hearing from the hysterical FFF crowd.
Even the Australians will agree.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Many eyes will be on President Obama’s State of the Union address tonight watching to see how he follows his inauguration promise to “respond to the threat of climate change.” Rumors are flying that he will use his executive power to bypass Congress and further EPA efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. But his best response would be to get the federal government out of the energy market and allow it to flourish as it may. The inconvenient truth is that the U.S. influence on global climate is rapidly diminishing as greenhouse gas emissions from the rest of the world rapidly expand. As a consequence, whether or not the United States reduces its emissions at all is immaterial to the path of future climate change and its impacts.   
  
Several reports last week have shown that carbon dioxide emissions from the United States declined in 2012 and now stand at a level on par with what they were back in 1994. U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have dropped about 13 percent from their high in 2007.   
  
All the while, global carbon dioxide emissions have been on the rise—primarily fueled by rapid emissions growth in developing countries, namely China (which is responsible for about two-thirds of the global increase during the past decade).   
  
[caption align=""center""]  




Figure 1. Emissions of carbon dioxide from the U.S., China, and the rest of the world, 1990-2010 (data from U.S. Energy Informat[/caption]   
  
Since carbon dioxide is well-mixed in the atmosphere, who actually emits it is of little consequence when it comes to its potential to lead to global warming. This means that the global percentage of a country’s annual carbon dioxide emissions is equivalent to its annual percentage contribution to the increased warming pressure (we use the term “warming pressure” to indicate that things other than the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases also act to influence that global average temperature from one year to the next). Since total global carbon dioxide emissions are quickly distancing themselves from U.S. emissions, as time passes, the relative influence of U.S. emissions on the future state of the global climate is rapidly declining.   




We recently showed that the United States will be responsible for only about two-tenths of a degree Celsius of total global warming by the end of this century, or about 7 percent of the total projected warming—an amount hardly worth worrying about. The rest of the world will be responsible for the other 93 percent.   
  
So when the president promises to “respond to the threat of climate change,” domestic actions will have virtually no impact—and yet those are the ones that are being put on the table with proposals like cap and trade, carbon taxes, emissions limits on new power plants, and actions like fuel economy standards, renewable energy subsidies, ethanol requirements, etc. (We purposely left Keystone XL pipeline off this list because it will have no significant effect on U.S carbon emissions).   
  
What the president really hopes to achieve by trying to force down U.S. emissions is not direct climate change mitigation, but one or more of the following: to gain some bargaining power at international talks to address climate change; that other countries will follow the United States' lead; or that new, lower emitting energy technologies will be developed and rapidly and safely deployed around the world.   
  
There is no guarantee of these outcomes. For instance, developing countries may find it to be more in their interest to energize their economies and their citizenry through low cost and proven methods (i.e., fossil fuels) than submit to a we’ve-got-ours-but-now-you-can’t-have-yours dictate. Or new, low-emitting energy technologies may be developed without the extra incentives.   
  
But in any case, the United States receives no direct climate benefits until, or unless, the rest of the world makes sizeable greenhouse gas emissions reductions.   
  
It seems rather bizarre that our own president would support actions aimed at holding Americans hostage to limited energy choices (and quite probably higher energy prices) while hoping that the rest of the world will come to our rescue in the form of reducing carbon dioxide emissions such that future global climate change is reduced to a degree as to result in a significant and detectable mitigation of weather/climate impacts in the United States.   
  
Rather than this wait and hope attitude, the president ought to take steps to encourage actions that would enable us to better fend for ourselves no matter what happens— actions aimed towards expanding our energy resources, growing our wealth and improving our resilience to what lies ahead. This path is paved with less government interference, not more.

Global warming alarmists like to tell us the planet is warming faster and faster.
Yet, when we look objectively at the untampered data, we see this is not the case at all at many locations.  Today we look at the (untampered) data from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA) for some stations across northern Europe for the month of October.
According to global warming believers, winter is supposed to be coming later, and spring arriving earlier. So looking at the season transition month of October is interesting.
Ireland
At the JMA we find seven stations in Ireland that have October data going back sufficiently to 1994:

Data source: JMA
As the chart above shows, 6 of 7 stations in Ireland show October temperatures have a COOLING trend since 1994. How can winter be possibly coming later?
Finland
Next we have October data from the Scandinavian country of Finland, near the Arctic, where it’s supposedly warming rapidly and a it is the climate canary in a coal mine.

Data source: JMA
In Finland we have data from 6 stations, and they clearly show that there has not been any real warming at all over the past quarter century.
Isn’t it puzzling that we continue to hear reports from alarmists from every direction that the warming is speeding up? It stinks like some cynical Communist-grade propaganda, doesn’t it?

With all the fakes news we’ve been witnessing lately, nothing should surprise us anymore. We certainly need to be careful when it comes to believing these now infamously dubious media sources.
Norway
Next we move on to Scandinavian Norway, which is situated next to the North Atlantic, and so there oceanic cycles would have a truly profound effect.

(Note: I didn’t include stations which don’t have the data from 20 century.) Data source: JMA
Lo and behold: Six of 11 stations in Norway show October temperatures have had no warming trend since 1999.
Sweden
And not surprisingly, the story is the same in Sweden.
Here the 6 stations with sufficient JMA data were examined, and here as well there’s been no real warming to speak of since 1995.

Data source: JMA here. 
Four of the 6 stations in Sweden show October temperatures have had no warming trend since 1995.
Where’s the climate emergency that hysterical alarmists are pushing to declare? There hasn’t been any since the IPCC issued it’s 2nd assessment report – a quarter of a century ago!
When are they going to finally stop this sham? This is all as bogus as the Trump impeachment proceedings – based on nothing except made-up rumors.
It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the same people who produced the phony Russia dossiers also would not think twice about producing a fake climate warming dossier.

Pop quiz. Who wrote this:



“There is medium evidence and high agreement that long‐​term trends in normalized losses have not been attributed to natural or anthropogenic climate change”?



Well, it’s obviously “a”, and not likely to be “b”, as Charles Koch writes very clearly. Nor would such a poorly constructed sentence have gotten by the Cato editors (“c”).



Which leaves “d.” That’s right, it’s in a recent report on “climate extremes” from our pals at the UN. Of course they couldn’t come right out and say it, so it’s up to others to translate to common English: any trends in weather‐​related losses are not related to dreaded global warming.





The current National Assessment is an incredible exaggeration of the effects of climate change on the United States.



But that hasn’t stopped the $3.5 billion per year U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). Instead, their draft “National Assessment” of climate change in the United States flogs more “extreme” climate in just about every one of the 30 chapters in this 1200‐​page doorstop.



The USGCRP is just about every organization that consumes an oodle of the multibillion dollar pie. It therefore considers its pronouncements to be the consensus of climate scientists.



So does the IPCC. They can’t both be right.



One thing that’s apparent in the new Assessment is that federal funding is awarded preferentially to those who thrive in a data‐​free environment. Weather‐​related damages are not increasing, as percentage of GDP. When you produce more stuff (increasing GDP), there’s more stuff to get hit by bad weather.





The “Transportation” chapter of this climate horror picture show asserts that pernicious climate change is “reducing the reliability and capacity of the U.S. transportation system”. Really? But, here is reality:





Does this look like reduction in capacity?





Does this?



Or is this related to global warming?





The fact of the matter is the vast balance of evidence is that the current National Assessment is an incredible exaggeration of the effects of climate change on the United States.



So why was it done?



Consider the “mission statement” of the USGCRP: “Thirteen Agencies, One Mission: Empower the Nation with Global Change Science”.



The operative word is “empower,” which is the purpose of the Assessment. It is to provide cover for a massive regulatory intrusion, and concomitant enormous costs in resources and individual liberty. History tells us that when scientists willingly endorse sweeping governmental agendas fueled by dodgy science, bad things soon happen.

Summary: Amidst the gloom that blankets America, there is evidence that a discontinuity in history approaches – a technological singularity. It could blow away many of today’s problems. Let this help dispel our fears and give us cause to celebrate. In the New Year, we can begin to prepare for what is coming.
“Everything that can be invented has been invented.”
— Attributed to Charles H. Duell, Director of US Patent Office 1898-1901. The quote is as false as the idea it expresses.

Wonders might await us that we cannot even imagine, just as the people of 1850 could not imagine the world of 1950. The rate of economic growth will accelerate, bringing more security and prosperity to the world. Pollution as we know it will be almost gone by 2100. The world will become a garden again as the population crashes. In the 22nd century we can repair the damage done in the 21st as the world’s population grew to 10 or 12 billion. Our next big challenge will be managing the political and social disruptions created by the coming new technologies.
Humanity rose by creating singularities
History, from the Serengeti Plains to the Apollo moon landings, is a series of singularities. Fire gave us power over the environment. Agriculture gave us control over our food supply. Writing allowed better accumulation of knowledge across generations. The industrial revolutionn broke us free from the Malthusian limits on our population and wealth.
Each singularity took us into an unknowable future. For a fun illustration of this see “Early Holocene Sci-fi” by Pat Mathews.
Shaman:  I have foreseen a time when everybody can have all the meat, fat, and sweet stuff they can eat, and they all get fat.
Chief:        You have had a vision of the Happy Hunting Grounds.
Shaman:  It is considered a great and horrible problem! People go out of their way to eat leaves and grass and grains, and work very hard to look lean and brown.
Chief:        You’ve been eating too many of those strange mushrooms, and are seeing everything backward.

The singularity that just ended
“The Singularity has happened. We call it ‘the industrial revolution’ or ‘the long nineteenth century.’ It was over by the close of 1918. Exponential yet basically unpredictable growth of technology, rendering long-term extrapolation impossible (even when attempted by geniuses). Check. Massive, profoundly dis-orienting transformation in the life of humanity, extending to our ecology, mentality and social organization? Check. Annihilation of the age-old constraints of space and time? Check.”
— “The Singularity in Our Past Light-Cone” by Cosma Shalizi (Assoc. Prof of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon).
Industrial revolutions do not just solve problems. They make them irrelevant – to be replaced by the problems of a more stable and prosperous world. Each is a leap forward followed by a period of consolidation.
An industrial revolution began in 1700 (to pick an arbitrary date) and ended with WWII. Its momentum boosted per capita GDP in the developed nations through the 1960s. Few noticed it ending. Even in the 1960’s people expected a future of rapid technological progress. But all we got was the manned space program (an expensive trip to nowhere) and the supersonic transport (a premature technology), and radical but narrow changes in communication and computers.
Few predicted this slowdown. One who did was the great physicist Albert Abraham Michelson in Lights waves and their uses (1902). People laughed, but time has shown it as more right than wrong.
“The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all been discovered, and these are so firmly established that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedingly remote. …Many instances might be cited, but these will suffice to justify the statement that ‘our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place of decimals.’”
Now the slowing is obvious. The productivity of research – the engine of progress – is slowing as ever more resources are devoted to it (see this NBER paper). See this dismal graph from “Are ideas getting harder to find?“, a 2017 NBER paper by Nicholas Bloom et al. More evidence: growth in total factor productivity peaked in the 1940s, despite the skyrocketing number of researchers. We press the gas pedal ever harder, but the car does not accelerate.

Looking at the bottom line, US economic growth has been slowing since the 1970s, as has that of the other developed nations. Many books describe this, such as these.

The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better by economist Tyler Cowen (2011).
The End of Growth: Adapting to Our New Economic Reality by journalist Richard Heinberg (2011).

A new singularity looms ahead

Available at Amazon.
Each year gives more evidence that a singularity lies in our near future, a discontinuity in history that ends our current tech stagnation. We can only guess at what it might bring.
Space travel can bring a vast increase in resources. In the distant future, planetary engineering might make us independent of Earth’s vicissitudes.
Genetic engineering can liberate humanity from random evolution, bringing the freedom to shape ourselves.
New energy sources, such as fusion can provide ample clean power for a growing world. It has reached a new milestone, as private capital moves in.
New industrial methods are coming. Such as learning the mysteries of catalytic chemistry. Our bodies do near-miraculous chemical processes at room temperature. This will also transform agriculture into a more eco-friendly cornucopia.
Semi-intelligent computers (aka “artificial Intelligence”) can supplement our minds, just as machines supplemented brawn – boosting productivity and hence economic growth. In the more distant future, perhaps they will end our solitude and free us from limitations of biological intelligence.
A longer vital lifespan can change humanity in ways we cannot imagine. In George Bernard Shaw’s Back to Methuselah, longer vital lifespans are the key to a better society (people of the future see the past as a wreck because everything was run by “children”). Vital life is key, to avoid becoming Struldbruggs – the senile, decrepit immortals in Gulliver’s Travels.
These are only plausible innovations. Who knows what we might achieve in the future?
What is a singularity?
There are many different concepts of a singularity, some contradictory. A key aspect is that we cannot see through a singularity in the physical universe (e.g., a black hole). Its first mention was by the great John von Neumann (1903-57), paraphrased by Stanislaw Ulam (BAMS, 1958).
“One conversation centered on the ever-accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.”
The public learned about it from Vernor Vinge’s 1986 book Marooned in Realtime, which described a wondrous future in which the rate of technological progress accelerates – eventually going vertical – after which the humanity leaves for a higher plane of existence. He gave a more detailed explanation in his 1993 essay, “The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era.”
There are several kinds of technological singularity, described in this excerpt from “Three Major Singularity Schools” by AI researcher Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.
“Singularity discussions seem to be splitting up into three major schools of thought: Accelerating Change, the Event Horizon, and the Intelligence Explosion. The thing about these three logically distinct schools of Singularity thought is that while all three core claims support each other, all three strong claims tend to contradict each other.
Accelerating Change.
“Core claim: Our intuitions about change are linear; we expect roughly as much change as has occurred in the past over our own lifetimes. But technological change feeds on itself, and therefore accelerates. Change today is faster than it was 500 years ago, which in turn is faster than it was 5000 years ago. Our recent past is not a reliable guide to how much change we should expect in the future.
“Strong claim: Technological change follows smooth curves, typically exponential. Therefore we can predict with fair precision when new technologies will arrive, and when they will cross key thresholds, like the creation of Artificial Intelligence.
“Advocates: Ray Kurzweil, Alvin Toffler (?), John Smart.
Event Horizon.
“Core claim: For the last hundred thousand years, humans have been the smartest intelligences on the planet. All our social and technological progress was produced by human brains. Shortly, technology will advance to the point of improving on human intelligence (brain-computer interfaces, Artificial Intelligence). This will create a future that is weirder by far than most science fiction, a difference-in-kind that goes beyond amazing shiny gadgets.
“Strong claim: To know what a superhuman intelligence would do, you would have to be at least that smart yourself. To know where Deep Blue would play in a chess game, you must play at Deep Blue’s level. Thus the future after the creation of smarter-than-human intelligence is absolutely unpredictable.
“Advocates: Vernor Vinge.
Intelligence Explosion.
“Core claim: Intelligence has always been the source of technology. If technology can significantly improve on human intelligence – create minds smarter than the smartest existing humans – then this closes the loop and creates a positive feedback cycle. What would humans with brain-computer interfaces do with their augmented intelligence? One good bet is that they’d design the next generation of brain-computer interfaces. Intelligence enhancement is a classic tipping point; the smarter you get, the more intelligence you can apply to making yourself even smarter.
“Strong claim: This positive feedback cycle goes FOOM, like a chain of nuclear fissions gone critical – each intelligence improvement triggering an average of>1.000 further improvements of similar magnitude – though not necessarily on a smooth exponential pathway. Technological progress drops into the characteristic timescale of transistors (or super-transistors) rather than human neurons. The ascent rapidly surges upward and creates superintelligence (minds orders of magnitude more powerful than human) before it hits physical limits.
“Advocates: I. J. Good, Eliezer Yudkowsky.”
Prepare for the future
Why are so many so gloomy about our future? We have survived ice ages, pandemics, natural disasters (e.g., the eruption of Toba, which exterminated most of humanity), and our own mistakes. Our history gives us good reason to look to the future with anticipation, not fear. Remember that as our elites attempt to lead us by arousing fears. Do not fear the future. Have faith in America.

"**When a migrant rescue team found two wedding rings in a backpack floating in the Mediterranean, they feared the owners were dead.**
Covered in tiny sea creatures, the bag was on a half-sunken boat that had capsized weeks before, killing five people.
But they shared images of the belongings with aid workers in Italy, who started asking around.
To their surprise, they found the owners, a young couple from Algeria.
Now the pair, whose names Ahmed and Doudou are inscribed on the rings, are set to be reunited with the possessions they thought they had lost forever.
""When I shared the photo I never thought that I would find the person the bag belonged to,"" Ahmad Al Rousan, a cultural mediator for medical charity MSF in Italy, told the BBC.
""At the same time, I was thinking it was probably someone who had died in the Mediterranean.""
Mr Al Rousan was part of the team that provided psychological support to Ahmed and Doudou and 13 others after their boat capsized off the island of Lampedusa on 21 October.
The couple, thought to be in their early 20s, had been living in Libya but felt forced to make the perilous journey to Europe as the country became increasingly dangerous.
Forty-eight hours into the crossing their boat went down. Five people died, including an 18-month-old girl.
Ahmed and Doudou, whose full identities are not being released, were rescued by fishermen. They were then moved to a reception centre in Sicily, where they were shown photos taken by the NGO Open Arms Italy of the bag and other belongings.
""I spoke with Ahmed directly and he started to explain about the rings and why they were in the bag,"" said Mr Al Rousan. The rings were broken and the couple had hoped to get them repaired in Europe, he said.
""Ahmed was really emotional. He was happy to find the rings as they are something very personal. But he could not get from his mind the whole incident and the five people who had died.""
Mr Al Rousan says that when Open Arms Italy approached him about showing people the photo, he told them he thought it would be ""impossible"" to find the owners.
He is often tasked with helping family members find the bodies of loved ones, so tracing the items to Ahmed and his wife instead was ""a very nice feeling"".
But the couple are said to still be in shock from the incident. On the same trip, a nine-year-old girl lost her mother and sister, according to MSF.
The backpack containing their rings is still onboard the Open Arms ship, off the coast of Sicily. The team reportedly plan to give them back once they leave Covid quarantine.
""We washed everything in the backpack onboard, including clothes and T-shirts,"" Riccardo Gatti, the president of the NGO Open Arms in Italy, told the Guardian.
""We can't wait to deliver it to Ahmed and Doudou. It was a strong emotion for us too.
""It's not just about objects. These bags that we often find are all these people have. Like these rings, a symbol of a love that fortunately, at least this time, the Mediterranean has spared.""

U.S.—Millions of Americans have repented of their sinful ways and turned to Jesus after hearing that Democrats are going to be on CNN for seven whole hours talking about climate change next week.
Whole cities, towns, and states accepted Christ as their savior as they saw God’s judgment coming on the nation in the form of Democrats going on and on about climate change for hours.
“Please Lord—do not leave Your people to suffer,” one man prayed, prostrate on the ground, sweating blood from his despair. “Why have you forsaken us? ‘Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever. Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?‘”
“I’m sorry for everything I’ve ever done,” cried one Seattle woman, who was an atheist until she heard about the town hall and repented of her sins. “I have strayed far from you, Lord, but I now commit my life to you if you’ll just promise to return before Wednesday.”
“We know, O Lord, that you can save us from having to hear rich white guys with multiple homes lecture us on conserving energy,” said a man named Daniel in Iowa. “But even if You do not, you are still Lord.”
“But seriously, please, save us.”

" By Michelle Stirling ©2019Originally submitted as a rebuttal to the Calgary Herald.Dr. Vipond and Noel Keough wrote a compelling op-ed in the Calgary Herald, published Dec. 29, 2018, to end 2018 on a high note of climate hyperbole.  They talk a doomsday scenario on climate change which is straight from the Book of Revelations, tying floods, wildfires, and hurricanes to the use of fossil fuels and human-caused global warming.As atmospheric scientist Dr. Judith Curry testified to the US Senate in 2014, “This premise is not strongly supported by the scientific evidence:  the science of climate change is not settled, and evidence reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 weakens the case for human factors dominating climate change in the 20th and early 21st centuries.”Curry goes on to explain that, “…  with the 15+ year hiatus in global warming [now some 20 years], there is growing appreciation for the importance of natural climate variability;  IPCC AR5 and SREX [Special Report on Extreme Weather] find little evidence that supports an increase in most extreme weather events that can be attributed to humans, and weather extremes in the U.S. were generally worse in the 1930’s and 1950’s than in recent decades.”Canadian climate scientist, Dr. Madhav Khandekar, past IPCC expert reviewer, World Meteorological Organization regional expert, former Environment Canada researcher, has studied extreme weather events extensively.  He concludes that extreme events are an integral part of climate and unrelated to the use of oil, gas and coal or carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. He notes that there are more uncertainties in the greenhouse gas theory of climate change today, than in 2000 when he wrote this report for the Alberta government.Climate policy analyst, Dr. Roger Pielke, Jr. has written two very thoughtful pieces on climate change.  “Misdefining ‘‘climate change’’: consequences for science and action” (2005) discusses confusion over the political definition of climate change and the scientific definition.  When people are talking climate catastrophe – they are referring to the political, not the scientific definition.A second commentary, “Opening up the policy envelope,” provides insight and perspective on IPCC reports that use the wildest, least likely scenario (known as RCP8.5) to arrive at catastrophic claims and improbable ‘solutions.’Oddly, Dr. Vipond and Keough push for rapid decarbonization – a policy that Prof. Kelly of Cambridge states would cause mass deaths. Belgian philosopher and jurist Drieu Godefridi warns that people should be wary of climate catastrophists and their humanicidal tendencies. Meantime, climate scientists around the world continue to find that carbon dioxide has ‘low climate sensitivity’ – meaning even a lot of carbon dioxide emissions from use of oil, gas or coal, results in a very nominal warming effect.So, where does the climate ‘crisis’ come from?  Matthew Nisbet has revealed that billionaire foundations with vested interests in “Big Climate” have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations (ENGO) worldwide. They hope to establish a global cap and trade system. For that you need willing victims for this Ponzi scheme and a price on carbon. Why a price on carbon? So that the Renewable Energy Certificates generated by the wind and solar plants become like printing money from hot air – the only trouble is, that money comes from the pockets of citizens, never to be seen again. But scare them enough…they’ll give in.These transnational, unelected, unaccountable organizations, like the UNPRI and CDP Worldwide are climate-obsessed and employ ‘climate crisis’ as a means of gaining compliance for GHG reporting from corporations, as well as carbon pricing/cap and trade policies from governments. Citizens are not consulted – but they don’t want to live in energy poverty! Witness the Yellow Vests protesting across France.While Dr. Vipond and Noel Keough spend much of their time demonizing Alberta oil and Albertans, they appear to have no geopolitical perspective – that our main competitor nations – the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, are busy selling product worldwide, unhindered by pipeline Blockadia or absurd climate policies at home or abroad.Meanwhile, our competitors laugh all the way to the bank; vulture investors snap up divested and demarketed Canadian fossil fuel shares, while we gnash our teeth in impotent, carbon-duped rage. Canadians are already paying a carbon tax equivalent of $170/t on fuel; the US pays zero carbon tax and the world average is $8/t.As Dr. Curry has testified, carbon dioxide is not a control knob that can fine tune climate, so there is no scientific or economic justification for a carbon tax or fossil fuel phase-out.  Destroying Alberta’s economy and making people poor will not save the planet. Limited public funds can be better spent adapting to changes in climate and being prepared for inevitable wildfires, floods and storms.Another good use of some public funds would be a special budget applied to evicting the foreign-funded Green Trade Warriors running rampant in Canada.Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society.

Hazy, with a 100 percent chance of nothing. That’s the confident forecast we can make concerning exactly how much effect Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s newly re‐​established climate commission will have on climate change.



Let’s start with the temperature. The governor tells us that “Virginia has the opportunity” to be a leader in “finding creative ways to mitigate climate change in the future”



If Virginia’s carbon dioxide emissions went to zero today, the amount of global warming that would be prevented by the year 2100 would be somewhere around 3 one‐​thousandths of a degree Celsius. That’s using the EPA’s own model for calculating the effects of various global warming policies. Specifically, that would be the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse‐​Gas Induced Climate Change and, yes, Virginia, the acronym for it is MAGICC.





Unfortunately, the amount that Virginia can ‘mitigate’ climate change is none.



Unfortunately, the amount that Virginia can “mitigate” climate change is none.



MAGICC further shows that even if the entire United States cut its emissions to zero, the warming saved is 0.14°C, an amount that is also too small to measure reliably.



But the assumptions used in MAGICC are already invalid. It assumes that the “sensitivity,” which is the total warming that eventuates from a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of this trace gas, is 3°C.



Not to throw cold water on Mr. McAuliffe’s parade, but the observed warming of the planet has been so far off from that forecast, that the entire 107‐​member ensemble of climate models used by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has flopped.



That’s in part due to the well‐​known (and not very well‐​understood) “pause” in surface temperature warming, which is now in its 18th year, using annual temperatures from the global temperature history from the University of East Anglia. That’s the one scientists feel is most reliable. Using annual satellite data, we are now in our 22nd year without a warming trend, but the satellites are actually measuring temperature above the surface.



When asked to simulate the change in surface temperature beginning in 1950, the UN models start to fail, at the 95 percent confidence level, about 37 years ago, which isn’t exactly surprising, given the lack of warming in the past two decades. Perhaps even worse, the observed warming trend for every period back to 1950 is lower than the predicted trend.



Now, Mr. McAuliffe is spot‐​on when he talks about “adaptation” to climate change. People in Virginia’s cities have been doing this for decades, where local warming is generally around ten times what has been observed globally. In fact, we’ve been doing it nationally without any particular effort and without the dictates of some climate commissioner.



That warming has little if anything to do with changing atmospheric carbon dioxide and pretty much everything to do with the fact that, as cities grow, they tend to retain the heat of the day in their bricks, buildings, and pavement. So, everything else being equal, (dangerous words in the climate business), urban heat waves should be a bit more frequent.



Death statistics from American cities show that the more frequent heat waves become, the _fewer_ people die from them. That’s “adaptation.”



Finally there are dreaded changes in sea level. The sinking of Tidewater Virginia is as responsible for sea level rise as is global temperature change. There’s no climate commission that can stop that.



But there are adaptations that can happen — like not building back into areas that get naturally inundated by strong or large hurricanes, unless the homeowner assumes 100 percent of the cost of flood insurance. Today, the public picks up over half the cost. As a consequence, pretty much every home that went down in Virginia’s last big storm — 2003’s Hurricane Isabel — has been rebuilt, and will be knocked down again by the next whopper.



If the climate commission will come down hard on subsidizing vacation homes in flood‐​prone regions, they will actually accomplish something. But there is simply nothing the commission can recommend that will do anything about global temperature or sea‐​level rise.
