Whenever the hurricane season in the Caribbean begins, the whole world and the German Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) wait for a strong storm, as it presents the ideal opportunity to sell climate change, as was the case in September 2017 when Potsdam’s Neueste Nachrichten (PNN) daily reported with reference to the PIK’s Anders Levermann:
Global warming provides energy for stronger tropical storms
According to Potsdam climate researchers, the impact of the current tropical cyclones can be attributed to climate change. Burning coal, oil and gas increases the temperature of the planet and thus provides energy for ever stronger tropical storms, explained Anders Levermann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). “Unfortunately, physics here is very clear: hurricanes draw their destructive energy from the warmth of the ocean. The water temperatures in the region are too high. Climate change does not cause these storms, but it can “make their consequences worse.”
Will the intensity of hurricanes increase with climate change? Can this be detected today, as Levermann concludes so trivially? This is not the case, say researchers around Lory Trenary from George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. They investigated climate models and re-analyses and found no connection with the drive by greenhouse gases, especially CO2.

The long-term trends 1958-2005 were ultimately contradictory and not valid. An attribution of hurricane intensity to climate change is still not possible. In the introduction to their current work, they also mention Levermann’s argument: “Warmer ocean-more severe storms! After a detailed analysis, however, they come to the following conclusion:
These results indicate that currently we cannot attribute changes in North Atlantic hurricane intensity to human related forcings.”
Already in the past there was disagreement among atmospheric researchers about the influence of anthropogenic forcing on hurricane intensity. Levermann did not bother with this last year either, because as a researcher he is undoubtedly informed about the various topics. So the only reason for spreading the false claim remains the climate siren character of the PIK and others.
Here is the abstract from the work of Trenary et al., which appeared in the Geophysical Research Letters on March 4, 2019:
Are mid‐20th century forced changes in North Atlantic hurricane potential intensity detectable?
Abstract: The impact of anthropogenic forcings on tropical North Atlantic hurricane potential intensity (PI) is evaluated in CMIP5 models for the period 1958‐2005. Eleven models are examined, but only seven models have a forced response that is distinguishable from internal variability. The use of discriminant analysis to optimize detectability does not yield a clear, common climate change signal. Of the seven models with a significant response, one has a negative linear trend while two have a positive linear trend. The trend in PI is not even consistent among reanalyses, although this difference is not statistically significant because of large uncertainties. Furthermore, estimates of PI internal variability have significantly different variances among different reanalysis products. These disagreements between models, reanalysis products, and between models and reanalyses, in conjunction with relatively large uncertainties, highlight the difficulty of detecting and attributing observed changes in North Atlantic hurricane potential intensity.
Plain Language Summary: Observed temperature has been steadily increasing over the last century and much of this warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions. Theoretically, the maximum intensity (or potential intensity) a hurricane can achieve depends strongly upon sea surface temperature, with warmer temperatures producing stronger storms. From this perspective, we might expect that the warming surface temperatures are driving observable changes in hurricane intensity. To this end, we analyze climate model experiments to determine if the observed changes in North Atlantic hurricane intensity can be attributed to human related emissions over the period 1958‐2005. Of the eleven models analyzed, we find that only seven predict that hurricane potential intensity has changed in response to greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions. The change in potential intensity differs across models, with one model predicting a decreasing trend in North Atlantic hurricane potential intensity, while two models predict an increasing trend in potential intensity. Different reanalysis datasets are likewise inconsistent. These results indicate that currently we cannot attribute changes in North Atlantic hurricane intensity to human related forcings. It is possible that as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, an unequivocal forced response in North Atlantic potential intensity may emerge in the future.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe President of the German Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe (Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, abbreviated BKK) is calling on citizens, government offices and companies to be prepared for widespread blackouts.

In an interview with German national daily Die Welt, BBK President Christoph Unger warned that in the future Germany faced higher probabilities of natural disasters arising from climate change, such as droughts, heat waves and flooding, but said his greatest concern was a power outage.
“After 24 hours without electricity we would have catastrophic conditions,” Unger told Die Welt.
He was particularly concerned about how the power supply could be switched off by a cyber attack. “We have to prepare ourselves for such a scenario and prepare ourselves for it”.
Unstable grid, more frequent interventions
He then told Die Welt that although the German power supply is relatively stable and secure in a global comparison, “the German Federal Grid Agency is having to intervene more and more frequently in order to compensate for grid fluctuations.”

Over the years Germany has added more and more volatile supplies of wind and solar power to feed into its power grid. This has made keeping the frequency within the needed range an increasingly difficult challenge.
“Faced multiple collapses”
For example, the German DWN here reported how in June earlier this year “Europe’s electricity grid faced multiple collapses” and how grid frequency in Germany had “plummeted several times to such an extent that Europe’s entire power grid had been endangered.” Some aluminum mills had to be taken offline.
Keep candles and matches on hand
To prepare for blackouts, Unger told Die Welt that citizens needed to keep “candles and matches” and always have a “batter-powered radio on hand in order to be able to receive news even when the power is out.” He added: “Every household should have a supply of food and drinking water.”
Diesel backup generators to the rescue
Ironically Unger told Die Welt that government offices and companies to ask themselves: “Is there enough diesel fuel on hand to power an emergency back-up generator? Where will the diesel come from when the electricity has not yet returned after two days but the back-up generators have to continue running and diesel can only be pumped from the tank farms with electric pumps?”
Is this the future of the European power supply? Citizens using matches, candles and battery-powered radios to getb through power blackouts and companies and government offices relying on emergency backup diesel generators? Sounds like the 1950s.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo recent scientific publications underscore how mass extinction events are associated with global cool-offs, glaciation and sea level fall, and NOT warmer climates.

Life thrives when the globe gets tropically warm. Photo credit: NASA, public domain
There’s been a lot of hype and hysteria surrounding the claims that the recent, modest global warming supposedly will have dire impacts on species diversity and survival.
But the wild claims fly in the face of what the earth’s history shows us: Biodiversity and species thrived in warm periods, and struggled during the cooler ones.
Now scientific results published in two recent papers suggest this yet again. What follows are the abstracts from the 2 papers along with links to them:
1. Fujisaki et al., 2019
To constrain the redox conditions and related nitrogen cycles during the Middle Permian (Guadalupian) to latest Late Permian (Lopingian) deep mid-Panthalassa, we determined the abundances of major, trace, and rare earth elements along with the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in shales interbedded with deep-sea cherts that are well-exposed at the Gujo-Hachiman section in the Mino-Tanba belt, SW Japan. … However, unlike the oxic and nitrate-rich deep-Panthalassa, we speculate that oxygen-depleted (i.e., anoxic/euxinic) and bioavailable nitrogen-poor conditions developed in the deep Tethys immediately before the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary (G-LB). These environmental stresses were potentially driven by a global cooling episode (Kamura event) together with the unique paleogeography, i.e., no contact with polar ice caps in the Tethyan Ocean. Upwelling of the anoxic watermass accumulated in the deep Tethys during the global cooling episode likely triggered oceanic anoxia in the shallow-marine regions around the G-LB [Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary, Mid- to Late Permian], which eventually resulted in the G-LB mass extinction. … In the latest Guadalupian (Capitanian), the appearance of the global cooling episode was proposed based on various lines of evidence; e.g., the lowest sea-level during the Phanerozoic (Haq and Schutter, 2008), the preferential extinction of tropically adapted fauna (Isozaki and Aljinović, 2009), the migration of mid-latitude fauna toward tropical domains (Shen and Shi, 2002), and the occurrences of mid-latitude tillites (Fujimoto et al., 2012) and alpine glacial deposits in high altitudes (Fielding et al., 2008). The high δ13Ccarb values during this period were also interpreted to indicate high primary productivity and leading to an effective burial of organic matter promoted by the global cooling episode (Kamura event; Isozaki et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2011). The global cooling episode potentially affected biological activity in the shallowmarine domains; i.e., the low eustatic levels invoked delivery of fluvial organic matter to shelf because of the increased land area, which likely resulted in increase of organic matter, expansion of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), and enhanced denitrification in the water column.”
2. Smolarek-Lach et al., 2019
Mercury Spikes Indicate a Volcanic Trigger for the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction Event … We conclude that our Hg and Hg/TOC values were associated with volcanic pulses which triggered the massive environmental changes resulting in the Late Ordovician mass extinction. … Mercury enrichments have also been described for the middle and latest Permian extinctions. Sanei et al.’s study of the latest Permian mercury enrichment in the Canadian High Arctic, attributed this to emissions from the Siberian Traps [flood volcanism] with deleterious environmental consequences. … [T]he Hg enrichment in the Katian geochemical record (the ornatus anomaly) is interpreted as a volcanic event that triggered severe cooling. It has been suggested that the upper pacificus anomaly is connected with a volcanic eruption which triggered an albedo catastrophe and the rapid expansion of ice sheets.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s really not any real doubt about it.
Cities, with their millions of tonnes of steel, asphalt and concrete act as ideal heat-absorbing sinks which take a long time to cool down at night. Just drive on a hot summer night through the country side and into a city makes that very clear.
Yet global warming activist scientists don’t like talking about that because it distracts from their flakey CO2 warming claims.
Now a new study looking at the urban heat island (UHI) effect on London titled “How much has urbanisation affected United Kingdom temperatures?” confirms real impact of the urban heat island effect. The study was published in the Atmospheric Science Letters.
Hat-tip: Reader Mary Brown
Here’s the abstract of the study (emphasis added):

That alone accounts for a very large part of the 20th century warming. But the alarmists certainly don’t want to hear it.

By Kirye
and Pierre
Ice Age now here reported, “snow and record low temperatures” in Poland — in July — earlier this week.
According to Polish sources, there was fresh snow on the highest peaks of the Tatras and the temperature fell below zero (-0.2 degrees).
June mean temperatures see no rise in Canada, Iceland
While Europe saw some record heat in June, temperatures have since fallen considerably, with many regions reporting well-below normal readings.
Elsewhere over the northern hemisphere June temperature trends show a decline over the past two decades or more.

Taken as a whole, 9 temperature stations scattered across Canada show June mean temperatures have not increased in 25 years. Chart: Kirye. Data: http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/…
Two of three stations in Iceland also show no warming. This is hardly what one would expect to find when scrutinizing behind the alarmist headlines and claims coming from global warming media and activists.

2/3 Iceland stations for June show no warming trend since 2000. Chart by Kirye. Data: http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/…
When it’s hot, the activists are so loud. But when cold offsets it all, then suddenly you can hear pins dropping.
As the saying goes regarding climate science: When it’s warm and stormy, it’s climate. But when it’s cool and calm, it’s just weather.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday the online Hamburg Abendblatt published an interview with Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt on the recent climate demonstrations and alarmism. Vahrenholt calls the demonstrations and demands “over-the-top”, and a real threat to the economy. He says the climate models are unreliable and predictions of great warming “absurd”.

Co-founder of Germany’s modern environmental movement, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt. Image: GWPF
Vehrenholt is one of founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement, the founder of the country’s largest renewable energy company, Innogy and a member of Germany’s SPD socialist parties. Lately the retired professor has become renegade among his peers by criticizing the “over-the-top climate debate” and warning against “hasty reforms”.
Atmosphere of fear and hysteria
Vahrenholt tells the Abendblatt the climate debate has become hysterical and that in fact “we don’t have a climate emergency.” He adds: “If Greta Thunberg’s demands are implemented, global prosperity and development will be massively endangered.”
Vahrenholt is one of the more prominent signatories of the letter to the UN: “There is no climate emergency.”
In the interview with the Abendblatt, Vahrenholt rejects Thunberg’s  bleak world view, noting that human society has markedly improved on almost every front over the recent decades.
“The number of hungry people in the world has halved, life expectancy has doubled, and infant mortality has been reduced to tenths. These successes have been largely due to the supply of energy for electricity, heat, transport and nutrition,” said Vahrenholt.
When asked why so few German scientists (12) signed letter to the UN, Vahrenholt told the Abendblatt: “People no longer dare to express themselves differently.”
The German chemistry professor says spreading panic and fear is “irresponsible” and that we should: “Stop scaring the children – they are already getting delusions.”
Climate models still unreliable

Vahrenholt then tells the Abendblatt that “we have until the end of the century” to tackle greenhouse emissions – and not 12 years –  and that the situation is nowhere near as serious as the alarmist voices claim it is. Moreover, Vahrenholt reminds that the models still – which serve as the basis for the panic – have a long way to go before being reliable: “Many climate models have been shown to show too much warming and cannot reproduce the fluctuations of the past because they know only one factor: CO2.”
Later in the interview he asks: “What are we to think of models that neither reproduce the Little Ice Age nor the Medieval Warm Period – when it was about as warm as it is today?” In other words: If they don’t even work for the past, then they are completely unreliable for the future.
CO2 greens the planet
Vahrenholt reminds the Abendblatt that the added CO2 has in fact made the planet greener because of the boosted photosynthesis.
Only small number of scientists say man is 100% responsible
When asked about the 97% consensus, Vahrenholt tells the Hamburg-based daily that very few scientists deny CO2 has a warming effect, but adds: “Only a small minority believe that climate change is 100 percent man-made, and the vast majority believe in several causes.”
Green movement a real economic threat
Vahrenholt agrees that we have to reduce emissions, “but not commit suicide.”
The retired German professor advises against a hasty shutdown of coal energy, and warns it would lead to far greater poverty, even in prosperous Germany: “If we get out of coal and the combustion engine by 2030, then what will become of this country?

The retired professor also rejects the claims he turned his back on environmental protection, rather he has “stayed true to the cause”.
Schellnhuber’s 6°C warming a scandal, absurd
Near the end of the interview, Vahrenholt tells the Abendblatt he thinks the globe will warm about 1.5° by 2100, i.e. the low end of the IPCC’s 1.5 – 4.5°C projected range. He characterizes Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s 6°C rise – and the applause it always gets – as a “scandal” and being “absurd”.

They show that the winter temperature trend for Germany over the past 32 years is not cooperating with “experts'” forecasts of rapid warming and snow and ice becoming a thing of the past.
The first chart, using the data from Germany’s DWD national weather service, shows that wintertime mean temperature trend in Germany has not risen in 32 years:

The green trendline shows that although CO2 in the atmosphere globally has increased from about 350 ppm since 1988 to about 412 ppm currently, Germany’s mean winter temperature has fallen a bit.

The story is true for much of France as well. Japanese blogger Kirye prepared a chart depicting the winter mean temperature of 12 stations across the country using the untampered data available from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA):

Germany trending away from droughts
Also the German media are often filled with scare stories telling us we will be seeing increasing number of droughts and dryness, and that last year’s dry summer was just a taste of what is to come.
Yet once again the data contradict all the doomsday drought reports. The long term winter precipitation trend since records began has been upward.

However, we acknowledge the trend has been decreasing (to normal levels) since about 2000. Interestingly German precipitation shows a 40 year cycle, and so likely has nothing to do with CO2.
The annual precipitation trend for Germany has also been upward overall, and it too has been trending downward since about 2000 (during this time sunshine hours have increased):

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigher frequencies of drought and extreme rainfall are assumed to be associated with modern climate change. But long-term studies in both hemispheres indicate extreme precipitation patterns were more common prior to the 20th and 21st centuries. Natural variability dominates precipitation patterns so thoroughly that an anthropogenic signal cannot be detected in observed records.
Internal climate variability (ICV) masks detection of an anthropogenic influence in extreme rainfall patterns (Bhatia and Ganguly, 2019).

Contrary to modeled expectations, there has been no “coherent picture” of an increase in extreme precipitation on a global scale in recent decades (Tabari and Willems, 2018).

There have been “no significant trends” in extreme precipitation (floods or droughts) on the East and West US coasts observed in the last 145 years. Further, “significant drought conditions that were common prior to 1900 have not been experienced by the present population“(Christy, 2019).

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper just appeared in the journal of Atmospheric Research titled: “Climate classifications from regional and global climate models: Performances for present climate estimates and expected changes in the future at high spatial resolution“.
Hat tip: Reader Mary Brown

Though the title itself reveals little about the quality of the performance of models, the study suggests that models still have a long way to go before really being useful for policymakers to go by.
The study concludes, “The modeling of precipitation remains the Achilles’ heel of models and thus of multidimensional indices, which are very sensitive to this variable.”
Well, just about every major climate index is directly related to precipitation. Thus if the models cannot get precipitation right, then everything else will also be wrong – or at least so far off the mark as to be useless.
The plea for us to worship crude models
“Nonetheless”, the authors write, “the role of models as privileged tools to advance our scientific knowledge of the Earth’s system remains undisputed.”
In other words, even though the models don’t work, and thus cannot be relied on at all by policymakers, we should still worship them!

Models as snake oil
Climate scientists have a long history of making the public think their models are pretty darn good, and that only a teeny weeny bit more tweaking is all that is needed. In reality, however, climate models are still only at the very embryonic stages of development and nowhere near suitable for performing the tasks that would make them of any use for the long term.
The climate system, which includes the atmosphere, extraterrestrial systems, tectonic activity and our great oceans, is just too poorly understood and so absolutely impossible to accurately model with any degree of certainty. There are still so many huge data holes that need to be filled.
Any scientist who claims otherwise should be put away for fraud, or in the least dismissed as an outright quack.
New data get ignored
What’s especially sad is that many of these gaping holes are gradually being filled, but unfortunately these data contradict the CO2 hypothesis of the alarmist scientists – and so they just ignore them.
The result: their models will remain a sham.
What follows is the paper’s abstract:
Climate classifications based on temperature and precipitation measurements are increasingly being used for environmental and climate change studies. Using three classification methods (Köppen, Extended Köppen, and Holdridge) and one observational dataset for present climate (CRU, Climate Research Unit), we show that GCMs have bridged the gap that led to the emergence of RCMs thirty years ago, as GCMs can now provide global climate classifications whose accuracy and precision are comparable to those of regional outputs of the RCMs. Projections of high-resolution GCMs for future climates under the assumptions of three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP26, RCP45 and RCP85) can therefore be used as a primary source for climate change and global warming studies at high resolution. This paper provides comprehensive, model-derived climate classifications for the entire planet, using RCMs and two GCMs for present and future climate-change scenarios, and discusses how well the models actually represent the climates of the world when compared with reference, ground validation data. It turns out that both GCMs and RCMs appear still limited to provide practical estimates of the world climates even for present climate conditions. The modeling of precipitation remains the Achilles’ heel of models and thus of multidimensional indices, which are very sensitive to this variable. The conclusion is that model outputs at regional scale need to be taken with extreme caution without venturing into informing policies presenting potentially large societal impacts. Nonetheless, the role of models as privileged tools to advance our scientific knowledge of the Earth’s system remains undisputed.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German business daily Handelsblatt here reported last month that leading German energy expert Jens Koeppen of Angela Merkel’s CDU party is calling for “drastic” permitting rules when it comes to installing wind turbines.

The proposed rules would make a number of proposed wind projects impossible.
Currently a work group that is focused on acceptance and made up of members from the coalition parties is trying to figure out a way to get around the rapidly growing protests against more wind turbines, whose erection are deforesting and industrializing large swaths of Germany’s idyllic landscape. 
Traditional environmentalists and conservationists are livid over the environmental destruction and health risks posed by wind parks. 
Protests have become formidable, and as reported yesterday here, Germany’s expansion of wind energy has literally ground to a halt as a result and has thus angered climate protection alarmists and Big Wind lobbyists.
The Handelsblatt writes citizens are tenaciously fighting the installation of 200-meter tall turbines, even doing so in court, and explains how one CDU-politician is calling for a nationwide wind turbine setback rule based on the one used in the southern state of Bavaria.
Bavarian 10H rule has effectively stopped new wind projects

The Bavarian 10H rule forbids the installation of any wind turbine within a distance equaling 10 times the height of the turbine from any residential area. That means no 200-meter tall turbine can be built within 2 kilometers from a residential area. In Bavaria that rule has literally ended the installation of new wind turbines.
Koeppen told the Handelsblatt that “the citizens must be taken seriously” or else “no progress will be made”.
Currently there’s a wave of lawsuits challenging wind park proposals across the country.
Communities risk being surrounded and plagued
The German UBA Office of Environment, however, warns that even a distance of 1000 meters would reduce the area wind turbines by up to 50% in some places.
Citizens are also very concerned about the health impacts from infrasound generated by wind turbines, which experts claimed can have an impact 10 kilometers away.
Once peaceful communities now find themselves divided
Wind energy has not only divided the environmentalists, but also disturbed the tranquility and harmony once found in many idyllic communities across the country.
Politicians as well are divided. The conservatives in the CDU aim to assure adequate setbacks for wind parks near communities. The socialists in the SPD, on the other hand, wish to relax the rules and thus clear the way for more wind park installation near communities.

A case for psychotherapy
In a recent paper dubbed “The Denial of the Apocalypse – Dealing with the Climate Crisis from the Perspective of Existential Psychotherapy” appearing in the German Das Psychotherapeutenjournal (The Psychotherapist Journal), author Fabian Chmielewski explains which “denial processes are effective and what the psychotherapists could and should concretely do about it”.
Panic over climate change is normal
According to Chmielewski, a psychologist with a practice in Hattingen, being in panic about the rapidly approaching climate apocalypse is in fact rational behavior, while having doubts and remaining calm about it is abnormal and thus needs to be addressed.
The journal’s editorial, written by Hans Schindler, comments that although Chmielewski’s paper is contentious, it is “a suitable impetus for the necessary debate about the socio-political responsibility of our professional group and for the discussion about the possibilities – and limits – of engagement in our roles as psychotherapists and citizens.”
Leading journal in Germany
Das Psychotherapeutenjournal is not just some crackpot publication that gets little attention in Germany, rather it is indeed the organ of the Bavarian State Chamber of Psychological Psychotherapists.
The journal is co-financed by the membership fees of the other German state chambers and sent throughout Germany. It is the central organ of a corporation under public law, which represents the profession of psychotherapists by law.
Concrete psychotherapeutic ‘interventions’
The abstract of Fabian Chmielewski paper:
A broad consensus of serious research warns of the scenario of a soon inevitable spiral of man-made climate change. Nevertheless, both large sections of the population and decision-makers do not seem to be adequately interested in the impending destruction of the world as we know it. The gloomy prophecies of climate scientists are played down or even denied, the necessary climate policy steps are not taken. The article looks at these phenomena from the perspective of existential psychotherapy and tries to point out possible causes and mechanisms of this repression as well as to derive concrete psychotherapeutic ‘interventions’. It also argues for the active participation of psychotherapists in health campaigns against this widespread “existential neurosis”.

Chmielewski claims that the “Fridays for Future” strikes and demonstrations are the clearest and most media-effective indication of the impending doomsday scenario, and calls for the implementation of the drastic climate policy measures demanded by science and that both doctors and psychologists warn of the health consequences of climate change and give it top priority. Here, he suggests, panic is the psychologically appropriate response.
Top human health priority
Chmielewski notes that at its annual general meeting, the Marburger Bund (association of physicians) demands: “Stopping climate change caused by humans and its consequences for human health must also be given absolute priority in health policy action”.
“Existential threat”
In the paper, Chmielewski writes that in recent times, various psychologists and psychotherapists have marked climate change as an “existential threat” (Psychologists for Future, 2019).
And when it comes to scientific dissent with regards to the upcoming climate doomsday, auditor Chmielewski writes that despite the scientific certainty of climate doomsday:
Nevertheless, important decision-makers are either completely denying man-made climate change or trivializing it and the urgency of the pressure to act. […] A large part of the population does not seem to be adequately interested in the impending destruction of the world as we know it and – as Brick and van der Linden (2018) put it – has only one lethargic “yawn” left for the apocalypse. Even more questionable seems to be the motivation of people to reject the human cause of climate change as a lie – sometimes with astonishing aggressiveness and with reference to untenable conspiracy theories.”
Suggesting compulsory hospitalization, medication
Also commenting on Chmielewski’s paper at the critical German achgut.com here, Air Tuerkis notes that generally therapists are rightly afraid to impose a certain point of view on people. But according to Chmielewski: “Exceptions are to be made, however, if an acute own or foreign endangerment is present”.
Tuerkis continues:
The concept of an ‘acute danger to oneself or others‘ is quite explosive here. It releases the therapist, for example, from the duty of confidentiality. The term normally aims at impending criminal offences that pose a danger to life and limb and above all a the danger of suicide. In Bavaria the legislator speaks of a danger to public safety to a considerable extent.”
A ‘considerable and acute danger to oneself or others’ is even sufficient as a reason for compulsory hospitalisation and compulsory medication. In this case, the patient could be admitted provisionally for up to 48 hours without a court order.”
In other words, back to the dark days days of Soviet-style punitive political psychiatry. Dissenters should be medicated into changing their views.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the latest Saturday Summary at Weatherbell Analytics, Joe Bastardi, a well-known 40-year veteran of meteorology, looks at tornadoes and hurricanes.
Although many meteorologists and climatologists confirm that there is no data suggesting global warming is causing more frequent and intense tornado and hurricane activity, there is a small but influential alarmist group who claim otherwise. And it’s no surprise who the click-baiting media parrot at maximum volume.
Landfalling hurricanes downward trend
At the 5:45 mark, Joe presents a chart depicting the frequency of US landfalling hurricanes since 1900:

Thank you global warming!
As the chart above shows, hurricane frequency has declined while global temperatures have risen over the same period, which leads Joe to comment that we “have been fed a bill of goods by people who use the weather as weapons.”
By “people” here, he means the climate-ambulance chasing media, scientists and public figures who seize upon every weather anomaly and claim it’s a sign of manmade global warming.

Also the former veteran AccuWeather meteorologist points out that the alarmists like to forget that there was a record setting 10-year hiatus for major hurricanes striking the U.S from 2005 to 2015. Here he suggests that the warming of the past 117 years may in fact be contributing to the downward trend.
Tornado activity on the decline
Next at the 10:10 mark of the Saturday Summary, Joe looks at tornado activity. Data here as well show that tornado activity has been declining rather than picking up, which is what the climate alarm-heads like to suggest is the case:

Chart: NOAA
As the NOAA chart clearly shows, tornado activity has fallen over the past 50 years. Here as well Bastardi says we’ve “been sold a bill of goods” concerning claims that climate is making tornadoes worse.
And so far 2019 has seen below average tornado activity as well:

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsually shunned by the German mainstream media, today moderate, rational voices on the issue of climate change are beginning to be heard on the air waves once again. This may be temporary. We’ll just have to wait and see.

Leading German climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt. Image: Die kalte Sonne
For example, just days ago, leading climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt was interviewed by NDR German public radio’s Anke Harnack on the topic of climate change. As protests by yellow vests in France and angry farmers in the Netherlands intensify, perhaps the establishment in Germany is having second thoughts about going down the hysterical climate rescue path that has been forcefully advocated in Germany over the recent months.
Prosperity based on “reliable energy supplies”
In the interview Vahrenholt, a leading founder of Germany’s modern environmental movement, tells the NDR that following the demands made by Greta Thunberg would put global prosperity at risk and exacerbate world hunger. He says the amazing improvement human society has seen over the last 100 years is thanks to “reliable energy supplies”.
“Huge, huge difficulties”
“Shutting these down in 12 years would indeed throw us into huge, huge difficulties.”

Vahrenholt says all the recent “panic is leading policymakers into making errors and will lead to disappointment for the youth because it is not doable.” He adds changing over the green energies is needed ultimately, but this cannot be done over a short time period of a decade or two. He says “we need two generations” to get off fossil fuels and that it’s going to require “more innovation and research in order to get CO2 emissions down to acceptable levels by the end of the century.”
Vahrenholt, the former director of renewable energies company Innogy, says he is also puzzled over why Germany refuses to do research on fusion and remains so fixated on unstable sun and wind. Vahrenholt was one for the 500 scientists who recently signed a letter to the UN declaring that the planet was not facing a climate crisis.
97% consensus claim distorted
On the claim 97% agree that man is behind global warming, Vahrenholt says this figure has been completely misrepresented, and that it is in fact “only a handful of scientists” who say that man is 100% responsible. Many scientists say that man is only partly responsible.
Chinese are laughing
The outspoken German professor of chemistry says giving in to the demands of the radical greens would lead to a deindustrialized Germany: “In the end what’s left is a deindustrialized Germany, and the Chinese are laughing their heads off.”
Leaders lack courage
On the large Fridays for Future protests, Vahrenholt says: “It’s not surprising because currently hardly a teacher, hardly a journalist, hardly a scientist has the  courage to say: ‘Dear millions of people, we find it nice that you’re concerned about the climate, but let’s really discuss among each other what really needs to be done, and how much time we have.’ This really annoys me. I may not always be right, but I’m pretty sure that the alarmists are not right.”

More pain for consumers. Electricity prices in Germany climb to a new high, reaching 30.85 cents (euro) per kilowatt hour. Experts warn transition to green energies may lead to shortages, higher prices.
German online national daily Die Welt here reports on how electricity prices in the country have reached “a new high” and that natural gas prices are high as well.
The German national news daily writes: “Electricity has never been as expensive for private households in Germany as it is this year.”
“Prices have risen to a new high,” Die Welt reports, citing the latest data from German Federal Network Agency.
For the first time, electricity prices for consumers reached 30 cents (euro) per kilowatt-hour, making German electric prices among the highest in the world.

Citing data from the Federal Network Agency, the average price soared to 30.85 cents (euro) per kilowatt hour, which works out to be an increase of almost 3.3 percent compared to just a year earlier. Last year the average price for one kilowatt hour was 29.88 cents.
According to Die Welt: “The Federal Network Agency evaluates the data of well over 1000 electricity suppliers.”
Why is electricity so expensive in Germany?
The Federal Network Agency puts the blame on the electricity wholesalers who, according to Die Welt, “pass on increases to the electricity exchange”.
And an end in the rising price spiral remains elusive, experts warn.
“Wholesale prices for electricity could continue to rise,” Die Welt reports. Large power producers such as RWE, warn that future plant closures due to the transition to green energies and the phasing out of the country’s nuclear power plants will “lead to a shortage”.
Die Welt ends its article: “The largest block on the electricity bill, however, are taxes, levies and allocations, which account for more than half of the total price.” One major price driver are the mandatory, exorbitantly high green energy feed-in tariffs that grid operators are forced to pay.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWorld leading sea level expert Prof. em. Nils Axel Mörner presents some stark examples that show how the IPCC and climate activists are wildly exaggerating their claims of rapid sea level rise.
================================================
12th IKEK: Nils Axel Mörner – the Kattegat and others among test areas for sea level
Prof. em. Nils Axel Mörner auf der 12. IKEK München, Bild EIKE
By EIKE
Mörner studied the Kattegat Sea between Denmark and Sweden. In this region sea level has not increased as announced by climate alarmists, but instead decreased. The actual oceanic increase in the past 125 years can be estimated as modest at 0.9 mm per year.   
Stockholm’s tide record is the second longest in Europe; the mean long-term change in sea level is a decline of 3.8 mm per year. The country itself is rising 4.9 mm per year due to the post-glacial rise of the continental landmass. The difference of 1.1 mm per year is the true oceanic component.
Nova Scotia: sea level 700mm higher back in 16th century
In addition to European locations, Mörner also looks at the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. He has just returned from the Ouvéa area off Nova Scotia. In the 17th century, the sea level was 70 cm higher, as confirmed by immutable geomorphological facts. 
At that time, the “Little Ice Age” with larger glaciers prevailed in the Alps (as Professor Patzelt showed). How could more liquid water be present at the equatorial area at the same time?

The phenomenon thus proves that the IPCC is wrong. 
In warm times, the sea level does not rise globally. The reason for this is the so-called rotational eustasy of the planet: In the north, the volume of water increases a bit, at the equator it remains about the same. 
Sea level at Fiji Islands, Maldives, Goa has dropped since 1950s
Also other islands or coastal regions show a sea level change, such as the island Ouvéa, also the Fiji Islands, the Maldives and Goa in India. Here, too, the oceans sank around 1700, rose around 1800 and sank again after 1950.  
Solar driven
Global sea level changes followed the moon’s tidal super cycles, which in turn stem from the large solar cycles. The sun also affects the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, which brings warmth to Western and Northern Europe. At maximum solar activity, the Gulf Stream flows northeast and sea level rises. During a solar minimum, the Gulf Stream flows from east to southeast and sea level drops to the north.
“CO2 no factor”
Mörner emphasized that the solar cycles and gravity of our neighboring planets, the solar wind and the moon, determined our climate and our environment. The carbon dioxide greenhouse effect has no place. 
IPCC climate science in part “anti-scientific nonsense”
With his presentation in Munich, the speaker wanted to send a message to the world climate conference COP24 in Katowice / Poland, which took place shortly after the EIKE conference. That message is: “Some of their statements fall into the area of ​​anti-scientific nonsense. The polar ice does not melt so quickly and the sea level does not rise in a short time. ” 
Mörner recommends observing physical laws and the evidence from nature for the procedure of determining sea level.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmists say that sea levels are rising rapidly, and unless we act now to take over the climate using the secret man-made CO2 reduction method, soon New York and even Cologne, Germany, will end up in water. At least that’s the alarmist scenario that the Truth Media like to tell us about.
However, a number of studies and tide gauge data tell us a very different story. Hat-tip: reader Mary Brown.
The latest study titled: Holocene sea-level change and evolution of a mixed coral reef and mangrove system at Iriomote Island, southwest Japan, by Yamano et al tells us that sea levels were more than 1 meter higher 5100 to 3600 years ago than they are today they, or 0.4 meters when corrected for tectonics.

The paper’s abstract follows:
Exposed fossil microatolls and core samples from a coral reef and a mangrove forest at the Yutsun River mouth, Iriomote Island, southwest Japan, reveal the internal structure and temporal changes in the sedimentary processes of a mixed reef–mangrove system. Evidence from the core samples and fossil microatolls suggests sea level reached its present position before 5100 cal yr B.P., and a relative sea-level highstand of 1.1–1.2 m above the present sea level occurred from 5100 to 3600 cal yr B.P. This was followed by a gradual fall in relative sea level. The tectonically corrected sea-level curve indicates a stable sea level after 5100 cal yr BP., with a sea-level highstand of up to 0.4 m between 5100 and 3600 cal yr B.P.
A nearshore reef dominated by massive Porites and arborescent Acropora initially developed at 6500–3900 cal yr B.P. Reef development was potentially terminated by relative sea-level fall and sediment discharge from the Yutsun River that affected the backreef environment. An offshore coral reef reached present-day sea level by 1000 cal yr B.P., forming a wave break that enabled the foundation of mangrove forest on the fringing reef after ∼1000 cal yr B.P. The reef development was significantly delayed compared with other coral reefs in the region with similar medium-to high-energy conditions, but it provided a calm environment in the backreef area that allowed the development of mangroves. These features demonstrate the chronology and causal relationship between coral reef and mangrove development under the influence of Holocene sea-level change and river discharge.”

The peer-reviewed study is yet more cold water on the heated alarmist claims of a rapidly accelerating sea level rise.

NOAA: tide gauges measure only 1.7 – 1.8 mm
Tide gauges are also showing a much slower sea level rise. Just recently the NOAA here announced that had adjusted its tide gauge data for 2018 and now says the average global sea level rise rate is only 1.7-1.8 mm/yr, as opposed to satellite data which show a rise of over 3 mm per year.
Naturally, the tide gauge data are more crucial because they measure sea level rise at the coast where people actually live.
According to sunshinehours.net:
That’s a measly 5.6 inches by 2100. 
The map of relative sea level trends provides an overview of variations in the rates of local sea level change at long-term tide stations (based on a minimum of 30 years of data in order to account for long-term sea level variations and reduce errors in computing sea level trends based on monthly mean sea level).
The variations in sea level trends seen here primarily reflect differences in rates and sources of vertical land motion.
Areas experiencing little-to-no change in relative sea level are illustrated in green, including stations consistent with average global sea level rise rate of 1.7-1.8 mm/yr. These are stations not experiencing significant vertical land motion.“

Share this...FacebookTwitterA German psychiatrist has read the Thunbergs’ book, observed climate movement and finds it’s all about fanaticism: “utopian character of demands”…”inability to engage in dialogue and compromise”.

Image: S. Fischer Verlag
Prof. Dr. med. Dipl.-Psych. Wolfgang Meins, neuropsychologist and professor of psychiatry, penned an article recently published at German libertarian site Achgut.com which looks at Greta Thunberg, her parents and the Green movement she has helped to propel. The title of the article: Greta and her parents – not hysterical, but fanatic. 
Prof. Meins read Thunberg’s German language book: Szenen aus dem Herzen and believes Thunberg and her movement are all about climate fanaticism and not climate hysteria. He also warns that politicians need to sober up and face the fanaticism for what it is.
Rooted in obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism
Meins writes that one special characteristic of fanatics is their “inability to engage in dialogue and compromise,” which leads to the fact that people are declared “external enemies” who are “potentially also fought with aggressive and destructive means.”
Meins attributes Greta Thunberg’s climate fanaticism to an obsessive-compulsive disorder and her autism.

Her disability, Meins writes, is rooted in the fact “that as an Asperger autistic, she tends to focus very strongly on a special field of interest. People with Asperger syndrome show little compassion and interest in other people,” he writes.
This means “you are as good as immune to the suffering of your fellow human beings”. For example, “people who would become unemployed as a result of banning all flights”.
Strongly emotional convictions dominate, permanently determine thinking
Meins writes: “The climate fanatics are united by a superior idea, i.e. strongly emotional convictions that absolutely dominate and permanently determine their thinking, for example: The CO2-induced apocalypse is irrevocably imminent unless we take immediate, radical countermeasures at any cost. In Greta’s case, superior ideas of this kind developed through a small distraction, based on a related theme: During a school lesson in autumn 2014, she sees a film about the pollution of the oceans. She bursts into tears during the film. At noon she sits in the cafeteria in front of her burger, which she does not touch. From then on, if I correctly interpret the mother’s vague statements, she only eats vegan, if anything at all.”
“Elites almost unanimously paying homage to a fanatic”
“The very special thing about Greta and her fans is that they are courted by large parts of the Western elites, and above all German elites. One hardly hears anything critical from these circles at all,” says Meins. “It is probably the first time since the end of the Second World War that these elites almost unanimously pay homage to a fanatic, and often even encourage Greta and her followers.
With regard to the SPD and especially the CDU-related “elite actors”, Meins assumes that “the completely utopian character of demands for a radical change in climate policy, now and immediately, is clear to them. He accuses them of cowardly refusing to “open the door to the fabulous realm of the climate apocalypse”. Their fear of being driven into political suicide due to “argumentative awkwardness, overlooked pitfalls and media that act on this issue” is overwhelming.
“No need to worry about ecodictatory regulations and prohibitions”
Meins writes in his article that “you get to know quite exactly how climate fanatics tick.” He adds: “For example, that one does not have to worry about the political, economic and social consequences of certain drastic or perhaps better: ecodictatory regulations and prohibitions. Why should they? There is no alternative to such measures, because otherwise we will “burn” or otherwise perish.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor those wondering how Greta Thunberg managed to get so off the rails  look no further than her climate advisors. They are among the most alarmist worldwide.
According to the online, German-language Merkur.de here, citing Swedish daily Expressen, 16-year old climate activist is advised by Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, among others, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany.
Wild science claims

Professor Rahmstorf and the Potsdam Institute are well known among the climate science community for their highly alarmist projections and off-the-mark science. For example, the PIK’s former director, Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, once preposterously claimed the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2030 and the world would explode with 9 billion people on it.
Alarmism as a business model
According to the Merkur, the PIK has “created a business model with climate change”, adding: “It advises state institutions and municipalities on how they can protect themselves against the severe climate changes predicted by PIK.”

The Merkur reports how Greta and Professor Rahmstorf “have met on several occasions” and how the 16-year old “calls the professor for advice.” Rahmstorf praises the teenager, saying “she knows a lot about climate science” and argues that politicians too should adopt Greta’s doomsday visions.

“Holy anger” and “religious exaggeration” 
But now some are speaking up against the excessive alarmism.
Not only are some media questioning Rahmstorf’s alarmist climate science, though it makes for good headlines, but so are other experts, such as renowned geologist Stefan Kröpelin, or Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, or veteran meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann.
Swiss meteorologist Kachelmann calls Rahmstorf a “climate-Ratzinger”, alluding to former Pope Benedict XVI, earlier known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. Kachelmann, a warmist, has become turned off by the fiery Potsdam professor’s “religious exaggeration” and “holy anger” in the climate debate.
“Climate howler”
The two heavyweights recently even argued on Twitter about whether a piece of broken glass could trigger a forest fire, as Rahmstorf claims, or not. The sharp-witted, media-savvy Kachelmann recently characterized claims made by Rahmstorf as “potsdaft” – an allusion to his place of work –  and labelled him a Klimaheuler, a ‘climate howler’.
Surrounded by alarmists, rational voices not welcome

Greta Thunberg’s other advisors include Swedish Professor Johan Rockström (53) and British Professor Kevin Anderson (57), both devout alarmists. Non-alarmist climate experts and rational voices are not welcome by Thunberg and her advisors. Why ruin a good business model?

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper appearing in the journal Urban Climate titled “Statistics on typhoon landfalls in Vietnam: Can recent increases in economic damage be attributed to storm trends?“, authored by Hiroshi Takagi, shows that tropical storm claims often made by climate alarmists are more fiction than fact. 

Tropical storm. Image: NASA
The paper concludes “it is reasonable to attribute the expansion of disaster-related economic damage to economic development and the fundamental volatility of typhoons.”
Hat-tip: reader Mary Brown
It also concludes:  “None of the meteorological trends such as frequency, central pressure, wind speed, or storm intensity show any significant increase or decrease over the last four decades.”
What follows is the paper’s abstract:


The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) indicates that the economic damage associated with storms has been rapidly growing in Vietnam. By contrast, the fatality rate due to storm-relevant disasters has been declining in recent decades. This study investigates whether typhoon trends have affected these outcomes. Best track data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) were examined to estimate central pressure and wind speed when typhoons made landfall. From 1977 to 2017, typhoons with wind speeds above 20 knots struck the country 105 times. A statistical analysis, which defined a storm’s intensity using principal component analysis (PCA), revealed that Typhoon Doksuri in 2017 was the strongest among the collection, followed by Cecil in 1985, Xangsane in 2006, and Damrey in 2017. The worst storm in history, Typhoon Linda in 1997, claimed over 3500 lives in southern Vietnam, but was only ranked 37th, demonstrating that typhoon intensity is not always the determining factor of fatalities.
Moreover, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) illustrates that none of the meteorological trends such as frequency, central pressure, wind speed, or storm intensity show any significant increase or decrease over the last four decades. However, landfall frequency has risen significantly, particularly in the northernmost part of the country where two large cities, Hanoi and Hai Phong, are located. A strong correlation was found between intensity and recent economic damage (r = 0.80) based on the proposed index of positive annual landfall storm intensity (PALSI). Given all of these factors, it is reasonable to attribute the expansion of disaster-related economic damage to economic development and the fundamental volatility of typhoons.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn empirical analysis using 2005-2015 data from 15 EU countries indicates that as more renewable energies (i.e., solar PV) are deployed, energy costs increase, household poverty risks rise, and incomes decline.


Image Source: Pereira et al., 2019
In contrast to the negative consequences of switching from fossil fuels to renewables, Dr. Tadesse Weldu Teklu affirms “CO2 emission (energy consumption) is directly correlated to economic prosperity and industrialization.”  
Therefore, least developed countries (LDCs) such as Ethiopia should “increase her CO2 emission per capita as much as possible” to escape from the renewables-centered “poverty trap” foisted upon them by “Earth-friendly” wealthy countries.  
Besides,  fossil fuel consumption will inevitably continue to grow and maintain a similar share to today’s (~80%) by 2040 despite symbolic “destined to fail” Paris agreement gestures.

If you compare historical photos of glaciers with those taken more recently, you can see that where there was formerly ice there is now very often nothing but rock. Geographers, however, are less interested in the area covered by a glacier, and more interested in its mass. Researchers from FAU have now investigated all glacial areas in South America in more detail than ever before, from the tropical areas of Venezuela to the subpolar regions of Tierra del Fuego.
Their two major findings are that the highest rate of mass loss is in the Patagonian ice sheet, and that the glaciers in the tropics have lost considerably less mass than previously projected, although this is not the good news which it might appear at first sight. The researchers’ findings have been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.*
Surveying glaciers is nothing new. There are two methods which are used particularly often. In the first method, researchers take several measurements directly at a glacier and project the results for entire regions. This is particularly problematic when it comes to large glacial areas such as the large ice fields in Patagonia, as barely any in situ measurements are available for these areas.
The other option is to take gravimetric measurements using satellites. Scientists base their measurements on the fact that gravity on Earth changes depending not only on the location but also over time. It is influenced by aspects such as the composition of the Earth’s surface, mountain ranges, movements in the core, plate movements – and, of interest for our context, when glaciers lose mass. One disadvantage of this method is that when only small areas are covered by glaciers, as is the case in the South American tropics, the satellite only receives a weak signal and the measurement is significantly less accurate.
One method for measuring all glaciers
Geographers from FAU specialising in both climatology and remote sensing and spatial information, led by Prof. Dr. Matthias Braun and Dr. Tobias Sauter, also used satellite data for surveying South American glaciers, but they focused on calculating elevation levels instead of basing their results on gravimetric measurements. Two radar satellites from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) have been orbiting the Earth since 2010. The aim of the TanDEM-X-mission was to obtain a three dimensional image of the Earth, which is not only of a consistent quality but also more accurate than anything that has gone before.
Differences in elevation were recorded down to the last metre. The researchers from FAU used data collected between 2011 and 2015 and compared them with measurements from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission of 2000. Using a complex method which involved making various corrections and calculating possible error margins, they compared the data to calculate the changes in elevation in the glacial regions of South America, thus obtaining an accurate picture of the changes in glacial mass.
Their method was unusual in that they were able to use one uniform method to record all glacial areas in the region. In addition, the method even provided accurate data for individual glaciers. Comparing the measurements from both space missions allowed the researchers to gain detailed insights into the situation throughout South America. For the first time, researchers succeeded in analysing the large Patagonian ice fields separately from the surrounding, smaller glaciers.
Entire glaciers have vanished
The greatest loss of mass, both relatively and in comparison to the other South American glaciers, was found in both inland ice fields in Patagonia, two regions with an area of approximately 18,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to the Rhineland-Palatinate region in Germany.
Slower rate of mass loss in tropics

The second important fact revealed by the research is that the mass of glaciers in the tropical regions of South America – in Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia – is changing at a considerably slower rate than previously supposed. Projections to date calculated that the 2900 glaciers there were losing approximately 6 gigatonnes of mass per year. The geographers from FAU have discovered, however, that they are only losing 0.55 gigatonnes per year, approximately 10 percent of the estimates to date.
This result is important, as glaciers are an important source of water in the dry period: when no rain falls and the temperatures reach their highest level, glacier melt water is used as drinking water, for irrigation and hydro power. People in these regions therefore have to know to what extent the glaciers are changing, and need quantitative data not only with respect to area but also in terms of their volume and mass.
In some areas such as the Central Andes in Chile and Argentina or the Cordillera Real in Bolivia, experts are even of the opinion that the maximum amount of water available from glacial melt has already been exceeded. This is an indication that glaciers are irrevocably on the retreat and will vanish entirely in the foreseeable future. In future, these areas will have less water available during the dry season.
The survey, however, also revealed that some areas have hardly experienced any change at all, such as the Andes in northern Chile and Argentina as well as in southern Bolivia at the latitude of the Atacama desert.
The researchers from Erlangen now hope that their study will be included in the next report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). After all, melted glacier ice is contributing to the rise in sea levels and the huge ice fields in Patagonia are particularly relevant. Glaciers are also used as an indicator for climate change in other respects as well.
The geographers from FAU now want to extend their analyses to cover other regions and investigate how the situation develops over a longer period of time. At present, the global terrain model from the TanDEM-X mission is currently being updated. Researchers hope to be able to benefit from these data in future. They are also relying on further national missions which are in the pipeline such as the Tandem-L satellites, which would make it possible for such measurements to be repeated more frequently.

It’s time to take the debate away from the extreme factions and to move it to cooler heads, says veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann
Former German Public television meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann wrote an essay commentary for the Swiss online Die Weltwoche here titled “Tell me where you stand”, where he compares today’s white-hot intolerance seen in climate science to the political intolerance witnessed in former communist East Germany.
“Religious furor”
In East Germany, either you adhered to the state’s hard communist doctrine, or you were the enemy. Such is the atmosphere we see today in climate science. Kachelmann writes: “Again today it’s either-or, and nothing in between.”
“Debates are important, and we must conduct them with arguments and without the religious furor that is being practiced today by both sides.”
The veteran meteorologist describes how on the climate issue “there are two irreconcilable camps”: the climate deniers and climate hysterics – each arrogantly claiming “infallibility”. It is no longer possible to be in between. Even those in between get insulted and attacked equally by both sides.
Natural science at schools have been “almost completely gutted”
While Kachelmann writes “deniers” are mostly older, right wing persons, the alarmists are made up of mostly “ugly young people” who are the products of school systems that have had their “natural science subjects almost completely gutted out”.
“These people don’t need graphs, but rather the godlike feeling of being on the correct side, which is why you don’t have to be so precise with facts,” Kachelmann comments.
“Today, the divining militancy of both sides is preventing a serious debate on priorities,” He says. “The green and brown nuts try to recruit for their political advantage those who have a big opinion on the subject, but no idea about it.”
Academic (green) supremacists
One example of the militant intolerance Kachelmann describes is illustrated by a recent Twitter comment by Potsdam scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who reacted to German parliamentarian Philipp Lengsfeld, who earlier had tweeted on a “remarkable” statement recently published by 90 leading Italian scientists who challenged the alarmist climate science and claims of consensus.

That comment by Lengsfeld was obviously too much for Rahmstorf, who was obviously unnerved that a parliamentarian would make such an observation. He not only attacks Lengsfeld and this site here, but he also insults and slanders the 70 Italian scientists.
His Twitter comment in English:
It is particularly noteworthy when a member of parliament cannot distinguish a climate denier website from serious science and falls for a list of signatures by predominantly unprofessional and emeritus people – even more untrustworthy than the lung physicians.”
In Rahmstorf’s view, anyone who challenges the Potsdam alarmist climate position is an enemy of the climate state, and any scientist who questions the science is equivalent to a tobacco scientist.
Yes, its’ time to move the debate and science over to moderate voices.

It has also been reported that a new all-time July low had been recorded in the Netherlands, according to one source here. The online NL Times here reported, “residents of Eastern Netherlands woke up to a frost covered landscape on Thursday” and that in Twente, “a minimum of -1.6 degrees Celsius was measured – a record low for July, according to Weerplaza.”
The cold has now gripped northern Europe for about a week now, as the mornings of July 3 and 4 saw “at times widespread surface frost in Germany” as well.

The cold is not expected to subside anytime soon. A recent GFS forecast shows it will likely persist across Northern Europe and most of northern Russia for another 10 days.
So don’t expect to see any global warming ambulance chasers to be found there. They were last sighted in Alaska, and may soon be headed to Iran or the “stans”.

The picture above of a thunderstorm over Upper Bidwell Park was taken by my Bidwell Ranch Weather Station Webcam at http://www.bidwellranchcam.com this summer.
Weather in the mountainous portion of upper park can sometime be pretty unpredictable, with storms forming quickly due to upslope winds which cause an Orographic Lifting effect aiding the quick formation of a storm.
You may have read in the Sunday ER about the new Outdoor Planetarium  at the Kiwanis Chico Community Observatory and some of the hi-tech gadgetry there.
Today I’m pleased to announce that I completed the installation of the first ever weather station in Upper Bidwell Park at the Observatory and it is available for online access at the Observatory web page at: http://www.chicoobservatory.com/weather.htm It displays new weather data every 15 minutes plus logs the entire day’s weather for use later. I often get requests for rainfall data for Big Chico Creek watershed, and there is virtually none. This will help.

The weather station will soon have its own live webcam, the picture in the weather graphic online now is from the Bidwell Ranch Cam.
When the new webcam is installed, it will overlook the Horsehsoe Lake fishing pier. Besides the camera being a bit of deterrent for rascally behavior, the new upper park weather station will also give hikers, bikers, and golfers an ideas of what the weather is like there right now, which will aid in choosing what to wear and what gear to bring. It will help observatory staff determine if viewing is likely that night. It will also display inside the observatory, and be linked to a network of weather stations around town for an even bigger project I’m working on to create a temperature and wind model to assist in an important public health service need. More on that in the future.
This is a free community service. Enjoy it with my compliments.

Al Gore is standing to rake in millions from a World Resources Institute meat consumption reduction report, one that will certainly help boost profits for the meat substitute manufacturers – in which Gore just happens to be a big stakeholder!

Al Gore has ties to meat consumption reduction report while holding huge stake in substitute meat company. Image: cropped here M4GW.
CNN recently reported here on the just published report from the global research nonprofit World Resources Institute. The 568-page report dubbed “Creating a Sustainable Food Future” recommends, among other actions, eating far less beef in order to rescue the planet.
Gore hack is WRI co-chair
But according to S___  at a thread at Twitter (see below), the WRI’s Co-Chair is David Blood. “David Blood is former Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management head who founded Generation Investment Management with Al Gore, yes that Al Gore,” S___writes under point no. 3.

1) So I was curious why there was this sudden push to cut meat, particularly beef consumption, it seemed to come out of nowhere, so I did a little research, a thread: https://t.co/8baJfISZ7c

So the report is now looking more and more like a junk-science-based instrument designed to boost the plant-based substitute meat industry, which include major companies such as Beyond Meat.
Kleiner Perkins: biggest Beyond Meat investor
Generation Investment Management is connected to Kleiner Perkins, where former Vice President Al Gore is one of its partners and advisors.
Who’s Kleiner Perkins? It turns out they are Beyond Meat’s biggest investor, according to bizjournals.com here. Beyond Meat is a Los Angeles-based producer of plant-based meat substitutes founded in 2009 by Ethan Brown. The company went public in May and just weeks later the more than quadrupled in there value.
Yes, Al Gore, partner and advisor to Kleiner Perkins, Beyond Meat’s big investor, stands to haul in millions, should governments move to restrict real meat consumption and force citizens to swallow the dubious substitutes and fakes.
If taken seriously, the World Research Institute Report, backed by Gore hacks, will help move the transition over to substitute meats far more quickly.
According to S___:
All these “We need to cut beef consumption to save the planet” stories originate from the World Resources Institute whose co-chair is a partner in the firm that collaborates w/ the main investor in @BeyondMeat and his co-founder is a partner in the main investor.”
Another dubious money making scheme that reeks of ethics violations and that needs to be investigated.

Once predicted to be ice-free by climate “experts”, the Arctic ice has not lost any volume over the current decade.
Using the modelled ice volume data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), we see June 15 volume trend has been flat since 2010:

Next we examine the fluctuating ice volume, going back to March 2006:

The above plot shows how Arctic ice volume has not gone down in 13 years, i.e. since climate experts began warning in earnest that the Arctic had entered a “death spiral”.

That the Arctic has plateaued at a low level does not surprise a number of climate and weather experts, who say it is natural and in large part connected to the North Atlantic sea surface temperature oscillations:

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor those serious about taking concerted action to combat climate change, implications from a 2018 study suggest that the widespread abandonment of  smartphone use — which is collectively on track to add 125 megatons of CO2 equivalent per year by 2020 — may be key to preventing the planet’s catastrophic demise.

Image Source (adapted): Press-Herald
Most people haven’t considered their smartphones to be significant contributors to global CO2 emissions.
But they are.  And they are poised to become one of the more prominent obstacles to global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in the coming decades.
The unsustainable expansion of smartphone emissions
A recent analysis by Belkhir and Elmeligi (2018) determined that the greenhouse gas emissions from the Information and Communication Industry (ICT) – smartphones and mobile devices, prominently – will grow from 1% of total global emissions in 2007 to 14% by 2040. That’s more than half of today’s relative contribution from the globe’s entire transportation sector.
In 2010, smartphone use added 17 megatons of CO2 equivalent (17 MT-CO2-e) to annual global emissions. By next year (2020), smartphone emissions are expected to reach 125 MT-CO2-e/year – a 730% explosion in just 10 years.
Last year (2018), there were 2.5 billion smartphone users.  Belkhir and Elmeligi suggest that if there aren’t serious efforts to reduce or eliminate smartphone use in the near future, the number of smartphone units across the globe may reach 8.7 billion by 2040.
This is unsustainable, dramatically undermining global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.

This past weekend, climate change protesters took to the streets across the world by the hundreds of thousands.
Many of these protesters were children and youth.  They decided to skip school last Friday to demonstrate just how deeply concerned they are about the Earth’s climate.
There is little these young people can do to save the planet from extinction as far as directly influencing government policy.
However, there is something that they – and we – can do that would make a difference in reducing our CO2 emissions impact: give up our smartphones.
Permanently.
And encourage all our friends and family members to do the same.
Widespread smartphone renunciation would be a symbolic testament to our commitment to rescuing the planet from the oncoming climate catastrophe.
It’s not too late…yet.  Shall we begin?

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the course of a 12 hour period on a cloudless day, 500 Wm-2 of solar energy pummels past the ocean surface to depths of 20 or more meters, warming up the first 2 meters of the ocean by 2.0 K.

Image Source: Fairall et al., 1996
In contrast, the infrared radiation absorbed and re-emitted in all directions by CO2 molecules cannot penetrate past the ocean’s 0.1 to 1 mm “thick” skin layer.

Image Source: Skeptical Science blog
Clouds and Ocean Domination
How much solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth system’s heat reservoir – the oceans, where 93% of the globe’s heat energy resides – is significantly determined by changes in decadal-scale cloud cover.
Direct short wave and long wave (i.e., “greenhouse effect”) forcing from the reduction or increase in cloud cover dominates as the modulator of Earth’s energy budget changes.
CO2’s influence is minimal and easily overwhelmed in these processes, as “the greenhouse effect of clouds may be larger than that resulting from a hundredfold increase in the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere.”


Image Source: Ramanathan et al., 1989, Wielicki et al., 2002
Satellite observations of decadal-scale cloud cover changes indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s about 3 to 6-7 Wm-2 of direct short wave forcing was additionally absorbed by the Earth’s oceans.  This may account for the warming trend in recent decades.

Image Source(s): Ogurtsov et al., 2012 , Pinker et al., 2005, Goode and Palle, 2007
CO2’s Honey Bee-Sized Contribution
According to a widely cited analysis of the CO2 radiative contribution to the Earth’s greenhouse effect, there was a 0.2 Wm-2 per decade forcing associated with a CO2 change of 22 ppm during 2000 to 2010.
The seasonal mean range for DWLWR (downwelling long wave radiation) reaches amplitudes of ~30 Wm-2 over the course of months.  This range is more than a 100 times larger than the entire DWLWR CO2 forcing contribution over 11 years.

Image Source: Feldman et al., 2015, Okulaer, 2015
CO2 concentration changes are registered in parts per million (ppm, 0.000001).  This means that for the 100 ppm rise in CO2 from the last glacial period to the warm interglacial we enjoy now (from ~180 ppm to ~280 ppm), the gaseous representation of CO2 in the atmosphere rose from <2 parts in 10,000 parts to <3 parts in 10,000 parts.
Since it took about 5,000 years for CO2 to rise by 1 part in 10,000 parts, this is the forcing equivalent of 0.006 Wm-2 per decade using the calculations of Dr. James Hansen (and the IPCC).

A CO2 forcing of 0.006 Wm-2 per decade is “about a third of the energy required to power a honey bee in flight.”
Image Source: Hansen et al., 2012 and  Ellis and Palmer, 2016
Uncertainty, Errors 10-100 Times Larger Than CO2 Forcing
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), uncertainty in the factors influencing the ocean heat flux reach amplitudes of 20 Wm-2.  This uncertainty is more than 10 times larger than the entire forcing contribution from CO2 since 1900 (<2 Wm-2).
“Unfortunately, the total surface heat and water fluxes … are not well observed. The uncertainty in the observational estimate is large – of the order of tens of watts per square metre for the heat flux, even in the zonal mean.” – IPCC AR4 (2007)

Image Source: IPCC AR5 (2013)
The IPCC also identifies error ranges for long wave (LW) forcing that range between 5-15 Wm-2.

Image Source: IPCC AR4 (2007)
The Earth’s energy budget is assumed to be imbalanced, as more energy is said to be absorbed by the system than leaving it.
During 2000-2010, Earth’s energy imbalance was believed to be 0.6 Wm-2. The uncertainty range for this value was ±17 Wm-2, meaning the energy imbalance could have ranged anywhere from -16.4 Wm-2 to +17.6 Wm-2, which is more than ten times larger than “the changes to the net surface fluxes associated with increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”

Image Source: Stephens et al., 2012
The ARGO data measuring ocean heat content launched in the early 2000s, but the coverage still leaves much of the non-uniformly warming and cooling regions of the ocean unsampled.  Sampling errors can range anywhere from 10 to 200 Wm-2.

Renowned Climate Scientists Ask A Never-Answered Question
In late 2013, five American Physical Sociey (APS) climate scientists published a framing document designed to re-examine the physical basis for the IPCC’s “consensus” position(s) on climate change.
Using the IPCC’s acknowledgement of ocean data uncertainty and low confidence that an anthropogenic signal can be detected amid the noise of natural variability, a cogent question was posed pertaining to the claims of certainty that humans exert fundamental control over the the climate of the Earth system.
The question has never been answered.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate sensitivity and the warming pattern
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2018, we reported on a paper that derived the sensitivity of our climate system with the best data available. Lewis/Curry (2018) reached the result: 1.3 °C for doubling of the CO2 in the atmosphere with a rise (Transient Climate Response), long-term equilibrium (ECS) of 1.7 °C (see Table 3 of the paper).
The numbers hardly react sensitively to the choice of (larger) time windows, they fluctuate very little, whether one evaluates 1870…2016 or 1930…2016. There has been a whole series of precursor studies also from other authors who also arrived near these quite small values. Also papers examining historical periods (last glacial maximum to pre-industrial) do not contradict these low figures.
So the much more dramatic sensitivity estimates, especially from GCM model considerations (for General Circulation Models), — 1.86 °C for TCR and 3°C for ECS — are not applicable? “It’s not that simple,” some activists insist because then the low sensitivity of the Earth’s climate would not necessitate urgent action to reduce greenhouse gases.
So how can we save the GCMs from empiricism with their worrisome projections? A key argument so far is this: models predict a different spatial distribution of ocean warming than what we observe:

 

Fig.3: The warming patterns derived by models (top) and the observed patterns. Of particular importance is the fact that the CMIP5 models indicate a rather uniform warming of the tropical Pacific as a result of the (mainly man-made) forcing (hence the model-mean), but the observations show a significantly stronger warming of the western tropical Pacific compared to the eastern one.  The images were generated with the KNMI Climate Explorer.
So it could well be, activists say, that the deviation are just a “whim of nature”, an internal variability, and after the end of this rather random episode, the warming becomes much stronger on a global scale on accordance to the models. There is talk of “trajectories” which were and will be possible, and the observations strongly deviate negatively because they are a random one of the possible warming patterns. In short: “What we have observed so far is not the real reality, but it will certainly get much worse. Believe the climate models!”
2 new papers
Here we present two current papers that provide explanation. To start: The observations of the warming rate are correct, the deviating patterns of the climate models are caused by their inadequacies and these patterns will not change.
In Dong et al (2019), the authors show that if the convective regions with many clouds in the western Pacific warm up more strongly than those with hardly any convection in the eastern Pacific, the overall global warming is much less pronounced.
Let’s take a look at the clouds in the tropical Pacific:

Fig. 4: The convection(CAPE Index) over the tropical Pacific. The west-east gradient can be seen clearly. Source.
Convection in the western tropical Pacific leads to an increased heat radiation into space, which means that the warming there can be reduced much more effectively than would be possible with a stronger warming of the eastern Pacific with less convection, see Fig. 4.
The paper finds:
For the west Pacific patch, warming is communicated to the upper troposphere, which warms the whole troposphere across all latitudes, causing a large increase in outgoing radiation at the TOA. Furthermore, the patch of warming locally decreases tropospheric stability, measured here as estimated inversion strength (EIS), but increases EIS remotely over tropical marine low clouds regions, yielding an increase in global low cloud cover (LCC) which enhances the global SW reflection….The results first highlight the radiative response to surface warming in tropical ascent regions as the dominant control of global TOA radiation change both in the past and in the future. …This surface warming pattern yields a strong global outgoing radiative response at TOA that can efficiently damp the surface heating, therefore producing a very negative global feedback.”
It is therefore a clear physical mechanism that leads to the observed stronger warming of the tropical West Pacific leading to lower global sensitivities (= stronger negative global feedback).
The second paper, Seager et al (2019), deals with the same phenomenon and concludes that the observed pattern is not random, but a direct result of forcing. It states:
The main features of observed tropical Pacific climate change over past decades are consistent with a response to rising CO2, according to fundamental atmosphere and ocean physics….However, the strength of the tropical Pacific influence on global climate implies that past and future trends will diverge from those simulated by coupled climate models that, due to their cold tongue bias (ein Streifen kühleren Wassers in Äquatornähe des Ostpazifiks, d.A.), misrepresent the response of the tropical Pacific to rising CO2.”
Climate models have such large deficits in the depiction of events in the tropical Pacific that they are globally incorrect in determining the response to the forcing (see Fig. 3) and systematically overestimate the sensitivity to the forcing (according to Seager et al, and Dong et al).
So will we read anything about this in the media? A possible headline might be: “Climate models calculate the future too hot! Don’t hold your breath.
PlayStation climatology
We eagerly await to see whether the results of these two important studies will even be included in the IPCC’s forthcoming progress report. Here hundreds of pages dealing with model projections would have to be critically revised. One more reason for us to trust empiricism and “PlayStation climatology”.
But what is to become of the “panic” which Fridays for Future wishes to impose on us? Policymaking is hot because the models are too hot. Which scientists have the courage to be responsible and to enlighten FFF and policymaking?

Antarctica rapidly cooling in recent decades
In a review of the scientific literature, Lüning et al. 2019 report Antarctica as a whole has undergone a cooling trend in recent decades.
The Antarctic Peninsula has cooled at a rate of -0.5°C per decade since the late 1990s.
West Antarctica as a whole has “slightly cooled” (or the warming has “plateaued”) over the past two decades.
East Antarctica “has not experienced any significant temperature change since the 1950s” with  ice sheet mass gains and cooling during the past 15 years.
Rising CO2 leads to Antarctic cooling
Antarctica contains about 90% of the world’s ice.
Because the continent averages -28.2°C in summer and -60°C in winter, inducing even partial retreat for an ice sheet that averages 2.3 kilometers in height would require a substantial amount of heat energy.
This effectively rules out a significant human influence.
According to scientists, raising CO2 concentrations does not even lead to warming in Antarctica. Actually, scientists find Antarctica cools in response to rising CO2 concentrations, which means we humans may be contributing more to ice mass gains than to losses.

Natural variability – clouds, wind, localized solar heating – drive Antarctic ice melt
The surface melting of portions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has received quite a bit of attention in media circles, often accompanied by scary warnings of ice sheet collapse and catastrophic sea level rise.
For example, Dr. James Hansen – admitting his doomsday predictions are tendentiously designed to be “persuasive” – has claimed sea levels will rise by 10 feet by 2065 mostly due to Antarctic ice sheet melt.

These harrowing warnings often seem to arise in response to observations of glacier calving events – large glaciers fissuring and breaking off from the ice sheet.
But glaciologists know that calving events are indicative of ice sheet thickening, not thinning. Glaciers calve when the ice accumulation has become so heavy and thick that the base of the ice sheet can no longer bear the load.

Image Source: Christmann et al., 2016
Yes, portions of Antarctica are undergoing ice melt. But ice sheet recession and advancement are both natural. And modern ice melt is well within the range of what occurs naturally for Antarctica.
Indeed, as Jones et al. (2016) conclude, natural variability “overwhelms” any forced response in satellite era trend observations.

Image Source: Jones et al., 2016
In two new papers, scientists identify the natural mechanisms driving the recession of some of West Antarctica’s glaciers in recent decades.
Scott et al. (2019) conclude surface melt is driven by wind currents and downwelling longwave radiation from clouds.
Stewart et al. (2019) find localized solar heating of surface water can explain melting in small portions of the Ross Ice Shelf.
Considering the total Antarctic meltwater contribution to sea level rise may only amount to 0.34 of a centimeter since 1958 (Frederikse et al., 2018), it is quite reasonable to conclude that nothing unusual, unprecedented, or concerning is occurring in Antarctica that could be said to fall outside the range of natural variability.

By Die Kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)

Photo: Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research
A good six years ago, Potsdam climate researcher Stefan Rahmstorf was outraged by the German Weather Service (DWD) at his at Klimalounge site.
The DWD had the audacity to contradict Mr. Rahmstorf. Specifically, it was about the presumed connection between the expansion of Arctic sea ice and cold winter weather. Rahmstorf’s simple model: Less Arctic sea ice causes cold European winters. At the time, he led a conglomeration of studies and claimed:
In my view, the above studies provide clear evidence of a link between Arctic ice loss due to global warming, and more frequent winter high pressures, particularly over the Atlantic-European part of the Arctic, and the associated influx of cold air into Europe. As we have often experienced it in recent winters – for example spectacularly in the first half of February 2012.”
In the process Rahmstorf became verbally wild and didn’t hold back dishing it out: The DWD was embarrassing, incompetent in questions of climate change, that it could not even read scientific papers, the arguments were flat. It was an unusually aggressive style of discussion that is seldom encountered in science. Rahmstorf original:
However, the taz quoted [German paper] yesterday the spokesman of the German Weather Service [DWD in German] as saying that if there was a direct relationship with the sea ice cover,  the entire winter would have to be very cold in Germany.  I think this trivial argument with which he would like to wipe from the table the climate research results shown above  is pretty embarrassing for the DWD.  Of course open water in the Arctic does not prevent stochastic weather variability. There will always be warm and cold periods. In all these studies it comes down to changing probabilities in the prevailing weather patterns: Petoukhov and Semenov estimate that the probability of cold winter extremes could triple, that is even in the Abstract. One wonders whether the DWD representative has read the relevant studies at all – and if not, why he feels the urge to comment on them in the media. Unfortunately, it has a certain tradition that meteorologists dealing with weather, are not familiar with climate science.”
More than half a decade has passed by since Rahmstorf’s rumblings. In the meantime, research has taken up the topic professionally and now has certainty: Rahmstorf was completely off the mark. Sea ice does not play a major role in the cold waves. Press release of the University of Exeter from August 12, 2019:

Arctic sea-ice loss has “minimal influence” on severe cold winter weather, research shows
The dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice through climate change has only a ‘minimal influence’ on severe cold winter weather across Asia and North America, new research has shown.
The possible connection between Arctic sea-ice loss and extreme cold weather – such as the deep freezes that can grip the USA in the winter months – has long been studied by scientists. Observations show that when the regional sea-ice cover is reduced, swathes of Asia and North America often experience unusually cold and hazardous winter conditions. However, previous climate modelling studies have suggested that reduced sea ice cannot fully explain the cold winters.
Now, a new study by experts from the University of Exeter, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the Energy and Sustainability Research Institute in Groningen, has shed new light on the link between sea-ice loss and cold winters. For the research, the international team combined observations over the past 40 years with results from sophisticated climate modelling experiments. They found that the observations and models agreed that reduced regional sea ice and cold winters often coincide which each other.
They found that the correlation between reduced sea ice and extreme winters across the mid-latitude occurs because both are simultaneously driven by the same, large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Crucially, it shows that reduced sea ice only has a minimal influence on whether a harsh and severe winter will occur. The study is published in leading science journal, Nature Climate Change.
Dr Russell Blackport, a Mathematics Research Fellow at the University of Exeter and lead author of the paper said: ‘The correlation between reduced sea ice and cold winters does not mean one is causing the other. We show that the real cause is changes in atmospheric circulation which moves warm air into the Arctic and cold air into the mid-latitudes.’ Over recent decades, the Arctic region has experienced warming temperatures through climate change, which has led to a large decline in sea-ice cover. This reduction in sea-ice cover means that areas of open water increase, which in turn allows the ocean to lose more heat to the atmosphere in winter – this can potentially alter the weather and climate, even well outside the Arctic.
Recent studies have suggested that the reduced sea ice or Arctic warming has contributed to recent cold winters experienced in the mid-latitude region – and that as the sea-ice reduces further through climate change, cold winters will become more frequent and severe. Now, this new study suggests that reduced sea ice is not the main cause of the cold winters. Instead, the cold winters are likely caused by random fluctuations in the atmospheric circulation.
Professor James Screen, an Associate Professor in Climate Science at the University of Exeter said: ‘The are many reasons to be concerned about the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice, but an increased risk of severe winters in North America and Asia is not one of them.’ Dr John Fyfe, a Research Scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, who was not involved in the research, writes in Nature Climate Change: ‘Blackport and colleagues put to rest the notion that Arctic sea-ice loss caused the cold mid-latitude winters, showing instead that atmospheric circulation changes preceded, and then simultaneously drove sea-ice loss and mid-latitude cooling.’
Minimal influence of reduced Arctic sea ice on coincident cold winters in mid-latitudes by Russell Blackport, James Screen, Karin van der Wiel and Richard Bintanja is published in Nature Climate Change. It was funded through a grant by the Natural Environment Research Council.”

Rising energy poverty with wind and solar energy penetration
Heating a home in the United Kingdom became 63% more expensive in the last decade, and electricity prices have risen by 80% in Germany since 2000. These developments can be traced to the increasing reliance on wind and solar energy in these developed countries (Lomborg, 2014).

Cold weather is 20 times more deadly than hot weather
A 2015 study analyzing 74 million deaths from 384 locations across the world (1985 and 2012) revealed that cold weather killed 20 times more people than hot weather did (7.29% of mortalities due cold vs. 0.42% of mortalities attributed to heat).
A new paper (Sera et al., 2019) analyzes atrributable mortality trends in urban areas – 340 cities in 22 countries – and found there was a similar (but less pronounced) discrepancy between attributable cold deaths and heat deaths (6.05% vs. 0.56%) during 1985-2014 for the world’s cities.

Cold weather death rates are increasing as heat deaths are declining
Two new papers (Díaz et al., 2019, Cheng et al., 2019) indicate that from Spain to Australia, heat-related mortality has been decreasing whereas cold-related deaths have risen in recent decades.
Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2018 found heat-related deaths declined in 7 out of 10 countries studied since 1985 and no trends in cold-weather deaths.
It is likely that the rise in both energy prices and energy poverty have heavily contributed to the higher incidence of cold-related mortality in recent decades.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate science skeptic Michael Kruger of Science Skeptical here writes that the earth has become GREENER and more fertile due to more CO2 and warming.

Source: Zhu et al 
Hard to believe, but the earth is not turning into a desert and more arid due to the CO2 increase in the atmosphere, like alarmist scientists and media like us to believe it is, but rather it is becoming greener and more fertile.
This is what scientists have found through the analysis of satellite data over the last four decades.

A study published in 2016 in Nature Climate Change proves that the earth has become considerably greener over the past decades.
For their study, the researchers led by Zaichun Zhu evaluated vegetation data recorded by three satellites between 1982 and 2009. The evaluation showed that since 1982, the plant world has become more luxuriant and thus greener on a large part of terrestrial land surfaces.
Area “twice the size of the USA”
“The biggest greening trends can be seen in the southeast of North America, in the northern Amazon region, in Europe, Central Africa and Southeast Asia,” said Zhu and his colleagues.  “This greening, which we have observed, is comparable in scale to an additional green continent twice the size of the USA,” says Zhu.
To find out exactly what is responsible for this increase in plant material, the scientists fed ten global ecosystem models with data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use and the development of climate factors such as temperature and precipitation. The result: 70% of the earth’s greening is due to the fertilizing effect of rising CO2 levels and 30% to climatic effects and other effects such as climate change, nitrogen deposition and changes in land cover.
Thus, in the high latitudes and in Tibet and other highlands of the mountains, the rise in temperatures is responsible for the fact that the vegetation there became more luxuriant. “Warming promotes photosynthesis and prolongs the growing season,” the researchers explain.
Increasing precipitation in the Sahel and South Africa
In the Sahel and South Africa, on the other hand, increasing precipitation is becoming noticeable. This makes the region more fertile and greener.
The rise in CO2 emissions and climate change therefore favor the greening of the earth and plant growth. Even Syria has greened.

The earth has become greener over the past 4 decades. This is the main conclusion of an international study published in Nature Climate Change on 25 April 2016. In 40 percent of the world’s regions, a significant increase in leaf biomass was observed between 1982 and 2015, only 4 percent showed significant losses of vegetation. The vegetation corresponds to the size of a continent twice the size of the USA.

The desert regions have also become greener, such as the Sahel on the border with the Sahara, the Fertile Crescent, which stretches across Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, and the former region of Carthage in North Africa, which used to be the granary of Ancient Rome.
These areas were already green and fertile in the climate optimum of the Holocene directly after the last ice age. From there, in the course of the Neolithic revolution, agriculture spread to Europe and Northern Europe.


The Sahel region has been greening for four decades:


This has been shown by a variety of studies.
Sahara shrinks by over 700,000 sq. km.
In 2018, Venter et al. recorded an eight percent increase in timber vegetation in sub-Saharan Africa over the last three decades using satellite imagery.
According to Wikipedia, the Sahara covers an area of around 9.2 million square kilometers. Eight percent of this corresponds to more than 700,000 square kilometers. This is an area almost as large as Germany and France together!

Lake Chad is growing
Even Lake Chad at the south edge of the Sahara is growing again and getting greener.

A greener Europe
Also in Germany it has not become more arid over the last four decades, as the media and climate impact researchers have recently informed us. Quite to the contrary:

Above all the north, the east, the low mountain regions and the Alps have become greener, as the satellite data show. The forest area is also growing in Germany, which is over 30% wooded. Between 1992 and 2008, the forest area in Germany “grew by an average of 176 square kilometers per year”.

Correction: 7 of 9 stations show no warming (not 8 of 9).
April data have been coming in, and they show that warming has been missing at many sub-Arctic stations over the past decades.
Canada cooling
Looking at 9 stations in Canada, where data from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA) are mostly complete, we see that the month of April hasn’t warmed at all despite all the hollering about a “climate warming crisis”.

Data source: JMA
In reality, the data show for April temperatures at 7 out of 9 Canada stations have been declining over the past 30-plus years!
Sweden no April warming in 2 decades
Next we look at data from 6 stations in the Nordic country of Sweden:

In Sweden, using stations with good data availability, we see that as a whole there has been no real April warming trend over the past 2 decades.
Irish spring is cooling
The same is true for the North Atlantic island of Ireland:

Data source: JMA
 
In fact, 5 of the 7 stations examined in Ireland have seen April cooling since 1993, a time when all the global warming hype was just getting started in earnest.
No warming at Antarctic station in 50 years
Finally. we move to the other end of the globe, Antarctica, and look at a plot of the annual data from the Japanese Showa research station:

Data source: JMA.
In an alleged time of “rapid warming”, nothing of the sort is actually happening. The Showa station, founded in 1957, in fact shows there hasn’t been any warming there in 50 years!

Connolly et al., 2019
“Observed changes in Northern Hemisphere snow cover from satellite records were compared to those predicted by all available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (“CMIP5”) climate models over the duration of the satellite’s records, i.e., 1967–2018. A total of 196 climate model runs were analyzed (taken from 24 climate models). Separate analyses were conducted for the annual averages and for each of the seasons (winter, spring, summer, and autumn/fall). A longer record (1922–2018) for the spring season which combines ground-based measurements with satellite measurements was also compared to the model outputs. The climate models were found to poorly explain the observed trends. While the models suggest snow cover should have steadily decreased for all four seasons, only spring and summer exhibited a long-term decrease, and the pattern of the observed decreases for these seasons was quite different from the modelled predictions. Moreover, the observed trends for autumn and winter suggest a long-term increase, although these trends were not statistically significant.”

“However, three combined gridded observational datasets, four reanalysis datasets, and most of the CMIP5 models cannot capture extreme precipitation exceeding 150 mm day−1, and all underestimate extreme precipitation frequency. The observed spatial distribution of extreme precipitation exhibits two maximum centers, located over the lower-middle reach of Yangtze River basin and the deep South China region, respectively. Combined gridded observations and JRA-55 capture these two centers, but ERA-Interim, MERRA, and CFSR and almost all CMIP5 models fail to capture them. The percentage of extreme rainfall in the total rainfall amount is generally underestimated by 25%–75% in all CMIP5 models.”
Bishop et al., 2019
“Atmospheric models forced by observed SSTs and fully coupled models forced by historical anthropogenic forcing do not robustly simulate twentieth-century fall wetting in the SE-Gulf. SST-forced atmospheric models do simulate an intensified anticyclonic low-level circulation around the NASH, but the modeled intensification occurred farther west than observed. CMIP5 analyses suggest an increased likelihood of positive SE-Gulf fall precipitation trends given historical and future GHG forcing. Nevertheless, individual model simulations (both SST forced and fully coupled) only very rarely produce the observed magnitude of the SE-Gulf fall precipitation trend.”
Chung et al., 2019
“Here, by conducting a comprehensive analysis based on multiple independent observational records, including satellite observations along with a large ensemble of model simulations, we objectively determine the relative contributions of internal variability and anthropogenic warming to the emergence of long-term PWC [Pacific Walker Circulation] trends. Our analysis shows that the satellite-observed changes differ considerably from the model ensemble-mean changes, but they also indicate substantially weaker strengthening than implied by the reanalyses. Furthermore, some ensemble members are found to reproduce the observed changes in the tropical Pacific. These findings clearly reveal a dominant role of internal variability on the recent strengthening of the PWC [Pacific Walker Circulation].”
Zhang et al., 2019
“Observed Southern Ocean surface cooling and sea-ice expansion over the past several decades are inconsistent with many historical simulations from climate models. Here we show that natural multidecadal variability involving Southern Ocean convection may have contributed strongly to the observed temperature and sea-ice trends.”

The study found that for Vietnam “none of the meteorological trends such as frequency, central pressure, wind speed, or storm intensity show any significant increase or decrease over the last four decades.”
But such a trend is not only seen for Vietnam, but virtually the entire Pacific. For example Japanese climate blogger Kirye compiled the stats on Japan typhoon landfalls and here we see they have not risen significantly, and the number of typhoons formed has even fallen:

Number of typhoons formed: jma . Number of typhoons landings in Japan: jma
At his latest Saturday Summary, meteorologist Joe Bastardi shows that this year’s hurricane season is off to a slow start as conditions in the main development zone will remain unfavorable for at least another week.
All of this tells us that global warming alarmists’ warnings of more frequent and intense storms have been completely WRONG so far.

Plods On…Regionally

Image Source: Gan et al., 2019
North America (180-0°N, 15-60°N) has been characterized as a “major cooling center” by the authors of a new paper (Gan et al., 2019) published in Earth and Space Science.
The continent warmed from 1982-1998, but a cooling trend since 1998 has nearly wiped out all the previous warming.
Overall, there has been no significant temperature change in North America since 1982.
The warming and cooling trends, especially the daily temperature minimum (Tmin), are well-correlated (r=0.71) with the path of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) during 1950-2014, leading the authors to conclude that the temperature trends over this 32-year period are “a result of” natural changes in the AMO.

Gan et al., 2019
The Key Role of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
in Minimum Temperature Over North America
During Global Warming Slowdown
“Daily Minimum temperature (Tmin) is an important variable in both global and regional climate changes, and its variability can greatly affect the ecological system. In the early 21st century, warming slowdown is seen over the North Hemisphere and North America is one of the major cooling centers.”
“In this study, we found that Tmin experienced an obvious decline in North America during warming slowdown period. Such Tmin decline is closely related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the correlation between the decadal components of Tmin and AMO reached 0.71 during 1950-2014.”
“According to composite analysis, the AMO on the positive (negative) phase takes two low-pressure (high-pressure) systems in the northeastern Pacific and the North Atlantic at night, accompanied by cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulations and warm (cold) advection in North America. Therefore, the analyses conclude that the Tmin decline during warming slowdown period is a result of the synchronous decrease of the AMO. The results emphasize the key role of AMO on the decadal variation of Tmin in North America.”

Another new paper renews the global warming “hiatus” debate and documents a 21st century cooling trend in northern China that also effectively snuffs out the previous decades of warming for the region.

Li et al., 2019
Satellite-based regional warming
hiatus in China and its implication
“Global warming ‘stalled’ or ‘paused’ for the period 1998–2012, as claimed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (IPCC, 2013). However, the early drafts of IPCC AR5 have no detailed explanation for this “hiatus” since 111 of 114 climate models in the CMIP5 earth system model did not verify this phenomenon. … In 2017, after a wave of scientific publications and public debate, the climate models as reported in IPCC remain debates, including definitions of “hiatus” and datasets (Medhaug et al., 2017).”

Image Source: Li et al., 2019
“The slowdown in global warming since 1998, often termed the global warming hiatus. Reconciling the “hiatus” is a main focus in the 2013 climate change conference. Accurately characterizing the spatiotemporal trends in surface air temperature (SAT) is helps to better understand the “hiatus” during the period. This article presents a satellite-based regional warming simulation to diagnose the “hiatus” for 2001–2015 in China. Results show that the rapid warming is mainly in western and southern China, such as Yunnan (mean ± standard deviation: 0.39 ± 0.26 °C (10 yr)−1 ), Tibet (0.22 ± 0.25 °C (10 yr)−1), Taiwan (0.21 ± 0.25 °C (10 yr)−1), and Sichuan (0.19± 0.25 °C (10 yr)−1). On the contrary, there is a cooling trend by 0.29 ± 0.26 °C (10 yr)−1 in northern China during the recent 15 yr, where a warming rate about 0.38 ± 0.11 °C (10 yr)−1 happened for 1960–2000. Overall, satellite simulation shows that the warming rate is reduced to −0.02 °C (10 yr)−1. The changes in underlying surface, Earth’s orbit, solar radiation and atmospheric counter radiation (USEOSRACR) cause China’s temperature rise about 0.02 °C (10 yr)−1. A combination of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other natural forcing (ONAT, predominately volcanic activity, and atmosphere and ocean circulation) explain another part of temperature trend by approximately −0.04 °C (10 yr)−1. We conclude that there is a regional warming hiatus, a pause or a slowdown in China, and imply that GHGs-induced warming is suppressed by ONAT [other natural forcing] in the early 21st century.”

German news site iwr.de here reports that the expansion of wind energy in Germany has “come the a stop” as the government has scaled back subsidies and enacted stricter permitting laws.
“As in April 2019, only nine new wind turbines went into operation nationwide in May,” IWR reported. “The year 2019 threatens to be a disaster for the wind industry in Germany.”
The IWR reported further: “In the first five months of 2019, only around 60 new onshore wind turbines went into operation nationwide. This is the result of an IWR evaluation of data from the market master data register of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA).”
“A catastrophe” for wind power
At Twitter green energy activist Prof. Volker Quaschning called the collapse a “catastrophe”, tweeting that the expansion of wind power “collapsed completely”. He added that “it will be impossible to meet the CO2 reduction targets” and that 40,000 jobs in the wind industry are “on the brink”.

Wind power in Germany has been met with increasingly fierce protest from citizens, especially from traditional environmentalists, who reject the industrialization of the landscape. Others point to wind energy’s volatile power supply, cost, noise pollution, general ineffciency and danger to birds and ecosystems.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) publisher Holger Steltzner wrote in an online commentary that the rescue of the global climate” has turned into a religious movement for “a large portion of German society”.
In his commentary, Steltzner remarks that even questioning the hundreds of billions spent thus far with hardly any progress in CO2 reductions to show is enough to get yourself branded as a heretic.
Freedom of dissent under attack
The FAZ publisher also questions the branding skeptics of manmade global warming as “climate deniers”, thus comparing them to Holocaust-deniers. He wonders: “Is this just the thoughtless use of language that abuses the historical break with civilization of the Shoah through banalization?”
Dissent over climate science in Germany is harshly scorned and the media and science community do not tolerate it.
In his commentary Steltzner reminds that man is in fact just one component in the complex climate system where huge natural factors are at play, and that the vast majority of skeptics do not even deny the climatic changes taking place today and how they are just as concerned about the environment as anyone else is.
Communist central planning
The trained business finance specialist and FAZ publisher writes that the German Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) has led to “price distortions, threatened grid stability and the writing off of modern power plants” and is accurately characterized as “eco-central planning”.

Causing more environmental harm than good
And what is even worse is that the Energiewende is likely causing more environmental harm than good. For example forests are being cleared to make way for the industrialization of the country’s once idyllic landscape, destroying biotopes with it. Stelzner adds that many Germans are filling up their cars with fuel that is 10% bio-fuel – which in turn leads to orangutans being shot dead so hat palm oil plantations can operate in places like Indonesia.
And according to Steltzer: “One fifth of Germany’s agricultural land is used for growing bio fuels.”
Another example of Germans trying to ease their conscience is the consumption of tofu in place of meat. He writes: “But weren’t there rainforests in Brazil, where today one soy plantation follows the next?”
Other examples Steltzner cites are avocado plantations in Mexico or the lithium-ion battery “which is supposed to save the climate, and whose raw material extraction in Africa, Russia or South America is devastating entire regions.”
“Illusion, religious zeal”
Steltzner also comments that it seems that environmental organizations have taken a page from the Vatican playbook, where in the past “believers could even acquire letters of indulgence for deceased people in order to wipe out sin penalties in purgatory.”
“Today the purchase of carbon dioxide certificates protects you from being plagued by a bad conscience while shopping in London,” Steltzner comments.
Though he perceives climate change as a real challenge, Steltzner summarizes by calling on Germany to “abandon the illusion that it can rescue the planet” and that “climate protection must not be driven with religious zeal”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBefore people jump into a debate about weather with veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann, they’d first better make sure that they really paid close attention at school and did their science homework.
In an debate at Twitter, the high-profile, seasoned meteorologist inadvertently exposed a shocking lack of comprehension of fundamental physics by some of Germany’s top climate officials, among them renewable energy expert Prof Volker Quaschning.
Hat-tip: Axel Bojanowski
High temperatures do not cause droughts
The Twitter exchange was unleashed by Kachelmann blasting the recent junk-science-driven media hype over another year of potential drought over Central Europe, and especially the false claim made by Prof. Quaschning that higher temperatures lead to more drought and forest fires. Kachelmann called this claim: false and “complete nonsense.” Kachelmann recently explained in a t-online article he penned:
Heat does not cause forest fires and is completely irrelevant. Forest fires are caused by the fact that it is dry longer, and then some fools – intentionally or not – throw something burning into the area, or park a very hot car over dry high grass and then drive away. The temperature on the day of the outbreak of forest fires does not matter.”
It’s the moisture, stupid
In other words, Kachelmann, dumps cold water on Quaschning’s claim that higher temperature is the factor behind drought and thus forest fires and Biblical-scale misery of the sort prophesized by Green fanatics. Kachelmann explains that temperature has nothing to do with the risk level of fire, and that the factor behind it is air moisture.
Shockingly, this fundamental physics law seemed to be unknown to “top scientists” such as Quaschning and others.
The FridaysFor Future activist and “renewable energy expert” Prof. Volker Quaschning kept insisting that temperature determined how dry soil would become, tweeting to Kachelmann: “Physics: More heat = more evaporation = drier ground = high forest fire risk = more forest fires. To shore this up he dragged Stefan Rahmstorf in to his side.

Confused about water vapor
Next, scientist Stefanie here tweeted a chart showing how much water a kg of air could hold versus temperature with the aim of showing Kachelmann he was wrong and that it was all about temperature:

Water vapor in grams per kilogram of air versus air temperature. Source here.
But this backfired on Stefanie when Kachelmann correctly demonstrated she did not understand the chart at all and that she had no idea what she was talking about.
That these climate experts would not know that water vapor in the air is the driving factor behind drought makes one wonder what faulty physics may have gotten applied to the climate models.
Throughout the entire thread there are attempts by the climate “experts” to assert their “academic authority”.
Other readers noted, for example, that despite extremely high temperatures in jungles, raging forest fires don’t break out in them. It’s not because of the temperature, but because of the moisture.
Climate alarmism becoming a sect
If any trend is emerging, it is that Kachelmann, a believer in man-made warming, is tiring of the fanaticism on both sides. He recently tweeted:
But unfortunately you can only stay in the sect if you join in the chattering of all the nonsense and depart from the grounds of science because of the purpose of saving the world allows all nonsense. Green and browns are outbidding each other in terms of lack of seriousness. It is getting very wretched.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterLaurent Alexandre: “Greta Thunberg instrumentalized by militant extremists“
In a stinging commentary at Le Figaro here, Dr. Laurent Alexandre, surgeon-urologist, a graduate of Sciences Po, HEC and ENA, and co-founder of the Doctissimo website, asserts that teenage Nobel Prize nominee Greta Thunberg is being shamelessly exploited and “is playing into the hands of economic interests for whom climate protection is of little importance”.

Dr. Laurent Alexandre. Image: https://twitter.com/dr_l_alexandre?lang=de
The French physician blasts the instrumentalization of the special child as “irresponsible” and that “revealing her neuropsychiatric state to the media should be a crime.”
“Substitute for the Marxist dictatorship” and “liberticidal agenda” 
Laurent Alexandre first comments that “the young people who follow Greta Thunberg are the useful idiots of the green dictatorship” much in the same way Lenin called left-wing bourgeois “useful idiots of the revolution” and that the failures of all Marxist models have “left the anti-liberals in turmoil.”
He writes that ecology today serves as “the ideal instrument to propose a new utopia that is a substitute for the Marxist dictatorship”. He adds: “By exploiting the youth, we are imposing a liberticidal agenda in the name of good feelings.”
Targets reachable only possible through a green dictatorship
Alexandre comments that Thunberg and the leftists are demanding that “we reduce our energy consumption by at least to a fourth, and believes that “imposing such a step backwards can only be achieved through the green dictatorship.”
The French physician even characterizes the militant activists as the “Khmer greens” and “green ayatollahs”, and reminds readers that the measures that are demanded by the greens will likely end up leading to more CO2 emissions rather than less because they are also demanding the shut down of nuclear power. If the nuclear power plants in France were to be shut down, fossil plants would need to be on standby and spring into action on sunless, windless days.

“Shamefully manipulated victim”

Alexandre implies that Greta Thunberg is unwittingly promoting “the interests of China and Russia” and that her demands would make us “highly dependent on rare metals needed for wind, solar and storage installations, of which China has a near-monopoly.”


The French urologist and book author describes Ms. Thunberg as “a shamefully manipulated victim” who needs to be protected, but adds that her radical ideas “must be attacked relentlessly”.
Criminal child abuse?

The tragedy of Greta Thunberg, Alexandre comments, is that “the child is all the more manipulable as her parents have made her disability public (which is irresponsible on their part)” and that as a doctor he believes that “revealing the neuropsychiatric state of minor children to the media should be a crime!”
He concludes:
We have known since Hans Asperger’s description of the syndrome in 1941 that Asperger’s children are sometimes brilliant but always fragile; instrumentalizing them is a moral fault.”
Movement of “deadly utopias”
Finally, Alexandre comments that following the green path will backfire because it would “aggravate global warming, increase the waste of public money, lead to a regressive green dictatorship and put us at the mercy of China and Russia. All liberal democrats, all Raymond Aron’s heirs, must combat the deadly utopias it conveys.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDuring the Mid-Holocene, when CO2 concentrations were stable and low (270 ppm), Antarctica’s massive Ross Ice Shelf naturally collapsed, adding the meltwater equivalent of 3-4 meters to sea levels.
Because CO2 concentrations changed very modestly during the pre-industrial Holocene (approximately ~25 ppm in 10,000 years), climate models that are predicated on the assumption that CO2 concentration changes drive ocean temperatures, ice sheet melt, and sea level rise necessarily simulate a very stable Holocene climate.
In contrast, changes in ocean temperatures, ice sheet melt, and sea level rise rates were far more abrupt and variable during the Holocene than during the last 100 years.
Modern ocean changes are barely detectable in the context of natural variability

Image Source(s): Rosenthal et al., 2013; Climate Audit
The temperatures of the global ocean have changed by just 0.1°C in the last 50 years, and just 0.02°C during 1994-2013.
According to Levitus et al. (2012), the global ocean’s 0-2000 m layer warmed by 0.09°C during 1955-2010, while the 0-700 m layer warmed by 0.18°C during that span.
In the context of the Pacific Ocean’s 0-700 m temperature changes during the last two millennia (Rosenthal et al. 2013), that 0.18°C change in 55 years is barely detectable.
Mid-Holocene centennial-scale sea level fluctuations were much higher than today’s
During the Early Holocene, when continental ice sheets were still in the process of melting, sea levels rose at rates that ranged between 10 to 60 mm/yr, or 1 to 6 meters per century (Ivanovic et al., 2017; Zecchin et al., 2015; Hodgson et al., 2016).
During the Mid- to Late-Holocene, when relative sea level was about 2 meters higher than today’s levels, sea levels rose and fell at rates of a half-meter to a meter per century, with 13 mm/yr reached on decadal timescales.

In contrast, the modern record indicates that sea levels only rose at a rate of 1.5 mm/yr during 1958-2014, or about 0.15 of a meter (6 inches) per century.

Widespread collapse of ice sheets from 5000-1500 years ago
A new paper (Yokoyama et al. [2019]) suggests that the Antarctic (and/or Greenland) ice sheets melted to such an extent around 5000 years ago that they added between 3 and 4 meters to sea levels.
The Ross Ice Shelf (Antarctica) underwent “widespread collapse” during this period (Yokoyama et al., 2016), subjected to rates of retreat and sub-ice shelf water temperatures much higher than present.
These melting events occurred while CO2 concentrations were a low and quiescent 270 ppm.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate scientist Professor Werner Kirstein was interviewed by alternative media outlet NuoViso,  and since the video was released early this month on Youtube, it has been viewed over 130,000, times.

Politics commissioning reports for money
In the interview Professor Kirstein tells moderator Robert Stein that CO2 emissions have no effect on the climate and that “politicians commission climate scientists to produce expert reports for money.”
“Public is being deceived”
Prof. Kirstein talks about the “conscious deception” of the public and how all research projects and publications by “climate scientists” only have the goal of confirming “man-made climate change” and that different scientific views are not welcome.
According to Kirstein, the public is being deceived with the false information and that the aim of politics is to find a way to collect further taxes and to collect levies.
“We currently see this with the climate tax, which is to be introduced soon,” Kirstein says.
Movement back to feudalism
In the interview Kirstein also says that in Germany it gets down to ideologues pursuing an ideological transformation. He says: “I say this a bit exaggerated: We are to become a society of craftsmen and farmers like under feudal rule. Above are the feudals and below are the peasants who pay taxes. Industry is a detrimental thing that destroys the environment.”

Doomsday scenarios are “false”
The now retired professor calls the doomsday scenario in which the polar caps melt due to the CO2 greenhouse effect and floods and climate refugee flows occur worldwide, false.
“Even if all CO2 emissions in Germany were stopped, the effect would still be zero. We have no influence on climate change,” he says.
Mann’s hockey stick “a fake”, Gore “a profiteer”

Kirstein also sharply criticizes the IPCC and Prof. Michael E. Mann, telling Stein: “The purpose of the IPCC report is to deceive people,” and that Mann’s famous curve in the shape of a hockey stick chart and the graphics “are fake.”
Kirstein also blasted Al Gore, calling him a “profiteer” of the spreading global warming hysteria.
Warming has been natural, “All this is normal”
“In truth, it was very warm in the 12th century in the Middle Ages. And about 150 years ago a small ice age came to an end, both were suppressed in Michael Mann’s curve,” Kirstein said. He calls the rise in temperature after the Little Ice Age a natural “reheating”.
Kirstein also says the assumption that the glaciers have declined due to global warming is also wrong.
“Glaciers come and glaciers go. But that also varies from region to region,” the expert says. “That is why the ice would increase at the South Pole and some glaciers would melt at the North Pole. All this is normal.”

NASA GISS likes to go back in history and alter the temperature figures from recorded datasets from all around the world, and then declare global warming.
Yet when we examine the (real) unadjusted, unaltered data, we find an entirely different story: In many places there has been little or even no warming over the recent decades. Many locations have seen cooling, in fact.
For example, using the data from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA), I checked 12 France stations which have August temperature data going back to 1982. Seven of 12 stations show August temperatures there have not warmed since 1990!

France August temperatures haven’t risen in almost 3 decades. Data source: JMA.
Looking at the 6 stations that have complete data going back to 1996 in the Scandinavian country of Finland, we also see the same story for August:

Three of 6 Finland stations have seen a cooling trend for August since 1996. The warming at the other three are statistically insignificant. Data source: JMA.
In neighboring Sweden we also find 6 stations for which the JMA has almost complete data going back over 2 decades:

Six stations in Sweden show a cooling trend for August since 1995. Data: JMA
These show no warming as well.
So when we look at the untampered data at stations in Europe, we find that there has not been any warming over the past recent decades. The story is the same at many stations scattered around the globe.
NASA GISS claims that warming has occurred because it simply changed the data to make it appear that way. Real data tell a different story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNDR north German television recently broadcast a report about the protests against a planned windpark near the German village of Kreien, some 200 km east of Hamburg.

White tail eagles being chased away from nest by loudspeakers in order to clear the way for permitting 14 wind turbines over 200 meters tall in Northern Germany. Image cropped: juvenile white-tailed eagle, Christoph Müller (www.christophmueller.org) – CC BY 4.0
One local resident told NDR television the area is already packed with 178 turbines, and that the plans to build 14 new over 200-meter tall behemoths are no longer welcome. The resident had noticed something very peculiar: a loudspeaker system that had been installed in the area of the planned project (see video, 0:20 mark).
Apparently the speaker system had been put in place to scare away white tail eagles that might get the idea to nest atop an adjacent nesting mast just meters away. The mast had been provided earlier for the purpose of providing a nesting place for the endangered bird species. White tail eagles nesting there would mean a sure stop of the project, and shooing them away would ensure the go-ahead for the wind project.
The sound of barking hounds

Eagles entering the area and looking to establish a nest there would be scared away by the sound of barking dogs blaring from the speaker (2:40). The result: keeping the nest empty and thus a free path for the construction of the wind park by wind project company UKA Nord.
Residents in the area have reacted angrily at the prospect of yet even more giant wind turbines getting erected in their area, and especially at the tactics used by UKA Nord to ward off potential nesting birds.
One local mayor described the loudspeaker measure as “unbelievable”.
Climate protection before habitat protection?
When asked to comment by NDR, windpark builder UKA Nord replied by text message claiming that the nesting mast was not “to protect birds” but instead was “a pure measure to prevent the expansion of wind energy, which is necessary for climate protection.”
Moreover, the written UKA Nord statement appealed to the local policymakers “to live up to their responsibility for transition to green energies and climate protection and strive for a constructive cooperation.”
At the 3:30 mark of the report, citizens are shown banding together to organize a citizen’s group against the project. So far they have seen some success. The UKA Nord has since turned off the speaker system and it’s been decided to dismantle it. Yet, plans for the construction of the park still have not been halted.

Australia’s election results are in, and once again major media are in state of shock.
The New York Times here for example called it a “stunning win” and claimed it was “propelled by a populist wave” that resembled “the force that has upended politics in the United States, Britain and beyond.”
The UK Guardian went on calling the result of the “climate change election” a “major upset”, complaining that in fact “the climate lost.”
The climate skeptic, German-language Ruhrkultour here commented that citizens have grown increasingly tired of the “climate hysteria”, and that this ultimately “cost Labour the election victory”.
Crosshairs on democracy
Now that the dust begins to settle, the search for answers begins in earnest. But as was the case in 2016 in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s stunning victory, don’t expect the losing side to acknowledge the truth and reality.
Rather look for them to search out a scapegoat. Expect them to even start criticizing democracy and blaming “misled voters”, who were deceived by fake news and populist disinformation campaigns. There will be more loud calls for even greater crackdowns on Internet social media platforms.
“Hope you die!”
The real reason for the loss by Labour is the towering arrogance that left of centre parties have been putting on display lately. Nothing illustrates this better than two tweets recently appearing:
Here’s the first by Australian academic, Daniel Best via Not Suit:

In other words it’s: “Vote for us, or eff yourself and die!”
That’s appalling. And these people think it’s “populism” or the “Russians” behind their losses? Try infantilism, and people being turned off by it.
Threats and insults
If these planet rescuers want to start winning elections again, they need to realize it’s their tantrummy, 6-year old attitude that’s turning everyone off. People are sick of — and frankly appalled — by all their phony “expertise”, bullcrap “consensus” claims, emotional hysteria and fake “climate crisis”. Never mind all the insults.
Yet, The Guardian pledges to get even more shrill about climate and use even bigger bogus threats.
Insulting the elderly
And here’s the second reaction, this one concerning the upcoming EU elections, by Matt Kelly


Source: Telegraph, via Twitter. Read story here.
So Mr. Kelly thinks the elderly are just disgusting incontinents who need constant cleaning up and cannot vote correctly.

Well, people are tired of being threatened and insulted into voting a certain way, and it’s people like Kelly and Best who are disgusting. This is the real reason why people aren’t voting for them.
Wishing us dead
And each time after they lose, none of us of course ends up dying and so in a tantrum they wish us all dead. Thankfully the majority of voters have been able to see through the infantile behavior.
In a way, The Guardian’s latest move ought to be welcome. It will only play into the hands of us “populists” and “deplorables” and ensure us more election victories ahead.

We often hear how the climate is changing everywhere, like in California.
Listening to the media we get the impression that the Golden State is drying out and risks burning up, before heavy rains hit. Others claim the state is facing “weather whiplash” because climate change will make the weather more extreme and volatile.
Today we take a look at the precipitation data of 7 stations spread across the state to see what changes have been happening. Used here are the data from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA) that cover the last 33 years.

Data: JMA.
As we can see, there has been no trend over the past 30 years. Variability also appears unchanged. California has always been a state characterized by alternating periods of drought and rainfall influenced by oceanic cycles like ENSO. The data show everything is within the normal range.
The real trend is the massive increase in media climate ambulance chasing where every anomaly gets hyped into something much more than it really is.

Michael Krueger
(Translated/ edited by P Gosselin)
In these times of Fridays for Future led by Greta Thunberg, all experts and self-proclaimed experts are talking about how badly the earth is doing and warning that planet earth is about to collapse unless action is taken immediately. It’s claimed that all experts agree on their vision of the future! Droughts, floods, crop failures and famines threaten – and millions of climate refugees will make their way from south to north.
These are the visions of the “climate impact researchers”. But is that really the case? The opposite is the reality.
Let us first take a look at the grain yield of the most important cereals grown in the world.

Global grain yields per hectare  for the most important grains. Source: Statista
Miracle upon miracle. The grain yields per hectare of corn, rice, wheat and barley have increased strongly over the last 25 years and have not decreased at all, despite all the climate horror claims.
In the case of maize, the yields per hectare have almost doubled. Maize yields have increased by around 80%, rice by around 65%, wheat by around 70% and barley by around 65%.
And this in times when droughts and torrential rains are supposedly reducing the harvest yields?

Global production of maize, rice and wheat. Source: FAOSTAT
If you look at the world harvests of the most important grains, they have also risen sharply over the last 25 years. The amount of maize harvested has roughly doubled, i.e. increased by 100%, the amount of rice harvested by about 75% and the amount of wheat harvested by about 80%.

If we look at global grain production and grain production in selected tropical countries, this has increased sharply since 1960. On average, production has quadrupled!

Exponential growth since 2000! Source: Worldwatch Institute
And when we look at the world grain production as a whole (wheat, rice and coarse grains), production has quadrupled since 1961!
This means that four times as much grain is harvested in the world as 60 years ago. The world population has only grown from 3 billion to over 7 billion in the same period. So it has only more than doubled a little bit

Maize and wheat yields for Germany and USA. Source: Felde 2009 as to FAOSTAT
The above figure shows how in Germany and the USA yields per hectare of cultivated land have risen sharply since 1960. Maize in Germany by approx. 130% and for wheat in Germany by approx. 120%. This is more than doubling. Maize in the USA has jumped by approx. 110%, for wheat in the USA approx. 75%. So almost doubling.

Grain production in tonnes and yield per hectare. Source: German Federal Office of Statistics
If we look at the development of grain production in Germany since 1950, we can see a significant increase both in the total harvest quantity and in the yields per hectare. The total grain production has increased by about 450%, the grain yield by about 350%.
Wheat yield (top), maize yield Germany (bottom). Source: Prof. F. Isermeyer, FAL Braunschweig
By international standards, wheat yields per hectare of cultivated land have risen worldwide. Germany, in particular, is distinguished in wheat cultivation by high yields per hectare and a strong increase in yields per hectare. The yield per hectare of wheat has more than doubled since 1970 and is four times higher than in other countries.
And maize acreage and maize yields have also grown strongly in Germany. In the last 30 years, the yields per hectare of maize have almost doubled and the area under maize has increased by about 75%.
Good news censored
The question is: Why don’t you hear about it in the media and news? As a rule, there are only reports of failed harvests and famines, but no new record harvests. Perhaps simply because this does not fit into the picture of a climate catastrophe?
Now imagine that the Arctic and Siberia would also become fertile arable land as a result of global warming and that crop yields increased even further as a result. Would that be bad or good?

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou really know that climate activism is going way off the rails when even a leading German socialist thinks the movement is becoming a threat to democracy. Leading German socialist politician Wolfgang Thierse warns of Greta Thunberg’s “anti-democratic”, uncompromising rhetoric. 
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne
“Anti-democratic affection”
Over the years a number of leading climate scientists and activists have expressed to some degree their frustration with democracy, hinting that the political system which incorporates the will of the common people in government has only gotten in the way of taking action against the “climate crisis”. What is needed, they suggest, is an elite group of Leaders to decide how to properly organize society. The average citizen is too stupid to make the right decisions.
Even some socialists are beginning to worry about the movement. For example German online flagship daily Die Welt here recently reported on how leading SPD politician, former President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Thierse sees in the words of climate activist Greta Thunberg an “anti-democratic affection” and thus he “warns against the climate movement”.
“Rigorism in climate debate”
Die Welt writes how Thierse also “warns against rigorism in the climate debate” and statements made by climate activist Greta Thunberg such as “that the climate does not tolerate compromises”.

Thierse made the comments to the Berlin “Tagesspiegel” in a video interview.
In Thierse’s view, such statements are “anti-democratic” and urges climate activists to take former German Chancellor Willy Brandt as an example when it comes to convincing the public on policy.

Thierse is not alone. Last month well-known nature filmmaker David Attenborough also told WELT: “The young climate activists see things in black and white, very clearly. They don’t yet know all the buts…”
In other words, the youth are being manipulated.
Attenborough added: “Maybe the young people don’t see the complexity of the problems to be solved and how to deal with them in a reasonable democratic way. Bringing the whole population along democratically is a big problem.”
German political scientist says climate movement like a religion
Also in a recent interview with German DLF here, political scientist Ulrike Ackermann said: “Rescuing the climate is almost like a religion.”  She warned: “It is of no use to paint the world catastrophe on the wall in an alarmism that can only be countered radically.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere has been a flurry of major May cold weather and snow reports coming in from a variety of regions across the globe, leaving global warming alarmists speechless.
Australia in ice box
For example, weather site electroverse.net here just reported on how the entire Australian land mass is getting walloped by extreme cold as the winter season begins there.
“It’s a cold snap affecting the whole country, it’s a big one,” says Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecaster Sarah Scully. Temperatures would be 10C below normal “even in the Northern Territory and Queensland.”
German mountain peak sees 6 meters of snow – in May!
Much of Europe has also been seeing unusually cold temperatures as well. Germany’s highest peak, Zugspitze, recently saw snow pile up to 6 meters – in May.
“That’s “the most in 20 years,” reported Michael Krueger of Science Skeptical.
“Very remarkable” snow in Corsica
Dalmatia, Croatia has seen “its coldest May start since records began and a “very rare and very remarkable” just blanketed the Mediterranean island of Corsica.

New England: “Been brutal”…can’t remember such “delayed” spring
In North America in New England on May 13th, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine were forecast to get snow, and not just dustings, but real cover.
Vermont-resident and NTZ reader Indomitable Snowman PhD wrote by e-mail 2 days ago: “It’s been brutal.  I can’t remember a ‘spring’ – ever – that has been this slow and delayed.  The grass is starting to turn green, but there is barely a hint of leaves on the trees.”
“Huge piles of snow” linger
Indomitable Snowman Phd – also a pilot – also described how he had just flown some friends up to Quebec City on May 12th and how on the way up they could see “there was still some snow in the forest and in the ditches”:

Footage by Indomitable Snowman PhD.
As the footage shows, one might think it’s February over Vermont, and not mid-May!
By the early morning of May 14, the National Weather Service (NWS) in Vermont reported snowfalls of 3.5 inches in Danville, 2.3 inches in Williamstown, 2.5 inches in Plainfield and 2 inches in Marshfield. Mount Washington in New Hampshire even saw a foot of new snow. Mid-May!
Major Greenland glacier “slams on the brakes”
A sign that the globe, or at least a major part of the Arctic (a claimed “climate canary in a coal mine”) has been seeing a major warming slowdown is that European satellites have been showing how a mighty Greenland glacier has “slammed on the brakes”. The Global Warming Policy Foundation site reports:


In the 2000s, Jakobshavn Isbrae was the fastest flowing ice stream on the island, travelling at 17km a year. […] But now it’s all change. Jakobshavn is travelling much more slowly, and its trunk has even begun to thicken and lengthen.”

In the modern climate, North Slope, Alaska (north of the Arctic circle) has a mossy tundra terrain and an absence of trees.
About 8,000 to 9,000 years ago, with CO2 levels lingering around 260 ppm, this region was imbued with both trees and animal species that today live many 100s of km south (Kuzmina et al., 2019).
Even during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 17,000 to 20,000 years ago, when CO2 levels hovered near 190 ppm, “summer temperatures were higher here than they are today” (Kuzmina et al., 2019).

Image Source: Kuzmina et al., 2019
During the LGM, horses were the most common large animal living in this region of the Arctic, followed by bison. Horses had a “substantial dietary volume” of dried grasses year-round, even in winter (Guthrie and Stoker, 1990).
Even though CO2 concentrations have reached 410 ppm today, 220 ppm higher than during the LGM, Northern Alaska is too snow-covered and frigid for horses to occupy this region now.
As Guthrie and Stoker, 1990 conclude, the Arctic is presently “no place for horses” because there is too little for them to eat, and the food there is to eat is “deeply buried by snow”.

The authors of a new study (Jiao et al., 2019) point out that temperature changes in the Tianshan mountains are “mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods.”
Despite some warming since the 1950s, the authors do not maintain CO2 changes were an influencing climate factor in the 1680-2012 reconstruction.
The 1708-1801 period is shown to be about 1-2°C warmer than the the 1950-2012 period.

Jiao et al., 2019
“Regional climate change is affected by large-scale climate-forcing factors, such as solar activity and atmospheric–oceanic variability (Fang et al., 2010; Linderholm et al., 2015; Rydval et al., 2017). On the one hand, based on the MTM analysis results, the temperature changes in the study area are mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods (Li et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015). The tree-ring chronology was developed by samples of Schrenk spruce collected from the National Nature Reserve of the Western Tianshan Mountains. The mean minimum temperature in the growing season is the main and stable limiting climate factor. Therefore, the mean minimum temperature series in the growing season during 1680–2012 was reconstructed based on the STD chronology.”
“In the past 333 years, the mean minimum temperature has roughly experienced three relatively cold periods and relatively warm stages (relatively cold periods: 1680–1707, 1802–1911 and 1935–1997; relatively warm periods: 1708–1801, 1912–1934 and 1998–2012). By analyzing similar trends in regional temperature changes in our reconstruction series with drought events, large volcanic eruptions and other reconstruction series around the study regions in Xinjiang and even large-scale regions, we found that the mean minimum temperature of the reconstruction was accurate and reliant. Moreover, the mean minimum temperature was influenced by solar activity (sunspots) and large-scale atmospheric–oceanic fluctuations (NAO, WPO, ENSO, TBO) based on the MTM and spatial correlation analysis.”

Of the 53 total tide gauges, 45% (24) are negatively accelerating, 14 document falling sea levels, and just 11 have sea levels rising more than 3 mm/yr.

A cooling/non-warming North America
A few months ago, Gan et al. (2019) reported that the North American continent as a whole (180-0°, 15-60°N) “is one of the major cooling centers” in the Northern Hemisphere, with temperatures dropping after 1998 and no signficant net change since the early 1980s apparent.

The contiguous United States has even undergone an overall cooling or non-warming trend – especially on the Eastern half – since 1900 (Partridge et al., 2018).

U.S. East Coast has been expanding, not shrinking, since 1960
A few months ago Armstrong and Lazarus (2019) indicated “trends in recent rates of shoreline change along the U.S. Atlantic Coast reflect an especially puzzling increase in accretion, not erosion.”
From 1830 to 1956, shorelines eroded at the rapid rate of -55 cm per year on average. Since 1960, the U.S. Atlantic coast has been expanding (accretion) at a rate of +5 cm per year.

New study: 45% of 53 long-term North America tide gauges show negative acceleration
A new paper (Boretti, 2019) utilizes 90+ years of continuous tide gauge data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) to record the sea level trends from the West Coast (20) and East Coast (33) of North America.
Boretti finds the average sea level change for the 20 West Coast tide gauges amounts to -0.38 mm/yr, whereas the average sea level rise rate is +2.22 mm/yr for the 33 East Coast gauges. Much of the relative differences between the two coasts can be explained by land subsidence (sinking) or uplift (rising).
“Nearly the entire East Coast of the United States, from Massachusetts and parts of Maine to Florida, is known to be affected by subsidence [6–10]. Subsidence is much stronger along the East Coast of the United States and significant only in Southern California along the West Coast, and it increased in intensity since the mid-1900s.”

Image Source: Boretti, 2019
Of the 53 total tide gauges on North America’s East and West coasts, 45% (24) are negatively accelerating, 14 document falling sea levels, and just 11 have sea levels rising more than +3 mm/yr.
The overall acceleration for both the East and West coasts amounts to just +0.0028 mm/yr² and +0.0012 mm/yr², respectively, when using the late 1800s and early 1900s as the starting years.
An analysis by Houston and Dean (2011) showed that when the sea level trend begins in 1930, the U.S. coasts as a whole actually decelerated overall (-0.013 mm/yr²) during 1930-2007.

These modest trends would not appear to support the conention that modern sea level changes in this region are rising at alarming rates.

The two authors focus on the economic direction of the German economy and how it is seriously threatened by the country’s obsession with climate protection and how policymakers are neglecting its key industry: automobiles.
Weik and Friedrich say that German policymakers are naive, and are in the process of ruining the German economy in their panic to rescue the planet from an alleged climate meltdown.
“Everybody is talking about the climate, yet no one is talking about the economic climate,” Weik and Friedrich say.
“Hard as nails” recession threatens Germany


The two economists warn of a coming recession, one that will be “hard as nails” as the ecological activist onslaught on German industry picks up.
According to the Weik and Friedrich, already “the seasonally adjusted and real order intake of German industry fell by 8.6 percent compared to the same month last year! For the tenth month in a row it is going down!”
“Companies such as Deutsche Bank, BASF, Bayer, Siemens, Thyssen, Ford have begun “massive job cuts or announced plans to do so”.

The two authors say that new buzzwords, such as “unemployment” and “layoffs”, will soon be dominating the media and that “no one will talk about the shortage of skilled workers any more, let alone climate change”.
Climate activist policymakers “negligently gamble away” prosperity 
They write that the outlook for Germany’s key industry, automobiles, “is pitch-black” as the assault against the internal combustion engine continues unrelentingly.
The authors write: “If we actually continue to destroy our car industry – which accounts for 21 percent of our GDP – then everyone must be aware of the consequences.”
These consequences would mean economic shock waves not only for Germany, but also for Europe which massively relies on revenues generated by the German automotive industry, the authors explain.


Weik and Friedrich write that Germany’s policies “negligently gamble away” prosperity and that the “coming climate change in the economy will nip all irrelevant sham debates in the bud.”
“People in the streets”…”different demonstrations on Fridays”
They add: “The heated discussions and hysteria are a sign of the famous late Roman decadence and a warning sign of the crash. For many who demonstrate today, there will be no jobs in Germany tomorrow.”
Weik and Friedrich warn that as the “economic climate changes drastically and more and more people are standing in the streets without work […] we will see completely different demonstrations on Fridays. But then it will be too late.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDuring the last few hundred years, species extinctions primarily occurred due to habitat loss and predator introduction on islands.  Extinctions have not been linked to a warming climate or higher CO2 levels.  In fact, since the 1870s, species extinction rates have been plummeting.

Image Sources: Loehle & Eschenbach (2012), BBC, Wrightstone, 2019
In the past it has been widely reported that high and abruptly changing CO2 concentrations led to climate conditions that were “too hot for complex life to survive” on the planet.
More recently, though, scientists have determined that the opposite may have been true: mass extinction events occurred during periods of global cooling, expansive ice sheet growth, and marine-habitat-destroying sea level drops of more than 100 meters.
In fact, of the 5 previous mass extinctions, volcanism-induced glaciation is thought to be responsible for the 1st, 3rd, and 4th events, with the 2nd unknown and the 5th from an aseteroid impact.  None of these explanations have ties to CO2 concentrations or sudden warming.

As suggeted above, scientists usually attribute the mass extinction cooling events to the same mechanism previously thought to cause sudden-onset warming: widespread volcanic eruptions.
More volcanism means more sulfate aerosols blocking out solar heat from penetrating into the ocean.  With “repeated clusters” of volcanic events gradually accumulating over time, decades to centuries of cooling can ensue.

Image Source: McGregor et al., 2015

New (2019) research suggests that the global cooling extinction events could have been triggered by a solar-astronomical influence.
Again, this suggests no clear link between mass extinctions and CO2-induced or sudden-onset warming events.

By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)

Arctic ice melt barely impacting AMOC. Day After Tomorrow scenario remains fantasy, new study suggests. Figure: R. Curry, http://editors.eol.org/eoearth/wiki/File:OCP07_Fig-6.jpg; CC BY 3.0
Stefan Rahmstorf never tires of claiming the Gulf Stream system (AMOC, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) is being strongly weakened by the fresh water input of the melting Greenland ice. In his Klimalounge blog at the end of January 2019 he wrote:
 ”The physics behind how global warming and ice melt (both without a doubt caused by man) is slowing down the AMOC is understood …”
Yet, on April 26, 2019, Dukhovskoy et al published a new paper in the JGR Oceans, which concludes that Greenland’s meltwater is having little impact on the AMOC:

Role of Greenland Freshwater Anomaly in the Recent Freshening of the Subpolar North Atlantic 
The cumulative Greenland freshwater flux anomaly has exceeded 5000 km3 since the 1990s. The volume of this surplus fresh water is expected to cause substantial freshening in the North Atlantic. Analysis of hydrographic observations in the subpolar seas reveal freshening signals in the 2010s. The sources of this freshening are yet to be determined. In this study, the relationship between the surplus Greenland freshwater flux and this freshening is tested by analyzing the propagation of the Greenland freshwater anomaly and its impact on salinity in the subpolar North Atlantic based on observational data and numerical experiments with and without the Greenland runoff. A passive tracer is continuously released during the simulations at freshwater sources along the coast of Greenland to track the Greenland freshwater anomaly. Tracer budget analysis shows that 44% of the volume of the Greenland freshwater anomaly is retained in the subpolar North Atlantic by the end of the simulation. This volume is sufficient to cause strong freshening in the subpolar seas if it stays in the upper 50–100 m. However, in the model the anomaly is mixed down to several hundred meters of the water column resulting in smaller magnitudes of freshening compared to the observations. Therefore, the simulations suggest that the accelerated Greenland melting would not be sufficient to cause the observed freshening in the subpolar seas and other sources of fresh water have contributed to the freshening. Impacts on salinity in the subpolar seas of the freshwater transport through Fram Strait and precipitation are discussed.”
In the main text, it is stated:
“This result agrees with the previous study of Saenko et al. (2017), who also show that the GFWA of similar magnitude (and even double of this magnitude) has negligibly small impact on the SPNA thermohaline fields, barely impacting AMOC.”
GFWA means the meltwater anomaly from Greenland and SPNA of subpolar North Atlantic. A study from 2017 finds something similar, which of course does not get mentioned by Rahmstorf in January, 2019. The fresh water from Greenland is mixed down to depths of 1000 m and thus the amount is practically meaningless for the AMOC, the paper finds.
What now?
For years we have been hearing from certain circles of climate research that we are melting the Greenland ice sheet and thus a “Day After Tomorrow” scenario gets conjured up. But a very recent paper finds that this is not the case. And when we report on it, are we thereby questioning the “credibility of climate science”, or are we correctly reflecting the progress made in climate research because the work is getting cited? Climate alarmists are desperately trying to convey the wrong image of a monolithic “climate science”, which in reality does not exist at all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYet another scientific paper presents evidence that the Arctic region was warmer than recent decades during the 1930s, leading scientists to conclude there is “still-insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms governing the Arctic Climate System.”

Araźny et al., 2019
A comparison of bioclimatic conditions on
Franz Josef Land (the Arctic) between the
turn of the 19th to 20th century and present day
“Air temperature in 1899–1914 during three expeditions was 1.8–4.6 °C lower than the modern period in winter (Oct–Apr). However, during the 1930/31 expedition it was 4.6 °C warmer than the years 1981–2010. Our results relate to what has been called the ‘1930s warming’, referred to by various authors in the literature as the ETCW or the ETCAW.”
“In individual months, the highest negative anomalies were identified in Calm Bay (hereafter CB) in January 1914 (− 7.4 °C) and in February 1900 (− 6.8 °C). In contrast, during the 1930/31 expedition, it was 4.6 °C warmer than the present day in CB [Calm Bay]. Such a high thermal anomaly was influenced by a warm autumn and winter, especially February 1931, when the average monthly temperature was 10.7 °C higher than in the modern period.”
“In approximately the last 140 years, there have been two periods of significant temperature increases in the Arctic. The first began in around 1918–1920 and lasted until 1938 and has been called the ‘1930s warming’ (Bengtsson et al. 2004). Other works have referred to this period as the ‘Early Twentieth Century Warming’ (ETCW, Brönnimann 2009) or the ‘Early Twentieth Century Arctic Warming’ (ETCAW, Wegmann et al. 2017, 2018). Our results confirm the observations for the last expedition from the historical study period in 1930/1931. These years covered the warmest part of the ETCW.  In turn, the second increased warming of the Arctic began around 1980 (Johannessen et al. 2004) or according to Przybylak (2007) in about the mid-1990s. Changes in overall atmospheric circulation have long been believed to have been the cause of the ETCW (e.g. Scherhag 1937). As the modern climate warming (since 1975) has progressed in a largely similar manner to the progression of the ETCW (Wood and Overland 2010; Semenov and Latif 2012), there has been renewed interest in the insufficiently well-explained causes of the ETCW using the latest research methods, including, primarily, climate models. An analysis of the literature shows that the cause of such a significant warming in the present period is still not clear. There is even controversy over whether the main factors in the process are natural or anthropogenic, although the decided majority of researchers assign a greater role to natural factors (Bengtsson et al. 2004; Semenov and Latif 2012). It would appear that the greatest differences of opinion on the causes of the ETCW are to be found in works presenting climate models (see, e.g. Shiogama et al. 2006; Suo et al. 2013), which is an excellent illustration of the still-insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms governing the Arctic Climate System.”

Another new paper indicates that West Greenland retreat rates were much higher “(400-800 m/yr)” during the 1930s and 1940s than “after 2000 (>200 m/yr)”.
Vermassen  et al., 2019
A reconstruction of warm water inflow to Upernavik Isstrøm
since AD 1925 and its relation to glacier retreat
“A link between the physical oceanography of West Greenland and Atlantic SSTs has indeed been suggested previously: a positive phase of the AMO [Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation] is related to an increase of warm Atlantic waters flowing towards and along the SE and W Greenland shelf (Drinkwater et al., 2014; Lloyd et al., 2011). Our data indeed supports that the AMO influences bottom water temperature variability along the West Greenland shelf and shows that this influence is strong within Upernavik Fjord.
“Despite differences in the timing and magnitude of the retreat of the different glaciers, they broadly share the same retreat history. High retreat rates occurred between the mid ‘30s and mid ‘40s (400-800 m/yr), moderate retreat rates between 1965-1985 (~200 m/yr, except for Upernavik) and high retreat rates again after 2000 (>200 m/yr).”
“[O]ur study shows that while warming of ocean waters in Upernavik fjord likely contributed to the retreat phases during the 1930s and early 2000s, ocean warming is not a prerequisite for retreat of Upernavik Isstrøm.”
“This is important since it implies that the future potential oceanic forcing of Upernavik Isstrøm will depend on changes related to circulation in the North Atlantic (i.e. the AMO). Since the meridional overturning circulation strength and associated heat transport is currently declining, (Frajka-Williams et al., 2017), this may lead to cooling bottom waters during the next decade in Upernavik Fjord and most likely also other fjords in West-Greenland.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vahrenholt: Merkel’s stricter climate targets to cost Germany another 3 trillion euros.



The stricter climate protection targets recently announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Protestant Church Congress would put a considerable burden on the German economy and every single household.
If the goal formulated by Merkel to increase the CO2 reduction target from 90 to 100 percent by 2050 were really achieved, then it would result in additional costs of around 3000 billion euros, according to a calculation by the former Hamburg Senator for the Environment, Fritz Vahrenholt (SPD).
7.6 trillion euros, twice Germany’s GDP
The cost of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 thus would rise from an estimated 4600 billion to 7600 billion euros. This is about twice as much as Germany’s gross domestic product in 2018, according to the magazine Tichys Einblick in its issue published Monday.

For these figures, Vahrenholt relies on a study commissioned by the Federal Government on the costs of the Energiewende (transition to green energies), which the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the German Academy of Engineering Sciences (acatech) and the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities presented in November 2017.

Additional 320 euros per month per household
According to the study, the researchers expect costs for reaching the 90 percent target to reach 4600 billion euros by 2050. According to the study, this corresponds to an average additional burden on households in Germany of 320 euros per month.

Reductions getting increasingly difficult, expensive

An increase in climate protection targets beyond the 90 percent aim, as Angela Merkel has now formulated as a target, is particularly expensive because all “favourable” possibilities for CO2 reduction and replacement have already been exhausted.
“The technical expenditure for any further reduction is much higher since all potentials for direct electricity use have been exhausted and low-cost fossil natural gas must be replaced by elaborately produced synthetic energy sources,” the researchers wrote in 2017.
3000 billion euros for last 10% reduction
On the basis of the cost assumptions made by the researchers, Vahrenholt extrapolated the costs for the last ten percent. According to this approach, the costs for the last ten percent are 3000 billion euros. By way of comparison, in their government report the researchers stated that the additional costs of increasing the climate protection target from 85 to 90 percent amounted to 1300 billion euros.
1050 euros per household – per month!

If the demand of the “Fridays for Future” demonstrators were met and climate neutrality were to be achieved by 2035, the costs would be incurred in a shorter time. According to Vahrenholt, the cost burden would rise to 1050 euros per household – per month!

===============================================
World may get another climate realist leader
By Kirye
As the working class struggles economically, signs of profound anti-establishment shifts are emerging in Japan, spurred on by a new political leader who is a climate and energy realist.
Rising Japanese political star Taro Yamamoto aims to shake up Japan’s crusty establishment down to the core. Image: Twitter here.
Growing poverty in Japan
In the House of Councillors election held on July 21, 2019, I voted for the recently founded Reiwa Shinsengumi party led by Taro Yamamoto . Why? According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), 57.7% of families, 81％ of single mothers and 1 of 7 children feel impoverished. These are shockingly dismal social and economic indicators for one the richest countries on the planet.
Part of this is due to an increased tax burden that have made people unhappy and poorer while the super rich profit from tax cuts. Moreover, Japanese finance minister Tarō Asō suggested that Japan could even learn from constitutional changes made by the Nazi party! Japanese president Shinzo Abe spends time on the golf course.
In contrast Taro Yamamoto, leader of the newly minted Reiwa Shinsengumi party, helps out at soup kitchens and fights for Japan’s many forgotten citizens.
Enough is enough – historic election result
Today there’s finally a growing feeling among the Japanese citizenry that the country is in need of toppling establishment structures and bringing in a new president and political party who work for justice, life and on behalf of the poor.
In the recent Upper House election, Mr. Yamamoto hauled in 992,267 votes, and so was the candidate with the highest number of votes in history in proportional representation. Now the Reiwa Shinsengumi has gone from a political group to political party, and is becoming more famous as many Japanese media are reporting on the phenomenon.
Energy and climate realist

When it comes to energy, party leader Yamamoto wants to use natural gas thermal power as a main energy supply, and to end the use of nuclear power (Japan is an earthquake country, so his ideas are valid).
On climate, I personally have never heard Mr. Yamamoto mention that CO2 is bad, despite so many Japanese people having been brainwashed by the media into believing we have to cut CO2 emissions. Many Japanese have never even heard of Climategate. Where does he stand on climate?

Yamaoto at JAJ press conference.
To find out, last Wednesday I took part in a press conference held by the Journalists Association of Japan and had the opportunity to tell Mr. Yamamoto the real story of how CO2 is not climate’s main driver (1:34:34 mark and 1:38:00). In summary I told him: Just this year alone, almost 200 new papers which do not support the anthropogenic global warming theory have been published so far. Last year the number of skeptic papers was 504. Moreover, NASA’s website shows only 166 stations have data that go back to 1880, and less than 1000 stations have the data from January, 1919.
I also told Mr. Yamamoto how distinguished Japanese climate scientist Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, who used to work for NASA, reminds us that only 5% of Earth’s surface has been adequately measured by thermometer over past 100 years and how the surface temperatures have been substantially affected by the urban heat island effect. Also how the real world’s temperature remains a far cry from the IPCC’s prediction.
He answered:  “In a sense it is wonderful if the fact spreads abroad and that it is controversial.”
He added:
Some people say that warming is not good, and are criticizing me because I aim breaking with nuclear power generation and I am pushing the generation of thermal power.”
This is a fresh perspective that has long been lacking in Japan, and so Mr. Yamamoto could act as a figure for changing public perception on the issues of climate and energy. Eventually the facts will win out because the sham cannot hide reality for long.
Growing roster of worldwide climate realist leaders – alarmists in panic
Already a number of worldwide leaders have expressed strong doubts on CO2 being the dangerous climate driver, for example US President Donald Trump, Russia President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and the UK’s Boris Johnson. Others include Eastern European leaders, Italy’s Matteo Salvini and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. The momentum is real. So it’s little wonder global warming alarmists are becoming increasingly spooked and hysterical.
Some people believe that Mr. Yamamoto will be the next President of Japan, and I hope so. If it becomes reality, the world will be adding yet another climate realist to the growing roster of climate-realist leaders.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman political analysis and commentary site Freie Welt here has an article on how millions of  Germans are increasingly unable to afford electric power.

Germany’s Energiewende ‘ risks shorting out as millions struggle to pay their electricity bills. Image cropped here.
While a number of commodities such as electronics, electrical goods and computing power across the country – and the globe – have gotten much cheaper over the years due to development, the price of electricity in Germany has “more than doubled since 2000”.
5 million struggling to pay for their power
Almost all of this is due to the Germany’s ‘Energiewende’: the transition to renewable energies and away from nuclear power and fossil fuels like coal.
According to the Freie Welt: “Last year, almost five million people in Germany had problems paying their electricity bills” as some 4.8 million defaulting customers “were threatened” by power companies.
“As a consequence of unpaid bills, almost 344,000 households were temporarily cut off electricity during the same period. This marks new records,” the Freie Welt reports.
“Next increases already in the pipeline”

The situation for Germans will likely get a lot worse before it gets better. Less than a third of the country’s power is supplied by wind and sun, and as that share rises – as is planned – the costs will only continue to climb and make the hardship for the poor even worse.
“Three quarters of the energy suppliers had raised their prices at the beginning of this year again on the average by five per cent,” Writes Freie Welt. “The next increases are already in the pipeline.”
At 29.42 cents a kilowatt-hour, Germans pay among the highest prices in the world.
Further price increases in the medium to long term
According to Valerian Vogel of the utility Verifox: “In view of the major challenges facing the German electricity system, consumers must prepare themselves for further increases in electricity prices in the medium to long term”.
In Germany, the high prices are mostly made up of taxes, levies, grid fees and green energy feed-in tariffs.
In its report, Freie Welt cites figures from the Federal Network Agency, which says wholesales price for electricity are mostly to blame for the excruciatingly painful prices levels. According to the Federal Network Agency, “Last year was around 30 percent higher than the average price for 2017.”
Fridays for Future (unintended) Revolution
Ironically, the Fridays for Future (skip school) movement yesterday issued a call in Berlin for an even more rapid completion of the coal and fossil fuel power phaseout. They demanded that this phaseout be completed by 2030 rather than 2038. The movement, backed by activist scientists, is in fact calling for a revolution.
And a revolution they will get, but very likely not the kind they are bargaining for.

In a recently published paper published by a team lead by Jessica Wang of the Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine titled: “Hydroclimatic variability in Southeast Asia over the past two millennia,” in the journal of Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Wang et al found good evidence of a positive correlation with solar activity since 1200 CE, “contrary to the findings in previous studies”.

Wang is developing high-resolution and precisely dated stalagmite stable isotope records (of C and O) to evaluate past hydroclimate variability. She and her team of researchers compare the new records with regional tree-ring records and stalagmite records from the broader Asian monsoon region to better understand regional hydroclimate dynamics.

The researchers use global climate model simulations to better understand the role external forcings (i.e., solar activity) have on precipitation variability over the last two millennia.
What follows is the paper’s abstract:
The spatiotemporal variability of the Asian Monsoon (AM) over the last two millennia has been attributed to a combination of external solar and volcanic forcing and/or internal coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics, but the relative importance of these mechanisms remains unresolved. The present knowledge of multidecadal to centennial-scale AM variability over Mainland Southeast Asia is not well-constrained, despite substantial progress in understanding seasonal to decadal variability from tree ring records. Here we present the first high-resolution stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) speleothem record from northern Laos spanning the Common Era (∼50 BCE to 1880 CE). The δ13C record reveals substantial centennial-scale fluctuations primarily driven by local water balance. Notably, the driest period at our site occurred from ∼1280 to 1430 CE, during the time of the Angkor droughts, supporting previous findings that this megadrought likely impacted much of Mainland Southeast Asia. In contrast, variations in stalagmite δ18O reflect changes in rainfall upstream from our study site. Interestingly, the δ18O record exhibits a positive correlation with solar activity that persists after 1200 CE, contrary to the findings in previous studies. Solar-forced climate model simulations reveal that these δ18O variations may be driven by solar-forced changes in upstream rainout over the tropical Indian Ocean, which modify the δ18O of moisture transported to our study site without necessarily affecting local rainfall amount. We conclude that future rainfall changes in Mainland Southeast Asia are likely to be superimposed on multidecadal to centennial-scale variations in background climate driven primarily by internal climate variability, whereas solar forcing may impact upstream rainout over the Indian Ocean.”

Yet another paper showing that climate variability was common over the past 2000 years without added CO2 from man.
Confirmed by 100s of studies
Alarmists may wish to dismiss these findings, but Wang’s results are in line with those of hundreds of other studies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to German online business daily Handelsblatt here, German electricity are set to get significantly more expensive in 2019 due to the power grid becoming 8 percent more expensive to use.  This will make already painfully high electricity prices even more excruciating. 

The Handelsblatt cites calculations by German think tank “Agora Energiewende”, which reports that revenues for the network operators total 24 billion euros this year.
According to Agora, “Costs previously referred to as grid costs are expected to rise by a total of six to eight percent.” For household customers the grid already amounted to 7.17 cents per kilowatt hour in 2018, which compared to 6.79 cents per kilowatt hour levied for the renewable energy feed in tariffs. This year it was 6.41 cents.
According to the Handelsblatt, “The EEG levy and grid fees thus add up to amounts of over 50 billion euros” annually. The rising grid fees are due to “massive investment in grid expansion to integrate renewable energies into the grid”. And because Germany’s Energiewende (transition to green energies) still finds itself in the early stages, the costs are projected to keep rising.
In Germany, electricity prices of around 30 cents per kilowatt hour for private consumers are among the most expensive worldwide, and are in fact “the highest in Europe” Handelsblatt reports.
What is especially warped about Germany’s electricity market is that one kilowatt-hour of electricity “is available in wholesale for less than five cents”, reports the Handelsblatt. This shows how grotesquely distorted the price structure has become since renewable energies have been mandated and nuclear power plants taken offline. .
The high end-user prices have become a huge burden on private individuals and energy intensive companies alike. German think tank Agora is demanding reforms and more transparency in the country’s murky electricity pricing structure.

PlayStation3 is out. I’m under-whelmed. The most odd part of this is
that people are actually leaving their jobs, schools, and family to camp out in
front of stores to be first to get a GAME. Go figure. Are they so lacking for
meaningful things in their life that this becomes the most important thing?

For those who wonder why there’s a bunch of hoopla surrounding this game,
part of the reason that it is so anticipated is that this game box has a very
powerful CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) combo that gives tremendous
real-time 3D rendering capability for unsurpassed realism. Reportedly up to 2 Teraflops per second (2 trillion floating point operations per second) which is the kind of performance a supercomputer like a Cray used to boast ten years ago. While the PS3 isn’t quite there yet for 100% photorealism in real-time, I anticipate PS4 or PS5 to render things so realistically you won’t be able to discern it from photographic or film imagery. Here is an image
from the PS3 game ""Gran Turismo"". Is it real or rendered?



Another feature of the PS3 is the built in Blue-Ray DVD
player, which plays HDTV DVD’s now starting to be available. Hi-Definition TV is
catching on and for gaming with a big 52"" flat panel it can be an immersion
experience. I’ve seen demos at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Vegas. Its
really getting hard to tell what is real anymore.
Living in alternate reality is OK for some people…its
a diversion. But I worry about the kind of folks whom get so addicted to this
that they have to camp out to get the next game. What sort of future do they
have? Gaming doesn’t put food on the table, nor help our economy, or foster good
citizenship.
My son will be asking for these games someday. When that
day comes I plan to call up Michael Jones and ask him to help me give my son a
crash course in hiking the natural world.
In the meantime, I may just buy one of these:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Jena-Germany based climate science and renewable energies- critical European Institute For Climate and Energy (EIKE) has sent a cease and desist letter to Wikimedia headquarters in San Francisco demanding that the platform remove all the “false content” in the German language entry about the organization.

Slander: Wikipedia’s German site describes EIKE as an organization for “networking and public relations work for the organized climate denier scene”. Image cropped from Wikipedia here.
EIKE is a non-profit association with the statutory purpose of promoting science and research in the field of climate and energy. According to EIKE, “We pursue our statutory association purpose independently of political parties, religious communities, other associations or organizations.”
EIKE claims the German Wikipedia entry about its activities and members has very little to do with the reality and that the content was in large part written to mislead readers rather than inform them and to slander the institute. “The content of the Wikipedia entry is filled with falsehoods which results in casting EIKE in an extremely negative light,” the Jena-Germany based scientific think tank commented by e-mail.
“Almost every single claim made by the Wikipedia entry about EIKE is either maliciously misleading, grossly distorted or just outright false, wrote EIKE Vice President, Michael Limburg in an e-mail.  “The Wikipedia entry was designed to produce a contemptuous image of the organization with the aim discrediting it.” The list of deletions demanded by EIKE is 7-pages long!
“Climate denier scene”
In one example, the Wikipedia entry claims that the EIKE “is described by independent voices from science and media as the center of the politically active and organized scene of climate deniers in Germany” (see image above) and that “its goal is to promote systematic attacks on climate science’s findings.”
“This is absolutely false and malicious,” EIKE responded by e-mail when asked for comment.
In the long grievance to Wikipedia, the attorney representing EIKE wrote that the claim made by the Internet platform’s authors was “made up”, “untrue and unlawful”, adding: “My client does not deny climate change, and their goal is not to systematically attack the findings of climate science.”
Among the many other alleged false statements made at the Wikipedia site was also that EIKE “pretends to be scientific, deliberately disseminates misinformation and tries to influence parties.” In the cease and desist letter, the attorney representing EIKE called that statement “false” and “unlawful”, adding that EIKE is independent of all political parties and that EIKE “conducts its own research on climate and energy and publishes it in scientific journals and at international scientific congresses.”
Renowned speakers at EIKE conferences

Over the years, EIKE has organized around a dozen international climate and energy conferences, which often feature many renowned, yet dissenting scientists, such as astrophysicists Prof. Nir Shaviv of the University of Jerusalem and Prof. Henrik Svensmark of the Danish National Space Institute (DTU Space) in Copenhagen. Other speakers have included leading oceanographer Prof. Nils-Axel Mörner.
EIKE also notes that the conferences are open to any scientists, and that it is not solely a place where “climate deniers” meet.
Unlawful Holocaust slandering
Under the Wikipedia entry subheading “Grundsätze des Vereins” (principles of the association) it states that EIKE is “an organization of climate deniers” – a claim that is not only false but also “unlawful”, the EIKE attorney wrote. Climate alarmists routinely use the “denier” term in order to slander and equate global warming skeptics to Holocaust deniers.
Big Oil/coal conspiracy
In the Wikipedia entry about EIKE, it is repeatedly suggested EIKE is funded by the oil and coal industry and the Koch Brothers through its links to CFACT, Heartland Institute, and other organizations.
The attorney representing EIKE underscored: “EIKE a scientific institute and think-tank, organized as a non-profit organization, with the sole purpose of presenting facts concerning climate and energy without any ideology. Yet, it is suggested that my client financially represents the interests of the oil and coal industry, which is demonstrably not true.”
In total, EIKE sent a list 7 pages long of false statements and misleading claims to Wikipedia demanding that they be removed.
Intent to unjustly inflict damage to reputation
EIKE has been working for sometime to get the needed corrections implemented at the Wikipedia site, but without success. Officials at EIKE say the falsehoods and deceptive claims platformed by Wikipedia risks inflicting great damage to their reputation and the overall perception among the unknowing public.
EIKE officials recently sent a cease and desist letter to Wikimedia head offices in San Francisco. But according to EIKE, they received a response from Wikimedia that said there were no German speakers there, and so they couldn’t help.
Wikipedia is a worldwide platform whose content is regularly posted in almost every major language worldwide. Over the years it has been sharply accused of poor quality control and political bias, especially concerning hot-button political issues such as climate science.

In the interview Köppel called the climate movement a “political mass trance that that is currently rolling over us” and that children have been prompted to skip school and protest an “infantilization” of politics.
In the interview, Köppel notes that the planet has warmed “only one degree since 1860” and that this increase is nothing unusual in a historical context.
“Dangerous” state intervention

When the BAZ points out that his opinion is more one from the fringes, Köppel dismisses it, telling the “Evangelium of climate prophets” is being challenged by renowned scientists like Richard Lindzen “while policymaking is already convinced that this climate hysteria is to be understood as absolute truth.”
He tells the BaZ that “it is dangerous that the state is massively intervening in our economy and energy supply.”
“State collective much more dangerous”
Later in the interview Köppel calls the belief that man has the main control over climate “presumption, religious delusion and self-denial.” When asked whether or not the state indeed should take action with regards to the “climate crisis”, Köppel replied “no”  and added: “The state climate collective is much more dangerous than climate change.”
“Dangerously one-sided” debate needs to be countered
So aggressive were the questions posed by the BaZ that Köppel asked: “Stop with this CO2 demonization”, telling the BAZ: “We have a hype about the climate. I’m talking about a new solar religion, a kind of political trance. It is the duty of citizens to take countermeasures. The debate is dangerously one-sided.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the calculations of Dr. James Hansen, the radiative influence derived from the increase in CO2 during the last deglaciation was so negligible that it equated to “a third of energy required to power a honey bee in flight” (Ellis and Palmer, 2016).

Image Source: Ellis and Palmer, 2016
Between about 22,000 and 17,000 thousand years ago, Earth’s sea levels were about 120 meters lower than they are now because much of the Earth’s seawater was locked up in kilometers-thick continental ice sheets.
Then, about 14,500 years ago, nearly the entire Northern Hemisphere abruptly warmed up by about 4-5°C within a span of about 20-30 years as sea levels rose at rates between 3 and 6 meters per century (Ivanovic et al., 2017).  Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperatures warmed by 3°C in less than 90 years during this time.

Image Source: Ivanovic et al., 2017
The last ice age ends and the Holocene begins
The Earth cooled and warmed and cooled and warmed for the next 3,000 years, during which time there was a gradual overall increase in global temperature of about 5-6°C superimposed on the abrupt decadal- and centennial-scale climate undulations.
By 11,700 years ago, when Greenland warmed up by 10°C within about 50 years (Steffensen et al., 2008), the last ice age glacial period ended and the Holocene interglacial warmth we now enjoy officially commenced.

The honey bee-sized magnitude of CO2’s influence during the last deglaciation
There are many adherents to the Shakun et al. (2012)-endorsed position that “increasing CO2 concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age.”
And yet one has to wonder how this conclusion could have been reached when the explosive warmings of degrees-per-decade occurred without any clearly detectable changes in CO2.
Not only that, but as Ellis and Palmer (2016) point out, Dr. James Hansen’s calculations of CO2’s radiative influence during the ~5,000 years of the Pleistocene-to-Holocene 5-6°C deglaciation suggest a 0.006 W/m² per decade CO2 forcing during this period, which is “about a third of the energy required to power a honey bee in flight.”

Image Source: Ellis and Palmer, 2016
With this vanishingly small forcing magnitude, why is it nonetheless thought that CO2 is a macro-level driver of Earth’s temperatures and a determinant of deglaciation transitions?

Recently Japanese scientist Dr. Kiyohiko Ikeda (@IkedaKiyohiko) retweeted about a newspaper book review appearing in the Sankei Shinbum, which reported on how Marc Morano’s best selling “The Politically Incorrect Guide To Climate Change” was hitting the book market in Japan.

今日の産経に、地球温暖化の不都合な真実がありました。いよいよ地球温暖化、CO₂削減とは何だったか、明らかにされています。国連の気候変動サミットも、色あせて、白々しく感じたものでした。風力発電のアホらしさは最初から分かっているのに、なぜ被害を拡大したのか。悪党よ pic.twitter.com/0yFnfS8KXL
— 由良　守生 (@zan4736511) October 8, 2019

Mr. Morano’s Politically Incorrect Guide book had been recently released in the Japanese version, translated from the English by Tadashi Watanabe, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry of the University of Tokyo and Professor of Tokyo University of Science Graduate School.
Mann lost in court
The Sankei Shimbun book review, authored by Shohei Nagatsuji, explains how this summer an event occurred and challenges the foundation on which the existing IPCC bases its CO2 global warming theory, but which went unreported in Japan. This August, the reliability of Dr. Michael Mann’s hockey stick graph was rocked after he had lost a defamation case against a Canadian researcher [Dr. Tim Ball], who had sharply criticized the hockey stick graph.
“Hundreds of factors” behind climate change
The Sankei Shimbun also reports how Mr. Marc Morano’s book -「地球温暖化」の不都合な真実』- presents the criticisms of Prof. Mann and the inside workings of IPCC.

The Japanese daily explains how Morano’s book cites scientists who say “temperature is mainly determined by water vapor and clouds, so even if CO2 is doubled or tripled, the situation would be almost the same” and that there are in fact “hundreds of factors contributing to climate change.”

Marc Morano’s best selling “The Politically Incorrect Guide To Climate Change” now in Japanese.
All focus on CO2 is “misplaced”
The Japanese daily also says Mr. Morano’s book shows how scientists from the UK and New Zealand saying that putting all the focus on CO2 is ” misplaced”.
“…amazed at each chapter”
According to the Sankei Shimbun:
We recommend you take this book because it is easy to read. You’ll be amazed at each chapter. It is full of scientific controversies and scandals over global warming that are not well understood in Japan.”
No consensus
The Sankei Shimbun concludes that Mr. Morano’s book provides “an overall picture of the global warming issue” and that it is an issue which “can be viewed from multiple perspectives.”
Overall it’s a very positive, welcome review for Marc Morano’s “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change” here in Japan. Recently Morano’s book has climbed near the top of the charts for books under Environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOur German skeptic friend Snowfan here keeps us up to date on the latest ODEN “Ship of Fools” attempt to travel across an Arctic that is supposed to be ice-free by now.
The incentive to cross the Arctic passages in the summer is huge. Doing so would mean at least a week of fame with the media blaring out your name along with grossly hyped headlines of an Arctic ice meltdown due to global warming. One of these years, a ship might get lucky and manage to get through the Northwest Passages.

Image from: Ship-Tracker ODEN  Snowfan
And the pressure to do so is enormous because over the last ten years Arctic ice volume has even rebounded slightly and if that trend continues, as some expect, the global warming alarmist may never get another chance to get through. Last year failed.

Mid-summer Arctic ice volume has grown modestly over the past 13 years, thus casting doubt Arctic is melting further. Chart: Kirye.
The latest “Ship of Fools” episode this year is an attempt by the above mentioned Swedish ice breaker ODEN, which hopes to get through. Unfortunately conditions so far this summer have not been as favorable as they hoped, Snowfan reports:

This year Arctic sea ice in the area of interest on July 14 is (unexpectedly) thicker than it was last year at the same time, and a heck of a lot more than what some climate models and Al Gore projected a bit more than 10 years ago:

In Lancaster Sound and the Barrow Strait (eastern access point to the NW-Passage) sea ice in mid July 2019 is up to 3 meters thick, i.e. 2 meters thicker than in mid-July 2018! Source: DMI Arctic Sea Ice Thickness. Image: here.
Also defying the models is the extent of ice cover for July 9 at the Baffin inlets Regent – Boothia. Over the last 50 years, there’s been little trend change:

The latest on ODEN, according to CruiseMapper, is that it is currently well off course. Snowfan writes:
In the night of July 19, 2019, the Ship of Fools has deviated far from its planned route southeast of Coburg Island and is positioned this morning west of this island. We await with suspense to see if the climate fools will overcome the thick ice on July 20, 2019 and arrive on time in Pond Inlet.”

An eye-opener book by Japanese MIT climate scientist now partly available in English at Kindle.

MIT climate scientist Dr. Mototaka Nakamura’s writes global warming data are “untrustworthy”, “falsified”.  Image: http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/
Not long ago we reported on a recently released book authored by Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a scientist who received his doctorate from MIT and worked at NASA: “Confessions of a climate scientist The global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis“.
After that post, I personally urged Dr. Nakamura to write the book in English.
Today I am very pleased to announce that a newly released Kindle version is now available with the important parts in English. You can download it for free for a limited time.
Please do download it! The English parts are within the Japanese text.
“Untrustworthy” and “falsified” data

In the book Dr. Nakamura writes how in the 1980s he became “seriously concerned about the predicted ‘catastrophic global warming due to the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere'” and how the issue motivated him to study the atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the North Carolina State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and to become a climate scientist.
Ironically, rather than finding any robust scientific basis underpinning the hypothesis, Dr. Nakamura wound discovering just how “untrustworthy” and “falsified”  the data behind global warming really are.
“We also do not know for certain how the earth’ s climate has changed in the past 100 years or longer, although we do know well how regional climate has changed in limited regions, such as Europe, North America, and some parts of Asia,” he writes. “A quasi-global observation system has been operating only for 50 years or so, since the advent of artificial satellite observation. Temperature data before then were collected over extremely small (with respect to the earth’ s entire surface area) areas and, thus, have severe spatial bias.”
Confident other scientists will speak up on “fraudulent claims”
On whether other scientists will speak up, Nakamura wrote that he is confident that “some honest and courageous true climate scientists will continue to publicly point out the made by the ‘mainstream climate science community'”.
As an expert, Dr. Nakamura also believes that the climate simulation models used for climate change predictions have two “serious flaws” among many. One “fatally serious flaw” is the oceanic component of the models and the “grossly oversimplified and problematic representations of the atmospheric water vapor”.
Nothing except a propaganda tool
Dr. Nakamura concludes that the “global surface mean temperature change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public.”

Since 1930, seawater pH trends have risen slightly, meaning sharply rising CO2 has been coincident with less, not more, ocean “acidification”.

Is “acidification” occurring too rapidly for species to adapt?
Scientists (Wei et al., 2015) estimate that the ocean’s global mean surface pH may have declined (i.e., become less alkaline and thus more “acidic”) by -0.07 to -0.08 in the last 200 years — from ~8.12 during pre-industrial times to 8.04 to 8.05 today.
It is commonly claimed that this long-term decline in pH, or “acidification”, is occurring far too rapidly for the oceanic biosphere to adapt.  Consequently, there are alarmist claims that the pH changes in the last few hundred years are so extreme they will lead to a mass extinction event.

Image Source: Wei et al., 2015
A pH change of -0.07-0.08 over 200 years is an overall long-term pH change rate of about -0.0003 per year.
By way of comparison, from one season to the next, or over the course of less than 6 months, pH levels naturally change by ±0.15 pH units, or twice the overall rate of the last 200 years. 
On a per-decade scale, the changes are even more pronounced.  Oceanic pH values naturally fluctuate up and down by up to 0.6 U within a span of a decade, with an overall range between 7.66 and 8.40.  This is decadal rate of pH change is larger than the overall 200-year trend (0.07-0.08) by a factor of 8.

If the oceanic biosphere was incapable of adapting to the modern rate of long-term change (-0.07-0.08/200 years), or to the frequently-realized seawater “acidic” values of 7.7 or 7.8, one would think this vulnerability would have been observed at some point in the last 200 years.
Reconsidering the “acidification” starting point
Many of the highly cited pH trend studies choose a starting point from the recent decades rather than from a long-term record.  Dore et al. (2009), for example, chose 1988.

Using recent decades has the effect of illustrating that rapid pH decline, or “acidification”, coincides with dramatically rising CO2 emissions.  This is the intended representation, of course, because it is assumed that we humans are responsible for “acidifying” the oceans.

Image Source: Wei et al., 2015
What if we choose 1930 as the “acidification” starting point?
If CO2 emissions predominantly drive trends in oceanic pH, the correlation between pH decline and an explosive rise in emissions could presumably be established beginning around the 1930s, or when CO2 emissions began to rise dramatically.
Interestingly, an entirely different pattern emerges if we use 1930 rather than more recent decades as the starting point for pH trend detection.
Namely, the long-term decline in pH can mostly be found in the decades prior to the 1930s, or when steep increases in CO2 emissions were not occurring.
The post-1930s period even suggests a slightly rising pH trend.
In other words, after CO2 emissions began rising precipitously in the 1930s, the oceans have become less “acidic”.
This determination would appear to undermine the claim that human activity, and not natural variation, is what drives the long-term declining trend (0.07 to 0.08) in oceanic pH.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo University of Turku (Finland) physicists have determined a) the climate’s sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 is 0.24°C, b) the human contribution to the warming of the past century is only about 0.01°C, c) the IPCC and climate modeling dramatically overestimate CO2’s climate impact, and d) variations in low cloud cover control the climate.

Cloud cover changes “explain the linear trend of global temperature” since the 1980s
In a new paper, O.M. Povrovsky of the Russian State Hydrometeorological University analyzes satellite-observed cloud cover changes during 1983-2009 and their relation to global temperature change.
Povrovsky found global and regional cloudiness decreased between 2-6% during these decades, and “the correlation coefficient between the global cloud series on the one hand and the global air and ocean surface temperature series on the other hand reaches values (–0.84) — (–0.86).”
Consequently, Povrovsky (2019) concluded changes in cloud cover explain both the increasing global temperature during 1984-2009, but even the interannual variability.

Anthropogenic climate change isn’t supported by experimental evidence
Dr. Jyrki Kauppinen was an expert reviewer for the IPPC’s last climate report (AR5, 2013).
In a comment to the IPCC overseers, Kauppinen strongly suggested the “experimental evidence for the very large sensitivity [to anthropogenic CO2 forcing] presented in the report” is missing (Kauppinen and Malmi, 2019).
In response, the IPCC overseers claimed experimental evidence could be found in the report’s Technical Summary.

But the Technical Summary merely contained references to computer models and non-validated assumptions. Kauppinen writes:
“We do not consider computational results as experimental evidence. Especially the results obtained by climate models are questionable because the results are conflicting with each other.”
Upon examination of satellite data and cloud cover changes, Dr. Kauppinen concluded the IPCC’s claims of high climate sensitivity to CO2 forcing (2 to 5°C) are about ten times too high, and “the models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature.”
Evidence for natural climate change supported by satellite observations
When low cloud cover data from satellite observations are considered, a very clear correlation emerges.

As low cloud cover decreases, more solar radiation can be absorbed by the oceans rather than reflected back to space. Thus, decadal-scale decreases in low cloud cover elicit warming.
When cloud cover increases, cooling ensues.
In this manner, Kauppien and Malmi (2019) find “low clouds practically control the global temperature,” which leaves “no room for the contribution of greenhouse gases i.e. anthropogenic forcing.”
In fact, Kauppinen and Malmi boldly conclude that the total warming contribution from anthropogenic CO2 emissions reached only 0.o1°C during the last 100 years, which means “anthropogenic climate change does not exist in practice.”

Kauppinen and Malmi, 2019
No experimental evidence for the
significant anthropogenic climate change
“The IPCC climate sensitivity is about one order of magnitude too high, because a strong negative feedback of the clouds is missing in climate models. If we pay attention to the fact that only a small part of the increased CO2 concentration is anthropogenic, we have to recognize that the anthropogenic climate change does not exist in practice. The major part of the extra CO2 is emitted from oceans [6], according to Henry‘s law. The low clouds practically control the global average temperature. During the last hundred years the temperature is increased about 0.1°C because of CO2. The human contribution was about 0.01°C.”
“We have proven that the GCM-models used in IPCC report AR5 cannot compute correctly the natural component included in the observed global temperature. The reason is that the models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature. A too small natural component results in a too large portion for the contribution of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. That is why IPCC represents the climate sensitivity more than one order of magnitude larger than our sensitivity 0.24°C. Because the anthropogenic portion in the increased CO2 is less than 10 %, we have practically no anthropogenic climate change. The low clouds control mainly the global temperature.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigh profile German meteorologist Donald Bäcker recently told an audience that there remains great uncertainty as to what is really behind climate change. He told the biggest problem the planet faces is waste, particularly plastic in the oceans.

Hat-tip: Hallolindenlimmer.de
Donald Bäcker regularly gives his weather forecasts on flagship German public television and spoke in an entertaining way before an open-minded and very interested audience in the Ihme Centre in Hanover.
The lecture lasted two hours and the videos posted at Hallolindenlimmer.de show the climate excerpt of it.
Plastic pollution a greater problem
The topic of climate change was emphasized in his lecture under the title: “Is our climate going crazy?” Bäcker rejected climate panic and recommended to the climate striking pupils to go back to school and learn.
His conclusion on the climate debate: “Plastic in the sea is worse”.
On climate he told the audience that it is very difficult to figure out what part man plays and what natural factors play in the complex system of climate.  At the 5:30 mark of the 32-minute video excerpt, he told that rolling back CO2 is not going to save us and that the worst problem is plastics and coping with the population growth.

Too many people living in naturally hazardous areas
Concerning natural disasters hitting populated areas, he tells the audience that it’s not climate change causing the tragedies, but rather people living in hazardous areas.
“Dangerous” to declare climate science settled
He also criticizes the climate discussion and calls the claims that the discussion is over and that CO2 is the main driver today  “dangerous”. Bäcker points out that predictions made by climate scientists in 2000 that Germany would dry out have turned out to be wrong.
At the 14-minute mark he warns that the climate model predictions are lacking in quality and that climate scientists know their predictions will be forgotten 30 to 40 years down the road. He reminds the audience how scientists warned in the 1970s of a coming ice age, which today we know never showed up.
At the 16-minute mark, Bäcker reminds the audience that renewable energies like solar are not what they are cracked up to be, saying that the production of solar modules “is very energy intensive” and more damaging to the environment than we are led to believe.
Today’s climate not unusual
When questioned about the “dramatic” situation in the Arctic, Bäcker remined that this is not an unusual situation in that people once settled in Greenland 1000 years ago and how the climate back then was warmer than it is today.
No consensus
At the 18:00 mark he sharply criticizes the notion that the science is settled and finds it disturbing that people who present alternative explanations get dismissed and labelled as nuts, and shut out by the press. He adds that there is in reality no consensus and there are scientists out there who don’t agree.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA commentary at flagship German online daily FAZ looked at a recent study by the German Umweltbundesamt – UBA – (Federal Environment Agency) which examined the per capita consumption of natural resources by different population groups.
Not surprisingly, high income groups were found to own a large number of cars and live in large homes with energy-guzzling appliances – thus making this group of people large consumers of energy.
Frequent flier climate activists
Also the study found that the “urban, academic young classes who tend towards voting for the Greens have far above-average CO2 emissions per capita” and these emissions “are not offset by them buying vegetables from the local region in the organic shop”.
The FAZ writes that the study found that this particular class — who are worried about the CO2 emissions and the climate — have “an above-average number of frequent flyers” and like to take long-haul flights to distant places like “New Zealand or Canada to admire nature”.
The UBA study also found that traditional working classes (whose lifestyles the Greens often complain about) in fact are energy modest and fly less frequently.
Here the FAZ concludes:
The bottom line of the study was that those with a ‘positive environmental attitude’ had the highest actual energy consumption and CO2 emissions.”

Al Gore: “a hypocrite and a Pharisee”
The FAZ also mentions former Vice President Al Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth”, where he “praised his ‘CO2-neutral lifestyle’ and claimed he compensated for his air travel. But later it was exposed how Gore’s 10,000 square foot mansion in Tennessee consumed “about twenty times as much energy as the house of an average American family”.
“The green-preaching politician was a hypocrite and a Pharisee,” the FAZ commented over Gore.
Back to extreme poverty
The FAZ commentary also wrote about the “Fridays for Future” movement. Here the involved activists are calling on society to wean itself off fossil fuels. This for example could be done by enacting a high CO2 tax, they claim. However the FAZ comments that this would lead to “a sharp rise in energy costs, which would be difficult for low-income groups to bear” and that “millions of poor people in other parts of the world, such as Africa, would be pushed below the absolute poverty line.”
High energy tax “a death sentence”
According to the FAZ: “To put it bluntly, the path naively advocated by some well-off activists could, in extreme cases, be the death sentence for the poor in developing countries whose future well-being and survival they are supposed to be fighting for.”

Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne
Recently, Der Spiegel wrote about how Germany’s once highly ballyhooed Energiewende (transition to green energies) has turned out to be a botched project. Then Michael Schellenberger at Forbes commented that the laws of physics tell us it was never meant to work in the first place.
Behind closed doors, no one in Berlin believes in it
Now, just days ago, energy expert Dr. Björn Peters wrote at the German Association of Employers site that the Energiewende has deteriorated to the point that: “No specialist politician in Berlin believes in the success of the Energiewende any more. Whoever you ask, everyone says this only behind closed doors and thinks that if you go to the press with it you can only lose against the ‘green’ media mainstream.”
Peters warns that what is needed in Germany is a good dose of reality and “a fresh start on energy policy.”
Advantages of fossil fuels “too great”
The German expert writes that despite the hundreds of billions of euros committed to green energies, “chemical energy from coal, oil and gas supplies about four fifths of primary energy worldwide and also in Germany and thus represents the present energy supply”.

And although at some point, the reserves will be exhausted, and alternatives will need to be found, but “for the time being, chemical energy sources are irreplaceable and will remain so for several decades to come. Their advantages are too great.”
Peters reminds that “petroleum-based fuels have the invaluable advantage of high energy density. At over 10 kWh/kg – a hundred times higher than batteries – they are the only energy sources that can reliably supply cars on overland journeys, trucks and ships with energy.”
Yet, Peters agrees that alternatives need to be sought out ultimately because traditional fossil fuels are limited in their supply and burning them entails questions concerning their impact on health.
Nuclear technology as the solution
In his opinion piece, Peters advocates nuclear power as the alternative, writing: “If now the chemical energy sources cause too much damage to humans and nature and will run out in the foreseeable future, and the surrounding renewable energies cannot provide a comprehensive energy supply, only nuclear energy sources remain. Physics does not permit other energy sources. From these we can show that they have the potential to deliver clean and highly concentrated energy forever. Of particular importance is the fact that nuclear energy can provide energy for all applications that human civilization needs, i.e. not only electrical energy but also for heating, transport and industrial process energy.”
Peters also notes that there are “candidates for a modern energy supply by means of nuclear energy”, with the most promising being the dual fluid reactor as it is inherently safe because the physical processes prevent it from getting out of control and it is emissions-free.
Sun and wind inadequate
In Peters view, it’s been shown on multiple occasions that energies from the sun, wind and biomass are not yet suitable for powering entire modern societies.
The German energy expert criticizes Germany and the EU’s narrow focus “on promoting only a few power generation technologies” while ignoring more comprehensive energy supply concepts.
He warns: “In the end, even the German public will not be able to avoid the banal physical reality: Without nuclear energy sources, it will not be possible to abandon chemical energy sources due to the pitfalls of renewable energies. A new start in energy policy is therefore urgently needed.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper finds the performance of test-taking (cognitive, decision-making) “astronaut-like” subjects exposed to 5000 ppm CO2 was “similar to or exceeded” the performance of those exposed to baseline (600 ppm). This study follows up on a 2018 paper that determined submariners exposed to 15000 ppm CO2 performed just as well as subjects exposed to 600 ppm.
Those of us who own CO2 monitors know that indoor (bedroom) CO2 concentrations typically vary between about 600 ppm during the day and 1000 ppm overnight – the latter earning a frowny face air quality rating.


CO2 is a cognitively-impairing toxin?
In recent years there has been a push to create the impression carbon dioxide is a pollutant, or toxin. Consequently, there have been a few studies suggesting exposure to higher CO2 concentrations (~1500 to 2500 ppm) severely impair human cognitive and decision-making performance (Satish et al., 2012, Allen et al., 2016).
If true, this would be rather problematic for elementary school children, as they are routinely exposed to CO2 concentrations ranging between about 1500 and 3000 ppm in their classrooms (Corsi et al., 2002).
Driving alone in one’s vehicle could mean exposure to “3700 ppm … above outdoor [CO2] concentrations” (Satish et al, 2012), or about 4100 ppm.
This elevated-CO2-is-toxic-to-brain-functioning paradigm suggests the world’s highways are teeming with cognitively-impaired drivers.
2 new studies show elevated CO2 has no effect on cognitive performance
The results from a 2018 study (Rodeheffer et al., 2018) measuring the cognitive and decision-making performances of submariners exposed to elevated CO2 undermined the attempts to portray CO2 as a brain-function-impairing toxin.

In the study, subjects were exposed to 3 CO2 conditions: 600, 2500, and 15000 ppm.
The results indicated there were “no significant differences” in how the subjects performed for any of the CO2 exposure levels.

Image Source: Rodeheffer et al., 2018
A new study (Scully et al., 2019) assessing the capacity of elevated CO2 exposure to affect cognitive and decision-making performance appends the Rodeheffer et al. (2018) results.
This time, “astronaut-like” subjects were exposed to four CO2 gradients: 600, 1200, 2500, and 5000 ppm.
The results indicated there were “no clear dose-response patterns” evident for any of the exposure conditions.
In fact, the performance of subjects exposed to 5000 ppm slightly exceeded the performance of subjects exposed to 600 ppm CO2.
These results suggest the elevated-CO2-is-toxic-to-brain-functioning paradigm is not supported by real-world experiments.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenland’s ice sheet mass losses have significantly decelerated since 2013 – a reversal from the rapid retreat from the 1990s to 2012 driven by cloud forcing and the NAO (Ruan et al., 2019). The post-2013 “relatively stable” ice sheet even gained mass during 2017-’18 (Andersen et al., 2019).

Ruan et al., 2019    
Decelerated Greenland Ice Sheet Melt Driven
by Positive Summer North Atlantic Oscillation
“The GrIS lost mass at a rate of about -102 Gt/yr in early 2003, increased to -393 Gt/yr during 2012-2013, but suddenly reduced to no more than 75 Gt/yr during 2013-2014 (Bevis et al., 2019). It is suggested that this deceleration is due to the increased snowfall accumulation driven by the positive phase of summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO; Folland et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2015).”
“It is shown that the deceleration of GrIS melting since 2013 is due to the reduction in short-wave solar radiation in the presence of increasing total cloud cover, which is driven by a more persistent positive summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO) on the decadal time scale.”
“After an extreme year of the GrIS mass loss in 2012 (Tedsco et al., 2013; Nghiem et al., 2012) the rate of mass loss dramatically decreased since 2013 and has returned to about the same level (or even less) as was observed during 2004-2005. This indicates that the deceleration in GrIS mass loss since 2013 is mostly attributable to a reduction in the total mass loss during the summer season.”
“[T]he total cloud cover decreased with a rate of around 0.5% per year before 2013 in most of Greenland except the northeast area. As a result, the melt-albedo feedback is enhanced (Hofer et al., 2017) and the increased shortwave radiation over the low albedo ablation zone leads to accelerated melt of the GrIS (Box et al., 2012; Van-Angelen et al., 2012; Franco et al., 2013). Since 2013, the total cloud cover over most of southeast Greenland increased at a rate of more than 0.1% per year.”
“The lower SLP over Greenland is also consistent with the dramatic cooling of the northern North Atlantic Ocean during the same period. On the surface, the mean summer sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is more than 2ºC colder than the SST during 2003-2013; in the upper 300m, the volume mean ocean temperature is nearly 1.6ºC less (Fig. 6). The cooling of the ocean is not only helpful for the atmospheric configuration over the Greenland, but also favorable for the reduction of mass loss due to warmer water intrusion into the marine-terminated glaciers, though the latter process explains only around 30-50 Gt of the total mass budget of the GrIS (Zwally et al., 2002; Box et al., 2009; Tedstone et al., 2013).”


Andersen et al., 2019
Update of annual calving front lines for 47 marine
terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland (1999–2018)
“Currently, the mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet is the largest Arctic contributor to global sea-level rise (van den Broeke et al. 2009, 2017; Box et al. 2018).”
“The period 2007–2012 underwent a rapid loss of glacier area, compared to 2013–2018, in which glacier area was relatively stable, associated with a small area change. The year 2017–2018 stands out as the only period with net area gain (+4.1 km2).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe weather sensitivity of activists
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Have you noticed it too?
Over the last years it’s been climate change that is to blame for everything. Whether it’s storming outside or snowing, whether it’s not storming or not snowing, whether it’s thunderstorming with a lot of rain, or if it’s dry: everything is said to be climate change. What kind of weather would not show climate change? Any deviation from the mean is now a sign of climate change?
There are some who oppose this logic.
Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann is a shining example. On Twitter, he recently got peppered with accusations that he’s supplying the “climate deniers” with ammunition.
Carbon has made an immense contribution
This article could show the opposite because we too are convinced that mankind is changing the climate, and the use of coal, gas and oil in the entire value chain of industrial society has brought it about. On the other hand, mankind would not be where it is today without the positive effects of carbon in human nutrition, energy supply, mobility, poverty alleviation, the fight against disease with medicines and many other achievements that we owe to the combined efforts of generations before us.
And it will take some effort to get the effects of our actions under control by about 2100. Any earlier date for an Armageddon is fiction, serious science agrees.
Task for a century, not a legislative period
We would like to refer once again to what we derived in July 2017: How high can the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increase in order not to surpass the 2°C target: around 600 ppm? Assuming current (2017) 407 ppm CO2 and a current average growth of 2.11 ppm per year, the 600 ppm would be reached in 2108. Of course it would be necessary to reduce global CO2 emissions to near zero by the end of this century – a task for three global generations and not for three German legislative periods.
Desperate activists seizing upon every anomaly
Activists don’t see it that way. They announce the checkered flag will be waving for mankind in just 12 years.
But it’s difficult to justify this, so they try to take advantage of any weather. For example, it can get warm in Finland when the wind blows from the south in summer. This shouldn’t be surprising given the high solar radiation, but the activists now hype it up to turn the weather into climate.  It is quite easy to calculate how many days the daily maximum temperature there exceeded 26°C.

It’s easy to see that warmth over Finland happens every now and then and that real conclusions cannot be drawn. There is no reason to panic about hot Finnish days.
No evidence of anthropogenic influence on cyclones
Another dubious claim that is often made is that climate change is causing more / stronger tropical storms such as hurricanes (in the Atlantic) and typhoons (in the Pacific). In recent years, we’ve seen a number of articles of this type whenever there’s been a tropical storm. A simple thermodynamic conclusion gets drawn: Warmer water contains more energy and makes storms worse.
Yet, a recent study by world-leading researchers on this topic makes it clear that it is not so easy. They find many uncertainties, and in particular that Atlantic hurricanes are not attributable to climate change, not even the associated extreme precipitation:
To date, there is no convincing evidence of a detectable anthropogenic influence on hurricane precipitation rates,…”
No trend in German precipitation
Since 2019 could be a rather active hurricane season, we have tobe prepared that climate change will be blamed by activists. But this conclusion, according to science, is not justified. It’s simple scaremongering! But we all know Greta Thunberg’s call: We want panic!
Also often reported: Forest fires in this country [Germany] are largely due to the “climate crisis”. Forest fires are the result of drought. Yet, it is not the heat that is to blame, but rather the lack of precipitation. And what about summer in Germany?

The DWD German Weather service notes: no trend has been found.
Why are they lying?
It was unusually dry last year, so yes there were more forest fires. All those who exploit a weather event for their agenda have to ask themselves: What kind of agenda is this for which you have to lie so much?

Dr. Sebastian Lüning wrote a complaint to German ARD public broadcasting concerning its December 2, 2018, one-sided reporting of the Indian island of Ghoramara and the sea level rise it is allegedly experiencing. The €6.9 billion euro publicly funded, 22,612-employee ARD is the German equivalent to the UK’s BBC.
What follows is the exchange between Lüning and the ARD editorial staff:
======================================
From: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
To: NDR Rundfunkrat
Date: 3 December 2018
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
On December 2, 2018, you reported on the Tagesschau.de evening news on the Indian island of Ghoramara, which according to your report is “sinking into the sea” due to climate change.
https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/indien-klima-ghoramara-101.html
In concrete terms, the report cites rising sea levels as the only cause. This, however, distorts the facts, as the shrinking of the island actually has a number of reasons. Although the globally rising sea level plays a role, other processes are much more important, which your correspondent Bernd Musch-Borowska fails to mention a single word about and thus ultimately over-dramatizes the role of climate change. This is all the more regrettable because the report appeared on the first day of the Katowice Climate Conference and thus casts the technical robustness of your reporting in to doubt.
In view of the enormous importance of climate change in the public debate, you should make additional efforts to avoid such one-sided and technically unbalanced presentations in your program, e.g. by consulting experts before publication.
The island of Ghoramara lies at the mouth of the Ganges. As in many deltas of the earth, strong currents prevail here, which lead to a constant rearrangement of sediment and a systematic shifting of the islands. Similar coastal dynamic processes can be observed in the area of the East Frisian Islands.
The island of Ghoramara and neighboring islands in the Sundarbans have therefore always been exposed to major morphological changes. In addition, there is a rate of subsidence of several millimeters per year, which is also typical for deltas, an amount which even exceeds the global (eustatic) sea-level rise of 2-3 millimeters per year. In addition, the construction of several dams in the catchment area of the Ganges has led to a reduced sediment load in the river and delta, further exacerbating erosion.
Also activities on the island of Ghoramara have made the problem worse. Strong groundwater removal has led to an additional compaction and lowering of the island. In addition, the islanders have removed part of the protective mangrove vegetation in the process of creating additional arable land, leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion during storms.
If you are interested, I would be happy to provide you with the relevant technical literature.
The Tagesschau article falsely suggests that sea-level rise is the main problem for Ghoramara. This is wrong. What is true is that the shrinking of the island of Ghoramara has a variety of causes, which can be divided into 1) natural, 2) non-climatic anthropogenic and 3) climatic anthropogenic causes. I would therefore like to ask you – at the same place as the original report – to list the complete range of causes so as not to provide a basis for accusations of climate dramatization on the occasion of the current climate conference in Katowice.
Best regards,
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning
Geoscientist
But the editor-in-chief of ARD, Dr. Kai Gniffke, finally replied evasively on January 4, 2019. The pdf of the reply can be found here. In the reply, the ARD defended its report, writing: “Unfortunately it is not possible to address all backgrounds and developments in daily reporting.”
To which Lüning responded:

From: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
To: NDR Broadcasting Council [ARD]
Date: 10 January 2019
Dear Dr. Nenz,
Dear Dr. Gniffke,
Thank you for sending the statement. Of course, the answer is not satisfactory, because you reply to my accusation of selective and distorted reporting by claiming that the climate conference and the scarcity of the reporting justify the deliberate omission of important contextual information. The incomplete presentation, however, automatically leads to an artificial dramatization. Ultimately, it is deliberate cherry-picking.
The editorial team is thus in the same line as the former editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Christopher Schrader, who in your program ZAPP openly admitted that in his articles he follows a personal mission and prefers to leave scientific uncertainties unmentioned in order to prevent citizens from becoming unrestful and doubting the energy revolution.
https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/zapp/Von-wegen-Klima-Wissenschaftsjournalisten-wettern,klima302.html
I was also surprised that another mistake had crept into your answer. You wrote that there are “more violent and more frequent storms” in the area of the Indian island of Ghoramara due to climate change. This is also wrong, especially as it is not even claimed in your original article. Studies in the northern Indian Ocean have not found a trend in tropical cyclones for the last three decades. See Hoarau et al. 2012:
https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.2406
It would be really important that you introduce quality assurance measures in your ARD editorial office in the area of climate change reporting in order to avoid such obvious mistakes and distortions. As you may know, this is not the first case. As an example, I would like to mention your reporting on the warming of the North Sea in 2017:
http://www.kaltesonne.de/um-antwort-wird-gebeten-der-fall-nordsee-erwarmung/
For the sake of transparency, I would also like to ask you to allow us to publish your Ghoramara statement on the website www.kaltesonne.de.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning
Again the ARD editors followed by dodging the facts of their poor reporting in a response to Lüning’s message above, even going so far as to deny everything. What follows is their response to Lünings accusations:
From: Dr. Kai Gniffke (Editor-in-Chief ARD-aktuell)
To: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
Date: 25 January 2019
Dear Dr. Lüning,
We regret that our detailed response to your program complaint was not satisfactory from your point of view. As we have already stated in the opinion, we believe that the situation of Ghoramara has been accurately described in the criticized report. In principle, not all aspects of a complex issue can be presented in a single contribution. We understand your comments as a suggestion and have already written that an in-depth consideration, for example in the context of a longer radio feature, is conceivable.
In your reply, you also mentioned our report on the warming of the North Sea in 2017, which you also criticized. We refer you to our corresponding statement, which you had already published on your website. You are also welcome to publish our most recent statement there.
We thank you for your comments and assure you that we will continue to report on climate change and its impacts.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. Kai Gniffke
First Editor-in-Chief ARD-aktuell
Clearly the ARD’s reporting was sloppy and intentionally one-sided with the aim of generating climate urgency. And the reactions by its editors told us us they had no plans to change anything with regards to quality control and its obligations to viewers.
But today, months later, Die kalte Sonne here informs that ARD editor Kai Gniffke has left the ARD. But don’t expect the quality of climate science reporting to improve at ARD any time soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMainstream climate science claims CO2 molecules “slow down the rate of heat-loss from the surface” like a blanket does. And yet the rate at which a CO2 molecule retains or slows down heat loss is, at most, a negligible 0.0001 of a second. A CO2 concentration of 300 ppm versus 400 ppm will therefore have no detectable impact.
SkepticalScience, a blog spearheaded by climate science “consensus” advocate John Cook, is widely considered the explanatory guidebook for the anthropogenic global warming movement.
The blog claims CO2 molecules, with a representation of 4 parts in 10,000 in the atmosphere (400 parts per million, or ppm), collectively function like a blanket does in slowing down the rate at which the human body cools.

Image Source: SkepticalScience
The rate or time lapse involved in this “slowing” of heat loss is problematic to the paradigm that says CO2 drives global warming, however.
Professor Nasif Nahle has mathematically assessed the rate at which heat is retained by CO2 molecules; his work was endorsed by the Faculty of Physics of the University of Nuevo Leon (Mexico).

Nahle found the “mean free path” for a quantum wave to pass through the atmosphere before colliding with a CO2 molecule is about 33 meters (Nahle, 2011a). Such a wide chasm between molecular collisions would appear to undermine a visualization of CO2 functioning like a blanket does.
Even more saliently, Nahle determined that the rate at which CO2 molecules can retain heat at the surface may only last about 0.0001 of a second (Nahle, 2011b).
If heat-loss is slowed down at a rate of 0.0001 of a second by CO2 molecules, the atmospheric CO2 concentration – whether it’s 300 ppm or 400 ppm – effectively doesn’t matter. The time lapse differential would be immaterial for either concentration.
Consequently, Nahle concludes “carbon dioxide has not an effect on climate changes or warming periods on the Earth”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe 4.6 trillion euro German green energies flop

By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The demands for the phasing out of coal, fuel and natural gas are becoming ever more shrill in Germany. At first early this year it began with the bold proposal of the coal commission, half of which was occupied by green activists from the Federal Chancellery, calling on the phase-out of coal by 2038. Then came the demand by Green party leader Robert Habeck and his green friends for the phase-out of the internal combustion engine by 2030. And when it was very dry for four weeks in April, Annalena Baerbock declared a climate crisis and called for doubling the CO2 price and a strong regulatory law!
Now the Friday Children of Lummerland are demanding a CO2 tax of 180 euros per tonne this year, and that we reduce “greenhouse gas emissions to zero” by 2035, i.e. 100% renewable energies.
So far wind and sun cover only 2.5% of Germany’s primary energy needs
So it is worth taking a look at the study of the Academy project “Energy Systems of the Future” of the “Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities” to see what’s ahead of us. All sectors, electricity, transport and heat are considered together. And look: 80% of the energy is produced by fossil fuels, 7.5% by nuclear energy and 13% by renewable energies. Once biomass (including biogas and biofuel) is subtracted from renewable energies, only 1.5% of primary energy is generated by wind power and 1% by photovoltaics (p. 10 of the study).
This is a long way from 100%. The study comes to the conclusion that if one wants to go the way of decarbonization, e.g. by 90% by 2050, then “around 1150 terawatt hours, almost twice as much electricity will be needed than today” will be needed (p. 10) because traffic and heat are also to be powered from electricity.
7-fold increase in wind and sun needed
Since only photovoltaics and wind power are considered, the study concludes:
In this case, the installed capacity of wind power and photovoltaics would have to be increased sevenfold compared to today (with the same energy consumption).”
Today, we (Germany) have around 28,000 wind turbines with an installed capacity of 57,000 megawatts and 46,000 megawatts of photovoltaics. A sevenfold increase in the photovoltaic area would require covering almost all roof-facades and other residential areas possible in Germany. A sevenfold increase in the capacity of the wind turbines would change Germany even if the capacity of the individual turbines were doubled. Every 1.5 kilometres a 200-meter tall 3-5 MW turbine would have to be installed.
Approaching abyss
The study also hints at the abyss that we are approaching in this way.

The dominance of the fluctuating renewable energies requires high flexibility on the electricity generation side and on the consumption side.”
In other words, if nature does not provide enough wind and solar power, you have to do without electricity for a while. It is interesting to note that even in the beautiful new world of decentralized green energy generation, it still wouldn’t be possible to go without large centralized power stations. The study estimates that some 60 – 100,000 megawatts of large-scale power plants, which of course would run on biogas or synthetic methane or hydrogen, would help prevent short-term grid collapses. For comparison: today’s large power plant capacity is 90,000 MW.
Storage absurdly expensive
The study’s claim that batteries could only be one solution for short-term storage is helpful. The prerequisite for long-term storage is the successful development of power-to-gas, that is converting wind power into hydrogen or even methane by electrolysis. This remains absurdly expensive today, but we can already do it. However, the authors warn that in days of a cold, dark lull (no sun and no wind in winter), there could be competition between power to heat (i.e. heat from wind power) and the demand for electricity when supply is scarce. That means one would have to choose between lighting and heating. The car would stop in any case.
The authors also correct the widespread misinterpretation of the car as a power storage device.
The buffer capacity of the electric fleet is in the range of a few hours.“
The 4.6 TRILLION euro power supply
The beautiful new world of the German Greens has a hefty price. In the study, the authors assume 60% CO2 reduction, which should be achieved by 2030. By then it will cost 4 trillion euros in a good 10 years. Today’s energy supply system costs 250 billion euros per year, but that will cost 1.5 trillion more. With 60 to 75% CO2 reduction, the authors expect a further 800 billion euros. From 75 to 85% yet another trillion. From 85 to 90% CO2 reduction will cost another 1.3 trillion euros. So 1.5 trillion euros up to 60%, and another 3.1 trillion euros up to 90% make together 4.6 trillion euros.
German households are to spend €4.6 trillion to avoid 800 million tonnes of CO2. This is the amount of CO2 that China emits additionally every year.
100% renewables would cost 764 euros – monthly!
So that the parents of Fridays for Future understand the 4.6 trillion figure correctly: that’s 153 billion euros a year. With 40 million households in Germany, each household would pay 382 euros per month. And if it goes according to Greta and her followers, namely to reach 100% renewable energies in 15 years, then that would be 764 euros per month – if it does not first come to a collapse of Germany, which would be very likely. That’s 764 euros for a monthly average income in Germany of 1,890 euros. This means that the average household would fall below the defined poverty line.
What a beautiful new world.
Sun and wind to decide when we can move or heat
We (Germans) are not even able even cope with the converting the electricity supply (see the warning of the Federal Network Agency to build reserve power plant capacity of 10,000 megawatts – 10 nuclear power plants – in 2022). Now we are expanding the problem to heat and transportation. All three sectors, which were previously dominated by different energy sources (coal, natural gas, crude oil), are to be made dependent on a single one: electricity from wind and sun. Wind and sun are to decide when we can move our car, how much heat we can use in winter and when the light can be switched on. This is what is best called a sustainable short-circuit.
Irrational rush
And why all this? Because of the climate crisis mentioned earlier, of course. And that’s why blogs like ours are necessary in order to make it clear to all decision-makers: Yes, we must leave the fossil era behind us by the end of this century. But we also have use this time, because the climate sensitivity of CO2 is much lower than the panic-makers and social system changers like to tell us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTenders for new wind energy projects in Germany “have fallen to a new, all-time low”, the online IWR reports here.
After the installation of thousands of megawatts of German wind power capacity led to instability in the power grid, exploding electricity prices and the destruction of natural landscapes and biotopes, protests against wind projects ratcheted up to the point where the government was forced to scale back on subsidies two years ago. The result: investments in wind parks, once seen as the future of Germany’s energy supply, have since collapsed.
The IWR writes: ”
The negative trend in the construction of new wind turbines in Germany, which has persisted for more than a year, is thus intensifying.”
And: “A short- or medium-term change is not to be expected,” the IWR reports.
As of September 1, 2019, the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) has put out to tender 500 megawatts (MW) of wind power capacity, but so far “only 176 MW could be awarded in permissible bids”.
The grinding halt in wind energy by Germany flies in the face of the country’s commitment to transition over to green energies by 2050. Already experts say Germany will fail to meet its 2020 comitments.

Following the solar energy industry to the graveyard
IWR Director Dr. Norbert Allnoch said: “Politicians are frivolously jeopardizing the economic location of another future-oriented industry, as they did years ago with the solar industry.”
Will the “restart” be enough?
The wind industry is now placing its hopes on a “restart” on green energy investment announced by finance minister Olaf Scholz in his opening speech that kicked off debate in parliament on national spending in 2020. “More of the same will no longer help us,” Scholz said on the German government’s strategy to push climate-friendly activities through support programs and tax rebates.
Climate cabinet to roll out new measures
Major decisions on green energy programs and investments are expected to be announced by the country’s “climate cabinet” on 20 September 20th, but details on wind energy expansion plans remain vague. Currently onshore wind park projects face fierce opposition from hundreds of citizen protest groups and traditional environmentalists who believe the destruction of the German landscape is not an ecological price worth paying
On other fronts, Scholz foresees a pricing system for CO2 and that any measure would need to be financially designed “in a way that works for citizens”.
“We failed to take the necessary decisions in the past decades. There is now no more time to waste,” Scholz said.

In April this year I missed an important podcast interview with one of the world’s most prominent Sahara Desert researchers, geologist Dr. Stefan Kröpelin, by the Düsseldorf-based German daily, Rheinische Post.

Image: University of Cologne 
The two RP hosts conducting the interview seemed to expect Dr. Kröpelin would tell the audience how dire the consequences of man-made global warming are on the Sahara Desert and planet overall.
They didn’t get what they bargained for.
Warming does not lead to desertification
Instead, in the interview, Dr. Kröpelin rejected in very clear terms man’s major climatic impact and that global warming is only negative.
Kröpelin told listeners that history is very clear: When the globe is cold, the deserts expand. And when the globe is warm, deserts become greener and far more fruitful.
Kröpelin is a leading expert
Kröpelin has been studying the Sahara for over 40 years, spending weeks and months each year on site gathering data a reconstructing past climates. Nature described Kröpelin as “one of the most devoted Sahara explorers of our time.”
At about 9 minutes into the interview, he explains how the Sahara was massive in size during the last glacial period, and that about ten thousand years ago it greened up once temperatures shot up early in the Holocene.
When asked (10:15) if he worries that things in the Sahara “will get much worse” due to climate change, Kröpelin tells the host and audience: “First, that is a statement I 100% reject”, adding that localized desertification has more to do with the population growth at the edges of the desert and that the people who live there are cutting down trees and extracting water from the ground.
Rising precipitation, shrinking desert 
Next (12:00), Kröpelin talks about the remote edges of the Sahara where few people live: “Here we signs that precipitation is increasing and that should the trend continue, the desert is going to shrink.” Similarly as it did at the end of the last glacial. “The Sahara changed from a desert to a savannah. These are not model simulations.” He says rather this is” based 100%” on real observations of a wide variety of proxy data taken throughout the region.

The greening of the Sahara “happened not because it got colder, but because it got warmer,” he said.
A third would become livable again
Kröpelin also shocks the host and audience, claiming that even if the climate models were true, which he says he doesn’t believe, “Maybe one third of the African continent will be a livable zone again. That would be an unbelievable advantage for the people in Sub-Saharan Africa. […] I dispute that over the last decades there’s been a climatically controlled increase of the desert.”
“Never been a stable climate”
On the subject of climate-induced human migration, Kröpelin says human migrations due to climate changes have always occurred. In the past sea level changes simply caused the people to step back or forwards a few meters. But today, the problem is that the built infrastructure is unable to move with the changes. “There’s never been a really stable climate.”
“What’s one meter from 4000?”
On sea level rise, Kröpelin plays down the changes that are occurring today, reminding us that the average depth of the ocean is some 4000 meters, noting.  “What’s one meter from 4000 meters of sea depth?”
Climate change “totally exaggerated”
When asked about the climate protests now taking place (21:00), Kröpelin comments: “I would say that today’s handling of climate change is hysterical” and that “we should not be dramatizing.”
The University of Cologne expert geologist says that by only looking at the last few decades, “We can naturally create panic. But I find it totally exaggerated.”
PIK painting “doomsday scenarios”
Kröpelin notes that the claim that global warming is all bad just “isn’t true” and that “the real catastrophe would be a dramatic drop in global temperature” and that “warming is the least of our problems.” He adds: “Climate change is totally exaggerated.”
He sharply criticizes the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for “painting doomsday scenarios” and says the topic has been heated up by politics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSatellite observations indicate the Earth has become much greener in recent decades. According to scientists, the overwhelming majority of the “significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China” since the early 1990s can be attributed to the combination of CO2 fertilization (56%) and climate change (35%).

Image Source: O’Sullivan et al., 2019
O’Sullivan et al., 2019
“The recent warming hiatus (1998–2013) was identified as a potential key mechanism behind the increased land sink during this period via reduced ecosystem respiration (Ballantyne et al., 2017).”
“At the global scale, simulated NPP [net primary production, greening] increased substantially over the 20th century to present day from 56.2 (mean of 1901–1910) to 66.0 Pg C/year (mean of 2007–2016) with positive contributions from all drivers considered, including rising CO2 concentrations (referred to as CO2 fertilization), nitrogen deposition, climate, and carbon‐nitrogen as well as carbon‐climate synergies. The relative contribution of these drivers to this overall NPP increase amounts to 60% for increased CO2, 15% for nitrogen deposition, 8% for carbon‐nitrogen synergy, 9% for carbon‐climate synergy, and 8% for climate. Both CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition individually caused a smooth, transient increase in NPP, in line with the trajectory of the corresponding drivers.”
“[R]esults show a global NPP [net primary production, greening] increase of 3.4 Pg C/year between the early 1990s (mean of 1990–1996) and the end of our study period (2010–2016), with CO2 fertilization and climate being the dominant drivers, accounting for 56% and 35% of the overall change, respectively.”
“Carbon‐climate interactions led to significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China.”
A dozen new papers attest to the substantially positive impact that CO2 fertilization and warming has had on the biosphere.
• Due especially to the rise in CO2 concentrations, 52% of the globe’s vegetated lands have shown statistically significant greening/gross primary production trends since 1981, whereas just 12% of vegetated areas have been browning. CO2’s greening effect has been underestimated by 60% with outdated models.

Image Source: Winkler et al., 2019
Winkler et al., 2019
“Historical increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration, from 280 to current 400 ppm, has resulted in enhanced GPP [gross primary production/greening] due to its radiative and physiological effects, which is indirectly evident in amplified seasonal swings of atmospheric CO2 concentration and large scale increase in summer time green leaf area. Thus, these observables, expressed as sensitivities to ambient CO2 concentration, might serve as predictors of changes in GPP and help to reduce uncertainty in multimodel projections of terrestrial carbon cycle entities. This study is focused on the northern high latitudes (NHL, north of 60°N) where significant and linked changes in climate and vegetation have been observed in the past 3–4 decades: 52% of the vegetated lands show statistically significant greening trends over the 36-year record of satellite observations (1981–2016, Methods), while only 12% show browning trends, mostly in the North American boreal forests due to disturbances.”
“Here, we apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (EC) to reduce uncertainty in multi-model projections of GPP using historical simulations and satellite observations of LAI focusing on NHL. We find that the EC estimate [of the effect of CO2 on greening/GPP] is 60% larger than the commonly accepted multi-model mean value, in line with a recent study that assessed the impact of physiological effects of higher CO2 concentration on GPP of northern hemispheric extra-tropical vegetation. Detailed independent analyses of insitu CO2 measurements and atmospheric inversions imbue confidence in our conclusions. Our central finding is, the effect of ambient CO2 concentration on terrestrial photosynthesis is larger than previously thought, and thus, has important implications for future carbon cycle and climate.”
• According to observations, the Earth – especially its dryland regions – has been greening due to climate change (CO2 and temperature rise).
Brandt et al., 2019
“Recent Earth observation studies find a greening of the Earth and in particular in global drylands, which is commonly interpreted as a global increase in net primary production and has been attributed to climate change. Although changes in rainfall, fire regimes, elevated temperatures, atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen depositions are suggested explanations, only few studies provide quantitative evidence on both the biophysical processes (changes in vegetation cover, structure and composition) and controlling factors of long-term dryland vegetation trends.”
Qiu et al., 2019
“Our results show that both net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) of northern peatlands increased over the past century in response to CO2 and climate change.”
• The “remarkable” vegetation greening in the Yellow River Basin since 2000 is expected to continue for 73% of the region.

“Changes in Vegetation Greenness in the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Basin over 2000–2015 … In this study, the vegetation dynamic characteristics were analyzed for unconverted forestland, shrubland, grassland, cropland, and converted forestland, shrubland, and grassland from cropland over 2000–2015 in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River. … The results obtained were as follows: (1) Vegetation greening was remarkable in the entire study region (0.036 yr−1).”
“Overall greening trend in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River indicated great achievements have been obtained since the implementation of the GTGP. Vegetation restoration exerted stronger influences on converted types from cropland than unconverted types. In the future, approximately 73.1% of the study region is expected to continue increasing [greening].”
• Water-use efficiency – the ability for plants to compensate for water loss – has improved directly due to “rising atmospheric CO2 and contemporary climate change.”

Cernusak et al., 2019
“Human-caused CO2 emissions over the past century have caused the climate of the Earth to warm and have directly impacted on the functioning of terrestrial plants. We examine the global response of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) to the historic change in atmospheric CO2. The GPP of the terrestrial biosphere has increased steadily, keeping pace remarkably in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2. Water-use efficiency, namely the ratio of CO2 uptake by photosynthesis to water loss by transpiration, has increased as a direct leaf-level effect of rising CO2. This has allowed an increase in global leaf area, which has conspired with stimulation of photosynthesis per unit leaf area to produce a maximal response of the terrestrial biosphere to rising atmospheric CO2 and contemporary climate change.”
• A “large increase” in total biomass and improvement in water use efficiency is assessed for the Amazon region under elevated CO2 (700 ppm). Elevated CO2 “nullified” the effect of drought.
Oliveira and Marenco, 2019
“The large increase in total biomass and the substantial improvement in WUEP [water use efficiency] under eCO2 [elevated CO2, 700 ppm], and the sharp decline in leaf area under water stress widen our knowledge on the physiology of this important species for the forest management of large areas in the Amazon region.”
“Climate models predict an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and prolonged droughts in some parts of the Amazon, but the effect of elevated CO2 is still unknown. Two experiments (ambient CO2 ‒ 400 ppm and elevated CO2 ‒ 700 ppm) were conducted to assess the effect of drought (soil at 50% field capacity) on physiological parameters of Carapa. At ambient CO2 concentration, light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (PNsat) was reduced by 33.5% and stomatal conductance (gs) by 46.4% under drought, but the effect of drought on PNsat and gs was nullified at elevated CO2. Total plant biomass and leaf area production were also reduced (42‒47%) by drought. By changing leaf traits, Carapa is able to endure drought, as the consumptive use of water was reduced under drought (32‒40%). The improvement of PNsat under elevated CO2 and water stress and the leaf plasticity of Carapa broaden our understanding of the physiology of Amazonian trees.”
• Plants grown under elevated CO2 have “higher biomass, plant height, and leaf area.” Elevated CO2 “may mitigate the negative effects of water deficit” in soybeans.
Bencke-Malato et al., 2019
“In this study, we evaluated the individual and combinatory effects of E[CO2] [elevated CO2] and water deficit on the physiology and root molecular responses in soybean. Plants growing under E[CO2] [elevated CO2] exhibited increased photosynthesis that resulted in a higher biomass, plant height, and leaf area. E[CO2] decreased the transcripts levels of genes involved in iron uptake and transport, antioxidant activity, secondary metabolism and defense, and stress responses in roots. When plants grown under E[CO2] [elevated CO2] are treated  with instantaneous water deficit, E[CO2] reverted the expression of water deficit-induced genes related to stress, defense, transport and nutrient deficiency. Furthermore, the interaction of both treatments uniquely affected the expression of genes. Both physiological and transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that E[CO2] may mitigate the negative effects of water deficit on the soybean roots.”
• Elevated temperature and CO2 increased maize and soybean yield by 25%-31%.
Qiao et al., 2019
“Maize had 25% yield increase under elevated temperature (eT). Soybean had 31% yield increase under elevated CO2 (eCO2) with eT. Elevated temperature with and without eCO2 increased grain oil concentrations.”
• Rice yield is “significantly higher” with elevated CO2.
Raj et al., 2019
“Climate  change  associated  with  rising  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  concentration  may  have  impact  on  crop production and soil health. Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration may enhance crop growth with higher demand for nutrients by the crop. An experiment was conducted during July-October, 2013 using Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment facility at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to study the impact of elevated CO2 and nitrogen (N) dose on growth, yield and nitrogen uptake in rice crop. Four doses of N, i.e., control, 0.6 g N pot-1 (75% recommended dose of N), 0.8 g N pot-1 (100% recommended dose of N) and 1.0 g N pot-1 (125% recommended dose of N) were applied in both ambient (395 ppm) and elevated CO2 (550±20 ppm)  conditions. Grain and biomass yield of rice was significantly higher under elevated CO2 condition. Plant growth and yield parameters also increased with increased N doses in both elevated and ambient CO2 conditions. Nitrogen concentration of grain and straw decreased under high CO2 level but N uptake increased under elevated CO2 condition. Agronomic efficiency of N was higher under elevated CO2 while recovery efficiency of N remained unaffected. The study showed that although yield of rice increases under elevated CO2 condition, to maintain plant nitrogen concentration, application of additional dose of N is required.”
• Trees “may temporally benefit from warming climate” in Asian boreal forests.
Zhang et al., 2019
“While summer GST [ground surface temperature] had a somewhat consistently positive correlation with tree growth, winter GST has shifted from a negative to a strongly positive correlation with growth in the last decade, coincidental with a sharp increase in winter GST since 2004. Winter GST is also strongly correlated with the rapidly thawing permafrost dynamics. Overall, our results suggest a link between recent changes in the permafrost and shifts in climate‐growth correlations for one of the main boreal tree species. As a result, L. gmelinii has experienced an important increase in radial growth that may indicate that, unlike what has been reported for other boreal species, it may temporally benefit from warming climate in the continuous permafrost region of the Asian boreal forests.”
• Due to climate change, the height growth for oak trees has been “significantly higher” during the last 30-35 years than the decades prior.
Gulyás et al., 2019
“Due to climate change, it is important to know to what extent forests will be impacted by atmospheric changes. This study focuses on the height growth response of sessile oak.”
“The relative top heights of the young stands were significantly higher than of the older stands, which means that the overall growing conditions were better in the last 30-35 years due to atmospheric changes than the mean conditions during the lifetime of old stands.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA significant number of scientists say that the Earth’s climate is in large part impacted by solar activity, and less so by trace gas CO2 concentration. German scientists present new findings showing a link between solar activity and precipitation in Europe.
=================================================
How Changes on the Sun Influences Rain
A balanced level of precipitation provides the basis for a wide range of economic and social activities in Europe. Particularly agriculture, drinking water supply and inland waterway transport are directly affected. However, the amount of rain fluctuates strongly from year to year. While it may pour torrentially in one year, rain may remain absent for weeks in other year. The population is used to this variability and usually knows how to deal with it.
But what is behind the strong changes? A system, or pure atmospheric noise?
The chance discovery by an agricultural scientist from Münster, Germany, now suggests that in certain months that rain over Germany and other parts of Europe follows a pattern that up to now has remained undetected. As part of agricultural consultation, Ludger Laurenz analyzed decades of rainfall records of the weather station in Münster and noticed a constant up and down that followed an 11-year rhythm – especially in February.

Fig. 1. February precipitation in Germany compared to changes in sunspots. Shown is the optimum positive correlation (r = 0.54) with a solar lag of +17 months. Solar cycles are numbered 14–24. The probability that the correlation r = 0.54 is by chance is less than 0.1% (p < 0.001). Source: Science Direct.com. 
After detailed examination it was clear that this rhythm correlated closely with the activity of the sun: the well-documented 11-year sunspot cycle.
Europe data examined
Laurenz next teamed up with two colleagues to examine the extent to which the observed pattern from Münster is reproducible in other parts of Germany and Europe, and whether the phenomenon also exists for the other months of the year. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke from the HTW University of Applied Sciences in Saarland gathered the precipitation data collected in Europe since the beginning of the 20th century. The physicist emeritus then developed a computer algorithm to determine the similarity of changes in rainfall and solar activity. All 39 European countries and every one of the 12 months of the year were quantified over a total of 115 years using mathematical correlations.

All maps: Lags are simplified and generally fall within ±10 months of the statistically calculated value (Table S1). Source: Science Direct.com. 
In order to include possible delay effects, the data series of rain and sunspots were systematically checked for shifts. For this purpose, the time series were gradually shifted in time against each other like combs and the respective change of the correlation measure was noted. The multidimensional data obtained in this way were evaluated for systematic trends by geoscientist Sebastian Lüning and visualized cartographically. Lüning is associated with the Swiss Institute of Hydrography, Geoecology and Climate Sciences (IFHGK) and is specialized in the research of solar climate effects.
February northern Europe precipitation linked to solar activity
The mapped out results show that the link between February precipitation and solar activity originally discovered in Münster is valid for large parts of Central and Northern Europe and has very high statistical significance there. Towards southern Europe, however, the correlation weakens significantly.

4-year shift for February Central Europe precipitation
The statistical investigation was also able to demonstrate systematic phase shifts across the continent. In Germany and neighboring countries, February precipitation was particularly low when the sun was very strong four years earlier. The delay seems to be due to the slow deep circulation of the Atlantic, as earlier work suggests. On the basis of the statistically-empirically determined correlation, February 2018 in Germany with particularly low precipitation can now also be explained, which followed a particularly high intensity peak of solar activity at the beginning of 2014.
Solar signal found in other months
Similar relationships between rainfall and solar activity have been observed in a weakened way in some other months, especially in April, June and July, which account for a large part of the vegetation period in Central Europe. The result was a complex picture of the interplay of sun and rain in Europe, which showed clear trends over 1000 km and varied strongly from month to month.
Mechanism remains unclear
The study thus confirms the concept of a solar participation in the European hydroclimatic development, which had already been indicated by a whole series of local case studies of other authors. However, the exact mechanism by which the solar signal influences precipitation is still largely unclear and requires further research.
Ocean cycles also at play
The solar precipitation effect, which has now been mapped out across Europe for the first time, opens up new possibilities for improved medium-term precipitation forecasts. Agriculture in particular, but also for defense against extreme weather damage in connection with heavy rainfall and droughts, could benefit from this.
The next step in refining the forecasting methodology is a more precise quantification of the effects of Atlantic Ocean cycles, which also play an important role in rainfall, especially in Western Europe.

Evidence from the tropical Atlantic indicates today’s regional temperatures (15.5°C) are 7.5°C colder than a peak temperatures (23°C) between 15,000 to 10,000 years ago, when CO2 hovered around 220 ppm.

“[T]he Tobago Basin core 235 subSSTMg/Ca record is highly variable and ranges from ~13-23°C, which is approximately three times as much as at Beata Ridge.. In Tobago Basin, the subSSTMg/Ca decrease by ~2°C from 30 ka BP (18°C) to the onset of HS1 (16°C). Within HS1, the subSSTMg/Ca increase continuously by 2°C, while at ~15.5 ka it rises abruptly by ~6°C up to maximum temperatures of 23°C. The abrupt subSST rise is delayed too the reconstructed SST rise at the beginning of HS1 by Bahr et al. (2018) (Fig. S7). Subsequently, subSSTMg/Ca scatters around 20°C until the beginning of the Bølling-Allerød (B/A). During the B/A and the YD the subSSTMg/Ca remains higher than ~19°C, abruptly increases up to ~22°C at mid YD, while steadily decreasing afterwards reaching modern values of ~15.5°C in the mid Holocene. Lowest subSSTMg/Ca of ~13°C are observed after ~7 ka BP. On average, the LGM subSSTMg/Ca are warmer by ~2.5°C than during the Holocene.”
“[T]he subsurface temperature variability is a robust climate signal in the tropical W Atlantic. Both records show an increase of ~5°C in subSSTMg/Ca from the LGM to the early YD and a subSSTMg/Ca decrease by ~7-8°C during the Holocene suggesting that both sediment cores are influenced by the same oceanographic changes. Notably, the mid Holocene subSSTMg/Ca in Tobago and Bonaire Basins remain cooler by ~1.5°C and ~3°C, respectively, than during the LGM.”
“At Tobago Basin and Bonaire Basin, the deglaciation is characterized by abrupt rises in subSSTMg/Ca by ~5.5°C at the end of HS1 and by ~6°C at the middle of the YD to peak values of up to ~23°C and ~22°C, respectively, accompanied by changes towards saline conditions (mean δ18Osw-ivf of ~2.25‰ and ~2‰, respectively (Fig. 3). These highly variable changes occur within less than 400 years.”
“In contrast to modern conditions Tobago Basin core 235 was influenced by a warm water mass between 30-10 ka BP, indicated by elevated subSSTMg/Ca (~2.5°C warmer than the modern conditions).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterCat 5 Hurricane “Dorian” showed a development parallel to a solar storm lasting several days, which reached the earth from 27 August to 4 September 2019.
By Snowfan
The strength of particle radiation of a solar storm is given as a three-hour value in the Kp index, the daily value is called the A index.
The following table shows the development of hurricane DORIAN compared to solar activity in the daily values of the A index.
Source: https://nextgrandminimum.com/
The parallels are astonishing: It would seem DORIAN was “fed” by the strength of the solar storm in its development, especially in its peak around September 1, 2019.
It’s well known, of course: correlation isn’t causation.
So the question arises: How could solar storms influence earthly hurricanes? And the question certainly cannot be vice versa.
A commentator made the following interesting comments on hurricane activity in 2017 (including IRMA), and 2018 in the North Atlantic and a connection of solar activity with regard to changes in the jet stream:
Interesting sequence of events here; July 9/10 we had a sharp ‘Kp’ impact after a prolonged period of quiet.
On July 11th, TS Barry had been activated, by the end of the week we had the Jet Stream phenomenon, first over the pacific then over US states.
The theory is that a burst of ‘Kp’ activity expands upper atmosphere and triggers profile changes which can activate or exacerbate potential or base line activity lower down in the atmosphere.
Science in this area is in its infancy; however a discussion of what is involved can be seen at
https://howtheatmosphereworks.wordpress.com/about/solar-activity-and-surface-climate/storm-analysis/
This is also an impressive parallel development of hurricane “IRMA” (Cat. 5) and the solar storm in September 2017:

IRMA– Recorded peak intensity and (below) overall progress

 
The influence of solar activity on the Earth’s weather, e.g. sudden stratospheric warming in the winter over the Arctic with violent “Arctic outbreaks” in the mid-latitudes, is already well known.
Why shouldn’t solar activity also have a significant influence on the formation and development of cyclones through solar storms over the stratosphere and the jet stream?
An important and meaningful field of research, in my opinion…, and far more meaningful than the demonization of the life-giving CO2 in our atmosphere, with the aim of pulling money out of people’s pockets with a CO2 tax….
By the way: The solar activity also influences ENSO – NASA sees the globally cooling La Niña from November 2019 on…

The current NASA-ENSO forecast from September 2019 shows globally cooling Lan Niña conditions with SSTA of at least -0.5 K and colder in the relevant Nino area 3.4 as early as October/November 2019.

5 crewmen to fly over to New York
But German online leftist daily TAZ here has uncovered that Greta’s climate publicity jaunt is going to wind up creating a massive carbon stomp, one far greater than anyone would have dared to imagine.
The TAZ writes that Greta would have been far gentler to the climate had she simply taken a commercial airliner. The reason, the TAZ writes, is because a crew of 5 men will have to fly over to New York in order to take the boat back!
This is what Andreas Kling, press spokesman for Thunberg’s skipper Boris Herrmann, told the TAZ on Thursday.
“There’s no other way,” said Kling!

10 tons instead of 4
Citing carbon emissions calculator site atmosfair, each crewman flying from Hamburg to New York will emit 2 tons of CO2 for the flight, i.e. a total of 10 tons. Had Greta simply taken a roundtrip commercial economy-class flight, she would have wound up emitting less than 4 tons.
The 16-year-old Greta and her father set sail last Wednesday afternoon on board the ocean-going yacht Malizia II with two sailors and a publicity filmmaker.
Hundreds of journalists travel to Plymouth
Moreover, “hundreds of journalists, supporters and spectators” travelled to Plymouth to watch Greta’s departure, thus adding enormously to the carbon emissions that the trip was supposed to reduced. The journalists could have witnessed here departure via live feed or a webcam rather than travelling in automobiles and what not to Plymouth.
Spokesman Kling says now they are considering sending Greta back from New York via cargo container ship.
Gee, cutting back fossil fuels “not easy” after all
Aware that the trip is possibly turning into public relations farce, sailor Herrmann told the TAZ: “The journey symbolizes two things: that it is not easy to replace fossil fuels and that mastering this challenge can be a great adventure”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier Arctic warmth unexplained: In Franz Josef Land it was several degrees warmer in early 1930s than today
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In January 2019, a paper by Andrzej Araźny et al appeared in the journal Theoretical and Applied Climatology, in which the researchers evaluated the weather data from four scientific expeditions to the Arctic Franz Josef Land.

Chart Source: A comparison of bioclimatic conditions on Franz Josef Land (the Arctic) between the turn of the nineteenth to twentieth century and present day.
The Araźny team also came across an unusual heat that was registered during a trip in 1930/31 when it was 4.6 °C warmer than the modern average in 1981-2010. The authors explain that there have been two phases of warmth in the Arctic in the last 140 years. The first spanned from 1920-1938 and the second began in the 1980s or 90s. Both heat phases have a similar course, so that the proportion of natural versus anthropogenic climate drives is unclear.
Araźny and colleagues demand that climate models address this question more intensively in order to finally close the large gaps in understanding in the Arctic climate system – also with regard to attribution.

What follows is the abstract of the study, whose pdf can be downloaded free of charge:

A comparison of bioclimatic conditions on Franz Josef Land (the Arctic) between the turn of the nineteenth to twentieth century and present day
The paper presents the variability of meteorological conditions: air temperature, wind speed and relative air humidity; and biometeorological indices: wind chill temperature, predicted clothing insulation and accepted level of physical activity on Franz Josef Land (in Teplitz Bay and Calm Bay) in the years 1899–1931. It employs meteorological measurements taken during four scientific expeditions to the study area. The analysis mainly covered the period October–April, for which the most complete data set is available. For that period of the year, which includes the part of the year with the Franz Josef Land’s coldest air temperatures, the range and nature of changes in meteorological and biometeorological conditions between historical periods and the modern period (1981–2010) were studied. The data analysis revealed that during the three oldest expeditions (which took place in the years 1899–1914), the biometeorological conditions in the study area were more harsh to humans than in the modern period (1981–2010) or similarly harsh. In contrast, during the 1930/1931 expedition, which represents the Early Twentieth Century Warming (ETCW), conditions were clearly more favourable (including predicted clothing insulation being 0.3 clo lower and 4.0 °C higher wind chill temperature than conditions observed nowadays).”
In the discussion the authors address in detail the Arctic warmth phenomenon of the 1930s:

In approximately the last 140 years, there have been two periods of significant temperature increases in the Arctic. The first began in around 1918–1920 and lasted until 1938 and has been called the ‘1930s warming’ (Bengtsson et al. 2004). Other works have referred to this period as the ‘Early Twentieth Century Warming’ (ETCW, Brönnimann 2009) or the ‘Early Twentieth Century Arctic Warming’ (ETCAW, Wegmann et al. 2017, 2018). Our results confirm the observations for the last expedition from the historical study period in 1930/1931. These years covered the warmest part of the ETCW (Table 3, Fig. 4). In turn, the second increased warming of the Arctic began around 1980 (Johannessen et al. 2004) or according to Przybylak (2007) in about the mid-1990s. Changes in overall atmospheric circulation have long been believed to have been the cause of the ETCW (e.g. Scherhag 1937). As the modern climate warming (since 1975) has progressed in a largely similar manner to the progression of the ETCW (Wood and Overland 2010; Semenov and Latif 2012), there has been renewed interest in the insufficiently well-explained causes of the ETCW using the latest research methods, including, primarily, climate models. An analysis of the literature shows that the cause of such a significant warming in the present period is still not clear. There is even controversy over whether the main factors in the process are natural or anthropogenic, although the decided majority of researchers assign a greater role to natural factors (Bengtsson et al. 2004; Semenov and Latif 2012). It would appear that the greatest differences of opinion on the causes of the ETCW are to be found in works presenting climate models (see, e.g. Shiogama et al. 2006; Suo et al. 2013), which is an excellent illustration of the still insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms governing the Arctic Climate System.”

In the conclusion, the authors compare the warmth of the 1930s to today’s values:
…during the 1930/31 expedition it was 4.6 °C warmer than the years 1981–2010.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate skepticism may have awakened, and ironically it may in large part be an unintended consequence of the “Greta demonstrations”. Germans may be finally getting fed up with the hysteria that has emptied out schools and turned into an ambush on their industrial jobs.
German geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning, who together with Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt runs German climate skeptic site Die kalte Sonne, was recently interviewed by the conservative Junge Freiheit TV in Berlin (In German).

While the mainstream media focus almost exclusively on the ultra-alarmist climate scenarios, Lüning takes a far more moderate, non-alarmist view of climate and  man’s impact on it.
In Lüning’s view, natural factors play an as big, or even bigger. role on climate than humans do.
Recent warming “not unusual”
In the interview, Lüning explains how the assumptions made by the CO2 alarmists fall apart when tested against the observations of the past. The experienced German geologist explains why the modern 20th century warming is nothing unusual and that the same has already occurred numerous times over the past 10,000 years.
Start of industrialization coincided with end of Little Ice Age
One problem, Lüning says, is that scientists like to begin their temperature charts right before industrialization began in earnest, which happens to coincide near the temperature low point of the Holocene. He says that the term “pre-industrial” has been the source of “lots of confusion”.

Medieval and Roman times were warmer. Image: Die kalte Sonne
Natural factors at work
Lüning reminds listeners that the question concerning how much of the recent warming can be attributed to man is still being hotly debated, and that we know that natural factors have always been in the driver’s seat in the past. Personally Lüning believes that the real figure is closer to 50-50, with a likelihood that natural factors are a bit more than half.
He thinks the CO2-based climate models so far have been unable to explain the climate variability of the past, but that those based on natural factors and the past changes are far better.
97% consensus claim very misleading
On the claims that there is a 97% consensus among climate scientists that man is now driving the climate, the geologist – who is also co-author  of the book: The Neglected Sun – says that claim is totally misleading:
The study is often cited, but unfortunately misunderstood. If you look closely at the study, then you quickly see that it has to do with a completely different question. That Co2 drives warming, most people – even the large majority skeptics – concede CO2 warms, but it gets down to the question of how much. […] All those who think it’s just a little bit get also lumped into the 97%. I’m in the 97%. Donald Trump is a part of the 97%, as he recently said that it is possible that CO2 warms.”
Preindustrial global temperature much worse
Next Junge Freiheit (JF TV)  asks if a one-degree temperature rise would be so bad. “Is today’s temperature worse than the level of 1850?”
Lüning replies, reminding us that 1850 was the Little Ice Age and how it was “really a difficult time”. Lüning added:

We had crop failures. We had cold. We had disease. We really should appreciate that we no longer live in the Little Ice Age because that one degree of warming was urgently needed. No one would want to go back to this cold period.”
Concerning another 1°C of warming ahead, he says that it would not be only bad news. “There would be winners and there would be losers.” He points out that especially Canada and Siberia would profit.
Emotionalized – kids should return to school, learn fundamentals
Lüning is also critical of the “Greta demonstrations” which he says “have moved the discussion from a factual one to one that is emotional”. He adds: “It’s good that the youth are getting involved, but they should return to school and learn physics, chemistry and geography and all the fundamentals of climate science.”
Strongly filtered press
Lüning also sharply criticizes the press, saying the issue has been “strongly filtered”:
Everything that is negative gets sold as headlines. And things like it’s been cooling for the last 3 years naturally get no headlines. What gets reported is very selective.”
Lüning calls the media “filtering” a fundamental problem that should not be happening in the 21st century.
Published literature far more balanced than media
When asked if the the published science is as imbalanced as the media, Lüning responds: “Not at all.” He says a new (non-alarming study) comes out almost daily, but the media refuse to report on it and instead they “prefer to report on alarmist ones, particularly from an institute located close to Berlin.”
Catastrophe very unlikely
Finally, when asked if we need to worry about the planet going under, as many projections range from manageable to catastrophic conditions ahead:
I see very many indications showing that it’s going be at the lower end of the range, towards manageable. That doesn’t mean we don’t need to do anything. But we don’t need to be preparing for the worst case scenario.”
In Lüning’s view, the path is very long and it should be taken one step at a time. He also tells JF-TV that climate science is still poorly understood and that more research needs to be done. He sees no need to hysterically put the entire economic system in question.
Viral: Nearing 50,000 views in just 2 days
On a positive note, since the JF-TV interview was released on Youtube just 2 days ago, it has been viewed already almost 50,000 times. For a German climate skeptic video, this is nothing short of phenomenal!
Perhaps in Germany it’s one thing to protest climate change, but maybe people are now getting fed up with kids not going to school and instead irrationally turning the discussion into a hysteria.
I asked Dr. Lüning what he thought about the video getting so many views. His reply by email:
People want to see a more balanced climate discussion, involving all views, not just the most extreme alarm scenarios.”
Germans are also starting to get fed up with the onslaught on their industry and jobs.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe “Green New Deal” is a multi-trillion-dollar plan proposed by Ocasio-Cortez in February of 2019 and backed by almost one hundred members of Congress, including most of the Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Among a slew of other sacrifices, the program would force our prosperous society to replace diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles with electric vehicles and meat eating with vegetarianism. Liberty would be replaced by stifling government regulation.

The Green New Deal And Climate Change – What You Need To Know explains why the “Green New Deal” is neither green nor scientific, and needs to be rejected.
Lynne Balzer’s new book The Green New Deal And Climate Change – What You Need To Know explains how the climate science that’s driving the radical policy initiatives is flawed, fraught with outright scientific fraud and how all the proposed green initiatives are in fact anti-green because they would end up irreversibly ravaging our environment.
50 years of wrong predictions
This book details the 50-year history of climate change alarmism that began in the 1970’s with its dire warnings about global cooling caused by mankind and how that term changed first to “global warming” and then to “climate change” when the warming stopped.
None of the predictions, ten-year survival warnings or tipping points given during the past five decades has ever materialized.
Ms. Balzer, a schoolteacher from America’s heartland, presents compelling reasons why wind turbines, solar power and biofuels are not only impractical but would actually greatly damage the environment.  The book exposes the serious flaws in the science behind the entire manmade global warming scenario and the scientific impossibility that carbon dioxide, a trace gas, could be responsible for warming the planet.

Balzer explains how prominent climate scientists have been hiding data and attempting to destroy other scientists who disagreed with their claims.
The right antidote for the truant FFF school kids
The Green New Deal and Climate Change: What You Need to Know is essential reading for all voters and policy makers.
It’s also the ideal book for the FFF school-striking kids to read because it’s written by a schoolteacher in terms that are easily understood by laypersons.
Every responsible parent or grandparent needs to give this book to their children so that they will be able to view the climate issue critically, calmly, rationally and objectively.
Ms. Balzer’s book concludes that the energy “solutions” specified in the Green New Deal are neither green nor sustainable and that so-called renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power and biofuels, are not only impractical and economically devastating, but also very damaging to the environment.
The “Green New Deal” is one social engineering lesson we’d be far better off going without.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite reports of relatively high regional rates of sea level rise, the Atlantic Coast of the United States has actually been expanding in recent decades after rapidly shrinking prior to the 1960s.

A 2001 Salon magazine “terror in the skies” alarmism article featured a Dr. James Hansen late-1980s prediction that New York City’s West Side Highway would be underwater within 20 years.

Of course the West Side Highway is not underwater today.
Nor does it appear that there have been any detectable changes to its shoreline position since 1936.
In fact, outside the realm of popularized alarmism, it is well known that geological processes are more determinative of relative sea level changes than climate factors contributing to sea level rise or fall (i.e., glacier melt or advance).
Piecuch et al. (2018) concluded “the majority of large-scale spatial variation in long-term rates of relative sea-level rise on the US East Coast is due to geological processes that will persist at similar rates for centuries.”

Pfeffer and colleagues (2017) assessed 849 coastal sites and determined that geophysical processes, or vertical land motion (VLM) trends (ranging from −13 to +16 mm yr−1 ), “have been recognized as a dominant component of the total relative sea-level variations observed at coasts” at locations throughout the globe.

Image Source: Pfeffer et al., 2017
In a new paper, Armstrong and Lazarus (2019) indicate “trends in recent rates of shoreline change along the U.S. Atlantic Coast reflect an especially puzzling increase in accretion, not erosion.”
The numbers are indeed “especially puzzling” for those immersed in sea-level-rise alarmism.
From 1830 to 1956, shorelines eroded at the rapid rate of -55 cm per year on average. Since 1960, the U.S. Atlantic coast has been expanding (accretion) at a rate of +5 cm per year.
The authors seek to provide a “plausible” explanation for this “enigmatic pattern” by suggesting “beach nourishment” (infrastructure development) may explain the tendencies for shorelines to grow as sea levels rise.
For those who do not ascribe to sea-level-rise alarmism, the recent reversal to shoreline accretion is not puzzling and needs no such “plausible” explanation.
Instead, these trends are consistent with a pattern of shoreline growth “all over the world” for the most recent decades.

Years ago in the 50’s, nuclear energy was the big idea of the time. Clean and nearly limitless energy for everybody was the promise, and ideas such as having a home nuclear power station were even floated to provide independence from the power grid.. I was so impressed with this idea that I did lots of work in nuclear physics even at my own high school, building a 1 MEV cyclotron (a form of atom smasher) which I powered with my dad’s arc welder.
After winning my state science fair, I went to the national science fair with it, but didn’t win there, partly because I think I terrified some of the judges when I fired it up. Getting it there was quite a job, lugging a 1200 pound steel electromagnet cross country and setting it up again was a good lesson in logistics.
I even started out in college in nuclear engineering, then 3 Mile Island happened and I saw the handwriting on the wall. Nuclear fission, which is what we use now, creates all sorts of radioactive isotopes as byproducts of the fission, and they remain radioactive for thousands of years, making disposal/storage a problem.
Nuclear FUSION on the other hand, doesn’t have such byproduct problems, and its been the holy grail of clean nuclear power for 50+ years, but it’s been elusive because its so difficult to do and still produce a net power gain.
That’s why I found this story from the Detroit Free Press interesting, it hit close to home, building a nuclear fusion reactor in your basement brings back memories of my own tinkering. Maybe someday, we’ll see a safe and clean fusion reactor in your home. If I’m still of this earth, I’ll be the first to buy one.
The work this young man did in his basement was a continuance of work done by eccentric inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, who is credited with inventing television, though RCA clearly stole the idea from him and commercialized it.
Farnsworth’s approach to fusion has been dubbed “Inertial Electrostatic Confinement” or “IEC” for short. (VERY) simply put, the process uses forces within the atomic particles themselves to bring them close enough to fuse. The more common approach uses tremendous external forces to achieve the same effect. These enormous machines employ powerful magnetic fields and the method is called “magnetic confinement” Literally billions of dollars have been spent in the last thirty years with little to show in the way of meaningful results. After thirty years, the “experts” still say that a practical fusion power plant is still – would you believe? – at least another thirty years away.
This article underscores why we need to encourage more science and technology
for our youth. The US keeps slipping behind.


TEEN GOES NUCLEAR: He creates fusion in his Oakland Township home
November 19, 2006
BY GINA DAMRON
On the surface, Thiago Olson is like any typical teenager.
But to his friends, Thiago is known as ""the mad scientist.""

Thiago Olson, 17,
stands near his nuclear fusion reactor, which he calls ""the Fusor,"" at
home in Oakland Township on Friday. After more than two years and 1,000 hours of
research, the Stoney Creek High School senior, with a little help from his dad,
built the machine. (PATRICIA BECK/Detroit Free Press)
In the basement of his parents’ Oakland Township home, tucked away in an area
most aren’t privy to see, Thiago is exhausting his love of physics on a project
that has taken him more than two years and 1,000 hours to research and build —
a large, intricate machine that , on a small scale, creates nuclear fusion.
Nuclear fusion — when atoms are combined to create energy — is ""kind
of like the holy grail of physics,"" he said.
In fact, on www.fusor.net,
the Stoney Creek senior is ranked as the 18th amateur in the world to create
nuclear fusion. So, how does he do it?
Pointing to the steel chamber where all the magic happens, Thiago said on
Friday that this piece of the puzzle serves as a vacuum. The air is sucked out
and into a filter.
Then, deuterium gas — a form of hydrogen — is injected into the vacuum.
About 40,000 volts of electricity are charged into the chamber from a piece of
equipment taken from an old mammogram machine. As the machine runs, the atoms in
the chamber are attracted to the center and soon — ta da — nuclear fusion.
Thiago said when that happens, a small intense ball of energy forms.
He first achieved fusion in September and has been perfecting the machine he
built in his parents’ garage ever since.
This year, Thiago was a semifinalist for the Siemens Foundation’s National
Research Competition. He plans to enter the Science and Engineering Fair of
Metropolitan Detroit, which is in March, in hopes of qualifying to be in the
Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in New Mexico in May.
To his mom and dad, he’s still reminiscent of the 5-year-old who toiled over
a kid-friendly chemistry set and, then at age 9, was able to change the battery
in his older brother’s car.
Now, in a small room in the basement, Thiago has set up a science lab —
where bottles marked ""potassium hydroxide"" and ""methanol""
sit on shelves and a worn, old book, titled ""The Atomic Fingerprint:
Neutron Activation Analysis"" piled among others in the empty sink.
Thiago’s mom, Natalice Olson, initially was leery of the project, even though
the only real danger from the fusion machine is the high voltage and small
amount of X-rays emitted through a glass window in the vacuum chamber — through
which Olson videotapes the fusion in action..
But, she wasn’t really surprised, since he was always coming up with lofty
ideas.
""Originally, he wanted to build a hyperbaric chamber,"" she said,
adding that she promptly said no. But, when he came asking about the nuclear
fusion machine, she relented.
""I think it was pretty brave that he could think that he was capable to
do something so amazing,"" she said.
Thiago’s dad, Mark Olson, helped with some of the construction and electrical
work. To get all of the necessary parts, Thiago scoured the Internet, buying
items on eBay and using his age to persuade manufacturers to give him discounts.
The design of the model came from his own ideas and some suggestions from other
science-lovers he met online.
Someday, he hopes to work for the federal government — just like his
grandfather, Clarence Olson, who designed tanks for the Department of Defense
after World War II. Thiago, who is modest and humble about his accomplishment,
said he knew from an early age what he would do for a living.
""I was always interested in science,"" he said. ""It’s always
been my best subject in school.""
But, his mom had other ideas.
""I thought he was going to be a cook,"" Natalice Olson said,
""because he liked to mix things.""

By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)

Image: NASA JPL (public domain)
The Gulf Stream provides heating for Western Europe. Some climate activists paint horror scenarios on the wall that the Gulf Stream is slowing down or even stopping due to climate change – with fatal consequences for Europe. However, other scientists see no evidence of this in the hard data. You can find more on this discussion at our DkS archive.
Today’s blog post: What’s new on the Gulf Stream?
In February 2019, Lozier et al. reported in Science that the models did not even correctly quantify the most important drives of the Gulf Stream. The dominant factor is not the Labrador Sea east of Canada, but the Arctic Ocean east of Greenland. See also report in The Daily Caller.
The Gulf Stream is apparently not as vulnerable to climate change as we thought. ScienceNews on 31 January 2019:
Climate change might not slow ocean circulation as much as thought
New findings from an international ocean observing network are calling into question the long-standing idea that global warming might slow down a big chunk of the ocean’s “conveyor belt.” The first 21 months of data from sensors moored across much of the North Atlantic are giving new insight into what controls the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a system of currents that redistributes heat around much of the Western Hemisphere.
Researchers had thought the strength of that circulation, known by the acronym AMOC, was largely influenced by the sinking of cold freshwater in the Labrador Sea, between Greenland and Canada. And climate simulations suggest that the sea’s deepwater formation might slow as the world continues to warm — which also could slow down the entire Atlantic current system and possibly make temperatures on land in the northeastern United States and the United Kingdom plunge. That concept inspired the (otherwise unrealistic) 2004 climate apocalypse film The Day After Tomorrow.

This MDR report from July 2018 also deals with fundamental problems of understanding:
Does a weak Gulf Stream deliver heat to us?
A new study is causing uproar and a lot of criticism. It deals with the Gulf Stream. So far it has been said: If it becomes weaker and possibly fails to appear at all, then it gets cold. A research team from China and the USA now claims the opposite. They say that a weakening Gulf Stream is heating up the global temperature once again.”.
Rad more at MDR.
Also see the articles on the study in Die Welt. Backers of the tough IPCC line were horrified. Alarmist site Klimareporter does not like the study at all and calls it “provocative“. Also the climate alarmist SZ daily was also dissatisfied. It is best to have the results explained directly by the authors without filtering. What follows is the accompanying press release from the University of Washington dated 18 July 2018:
Atlantic Ocean circulation is not collapsing – but as it shifts gears, global warming will reaccelerate
A huge circulation pattern in the Atlantic Ocean took a starring role in the 2004 movie “The Day After Tomorrow.” In that fictional tale the global oceanic current suddenly stops and New York City freezes over. While many aspects of the movie are unrealistic, oceanographers are concerned about the long-term stability of the Atlantic Ocean circulation, and previous studies show that it has slowed dramatically in the past decade. New research from the University of Washington and the Ocean University of China finds the slowdown is not caused by global warming but is part of regular, decades-long cycle that will affect temperatures in coming decades. The paper [Chen & Tung 2018] was published July 18 [2018] in Nature.
“Climate scientists have expected the Atlantic overturning circulation to decline long-term under global warming, but we only have direct measurements of its strength since April 2004. And the decline measured since then is 10 times larger than expected,” said corresponding author Ka-Kit Tung, a UW professor of applied mathematics with an adjunct appointment in atmospheric sciences.
“Many have focused on the fact that it’s declining very rapidly, and that if the trend continues it will go past a tipping point, bringing a catastrophe such as an ice age. It turns out that none of that is going to happen in the near future. The fast response may instead be part of a natural cycle and there are signs that the decline is already ending.”
The results have implications for surface warming. The current’s speed determines how much surface heat gets transferred to the deeper ocean, and a quicker circulation would send more heat to the deep Atlantic. If the current slows down, then it will store less heat, and Earth will be likely to see air temperatures rise more quickly than the rate since 2000.
“The global climate models can project what’s going to happen long-term if carbon dioxide increases by a certain amount, but they currently lack the capability to predict surface warming in the next few decades, which requires a knowledge of how much the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases is being absorbed by the oceans,” Tung said.
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is a conveyor belt that brings surface water northward in the Atlantic; from there, the heavier salty water sinks and returns at depth from the Labrador and Nordic seas, near the North Pole, all the way south to the Southern Ocean. Most people are interested in what happens at the surface — the Gulf Stream and associated Atlantic currents carry warmer water north, bringing mild temperatures to Western Europe.
But the new paper argues that the most important step, from a climate perspective, is what happens next. In the North Atlantic, the saltier water from the tropics sinks almost a mile (1,500 meters). As it does, it carries heat down with it away from the surface.
Changes in the strength of the AMOC affect how much heat leaves our atmosphere. The new study uses a combination of data from Argo floats, ship-based temperature measurements, tidal records, satellite images of sea-surface height that can show bulges of warm water, and recent high-tech tracking of the AMOC itself to suggest that its strength fluctuates as part of a roughly 60- to 70-year, self-reinforcing cycle.

When the current is faster, more of the warm, salty tropical water travels to the North Atlantic. Over years this causes more glaciers to melt, and eventually the freshwater makes the surface water lighter and less likely to sink, slowing the current.
When the AMOC is in a slow phase, the North Atlantic becomes cooler, ice melt slows, and eventually the freshwater melt source dries up and the heavier saltier water can plunge down again, which speeds up the whole circulation.
The new study argues that this current is not collapsing, but is just transitioning from its fast phase to its slower phase – and that this has implications for heating at the surface.
From 1975 to 1998, the AMOC was in a slow phase. As greenhouse gases were accumulating in the atmosphere, Earth experienced distinct warming at the surface. From about 2000 until now, the AMOC has been in its faster phase, and the increased heat plunging in the North Atlantic has been removing excess heat from the Earth’s surface and storing it deep in the ocean. “We have about one cycle of observations at depth, so we do not know if it’s periodic, but based on the surface phenomena we think it’s very likely that it’s periodic,” Tung said.
The new paper supports the authors’ previous research showing that since 2000, during which observations show a slowdown in surface warming, heat has accumulated deep in the Atlantic Ocean. The new study shows this is the same period when Atlantic overturning circulation was in its fast phase.
Recent measurements of density in the Labrador Sea suggest the cycle is beginning to shift, Tung said. That means that in coming years the AMOC will no longer be sending more of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases deep into the North Atlantic. “The good news is the indicators show that this slowdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation is ending, and so we shouldn’t be alarmed that this current will collapse any time soon,” Tung said. “The bad news is that surface temperatures are likely to start rising more quickly in the coming decades.”
The first author is Xianyao Chen at the Ocean University of China and Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology. The study was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Natural Science Foundation of China, the National Key Basic Research Program of China and a Frederic and Julia Wan Endowed Professorship.

The green curve is an established proxy of AMOC.Ka-Kit Tung/University of Washington.”
Die Welt reported on July 21, 2019:
Deep temperatures have been measured in the North Atlantic since the 1940s,” reports Professor Monika Rhein of the University of Bremen. These temperatures are an indirect indication of the strength of the Gulf Stream. “These measured data show strong fluctuations, but no trend in any direction,” says the oceanographer, summing up the long series of measurements. A decrease in the Gulf Stream has therefore not yet been observed.”
The German Climate Consortium published a Brochure on the Gulf Stream in July 2018.
Thibodeau et al. 2018 2018 analyzed oxygen isotopes of foraminifera of a Northwest Atlantic sediment core and found that the attenuation of the Gulf Stream (AMOC) in the 20th century led to a Gulf Stream minimum in the 1970s. The Gulf Stream was also particularly weak during the Little Ice Age, a natural cold phase. See also report in the Daily Mail.
McCarthy et al. 2018 found that a part of the Gulf Stream variability was related to the NAO ocean cycle.
Yan et al. 2018 complained that climate models represented the strong Gulf Stream variability only in a diminished form, an important inadequacy of model simulations.
Todd et al. 2018 short-term changes of the Gulf Stream after powerful hurricanes.
Good et al. 2018:
The observed AMOC overturning has decreased from 2004–2014, but it is unclear at this stage whether this is forced or is internal variability.
Lique & Thomas 2018 warned that the Gulf Stream could change over time. Report on this at Scinexx:

North Atlantic: climate change shifts the circulation
Sinking zones of the Atlantic circulation could shift considerably
Shifted engine of circulation: Climate change could not only weaken the Atlantic circulation flow, but could also shift it, as a simulation now suggests. The large sink zones of warm water would no longer lie off Greenland, as they do today, but in the Arctic Ocean and the subtropical Atlantic. This, however, could have a strong influence on the current – and also alter the heat exchange and the buffer effect of the ocean, as the researchers report in the journal “Nature Climate Change”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo more new papers add to the voluminous paleoclimate evidence that most of the last 10,000 years were much warmer than modern. 
The globe was about 4 to 6°C warmer than it is today between 9000 and 6000 years ago, when CO2 concentrations centered around 265 ppm.

Some regions exceeded the 4 to 6°C global average.
Northeastern China, for example, has been determined to have been between 7-10°C warmer than today during the Early Holocene (Liu et al., 2019, Zheng et al., 2018, Peterse et al., 2014, Jia et al., 2013, Gao et al., 2012).
New paleoclimate evidence even suggests  the 19th century may even have been ~1.7°C warmer on average than the 20th century in this region (Jiang et al., 2019).
Of course, none of these temperature values are consistent with the claim that the Earth’s surface temperatures are significantly determined by changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Seas rose and fell by multiple meters (-5 m to +3 m) within 1250 years until as recently as 4000 to 2000 years ago.
A new paper (Loveson and Nigam, 2019) reveals sea levels were still rising at a rate of 2.2 meters per century between 8100 and 7200 years ago, reaching a highstand of 4 meters above today’s sea level 6050 years ago.
For the next several millennia sea levels rapidly rose and fell within a range 6 meters – between 4 meters above to -2 meters below present levels.
A drop in sea level at one point reached an amplitude of -5 meters in just 1250 years (4350 to 3100 years ago) followed by 3 meters of sea level rise within 1200 years (3100 to 1900 years ago).
As recently as about 300 years ago mean sea level on India’s eastern shore was still about 1 meter higher than today.

Evidence there were sea port towns along India’s west coast that are presently located much further inland suggest sea levels were 2-3 m higher prior to 2500 years ago.

A new paper (Makwana et al., 2019) indicates there were sea port settlements that are today located “far inland” compared to where they were about 2500 years ago.
The scientists suggest sea levels may have been at least 2 meters higher than today at that time.
A visual example of how 2-meters-higher sea levels could have “submerged” the coast of western India is provided.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA potential wind turbine installation on the island of Crete may be poised to drive an endangered raptor population to extinction.
Recent studies have found the favored “renewable” energies – wind and solar – are not effective, even counteractive, when it comes to reducing emissions from fossil fuels.
Solar PV installation, for example, results in a net loss of energy, meaning that the net effect of solar energy use is ultimately more dependence on fossil fuels.

Image Source: Ferroni and Hopkirk, 2016
Due especially to its intermittent energy generation, the installation of wind turbines also necessitates eventual growth in fossil fuel energies to back them up (due especially to the frequent occasions when the wind is not blowing).

Even worse, the installation of wind turbines have been well documented to destroy wildlife habitats (Marques et al., 2019, Millon et al., 2018, Lange et al., 2018, Barré et al., 2018). Frequent soaring species collisions may ultimately lead to widespread extinctions (Naylor, 2018 , Watson et al., 2018, Vasilakis et al., 2017 ) in the coming decades.
Roughly 25% of North American bats are now classified at risk for extinction (Hammerson et al, 2017) in large part due to the explosion of wind turbines across the landscape.
If the expansion of wind turbines continues at its current pace, the hoary bat population is projected to be reduced by 90% (Frick et al., 2017) within the next 50 years.
In a new paper (Xirouchakis et al., 2019), scientists detail the austere short-term mortality risks wind turbines pose upon an endangered griffon vulture on the island of Crete.
Considering the unreliability and counteractive effectiveness of wind turbine use in mitigating fossil fuel dependency, one needs to ask why we are willing to risk the extirpation of rare raptor species for the purpose of expanding “renewable” energies that increasingly seem to do more harm than good.

Image Source: Xirouchakis et al., 2019
“[T]he environmental impact of commercial wind power production on biodiversity has proved to be substantial [3–7]. Wildlife is affected by wind power production through habitat loss, disturbance and displacement and above all by increased collision risk with wind turbines [8–10]. Bird fatalities due to collision with wind turbines have been the most prominent and frequently identified environmental drawback of wind energy development. Bird casualties from collisions can reach up to 40 deaths per turbine per year [11] with large raptors suffering the greatest toll.”
“We evaluated the consequences of wind farm development on the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) which was regarded as a suitable model species. Griffons are among the most collision-prone large soaring raptors and perhaps the most frequent victims of turbine blades in the Mediterranean region, i.e. up to 1.88 individuals/ turbine/ year [8]. Furthermore, assuming that the most crucial factor in minimizing the negative impact of wind farms on wildlife should be proper siting, we tried to estimate the potential collision mortality of the species by taking into account the existing and all planned wind energy projects on Crete.”
“Crete holds the last healthy population in the country (ca. 1000 individuals) which constitutes the largest indigenous insular population worldwide.”
“The model predicted that 39% of the griffon colonies which were occupied by more than 15 individuals would account for 62% of the wind farms and vulture interactions and would suffer 65% of the expected mortalities. The overall collision mortality rate was estimated at 0.03 vultures/wind turbine/year producing an annual loss ranging from 3.7% to 11% of the species population. More specifically a total of 990 individuals were estimated to be at threat of striking with turbine blades. The scenario #1 predicted a mean annual mortality of 1.49 ± 1.12 individuals (range = 0.18–4.98) per colony, whereas the overall annual fatality was anticipated at 83.5 griffons.”

Whenever NASA GISS announces how recent global temperatures are much hotter than, for example, 100 years ago, just how statistically reliable are such statements?
Most will agree, based mainly on sundry observations, that today is indeed warmer than it was when surface temperatures began to be recorded back in 1880. But we will never really know by how much.
Surface station datasets full of gigantic voids
When we look at NASA GISS’s site here, we can see how many surface stations have data going back to earlier years. Today we see that 2089 stations are at work in Version 3 unadjusted data.
Yet, when we go back 100 years (to 1919), we see only 997 of these surface stations have Version 3 unadjusted data that is complete:


Source: NASA GISS
Note how the Version 3 unadjusted datasets going back to 1919 are poorly distributed and sorrowfully lacking over Africa, Canada, the Arctic and all across the Southern Hemisphere. Never mind the oceans.
Only a measly 174 surface stations go back to 1880!
And when we look at the number of stations in Version 3 unadjusted data going back to 1880, ONLY 174 stations actually provide us with a complete thermometer dataset:

As is shown, Version 3 unadjusted data going back to 1880 covers only some parts of the US and Europe. All of Canada and Russia are void of data, and so it is impossible to know what the temperatures there really was.
The same is true for the entire southern hemisphere, let alone the entire globe. The bottom line: There is no way of knowing what the global temperature really was back in the late 19th century and early 20th century.
Japanese expert: data of “no scientific value”
This tells us that global temperature trends since the start of the Industrial Revolutions presented by NASA are fraught with huge uncertainty.
“This is nothing new,” says Japanese climate expert Dr. Mototaka Nakamura in an email to NTZ. “We simply did not have many observing stations in the 1800s and early 1900s. They can produce ‘new data sets’ and claim that they have ‘better data sets’ all day long, but they just can’t make any meaningful difference for periods up to 1980.”
“Not real data”
“These datasets are products of simulation models and data assimilation software, not real data,” Dr. Nakamura added. “This problem has been present in data products produced by all institutions from the beginning – NASA, NOAA, NCEP, ECMWF, UMet, etc.”
“Spatial bias before 1980 cannot be dealt with”
But the data shortcomings get even worse. Dr. Nakamura wrote: “A far more serious issue with calculating ‘the global mean surface temperature trend’ is the acute spatial bias in the observation stations. There is nothing they can do about this either.  No matter what they do with the simulation models and data assimilation programs, this spatial bias before 1980 cannot be dealt with in any meaningful way. Just look at the locations of the observation stations used in GISS products for various years on their page.”
Dr. Nakamura commented earlier here at NTZ: “The global surface mean temperature change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public.”
So how can we be sure about the globe’s temperatures, and thus it’s trends before 1980? You can’t. The real data just aren’t there.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the first 5½ months of 2019, over 200 scientific papers have been published that cast doubt on the position that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate’s fundamental control knob…or that otherwise serve to question the efficacy of climate models or the related “consensus” positions commonly endorsed by policymakers and ²²²²mainstream media sources.
These 200+ new papers affirm the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, emphasizing that climate science is not settled.
More specifically, the papers in this compilation support these four main skeptical positions — categorized here as N(1) – N(4) — which question climate alarm.
N(1) Natural mechanisms play well more than a negligible role (as claimed by the IPCC) in the net changes in the climate system, which includes temperature variations, precipitation patterns, weather events, etc., and the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on climatic changes are less pronounced than currently imagined.
N(2) The warming/sea levels/glacier and sea ice retreat/hurricane and drought intensities…experienced during the modern era are neither unprecedented or remarkable, nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability.
N(3) The computer climate models are neither reliable or consistently accurate, and projections of future climate states are little more than speculation as the uncertainty and error ranges are enormous in a non-linear climate system.
N(4) Current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment, whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).

In sharp contrast to the above, the corresponding “consensus” positions that these papers do not support are:
A(1) Close to or over 100% (110%) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, leaving natural attribution at something close to 0%.
RealClimate.org: “The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
A(2) Modern warming, glacier and sea ice recession, sea level rise, drought and hurricane intensities…are all occurring at unprecedentedly high and rapid rates, and the effects are globally synchronous (not just regional)…and thus dangerous consequences to the global biosphere and human civilizations loom in the near future as a consequence of anthropogenic influences.
A(3) The climate models are reliable and accurate, and the scientific understanding of the effects of both natural forcing factors (solar activity, clouds, water vapor, etc.) and CO2 concentration changes on climate is “settled enough“, which means that “the time for debate has ended“.
A(4) The proposed solutions to mitigate the dangerous consequences described in N(4) – namely, wind and solar expansion – are safe, effective, and environmentally-friendly.
To reiterate, these 200+ papers compiled in 2019 thus far support the N(1)-N(4) positions, and they undermine or at least do not support the “consensus” A(1)-A(4) positions.  The papers do not do more than that. In other words, it is not accurate to claim these papers prove that anthropogenic global warming (AGW) positions are invalid, or that AGW claims have now been “debunked”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn and interview with flagship German business daily Handelsblatt here, Danish economist Björn Lomborg warned of the “inefficiency in climate protection” and says Germany is a “deterrent example” in this respect.
“Gigantic costs”
He told the Handelsblatt that the once highly praised “Energiewende” was “poorly implemented” and that the costs will be “gigantic”.

“Germany, with its promotion of renewable energies, is a particularly deterrent example in this respect. Such mismanagement adds up to gigantic additional costs,” said Lomborg.
Great doubts concerning costs
The high profile  Danish economist also told the Handelsblatt that the goal of climate neutrality makes no economic sense, saying: “That is easy to say, but extremely difficult to implement. I have great doubts as to whether all these states will be able to answer the question of what it will cost in the end.”
Lomborg also told the Handelsblatt that bans would be counterproductive, and that consumers will simply spend the money they save by not flying on other CO2-causing products. “The only sure way to reduce CO2 emissions is to make people poor.”
Technology is the key
Lomborg says that he supports a CO2 tax over the short-term to reduce CO2 emissions but that that ultimately the only way will be through improved technology, and not political measures. “We need innovations to combat climate change. That must be our first priority. […] The key then is innovation.”

Citizens will rise up against bans
Lomborg says technical innovation is better than demanding people pay 16% of GDP on climate protection. “People don’t want that. They will then vote for politicians like Trump or Bolsonaro.”
Only one percent comes from wind and sun
When it comes to wind and sun as a supply of energy, Lomborg says that ultimately the huge costs will have to be correctly taken into account, and warns that they are far from being a cheap supply.
“You have to see the cost of the whole system. […] And we should not lose sight of the dimensions: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), one percent of global energy demand is currently covered by wind and sun, while the IEA estimates that it will be about four percent by 2040,” Lomborg told the Handelsblatt.
Going it alone, shifting emissions “crazy”
And the Danish economist warns against Europe going it alone on CO2 reductions. If it does, ” then the energy-intensive industry will disappear in the direction of the USA or Asia. It is crazy to drive the energy-intensive industry out of Europe and shift emissions to other regions of the world.”
Education and development
Lomborg also told the Handelsblatt that the best way to protect developing countries from climate change is to invest in their education and health care – so that they will be able to “get themselves out of sheet metal huts.” Storms wreak far greater damage on impoverished societies than on developed ones.
“If we lead people out of poverty, they will become less vulnerable to the consequences of climate change and to many other challenges. Yes, we must fight climate change, but we must do it intelligently,” said Lomborg
