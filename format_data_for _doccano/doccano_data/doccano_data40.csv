Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online NZZ here  has a report on the peer-review process and the problems plaguing it. Peer-review has become a leading topic in science in Europe and all over the world. The NZZ starts off:
Irritated by multiple scandals over the last years, many scientists are up in arms over the peer-review of scientific articles and are hoping for improvement.
Many say there’s a need for reform.

Cartoon Source: http://medinfo.netbib.de/archives/2009/01/23/2975
Scientists say manipulation is as easy as pie.As a whole, the field of science is becoming overwhelmed by the flood of papers seeking publication. The NZZ writes that according to a Finnish study, already in 2006  1.35 million peer-reviewed papers were published, and the trend is accelerating.
And it is unclear whether the current large-scale peer-review process yields the correct, important results every time. Also publishers and peer-reviewers can make mistakes, as hanky panky like copying text and manipulating charts is especially easy in today’s computer age.
The NZZ does not name any particluar science field here, or anywhere else in the report. But for those familiar with climate science and the CRU e-mails, it sounds all too familiar.
The topic of peer-review has gained much importance over the years, as it’s the lifeblood of scientific careers. That’s one reason why the recent European Science Forum in Turin in early July was so jammed pack.
The NZZ asks: Is the current system the best we have?
Based on a 2009 study by Adrian Mulligan of Elsevier publishing, the NZZ reports that one third of the scientists replied with yes, one third with no, and the other third were undecided. The survey sampled 4000 scientists.

With those results one could reasonably assume that half are not really convinced by the peer-review process. That tells me it needs to be reformed. There are many problems with it. The NZZ mentions some of them.
For example, some scientists say that papers do not even get reviewed by experienced scientists, but are often passed down to younger, less experienced colleagues who don’t really know how to do it.
The NZZ writes about being able to reproduce results:
Increasingly, peer reviewers are no longer able to reproduce the results of studies on their own – because the time and effort simply would be too much. Philip Campbell of Nature brought up that point in Turin.
Campbell says errors will always get by peer-reviewers, and sometimes even outright fraud. But that’s rarely the case, as studies such as one from Daniele Fanelli of the University of Edinburgh 2009 in the journal PLoS ONE shows. NZZ writes:
According to the results, an average of 2% of scientists admitted to having made at least one falsification. And up to 34% admit to having committed a dubious act.
Plagiarism is another problem. Fortunately, plagiarism-recognition software such as CrossCheck help to detect plagiarism. The software is based on publication data-banks.
Diagram manipulation is detected using the algorithms in programs for graphic processing. Other offences committed include ghostwriting, including co-authors who did not take part in the study and salami publication.
In my view, the NZZ report places too much of the blame on the sheer volume of papers that need to be reviwed and on human nature, and completely ignores the political aspects that have corrupted the process.
But in the end, its conclusion is correct: Peer-review needs to be reformed, as for now there is no other alternative system available.

For those of you who still have investments in the green stocks since last year, you have my heartfelt condolences.
As if the news from the green economy couldn’t be worse, with all the corruption we”ve seen in carbon trading, and the closure of the Chicago Climate Exchange, and the massive amounts of money that energy feed-in laws and government subsidies have cost the poor consumers.
Now on top of that we have the crash of RENIXX – the first stock index to track the performance of the world’s leading listed companies in the renewable energy sector, “the industrial field of the future”.
H/t: the German online TAZ here in a piece titled: Green Speculation Bubble Blows
RENIXX shares are weighted according to free-float market capitalization. To be listed in the index, companies must generate at least 50 percent of their revenue within the renewable energy industry.
Here’s an excerpt from the RENIXX World press release dated 4 January 2011:

Renewable energy shares: RENIXX World loses almost 30 percent in 2010
Muenster, [Germany] – The international stock index for the renewable energy industry RENIXX World (Renewable Energy Industrial Index) has ended the year 2010 with a drastic fall in value. The market barometer quote was 29.3 percent (at closing: 529.63 points) lower than a year ago(2009: 749.25 points), announced the IWR, a renewable energy institute, in Münster.

Within the framework of the periodic recomposition on January 1, 2011, the market weight of the companies in China listed in the RENIXX continues to climb. With the wafer manufacturers LDK Solar and Renesola and the wind turbine producer Goldwind, 10 Chinese companies have already been listed in the stock index from 2011 on. “The Chinese government pursues a very successful green industrial policy,” said IWR-director Dr. Norbert Allnoch. Other climbers are the renewable energy producer Enel Green Power (Italy) and the US specialist for the encapsulation of PV modules STR Holdings.
Three German producers of solar energy will be removed from the RENIXX World: Centrotherm, Roth & Rau and Q-Cells. In addition, as of 2011 the US wind energy supplier Zoltek and the Australian wind park operator Infigen Energy will no longer be represented in the RENIXX World.”
TAZ here has more, and writes:
The renewable energy economy has experienced the worst recession since the 1930s, explained IWR Director Norbert Allnoch. Many contracts for geothermal plants, offshore windmills and biogas plants have either been postponed or cancelled.”
TAZ also writes:
For the near future, Deutsche Bank in a study sees very little green. Because of increased ‘regulatory worries’, short-term more cautious expectations of companies in the photovoltaic sector and profit warnings issued by wind plant outfitters, the midterm profit expectations for renewables have been in some parts cut in half.”
In summary, it was the reddest year for the green economy thus far. I wonder if we’ll be reading all about it in the print media in the days ahead?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis year we’ve been hearing various reports of a cold winter predicted for Europe and western Russia. There has even been a report on the possibly of the coldest winter in 1000 years for parts of Russia.Maybe meteorologists there found out that Gore plans to do a lot of traveling over there, and thus have adjusted their forecasts. We all know what weather he packs in his baggage when he travels. Gore Effect.
Germany’s leading tabloid, Bild, which has a circulation that is twice the size as both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today combined, joins the fray of projecting a cold winter. It cites two German meteorologists who are predicting that Germany is about to experience one of the worst winters in a 100 years. Read here.  For the record, these 2 meteorologists are private and not government-funded ones.
Dr. Karsten Brandt of the private weather service Donnerwetter.de and Dominik Jung of the weather services Wetter.net are predicting that November and the first half of December will have mild spells, with temperatures even pushing near the 60°F mark at times. But, they warn this:
…is a harbinger of a very cold winter“
According to Bild newspaper, Jung claims:
Beginning in January it’s going to be bitter cold with nighttime temperatures under -20°C. After a short thaw in in early February, a new cold snap will roll over Germany. Winter will keep its icy grip deep into the month of March.”
Dr. Brandt projects that the Atlantic current, which pumps mild air over the continent, will break down in December and be replaced by cold easterly continental winds. These predictions are based on computer models using: data over the last 100 years, current oceanic data and volcanic activity, as well as animal migration patterns and animal winter fur. Personally I don’t believe the winter fur hypothesis.

But unlike the claimed consensus in climate science, meteorologists are not unanimous on these predictions of a cold winter. According to Bild, the state-funded German Weather Service for example predicts a normal winter, and adds:
A normal winter will feel cold because of the often mild temperatures experienced over the last 20 years.
I should have known – now global warming causes perceived cold winters!
Meanwhile yet another German meteorologist here, Thomas Globig, says there’s a 70% chance that the coming winter will be too cold. What does the US National Weather Service forecast for Europe?
2010/11 NWS winter forecast for Europe.
So expect to hear a lot about “natural variability” from the European warmists this winter.
=============================================================
UPDATE: Joe Bastardi at his euro-blogsite predicts a cold snap coming soon:
…blocking is developing and a major early season outbreak of cold looks to be shaping up as we wind the clock toward December. Fitting that with the first anniversary of the release of the climate emails, the weather may again try to prove its point that man can’t control nature.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne reason for all the hysteria throughout Germany, and elsewhere, is because there are people out there who don’t know what they are talking about. Here’s an example: Cem Özdemir, a leader in Germany’s Green Party, said on national ARD television:

You know, we know the arguments. The arguments are not that new. At peak times, that is not in normal use times, then energy consumption is at a maximum in Germany around noon, between 11 and 12, we consume about 80 gigabytes, but we produce 140 gigabytes, that is about one and half times what we really need.”
Hey! My computer has a memory capacity of 2000 gigawatts.
H/T: Dirk H
And that’s why Germany doesn’t need any nuclear power, according to Özdemir.
Imagine if Sarah Palin had said such a thing. But because Cem Özdemir is a greenie, he gets away with it. Luckily this is on Youtube and so the networks can’t bury it. To be fair, Mr Özdemir appears to have been up all night, stoking the flames of hysteria, and so he can blame this gaffe on exhaustion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe September Arcus Sea Ice Forecast, August Report, is out, and quite naturally, the doom and gloom projections of a death spiral have returned to the closet, at least until next June.
The mean of the 16 projections provided by scientists is 4.9 +/- 0.51 million square kilometers, which is likely to be lower than what the final result will end up being.  The July Report  outlook was 4.8 +/- 0.62 million square kilometers. Even that knucklehead Wilson sobered up and realised that his July projection of 1.o million square kilometres was perhaps just a tad too low.
The June report outlook is shown below for comparison.
Why not make a projection for next year? NOAA is forecasting  a brutally cold Arctic winter, meaning colder than normal, La Nina is strengthening, and the major ocean cycles have switched. These all point to more ice for next year. I’ll project 5.75 million square kilometers for September 2011. That’s what my top secret super model says.  (PS: Don’t tell my wife!).

Share this...FacebookTwitterMost skeptics have had a discussion with an alarmist at one time or another and experienced the raw irrationality of their obsession that the end of the world is approaching.
I’m not speaking about luke-warmers here, or even warmists – I’m talking about the climate alarmists, the very people we sadly are forced to deal with in climate science, e.g. Hansen, the Hockey Team, PIK, to name a few.
To deal with them, it is helpful to explore the mind of the alarmist and understand the psychology of doomsday purveyors in general.
When in discussion with alarmists, I’m always baffled by their constant insistence that the world is going to hell in a hand-basket, no matter what facts you present. The more you take their arguments apart, the more they stubbornly cling to their belief. Why is it they insist a doomsday is coming, and don’t want to hear anything else? Why do they crave a climate doomsday? Why do they react to good news as if it was the plague? Seems very irrational.
Unfortunately, what we find in the minds of alarmists and the purveyors of end-of-world scenarios is not a pretty sight, as you are about the see. We are dealing with irrationality here, and maybe worse.
A normal, rational person who is confronted by a life threatening possibility would welcome ANY evidence showing the situation is far less dangerous than first believed. But not the climate Armageddists. In fact, the doomsday not being true is their biggest nightmare. We’ve seen how alarmist climatologists and proponents have mobilized to prop up the doomsday scenario whenever it’s threatened. That’s what Climategate was all about – keeping the good news out and the doomsday scenario alive.
Being curious about the psychology of doomsday prophets, I came across a piece in Psychology Today by Howard Bloom written about a year ago called:
Why The World Will End In 2012 – Is Catastrophe In Your Brain?
It’s well worth the read (some may find Bloom controversial). I think there’s a lot behind what he says.
End-of-world predictions are as old as civilization
The main psychological undercurrent in the modern climate movement is the human fascination with (and wish for) a global apocalypse – a coming climate Armageddon. It’s what propels the movement. But this is not a new social phenomena. Such doomsday visions are as old as civilisation itself. The obsession with end-of-the-world visions is one of civilisation’s recurring psychological illnesses. Today’s global climate Armageddon obsession is just the latest bout.
Bloom provides a number of examples from history. The early Christians believed in the second coming of Jesus, and with him a cleansing of the earth to clear the way for a new order. So did the Mayans and the Aztecs. For the Aztecs it even became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Today, 85% of Muslim Shiites believe in the coming of the 12th Imam, which will cleanse the earth and lead to a world ruled by the laws of Islam. Frighteningly, Iran’s President Ahmad Ahmaddinejad is a believer, writes Bloom.
When doomsday predictions don’t come true
In recent times there have been many cults, sects, etc., and they all believed the end of the world was imminent. The 7th Day Adventists and Jehovah Witness, or Japan’s Aum Shinrikyo to name a few. They made end-of-the-world predictions which never came true. You’d think people would wake up and abandon these charlatans, but they don’t.

For example, 7th Day Adventist founder William Miller preached in the early 19th century that the world would end in 1843. The end never came. So his followers rescheduled it for a year later, 1844. That too never materialized. Did followers abandon the belief? Hardly. Today the 7th Day Adventists church has 16 million followers. Beliefs in Armageddons are not rational, and refuse to die.
Paul Ehrlich predicted also cataclysmic events back in the 1960s and 70s, claiming global starvation of unprecedented dimensions. Today we see just the opposite. The world’s population is far greater and better fed than ever. Have followers abandoned Ehrlich? Far from it. Followers base their loyalty on faith and emotion, and not rationale.
Why are many people hooked on doomsday prophesies?
A lot of people are simply malcontent with the world and the direction of the human race and society, and so it appeals to them that it could get wiped out, and thus clear the way for a fresh start – one that would reflect their own view of how the world ought to be. Many loathe today’s modern prosperity, and would like nothing more than to change it radically. So there is a deep and dark desire to rid the place of competitors. This deep passion to do so  appears to be evolutionary and biological, Bloom calls it the passion for disaster:
Surely biology and evolution must have a greater reason for holding on to such a deep disaster passion.”
To illustrate the dynamics of this kind of thinking, Bloom describes a German experiment conducted in the late 1940s where 15 brown rats, all strangers to each other, were put inside a box. At first the rats cowered in corners, afraid of each other. But over time things changed. Two of the rats eventually paired up and soon eliminated the rest. Bloom writes:
The rats had cleared the new territory of competitors, transforming the cage into a spacious land of milk and honey for themselves. A new promised land. Now, they could found a tribe that might if left to its own devices thrive for generations to come. A tribe that would carry the parental line of genes.
How does this relate to the popularity of notions that the world is about to end? Think for a second. Every millennial end-of-the-world movement has a hitch. We’ll all be broiled, fried, or caught in the crossfire of apocalyptic battles and plague. WE’LL be wiped out. But not the true believers. They’ll be saved. And they’ll have a fresh new world, a world purged of us, a world they can turn into their own private paradise.
Apocalypse-beliefs, I suspect, are land-clearance and land-grab dreams in disguise-dreams left over from our time as beasts.”
The green movement promises paradise, where the climate is friendly and the land is abundant in fruit, and human misery is practically non-existent. It’s about shaping the world according to the view of one particular group, one that happens to be very malcontent, and about eliminating competitors.
Greenhouse gases deliver the hope of a new order
Bloom ties all this in with catastrophic climate change, which, as readers here can tell you, is the very much hoped for fantasy of the alarmists. No matter what data refuting the doomsday scenarios are presented, the radical warmists don’t want to see or hear any of it, as it could disrupt their cherished fantasy. Bloom writes:
One of the most popular apocalyptic belief systems of the last 30 years has been the idea that we humans are bringing the destruction of the planet. The greenhouse-gas scenario is partly a scientific hypothesis and partly a deeply appealing myth. Climate-change-beliefs are a secular expression of an antique pattern…perhaps an instinctual pattern. They are a new way of saying that the end is coming and that only the believers will be saved. Only those who’ve embraced the right god or the right philosophy will survive. Only they will know the truth behind the new world order. And they will do more than remain alive, they will come out on top. They will flourish and thrive.”
Frustration and the desire to see a whole new order – that’s what’s common to all doomsday prophets. They are all disenchanted with the society they find themselves in, and are angry that it does not conform to their view of the world. Either the world changes so that it complies with their view, or it deserves destruction. There’s anger and the desire to punish. Whether that is a healthy psychology to see among leaders, I’ll let the reader make the call.
Howard Bloom is author of: The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition Into the Forces of History and The Genius of the Beast: A Radical Re-Vision of Capitalism (see widgets in side bar, above right). In the coming days I will be posting the next essay on the psychology of the AGW movement.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier today German Radio reported that an uusually large number of dead whales have washed up on the North German Baltic beaches over the last 2 weeks.
Now some believe that a newly installed Baltic 1 offshore windpark (see map) consisting of 21 2.3-MW turbines may be responsible, according to reports.

I searched the Internet for more information, but the story appears to be bottled up for now. The online dnews.de has a small report.
It writes that according to the German Marine Museum, 12 cadavers have appeared so far. According to whale researcher Stefan Bräger:
This high frequency is extraordinary. It is unclear what the cause of death could be, and it cannot be determined due to the extent the whales are decomposed. Researchers believe that it’s due to biological reasons. Young whales and mothers are especially vulnerable shortly after birth. They do not exclude the possibility that the construction of the windpark near the Darss peninsula  may have been a factor.
The windpark was just completed and is operated by energy giant EnBW.

This video link here is an animation of how the windpark was constructed. The video shows how huge mono-piles with a wall thickness of 100 mm are pounded into the seabed. That certainly cannot be very pleasant for any marine wildlife nearby, and certainly represents a major disturbance of habitat.
The issue of ramming huge piles into the seabed is becoming increasingly controversial in the installation of offshore windparks.
According to the Director of the German Marine Museum in Stralsund, Harald Benke, in this n-tv report here:
Whales whose hearing is disrupted or permanently damaged by noise are basically sentenced to death because they are no longer able to orient themselves.
And according to Kristin Blasche of the Federal Ministry For Maritime Shipping And Hydrography:
It has been determined that during pile driving work for offshore windparks – when the foundation is anchored to the seabed – extremely intense shock waves are produced under water.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Sendai mega-earthquake not only sent a tsunami of water over parts of coastal Japan, but also one of hysteria over the German media and green establishment. As Japan struggles to get a grip on its damaged reactors, German environmentalists are seizing the opportunity in a bid to fan panic across the country, and are now demanding that the country’s older reactors be shut down immediately. The voices of calm reason have been swept away.
Source: http://electricalandelectronics.org/2008/10/02/schematic-arrangement-of-nuclear-power-station/
The blog Denken für die Freiheit (Thinking for Freedom) of the Liberal Institute think tank of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom has posted a let’s-get-back-to-reason essay – Japan is not the Soviet Union – written by Dr. Klaus-Dieter Humpich. Here’s a summary:
Dr. Humpich first reminds us that Japan is subject to international regulations and so are reporting minute by minute on what is happening at the reactor sites. All planned and executed measures are reported to the public. Indeed the confusion is often media-related.
Reserve generators for cooling failed
When the earthquake struck, 3 of the 6 Fukushima Daiichi reactors were in operation, and stopped automatically – as they were designed to in the vent of an earthquake. Then diesel-powered back-up generators kicked in to supply power to the cooling water pumps. But within one hour, the diesel-powered generators failed due to yet to be determined reasons. Workers then brought in reserve generators, and it appears there were then problems in getting them in operation. During this time the cooling of the rods was not taking place and this led to overheating. This will certainly be examined later when a comprehensive investigation of the disaster begins.
Pressure cooker
In the reactor, heat and pressure build up if cooling doesn’t occur – like a pressure cooker on a hot stove. If pressure is too high, then steam has to be released into the atmosphere to keep the reactor from exploding. But then an equal amount of water has to be fed in in order to keep the balance. If the level of the water sinks too low, then things inside get hot. Once a critical value is reached, a chemical reaction between the steam and hydrogen can occur. At the Fukushima reactor on Saturday, hydrogen built up and an explosion ensued. Yet, the containement systems were left intact.
Japan’s containment systems not breached
But the situation in Japan developed completely differently from what happened in Chernobyl in 1986. In Japan, the reactors were shut down immediately as planned, thus stopping the nuclear reaction. At Chernobyl, the reactor was operating a full capacity and spiralled quickly out of control.


<!--

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




With the shutdown of the Fukushima reactors in response to the quake, only about 10% of the capacity still remained in the reactor.  The cooling system powered by the diesel pumps then functioned for an hour, and so the heat generating capacity of the core was brought down to about 1% of total capacity – much less than Chernobyl. Although 1% still means one megawatt, it is not enough to blow the entire reactor and containment. In Chernobyl the chain reaction ran away and the entire reactor vessel and containment building exploded violently, releasing everything into the air. That’s not the case in Japan.
At Fukushima, the reactor vessel, the containment and external concrete housing are still in intact. This means there are still three barriers that would have to be breached before dangerous levels of radiation can escape.
Category 4 accident (TMI 5, Chernobyl 7)
As the reactors are still heating, there’s naturally the risk of high pressure build-ups, which could lead to a Chernobyl type of explosion if not relieved. To prevent a failure of the containment building in an emergency, radioactive steam would have to be released though a filter system into the atmosphere in a controlled manner. .This rersults in a radioactive cloud. A controlled release is relatively not very dangerous as it dissipates quite rapidly. That’s why the accident at Fukushima is at Category 4 (TMI 5, Chernobyl 7). Category means that the reactor is totally damaged, but there is little impact on the surrounding environment. So we are still a ways away from Chernobyl.
Risk not completely eliminated
Although the containment systems are intact, the heat problem is still not eliminated. Sea water still has to be pumped to the damaged reactors to prevent heating and overpressurization. If the reactor has no water to keep cool, the temperatures can rise and lead to a meltdown. The latest news is that three reactors are threatened with a meltdown. The cooling water around the fuel rods in Reactor 2 have dropped dramatically.
The next hours and days ahead will show if the plant will withstand the 9.0 quake.
In the meantime, a panicked Chancellor Angela Merkel, spooked by the media hysteria, has announced that the planned extension of the operating lifetime of some of Germany’s older nuclear plants has been stopped. I wonder if India, China, Brazil and Iran will follow her example and abandon their ambitious plans to build a number nuclear power plants in the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMan-made CO2-induced global warming leads to more droughts, cyclones, floods, bitter cold winters and heavy snowfalls – so say many German media outlets. Why is that so?
Some people need to hear that the end of the world is coming, and if they don’t, it ruins their day. They need that dose of doom and gloom to make it through the day – just like the junkie who needs the needle.
So that’s why the media does it. What follows are some example stories in the media that appeared this week. But first, Der Spiegel sobered up for a time and actually presented something coherent and sensible.
Der Spiegel
Der Spiegel writes: Deep Heat In the Pacific Fueled Yasi. Der Spiegel asks if storms are fuelled by climate change:
A consenus paper from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) from the year 2006 says that the fluctuations in frequency of cyclones and their strengths cannot be traced back to warming.”
And points out that such storms have happened in the past too:
Also in Australia there have been cyclones: In March 1899 the deadliest ever cyclone ripped through the Bathurst Bay; 300 people died. Cyclone “Tracy” destroyed a large part of the city of Darwin on Christmas Day 1974, killing 71.”
But that was about it as far as sobriety goes from the German media this week. The rest saw to it that the catastrophe junkies get their fix of junk-science based doom and gloom. Here are some examples:
Die Welt
Reports on the real reason for the cold winter: Why Global Warming Leads to Ice Cold Winters
When sea ice area declines, it loses its albedo, which normally would reflect sunlight back into space. As a result, this leads to a warming in the high Arctic and thus changes the large-scale air currents so that large parts of Europe, Asia and North America get subjected to cold air masses.”

Absolutely brilliant scientific work there.
Süddeutsche Zeitung
Reports on cyclone Yasi: Reasons For The Cyclone:
Another factor is because the ocean at the Australian coast has apparently warmed up due to climate change. The sea surface over the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland has been more than 2°C warmer than normal in some parts over the last few months. This excess was enough to fuel Yasi into a killer.”
Financial Times Deutschland 
Reports on a large chunk of ice breaking off Antarctica Climate Change: An Iceberg Causes Trouble. The breaking off of a 2500 sq km chunk of the Antarctic Mertz-Glacier could have dire consequences on the global climate:
The iceberg breaking off could have dire consequences because a system was destroyed in parts that earlier had been effectively productive in producing salty deep water. Now the general warming of the oceans will be accelerated further, which will then in turn accelerate the melting of the polar ice caps and lead to additional sea level rise.”
Süddeutsche Zeitung 
Reports on the Amazon drought: Again A Drought of the Century
The Amazon Rainforest has gone through a second drought of the century within just six years. More than half of the 5.3 million sq km have received significantly less rain than average years. When the trees rot, five million tons of CO2 will be released. That is almost the same annual output of the USA.
”Two such events of this magnitude in such a short time is extremely rare’, says Simon Lewis of the University of Leeds. But unfortunately that fits the climate that predict a bitter future for the Amazonians.’
What about all the climate models that didn’t predict it? And is USA’s CO2 output really only 5 million tons?

Handelsblatt
Also reports on the Amazon drought: Record Drought In The Amazon
Many climate scientists fear that within the scope of global warming, droughts could increase in frequency and that the region will reach an ecological tipping point.
So, do you doom-and-gloom junkies who insist on a dismal future feel better now? Or do you need more junk?

Major backers like Sony and Kyocera have since disappeared. It was a huge embarrassment. But all of this no thanks to the mainstream media. Nowhere has the silence on this issue of using violence to shut down human dissent been more deafening than in Germany.
Other than a few blogs and discussion forums, a Google search in Germany of “1010 No Pressure” yields no critical reports by German media outlets relating to the controversy. No reports at all. Most of the search results lead to English speaking sites outside of Germany’s borders.  Except for a short uncritical blurb by Focus magazine, no German media has touched this story. They’ve buried it. Why is this so?
It’s because the German media and political classes are so very deeply involved in the green movement, and thus are now incredibly embarrassed by it.  They simply cannot afford having this spread to the German public. Awareness of the 1010 PR film would lead the public to ask serious, inconvenient questions.
New religion
Germany has become an environmenmtaly radical country, with climate protection having become its new religion,  it’s de facto raison d’etre.  Striving to be green is a very noble virtue. The established political classes and media are all deeply entrenched in the ideology, and actively purvey it daily. A green collectiveness has taken over. Former Minister of the Environment and Socialist party leader Sigmar Gabriel once distributed 6000 copies of Al Gore’s AIT to Germany’s upper secondary schools in order to indoctrinate university-bound students. Pupils are shown the movie, uncritically, yearly. Groups like the environmentalist Germanwatch regularly present world doom and gloom scenarios at schools to round out the indoctrination. Dissent, once a positive attribute in the land of poets and thinkers, is now scorned upon.
Being green means being virtuous, and so the result is a competition of who can be the greenest among political parties, and among European countries. Any consideration of the adverse economic and technical impacts this race could have has been thrown overboard. The race to be the greenest is the race to moral supremacy, i.e. the right to lecture the rest of the world on how to behave.
Dissent is not tolerated

Germany has its sceptics, but they have been vilified and severely marginalised by the well-funded scientific, political and media-establishment. Politicians and leaders who dare lift a single finger of scepticism quickly find it bitten off, and are immediately gang-mobbed. The case of Marie-Luise Dött is one example. The tactics of Hans Joachim Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf of the generously government-funded Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) routinely marginalise scientists who do not agree. Germany and Western Europe have once again become intolerant. Yet, their latest attempt to cover-up the intolerance has only served to expose it.
 Green has become Germany’s business model
Because of it’s faith in the green movement, Germany has invested immensely in climate protection. Even despite it’s gray and rainy climate, the country has become a leader in promoting solar energy, pouring billions in subsidising solar panels and passing aggressive energy feed-in laws. A vast array of green energy sources are heavily subsidised by the government. Billions are are now being poured into green energy infrastructure projects, like huge offshore wind parks. Europe is now getting set to implement Desertec, a massive €400-billion euro Saharan solar power generation facility, where huge corporate giants like Siemens stand to cash in big. Films like 1010 only serve to cast doubt and jeopardise already shaky public support.
Can’t afford to lose it
So with Germany so deep in Green, with everything at stake, it risks losing its very purpose, its mission, the imagined moral high ground that green promises to deliver, it’s entire bank-rolled future. Germany, like many other European countries, has put itself in a position where it simply cannot afford seeing the green movement collapse. Therefore it is doing everything possible to sustain it, and to bury anything that could threaten it.
No, 1010 must never reach public awareness. People could start thinking that the movement is run by zealots. That must never happen.
The deafening silence speaks volumes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterKilled more people than nuclear power.
Japan’s earthquake has unleashed a massive wave of hysteria throughout Germany as media outlets hyperventilate over the danger of a meltdown at the Japanese Fukushima nuclear power plant. Sure nuclear power is deadly dangerous if not properly used, and the situation in Japan is critical. But listening to the media, you’d think nothing could be more dangerous.
Now activists are demanding we switch immediately over to the-planet saving renewable energy sources, like wind power for example.
But just how safe is wind energy? Just how “safe” are many things out there? What about public transportation?
It turns out that nuclear power is a minor killer when the big picture is examined.
Zero nuclear power plant deaths in the USA 
Wind energy has killed more
The Japanese earthquake and nuclear reactor accidents is yet another example of the media’s distorted perception. It turns out that wind power has been a bigger killer than nuclear power in the USA. Here’s what treehugger reported awhile back:
According to one viewpoint of reports offering the comparison between wind versus nuclear energy, there has not been one single injury to a nuclear plant worker in all its 104 power plants and 40 years of service in the United States… not one!
The Wind Turbine Industry on the other hand, has quite a treacherous track record as you can see by the summary below:
Summary of Wind Turbine Incidents (December 2008):
• 41 worker fatalities –  includes falling from turbine towers and transporting turbines on the highway.
• 39 Incidents of blade failure – failed blades can travel over 400 meters, killing any unfortunate bystanders.
• 110 Incidents of fire – When a wind turbine fire occurs, local fire departments can do little but watch due to the 30-story height of these turbine units. The falling debris are then carried across the distance and cause new fires.
• 60 Incidents of structural failure- As turbines become more prevalent, these breakages will become more common in public areas, thereby causing more deaths and dismemberment’s from falling debris.
• 24 incidents of “hurling ice”- Ice forms on these giant blades and is reportedly hurled at deathly speeds in all directions. Author reports that some 880 ice incidents having occurred over Germany’s 13-years of harnessing wind power.”
Another way to save the planet and to “live safely” is to ride your bicycle. Well it turns out that bike-riding is far deadlier than nuclear power. In the USA in 2008, 716 bicyclists were killed in traffic accidents. About 53,000 bicyclists have died in traffic crashes in the United States since 1932. Compare that to the deaths caused by nuclear power in the United States – or even globally.
Candles kill more than nuclear
Indeed many things are far more dangerous than nuclear power plants, at least they have caused far more deaths and mayhem. Here are some annual death statistics from the USA that cause many more deaths, taken from here and here at Arthur Hu’s site. Why don’t we ban all of these menacing products?
Nuclear power plants – 0 deaths per year
Candles  – 126
Bicycles 1995  – 800
Agriculture  – 1,300
Motorcycles  – 2,500
Car Phones 2002   – 2,500
Alcohol – 100,000
Tobacco – 500,000
Candles kill 126 – in just a single year and in a single country! Having a reliable supply of electricity would mean less use of candles, and so lives would be saved. As far as I know, all of the above killer items are being sold without protest.  Here are some other killers:
Roller skates  – 10 
Window blind cords  – 13
Drawstring hoods  – 17
Dog Bites  – 20       
Skiing deaths  – 34       
Yes, even the lowly blind cord has killed more than U.S. nuclear power plants have.

Green transportation is a killer too
Let’s go green and hop on public transport. But wait, they cause more deaths than nuclear power too. Admittedly these US statistics aren’t so up-to-date, but they give you an idea of the risks involved.
1999 bus deaths  – 58
1999 railroad – 805
1999  struck by trains – 530
Dangerous occupations
And let’s move to ban all the following potentially catastrophic occupations. Actually they are not potentially – they simply just are! They are destroying the planet and kill humans. Occupations in USA; deaths/100,000:
Timber cutters  – 117.8 
Fishers    – 71.1 
Pilots and navigators  –  69.8 
Structural metal workers  – 58.2 
Drivers-sales workers   – 37.9 
Roofers – 37.0
Electrical power installers   – 32.5 
Farm occupations  – 28.0
Construction laborers –  27.7 
Truck drivers  – 25.0
We accept many of the risks these products and occupations pose because their benefits far outweigh the harm they do.
Automobiles are far more dangerous
If zero deaths in the United States from nuclear power is too much to take, then take a look at what the automobile claims every year:
Traffic deaths per year global: 1.27 million
Nuclear power has an excellent record
One thing that constantly gets ignored is the cost-benefit analysis of nuclear power. It has a far better track record than many other products or systems out there and it vastly improves our lives as a whole. Of course, there is a risk in generating power with nuclear reactions, but the benefits it offers are immense.
Sure accidents will happen. But as technology improves, these accidents will become rarer. It is indeed difficult to find a product that has given us so much for so little in terms of lives lost. Even if the worst happens in Japan, the loss of life will be relatively small.
I recall a few years ago 4 workers getting killed in a biogas plant here in northern Germany. Yet, the incident went practically unreported in the media. Imagine if these four workers had been killed in a nuclear plant.
The issue has little to do with safety, and much more so to do with politics and power.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIndeed here in Germany the media have stepped up the dramatic reporting in the wake of Deutsche Welle’s international conference on journalism and climate, reported here: Journalism for Dummkopfs.Driving home yesterday I heard a report on publicly funded German NDR News radio, asking a climate expert (paraphrasing):
Are the recent, numerous weather extremes seen worldwide ominous signs of the climate catastrophe?
NDR went on to mention the weather anomalies in Moscow, Pakistan, China and the local floods in the eastern part of Germany, and emphasized all the death and destruction along with it (They forgot to mention the severe cold in South America). Fortunately, the data tells the opposite story.
Cyclones and storms near all-time lows
Yet anyone taking a closer look will see that all the extraordinary drama is confined to the newsrooms, and is not what’s going on outside.  The latest tropical cyclone energy index shows that cyclones are near all-time lows. Where are all the big cyclones we were told would be coming in the wake of Katrina?

Nasty weather extremes have always occurred, and there are no statistics to show they’ve picked up. The number of deaths resulting from weather and natural disasters is also declining. There are many factors involved here, but the sky fell more often back then than today.
No upward trend in storms and bad weather since 1850
What about tornados in the USA? The following graphic also shows a downward trend. http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm

Indeed looking at the top 10 weather catsatrophes in the USA, the worst ones happened long ago. See Live Science here.
  1. 1900 Galveston  Hurricane, 8,000 dead
2. 2005 Hurricane Katrina, 1,836 dead
3. 1930’s Dust Bowl
4. 1906 San Francisco fire / earthquake 3,000 dead
5. 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, at least 2,500 dead
6. 1980 Heat Wave, massive drought, and 10,000 dead
7. 1988 Heat Wave, between 5,000 and 10,000 dead.
8. 1889 Johnstown Flood, leveled 1,600 homes, killing 2,209
9. 1871 Peshtigo Fire; scorched 12 towns and left 1,200 dead
10. 1925 Tri-State Tornado, nearly 700 dead
But let’s not focus only on the USA, where statistics are easy to get. Let’s look at other parts of the world. Now here’s a graphic (sorry about the quality) showing cyclone activity in the bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea from 1890 until 2000. Looks downward to me. Here the vertical axis shows the annual frequency of cyclones and the x-axis shows the year. The dark line is the 10-year moving average.
http://climatereview.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/hurrikan-mix/

Fewer people than ever are dying from weather extremes
And what about deaths globally? With all the bad climate change and growing populations, you’d think people would be getting killed on a massive scale. The following graphic shows the opposite is true.
http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html

All the panic is in the newsrooms
So why do some believe that extreme weather events are occurring more often than ever and that more people are dying and suffering? This is because the media stories have increased dramatically over the years, as they report on every Tiny Tim storm out there as if it were a Cat 5.  It’s overhyped.
Source of following graphic: http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n3/fig_tab/7400924_f1.html
Mounting media reports

The above graphic shows the number of newspaper reports about climate change, which is often cited as the reason for every weather anomaly happening out there. Fortunately, things on this big blue planet of ours have been quieter weatherwise, and people have caught on with respect to what all the media hype is about.
All the commotion is coming from the over-agitated folks in the newrooms.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn AP video report here in German reports on the biggest Merapi eruption in 100 years, and what potentially lurks.
More than 122 people have been killed thus far as the volcano continues to blast clouds of ash into the atmosphere. Over 200,000 people have been evacuated from the area so far. Experts are uneasy. At the 3o sec. mark, the AP video reports:
In the meantime, speculation of a possible gigantic eruption is making the rounds. Although Merapi does not show it, there’s a risk of a mega-eruption at any time. A collapse of the mountain could cause movement of the huge magma reserve underneath. If the heavy rock mass above it were to disintegrate, the magma would be freed and could be blown out. But no expert wanted to make an exact prognosis.
As reported earlier here at this blog, experts estimate that a reservoir of magma three times the size of what was ejected by the mighty Tambora eruption of 1815 remains trapped under immense pressure underneath Merapi. Tambora had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 7 and led to global cooling, the year without a summer.
For now, it’s wait and see with Merapi.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBermain Game Online? Ketahui Tentang Pokerqq! Tingkat anonimitas dalam game online menghasilkan hasil yang jelas untuk Anda dalam permainan. Sangat sulit untuk diintimidasi jika Anda tidak tahu. Atau bahkan tidak dapat melihat lawan Anda dalam bermain. Hal ini juga menciptakan peluang untuk berteman melalui ruang obrolan jika diinginkan. Hal ini bukan cara eksklusif untuk bermain permainan online. Tetapi Anda cenderung lebih nyaman terlibat dalam forum online dalam pokerqq.
Dalam bermain online juga menawarkan kesempatan untuk memainkan beberapa tabel sekaligus. Pemain pokerqq online yang berpengalaman akan segera merasa bosan jika fokus hanya pada satu meja meskipun mereka adalah game yang sangat cepat dibandingkan dengan permainan langsung.
Sebentar lagi mereka akan bermain 2 sampai 4 meja pada saat yang bersamaan. Tetap fokus pada banyak lawan dan jepit akan membantu Anda belajar untuk melakukan banyak tugas. Ini akan sangat membantu Anda ketika bergabung dengan tabel langsung, karena tidak ada seorang pun yang bisa membantu menghitung semua angka-angka itu dan semuanya harus terus masuk ke dalam kepala Anda. Ketahui informasi terlengakpnya mengenai permainan pokerqq online di http://www.ligaqq.com/.
Tetap Diinformasikan
Perbedaan penting lainnya dari dunia digital ke dunia nyata sebenarnya adalah aspek digital dari permainan online. Saat bermain di ruang poker online, Anda akan diberikan banyak informasi berbeda seperti jumlah chip Anda dan jumlah chip lawan.
Mungkin juga ada berbagai statistik yang ditampilkan tentang lawan Anda seperti peringkat, berapa kali masing-masing telah dilipat, berapa kali mereka mencuri pot dalam permainan pokerqq dll. Semua data yang tersedia ini membuat perbedaan besar ketika datang untuk menghitung peluang dan membantu dalam Anda keputusan ketika All In yang ditakuti diumumkan.
Jadi Mana yang Terbaik, Pokerqq Online atau Poker Offline?
Namun dalam permainan poker offline, Anda harus mempertahankan angka-angka ini di kepala Anda. Sampai tingkat tertentu jika Anda ingin mempertahankan keunggulan ini dalam permainan. Bahkan di ruang poker langsung terbaik, saya telah melihat banyak pemain yang melebih-lebihkan tumpukan lawan mereka atau salah menilai jumlah chip dalam pot.
Di kasino, Anda akan sering mendengar pemain bertanya kepada dealer berapa banyak chip yang ada. Ini akan berubah menjadi permainan yang panjang, yang tidak mungkin dimainkan secara online, karena putarannya diatur secara kaku.
Sekali lagi ini memberikan keunggulannya sendiri pada permainan, karena beberapa pemain akan menggunakan taktik ini untuk membuat orang lain frustrasi untuk melakukan gerakan yang ceroboh. Ini adalah salah satu kelemahan utama ketika Anda bermigrasi dari bermain langsung.  Pemain online jarang mendapatkan kesempatan untuk mengembangkan kesabaran mereka, terutama karena banyak pemain sering bermain empat meja sekaligus.
Ada juga keuntungan tertentu untuk bermain online ketika datang ke turnamen bermain. Online, Anda bisa mendaftar di turnamen mana pun yang Anda inginkan, jika Anda dapat membayar biaya masuk tentunya. Ukuran, tanpa batas, biaya masuk, taruhan tinggi, ini semua adalah pilihan yang Anda inginkan.
Turnamen lokal oleh kasino favorit Anda akan selalu tersedia untuk Anda, tetapi turnamen itu tidak sesering dan dapat diakses seperti saat bermain online. Juga fakta bahwa Anda berada di zona nyaman bukan lingkungan asing akan sangat membantu meningkatkan kepercayaan diri Anda. Plus Anda bisa bermain tanpa celana jika itu yang Anda sukai.
Demikian ulasan dari artikel kami mengenai permainan pokerqq online dan offline. selamat bermain dan semoga menyenangkan!

Share this...FacebookTwitterVarious blogs and alternative media outlets like PR Week today are reporting on the disbanning of the anti-capitalist, anti-carbon radical environmental cult campaign known as the Camp for Climate Action.
This is the crazed campaign that attempted to storm the Drax coal-fired power plant and blockaded the British Airports Authority. According to Wikipedia the campaign’s overall puprose was to…
…act as a base for direct action against, major carbon emitters, as well as to develop ways to create a zero-carbon society. Camps are run on broadly anarchist principles…”
In a statement appearing at its website, the Climate camp is calling the step a “metamorphosis”.
The reason for the metamorphosis is:
The near-collapse of the financial system; droughts in the Amazon, floods in Pakistan; a new government in the UK; a violent programme of unprecedented cuts; food prices rising and real incomes eroding; revolutions across the Middle East… This is all very different from 2005 when the Camp for Climate Action first met to spark radical action on the greatest threat to humanity, climate change.”
The Camp for Climate has apparently grown tired of its civil disobedience and squatting out in nature. Their new mission:
…we will launch new radical experiments to tackle the intertwined ecological, social and economic crises we face.”

Wonderful. That’s exactly what the world needs right now: bored kook activists performing “radical experiments” on society for the pupose of avoiding imagined social and economic crises. Has the British healthcare system deteriorated to the point that it can no longer care for its mentally ill?
Obviously the movement has now been taken over by more refined, sophisticated lawyer-type activists, who see an opportunity to capitalise. Its leaders will probably get offices in London, Paris, Berlin, etc., a staff of legal advisors, and will criss-cross all over the world in jets to every type of UN-sponsored save-the-planet-conference with the rest of the environmental NGO leaders  – all funded by the EU, UN and other special interests.
Expect it to bully corporations into making donations, and threaten to send out its thugs if they don’t. The Climate Campaign ends its statement with (emphasis added):
Now is a chance to team up with the anti-cuts and anti-austerity movements and play a crucial role in the revolutionary times ahead. Anything but co-ordinated action is doomed to fail.
See you on the streets.”
Lovers of democracy and freedom – beware!

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, the IPCC got one on the knuckles for grossly exaggerating Himalayan glacial ice melt, preposterously claiming the glaciers there would be gone by 2035. Now it comes to light that the IPCC has also grossly exaggerated the importance of glaciers as a source of fresh water supply for populations. 
This is what the German language online Die Presse writes here. (Read here in English).
If climate change does come, like some crystal balls are forecasting, then the glaciers melting and diminishing would reduce or eliminate melt water. The IPCC claims that it could impact perhaps 50 to 60 percent of the world’s population, 500 million people in the Ganges region in India alone!
But these numbers are quite exaggerated, claims Austrian experts Prof. Georg Kaser and Dr. Ben Marzeion of the Institute of Geography of the University of Innsbruck in Austria:
In the last few years numbers have been named that do not pass a closer examination. It is an exaggeration when it is claimed that the melting of glaciers endangers the water supply of 2 billion people.“
The professors of geology and their colleagues have examined data like precipitation, temperature and the glaciers, taken together throughout the year.

Just imagine you find yourself at the Ganges delta, it’s summertime, and a lot of melt water is coming down. But during the warm months, there are also the monsoons. And when there is a lot of land area on which the monsoons fall between you and the glaciers, glacier water plays a minor role.”
Die Presse writes that this is the case everywhere for the region south of the Himalayas. This means that the 500 million people in the region of the Ganges would therefore hardly be effected.
Dr. Ben Marzeion says the story is different for the region of the Aral Sea because the region is dry and depends more on glacier melt water. Here 10 million of the 40 million people would be significantly impacted.
In Europe, on the other hand, 81 million people live along the along Danube River.  An absence of glacier melt water would significantly impact only 310,000 people. Marzeion says:
That’s still a lot of people who would be effected, particularly in higher elevations near the glacier. But it is a relatively small number.”
The results of the study have been published in the renowned scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe know that more and more temperature stations have been sited in urban areas over the last few decades, and surely this has had an impact on the measurement of the globe’s temperature. But not to worry, say scientists, the raw data have been homogenized in order to compensate for this.
Elevated temperatures in urban environments. (Photo: NASA)
Have they compensated enough? Just how much uncertainty is in the land-based temperature record for the last 50 years? A new report from NASA shows some results that I think are surprising.
Summer land surface temperature of cities in the Northeast were an average of 7 °C to 9 °C (13°F to 16 °F) warmer than surrounding rural areas over a three year period, the new research shows. The complex phenomenon that drives up temperatures is called the urban heat island effect.
Dr Marc Imhoff, leader of the study, says that urban areas located in forested regions have a much more pronounced urban heating effect than in desert areas. Adjustment is neither an easy nor accurate task (emphasis added):
However, accurate comparisons have long eluded scientists because ground-based air temperature sensors tend to be unevenly distributed and prone to local bias. The lack of quantifiable definitions for urban versus non-urban areas has also hindered comparisons
But thanks to satellites, progress is being made in understanding the urban heat island effect. Satellite data have been used to compare various urban settings. Ping Zhang, a scientist at Goddard and a lead author of the research:
This, at least to our knowledge, is the first time that anybody has systematically compared the heat islands of a large number of cities at continental and global scales,”
Research by NASA scientists shows that compact urban areas have a higher urban heat  island effect that sprawling cities, and depend greatly on the surrounding environment, as mentioned above.
Taking the UHI effect has been the subject of much controversy over the years. This new study shows that it may have been significantly understated, at least in some areas.
Providence, R.I.; Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Boston, Ma.; and Pittsburgh, Pa.; had some of the strongest heat islands of the 42 northeastern cities analyzed.

These 3 examples have all trended upwards over the last 30 or 40 years. The actual siting and history of each station would have to be examined individually. So one can imagine what a mess this is and how arbitrary all this could be. Here we can be thankful for satellites.
The warming indeed is man-made, but in a different sense. The urban warming is what has impacted people in the summertime, especially at night.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that, between 1979 and 2003, heat exposure has caused more than the number of mortalities resulting from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes combined.
It is the lack of cooling at nighttime, rather than high daytime temperatures, that poses a health risk,” said Benedicte Dousset, a scientist from the University of Hawaii who also presented data about heat islands at the AGU meeting.
Urban planners will have to take this into account when designing cities in the future. Trees, trees and more trees can help a lot. Meanwhile, all this leaves James Hansen with a pile of almost useless data.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe self-anointed elite class of “real” journalists exposes the raw hostility and contempt it harbours for the very citizenry it purports to serve.
Sometimes you read something, somewhere, that causes many people to get angry. But the latest piece by the UK Guardian, Andrew Marr unloads on citizen bloggers, calling them “inadequate, pimpled, very drunk, angry and single,” just made my day. They are collapsing faster than I ever imagined.
Chumps like Marr are furious because nobody really takes them seriously anymore. Bloggers and free speech are ruining everything, and so he lashes out. Call it Marr’s controlled, yet expressive tantrum.
Enlightened journalists say they are in favour of progress, but progress is precisely what is killing them. They do not know how to deal with it. The growing sense of irrelevance is really tough on them.
The first reaction of course is to lash out emotionally. This is what Andrew Marr of the BBC has done. The Guardian writes:
The BBC‘s website has nearly 100 blogs and invites its readers to “have your say” on an enormous range of topics, from Westminster to the weather.
But one of the corporation’s most familiar faces, Andrew Marr, has dismissed bloggers as “inadequate, pimpled and single”, and citizen journalism as the “spewings and rantings of very drunk people late at night”.
Quoting Marr, who incidently is hired by the publicly-funded BBC, and whose obligation is to inform the public, cannot contain the utter contempt he harbours for his audience. The Guardian quotes Marr:
‘A lot of bloggers seem to be socially inadequate, pimpled, single, slightly seedy, bald, cauliflower-nosed young men sitting in their mother’s basements and ranting. They are very angry people. OK – the country is full of very angry people. Many of us are angry people at times. Some of us are angry and drunk’.
You really need to read the whole Guardian piece. I guarantee you’ll be entertained by the frustration these malcontents are feeling. You’ll quickly understand why they fantasize of detonators with red buttons, and why they think exploding children are “kind of funny”.

Well, I really think it’s funny that they are emotionally exploding. And yet it is indeed extremely sad to watch these once reputable journalistic institutions fall so far. But it’s by their own doing.
The citizens’ view of “mainstream” journalism
Allow me to use Marr’s own comments and change them to tell you what we as citizens feel about the established media. I think many will agree. Here’s how I’d put it:
Many of society’s common readers have dismissed ‘mainstream’ journalism as inadequate, hypocritical and condescending, and mainstream journalism as the “spewings and rantings of arrogant, narrow-minded, dogmatic, and frustrated people – day and night.
A lot of mainstream journalists seem to be isolated from the mainstream public, dressed in fancy clothes, arrogant, quite seedy, toupè-wearing, high-nosed grumps sitting in their newsrooms and ranting about how atupid their readers are. They are very angry, frustrated people. OK – the country is full of very frustrated people. Many of us are frustrated people at times. Some of us are really angry and frustrated, and we dream of red-buttoned detonators.
So-called mainstream journalism is the spewings of contempt for the working classes, from very arrogant hypocrites sitting in ivory towers that are funded by the taxpayers. Take Andrew Marr as an example.
It is fantastic at times but it is no longer the future of journalism.
Most of journalism is simply too condescending and too arrogant. Much disinformation is printed because they cannot cope with inconvenient truths. Mainstream journalists fantasize of explosive horror clips, about things that they’d love to do to their uncooperative readers.
The former readers of mainstream journalism, like many in the blogosphere, have previously criticised the tone and the quality of journalism, saying we have stopped reading most mainstream journalism like the BBC. It’s out of touch with its original purpose, and the citizens it is supposed to serve, and not insult.
‘It’s a waste of my time,’ say the average citizens, adding that mainstream journalism is most often written by people who think they ought to tell the rest of us how to think, that citizens are too stupid to do so on their own, and think it’s okay to abuse and insult them, just as Andrew Marr does.
But in the end, we “drunk and pimpled” citizens do not need to fantasize about red buttons and blowing up “real” journalists. The “real” journalists are pressing their own self-destruct red buttons all by themselves.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn an earlier post, Silence of the Greens, I broke one of my own rules (not to delete opposing views, like RC does). But in this case, I felt one particular annoying ultra-warmist reader needed to learn his own lesson. That is, if they are going to make rules for the rest of us to live by, then they too ought to live by those rules too, just to see what it’s like.
We already know that top warmists demand we live carbon-free lives, yet they themselves leave carbon footprints the size of craters.
In the comments of the above mentioned post, I posed the following question to the annoying warmist reader:
You do know that you are free to say what you want here, though I do not agree with it. At RealClimate their rules are a bit different. Opposing comments never see the light of day.
Now, are you going to argue that your side is always correct, and that the sceptics are wrong, and thus it’s correct that their comments are deleted? If so, then you are only confirming the intolerance I’ve written about here. RC is notorious for their suppression of dissent. An exchange of differing views like we are having here would not be possible at RC.
The warmist reader replied:
The reason why climate scientists remove posts is simply because they think Deniers are trolling and don’t even believe themselves what they post!
They think Deniers are merely trying to prolong the debate. This provides the impression to the public of a meaningful debate between two equally informed groups which isn’t the case. To them its like arguing with Apollo moon hoax conspiracy theorists or even flat earthers! They want to move on to debate the detail of how warm and how fast, not if.

Name me one climate scientist (sceptic or otherwise) who believes man has no effect on the rate of warming.
As an Engineer I’m more interested in solutions, but I do get annoyed at people deliberately misleading others, life is difficult enough without that sort of thing.
It’s mean, I know, but I decided that this reader should learn a lesson and live according to his own rules, and so I proceeded to snip all his comments, citing: “trolling and saying things you yourself do not even believe (RC Policy – sorry)”. The small-minded reader must have wasted a good amount of time, as he wrote a good three pages worth of childish provocation.
Really sorry about that.
I won’t do this in the future with other readers, unless of course they get as annoying and provocative as this particular reader did.
I have saved the content of this warmist reader, and so there is the possibility I’ll repost them. It wasn’t all bad. But at the moment, I think this person should find better ways to spend his time.
Deserved? Or not?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s Joe Bastardi’s advice. But some out there are sure the warming is going to continue no matter what. “Just look at the models!”, they keep saying. Problem is, models are not data from observation, instead they are scenarios of data that might be measured in the future.
The start of this decade certainly isn’t paying attention to the models, as Joe Bastardi explains in his latest video here.
JOE’S LATEST VIDEO
The 9-month ENSO lag is going to put 2011 a long way away from “one of the warmest years”. These “warmest” years are about to disappear for awhile as the PDO goes into its cool side. Note what Joe said:
Unfortunately, this La Nina shows no signs of stopping, and is going to stay down there for quite awhile.”
That’s not what the models were projecting 6 months ago. Seems like the activity that modellers spend the most time working on after making models, is revising them. Here’s what THE MODELS projected 6 months ago:

And here’s what THE MODELS are now projecting:
The models are all over the place. Huge uncertainty. 
Note the huge range! There’s gonna be a whole lot of revising going on in the months ahead.
Next, all you need to do is to look at the following chart to see where we’re headed on a decadal scale. The warm phase is behind us and we are now starting a cool phase – that means more La Ninas in the works, which means cooler global temps ahead.
Headed back into the cool phase.
Many out there are gonna continue banging their heads against the wall insisting that the warming will defy PDO gravity and the cycles, and continue in the years ahead. Nothing we say will change their minds. That’s why I say, let’s just let the events unfold, and we’ll see who’s right soon enough.
This coming decade is going to be a cooler one – all because of natural cycles – and that’s why I’m betting on a cooler decade. The big climate bet is out there, and the next 10 years very very likely will answer the big climate question. You can join the bet too. Best of all, no matter who wins, it’s for charity.
JOIN THE CLIMATE BET FOR CHARITY
Winning this bet may end up being as easy as taking candy away from a baby. We’ll know soon enough.
And finally, my advice to you warmests who are in it for politics – milk the last decade being the warmest all you can, while you can – because it’s about to get doused with lots of cold water.

===================================================
Is CO2 Warming a Mirage?
By Ed Caryl
There are three levels in the atmosphere where CO2 could act: at the surface, in the troposphere, and high in the atmosphere where radiation to space is greater than thermal absorption. In each location the conditions are different, and the way CO2 acts is different.
At the surface, the CO2 “back radiation” has been a mystery to many, this author included. Some argue that such a thing doesn’t exist, that it is against the second law of thermodynamics. It does exist, but the mechanism does not work very often, or exactly as advertised. This article will throw you some curves, and many numbers, but will stay away from complicated mathematics. Complex math is unnecessary.
First, the basics: CO2 is a three-atom molecule. It can be visualized as one carbon atom with two oxygen atoms attached, one on each side, in a straight rod configuration. As such, it is “non-polarized”, that is the charges on each atom balance, and the charge on the whole molecule appears to be zero as viewed from any angle. Thus, it has only two modes of vibration when excited by infrared radiation (IR). It can vibrate in and out along the long axis, like a rod that has been struck on one end, or it can vibrate parallel to the axis, like a rod that has been struck in the middle.
The vibration mode along the long axis is only excited in an asymmetric mode, where the end atoms move together in the same direction at the same time. The symmetrical stretch, where the oxygen atoms both move away from the carbon atom then back towards it, does not expose any charge, so doesn’t radiate or absorb radiation.
Figure 2. The vibration modes of CO2. From the top, only the 2nd and 3rd modes contribute to CO2’s IR activity. (Source: Chemwiki, UC Davis)
Figure 3 below shows radiation transmitted by the atmosphere. Conversely, that part that is not transmitted is absorbed. Note: only two peaks of CO2 act to absorb radiation that water vapor does not. Those peaks are at 4.25 µm and 15 µm. The 4.25-µm peak occurs at a wavelength that has little long-wave radiation by the earth.
Figure 3: Source Wikimedia Commons.
The 15-µm peak is the only one that is important in the greenhouse gas discussion. The atmospheric transmission at that frequency is such that less than 5% of the radiation gets through a 1-meter path at one atmosphere with the normal amount of CO2. This means that any radiation from the ground at the wavelengths that CO2 will absorb and re-radiate will be intercepted very close to the ground, most of it within a meter. The standard story is that when the energy is re-radiated, half goes up and half goes back down to the ground. But here is the rest of the story:
When a CO2 molecule is irradiated, it takes from 7 to 15 microseconds (a microsecond is 10-6 seconds) before it re-radiates. In air at standard pressure (1000 millibars), the air molecules are undergoing 1010 (10 billion) collisions per second. This means that before the CO2 molecule can get rid of the energy by re-radiating, it has very probably gotten rid of the energy thermally by colliding with other air molecules, oxygen and nitrogen, that do not re-radiate, about 100,000 times. It is true that some CO2 molecules will gain energy by these same collisions, at room temperature about 5% are excited at any time, but most of them lose the energy thermally before they can radiate.
At the surface, the ground is radiating long wave IR into the atmosphere. But, as described above, that radiation does not go very far. Half of it is absorbed in a few centimeters. If “back radiation” exists, some of the energy would be returned to the ground, but on the way back to the ground, CO2 molecules would absorb an additional fraction. That heat is then further absorbed by more thermal collisions with other air molecules. In any case the result is heated air.

This is especially visible above dark, flat surfaces, like asphalt roadways, or flat gravel deserts, if conditions favor, as an interior mirage, as in figure 1. An interior mirage occurs when the air at ground level is hotter than the air above it, making the ground level air less dense, thus with a lower index of refraction. This acts as a crude lens, making things higher up in the background, like the sky, hills, or higher background objects appear as if they were inverted at ground level. The sky or distant terrain can sometimes look like rippling water in this situation.
This phenomenon does not happen everywhere, only where conditions are right to hold the hot air at the surface and where IR heating is high. Any vertical relief, such as sloping ground, trees, grass, brush or other vegetation, will encourage convection and interfere with the radiation, and the warmer air will rise away from the surface. Lighter surfaces and vegetation also have less emissivity, thus there is less IR to interact with CO2. It does not happen over water, ice, or snow. Over those surfaces, another type of mirage happens, a superior mirage.
Figure 4. This is a superior mirage of Point Reys National Seashore seen in the background from San Francisco Bay. The image is not inverted. Point Reys is over 50 kilometers away, and over the horizon from this location. Source: Wikipedia Commons.
A superior mirage occurs when the air is colder and denser at the surface than higher up, and refracts a distant image along the surface, sometimes one that is over the actual horizon, making it visible as in Figure 4. This is an indication that IR heating is not taking place. We know that IR heating will not take place over ice or snow, because both the temperature and the emissivity are low. It does not take place over water because the water temperature and air temperature over it are usually very close. Any heat generated by IR is lost to water evaporation.
What happens to an inferior mirage when CO2 increases? The atmosphere becomes a bit more opaque at the wavelengths where CO2 absorbs energy, and the height where the energy is absorbed lowers slightly. Instead of 95% absorbed at 1 meter, we have 95% absorbed at 80 cm. Only where it is absorbed changes, not how much. There would be little difference in appearance of the mirage, and no difference in heating.
What happens further up in the atmosphere? For that I bow to others. It involves a concept called Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Tom Vonk has a good explanation here. The CO2 in the atmosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) up to about 100 km. If the atmosphere is in LTE, an increase in CO2 does nothing. It is only at the top of the atmosphere that CO2 can radiate heat to space, and more CO2 there will result in more radiation.
At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), if there is more CO2, there is more long-wave radiation to space, and the high atmosphere cools. Google Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium on the web; you will see many articles talking about non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Many of these are discussing cooling at the TOA by ozone, CO2, and other processes.
Some readers will say that my explanation is wrong; that an inferior mirage is simply from the surface heating the air by conduction. Air is an insulator. There is some heating of the air by convection, especially if the surface is sloping or irregular, but most of the air heating is by radiation.
There is no “back radiation” if the air is cooler than the surface, because heat (radiation) cannot flow from a cooler body (the air) to a warmer body (the ground surface). There is only radiation upward from the hot ground to the cooler air, which is then absorbed by the CO2 in the air. If the air happens to be warmer than the ground, then radiation can flow the other way and heat the ground, but this is rare. For a good tutorial on the subject of heat flow, go to this site, and download Chapter 26 – Heat Transfer.
In summary: The ground surface is heated only by solar shortwave radiation. This heats the ground, which then radiates long wave IR back into the atmosphere. At the wavelengths where CO2 and water vapor are opaque, this IR is absorbed and heats the atmosphere. If CO2 increases, only the height at which this happens changes. This height is very close to the surface, on the order of 1 meter or less. Back radiation only happens if the air is warmer than the ground. At elevations above 1 meter, the atmosphere is in LTE and increased CO2 does nothing. At the TOA, increased CO2 can radiate to space, cooling the TOA.
Increased CO2 warming is nothing but a mirage.

=========================================================
Indeed, for those of us reading reliable reports, we get the sense that they are slowly gaining the upper hand over the problems.
On the other hand, listening to the media report on the Fukushima sitiuation is a bit like listening to a hysterical child who is convinced that he has just seen the boogey man under his bed. Here’s an example of media stupidity and sensationalism:
You just can”t rely on this kind of low level media for accurate, factual and cool-headed information. Not surprisingly, some Germans, who are 9000 km away from the reactors, are actually out buying iodine pills and Geiger counters. Some are probably even digging bomb-shelters by now.
So get the latest news from experts, instead. Here’s the latest update (reality):
From World Nuclear News here (emphasis added): ================================================================

Problems for units 3 and 4
16 March 2011
Earlier, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that a blaze was spotted in the reactor building of Fukushima Daiichi 4 at 5.45am local time this morning. Attempts to extinguish it were reportedly delayed due to high levels of radiation in the area. A spokesperson for TEPCO said that by around 6:15am there were no flames to be seen. The incident at unit 4 is believed to be in the region of a used fuel pond in the upper portion of the reactor building.
FIRST PUBLISHED 0.25am GMT
UPDATE 1:14am GMT
Information from TEPCO spokesman and video feed
UPDATE 2: 4:10am GMT
Update title from ‘Second fire reported at unit 4’ and information on Unit 3 and 4 from Chief Cabinet Secretary Edano
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano has described problems that occurred on the morning of 16 March with Fukushima Daiichi 3 and 4. He also outlined plans to pump water into unit 4.
At 8:34am local time white smoke was seen billowing out of Fukushima Daiichi 3. Efforts to determine the cause of this development were interrupted as all workers had evacuated to a safe area due to rising radiation readings. Readings from a sensor near the front gate had fluctuated for some time, although Edano said that on the whole there was no health hazard. Earlier in the morning readings had ranged between 600-800 microsieverts per hour, but at 10am readings rose to 1000 microsieverts per hour. Readings began to fall again from around 10:54.
Edano said that one possibility being considered was that the unit 3 reactor had suffered a similar failure to that suffered by unit 2 yesterday, although there had been no reported blast or loud sound, which had been the case for unit 2. The immediate focus, said Edano was on monitoring of levels and checking pumping operations.
It was not clear whether the increase in radiation readings were due to the problems today with unit 3 or the ongoing problems resulting from the damage suffered by unit 2, yesterday.
Edano also outlined plans for units 4. Preparations were being made to inject water into unit 4, however the high levels of radiation from unit 3 were impairing those preparations. When possible, the water injection would be done gradually as there were safety concerns over pouring a large amount of water at once. The water will be pumped into the reactor building from the ground, plans to drop water from a helicopter having been abandoned. Although he said that “all things were possible” Edano did not believe that recriticality at unit 4 was a realistic risk.
Second fire at unit 4
Tokyo Electric Power Company issued a notice of an explosion at unit 4 at 6am on 15 March. This was followed by the company’s confirmation of damage around the fifth floor rooftop area of the reactor building. On that day, a fire was discovered but investigations concluded it had died down by around 11am. At present it is not clear whether today’s fire was a completely new blaze, or if the fire reported yesterday had flared up again.”

Here it is in a nutshell:
Reactors 1 and 2: There no news mentioned here about them. And there is a saying about “no news”. Let’s hope it stays that way.
Reactor 3: White smoke was seen, radiation levels went up, but have since come back down. They are monitoring levels and checking pumping operations. I can’t discern a disaster there.
Reactor 4: Here we see that a fire was spotted this morning at 5:45. By 6:15 there were no more flames to be seen.
Overall there are no reports that any of the reactors and containment facilities having melted down, let alone exploded like Chernobyl.
And if the World Nuclear News is not good enough, here’s the latest status report from:
IAEA (emphasis added):
==========================================

Japan Earthquake Update (16 March 2011, 03:55 UTC)
Japanese authorities have informed the IAEA that a fire in the reactor building of Unit 4 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was visually observed at 20:45 UTC of 15 March. As of 21:15 UTC of the same day, the fire could no longer be observed.
Fire of 14 March
As previously reported, at 23:54 UTC of 14 March a fire had occurred at Unit 4. The fire lasted around two hours and was confirmed to be extinguished at 02:00 UTC of 15 March.
Water Level in Unit 5
Japanese authorities have also informed the IAEA that at 12:00 UTC of 15 March the water level in Unit 5 had decreased to 201 cm above the top of the fuel. This was a 40 cm decrease since 07:00 UTC of 15 March. Officials at the plant were planning to use an operational diesel generator in Unit 6 to supply water to Unit 5.
The IAEA continues to liaise with the Japanese authorities and is monitoring the situation as it evolves.”
==================================
Or read here: http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/artikeldetail/article/111/tschernobyl-wiederholt-sich-nicht.html
In a nutshell, no news about Reactors 1-3, the Reactor 4 fire appears to be extinguished, and Reactor 5 seems to be threatening something, but the means of controlling that are at hand.
This all doesn’t mean that we are out of the woods. The next hours will tells us more. In the meantime be careful with all the Hollywood-type of drama and hype you hear from the clueless media and Greenpeace “experts”.
Also you can get press releases from the reactor operator TEPCO. But the press releases are confusing:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online news magazine FOCUS reports here today that a new record low temperature has been set at a station in Antarctica.
The Neumayer III station, operated by Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, has recorded the lowest temperature at their Antarctic location since the start of operations there 29 years ago. The mercury dropped to -50.2°C.
According to polar meteorologist Gert König-Langlo of the Neumayer III, such similarly low temperatures have been recorded only 10 times since Neumayer operations began at this location. Says König-Langlo:
This is the first time we’ve gone under the minus 50 degree mark.
The Neumayer III is located on the approximately 200-meter thick Ekstrom Ice Shelf. The station is moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year in the direction of the open sea.FOCUS online is quick to point out that this record cold is not a sign of climate change, but rather it is a local regional weather phenomenon (only warm events are signs of climate change).
According to König-Langlo:
The cause was the ongoing cloudless and very low wind weather conditions, which is rare in the region. A light breeze is enough to put an end to the phenomenon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany, climatology has become the Trabant of sciences.
Reading all the climate doom and gloom in the more prominent German online papers like Der Spiegel, Die Welt, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, etc., you’d think by now readers would have long since barricaded themselves inside their homes and crawled under their beds in angst, in order to hide from the dreaded Klimakatastrophe. 
So frequent are the alarmist climate stories. Normally such stories would be better placed in the comics section. But in Germany newspapers don’t have a comics section, and so they get mixed in with the news.
Day after day normally respectable papers are filled with worst-case reports, often extracted from press releases dribbled out by tax-payer funded panic-houses like the authoritarian Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
But, hardly anyone believes them anymore:  90% to 10%.
Yesterday I read yet another rehashed panic story in Die Welt, whose title translates: Heat Waves Threaten With Increasing Frequency.
Very revealing are the reader comments. Judging from them, a majority of German readers scoff at the claims the planet is heating up catastrophically, and do so with a whoppingly huge majority.

At Die Welt, readers who write comments can be rated by other readers with either a “thumbs up” if you agree with the comment, or a “thumbs down” if you don’t. So I counted up the number of “thumbs up” and the number of “thumbs down” for the first 20 reader comments that appeared after the above mentioned piece. The result (Saturday, 5:15 pm): 
Number agreeing with the sceptics:   1864  (90.2%)
Number agreeing with the warmists:  203  (  9.8%) 
Wunderbar! Alarmist climate science has lost its credibility, authority and trust, it seems. There’s hope for real climate science after all. Yes, a broad majority of informed Germans, at least Die Welt readers, believe climate science forecasts fundamentally are rubbish. Sure this is not a real survey. But to me it’s a clear signal.
 Some online papers have even given up allowing readers to have their say, having grown tired of being told their “news” are rubbish. So give Die Welt some credit for allowing readers to have a voice.
Interestingly, the Germans have a wide selection of words that mean “nonsense”, and one finds them used regularly in reader comments about climate. Here are some: Unsinn, Bloedsinn, Quatsch, Unfug, Dummheit, and Humbug. 
Now we can add another to the list of synonyms: Klimawissenschaft (climate science). So now when my son worries about a minor matter, I simply tell him: “Don’t worry, it’s all climate science”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs the hysteria reaches new levels and the anti-atomic power groups are ever more adamant about a nuclear-free Germany, Angela Merkel has been pressured to announce that some of Germany’s nuclear power plants will be closed. That’s probably good news for the gas industry, and for Germany’s neighbours.
But right now, Germany does not have the gas capacity to step in and take up the slack, and so expect the country to put its gas development on the fast-track, and to import.
The construction of coal power plants faces massive resistance here, and so that too is also out of the picture. So where will Germany get its power when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow?
By abandoning coal and nuclear, Germany may succeed in isolating itself when it comes to energy. Either it will have to become dependent on its neighbors, or its population will be expected to behave like energy misers and to fret over every milliwatt that gets used.
Some of Germany’s electric power will be generated by natural gas. And the rest? Not to worry. Germany has got plenty of neighbors around who are less prone to atomic hysteria and who will be willing to sell power – for a price. Plenty of new atomic power capacity is being planned just to the east (see World Nuclear Association). And everywhere else around the world, atomic power plants are being constructed, planned or proposed.
Reactors now under construction
According to the World Nuclear Association, 62 reactors are currently under construction.

China: 27 reactors
Russia: 10
India: 5
Germany: 0
Many more reactors are being planned – 158 in total. When one looks at the chart, Germany columns are filled with goose eggs.
China: 50 reactors
India: 18
Japan: 12
Russia 14
USA: 9
Germany: 0
And many more are being proposed: 324 reactors in all.
China: 110 reactors
India: 40
Italy 10
Russia 30
Ukraine: 20
Japan: 12
Russia 14
USA: 23
UAE: 10
Vietnam: 12
Turkey: 4
Poland: 6
Germany: 0
Plenty of Germany’s neighbors are positioning to take over the job of producing electricity. If Germany should find it’s too expensive to produce electricity with sun and wind, or it’s too difficult to get a steady supply, then it will have to call Italy, Ukraine, Poland or Russia for help.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel here gives us a good idea of the scale and magnitude of Japan’s massive Sendai earthquake, which weighed in at 9.0 on the Richter scale. It ought to remind some of us of nature’s fury and that we are powerless to steer it.
The earthquake occurred in the western Pacific Ocean, 130 km (81 mi) east of Sendai, Honshu, Japan. Its epicenter was 373 km (232 mi) from Tokyo, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
Massive energy
The earthquake opened up a 400 km long gash in the ocean floor, releasing a surface energy of 1.9×1017  joules (according to the USGS). The total energy released underground was about 205,000 times that on the surface.
This energy is equivalent to about 9.32 teratons of TNT, or approximately 600 million Hiroshima bombs, or about 80 years of global energy usage, estimated to be 4.74×1020 joules for the year of 2008 [Wikipedia]. That’s arguably more energy than what all of mankind has ever used so far.
Earth gets a facelift
All that energy gave the surface of the globe a facelift, literally. Wikipedia writes:

According to Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake’s enormous strength shifted the Earth’s axis by 25 centimeters (9.8 in). This deviation led a number of small changes, including those to the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth’s rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.6 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth’s mass.
A report by the U.S. Geological Survey said that Honshu, the main island of Japan, was shifted 2.4 m (7.9 ft) toward the east. Researcher Lucy Jones said of the precise data, “The Japanese have the best seismic information in the world… This is overwhelmingly the best-recorded great earthquake ever.”
Der Spiegel lists the top 11 earthquakes measured since 1900; location, year and strength:
1. Valdivia, Chile – 1960 – 9.5
2. Prince William Sound, Alaska – 1964 – 9.2
3. West Sumatra – 2004 – 9.1
4. Japan -2011 – 9.0
5. Kamtschatka – 1952 – 9.0
6. Chile – 2010 – 8.8
7. Ecuador – 1906 – 8.8
8. Rat Islands, Alaska – 1965 – 8.7
9. North Sumatra – 2005 – 8.6
10. Assam – 1950 – 8.6
11. South Sumatra – 1957 – 8.6
Strangely these events are bunched in the 1950s – 60s and the 2000s.
The Sendai earthquake has also unleashed of tsunami of hysteria here in Germany, where many media outlets are busy quoting organizations like Greenpeace on the risks of atomic power. The earthquake obviously has driven another nail into nuclear energy’s coffin in Germany, having galvanised opposition even more. So forget nuclear energy in Germany in the future. The results of the upcoming state elections will show this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe cold now sweeping over Europe and other parts of the globe are due to natural cycles, says German meteorologist Thomas Globig. He points out that the first 2 weeks of December in Britain have been the coldest since the last little ice age 350 years ago, and claims some climate models have criminally under-estimated solar influence on climate and that we ought to expect colder winters, and expanding Arctic ice in the years ahead. “Some climate forecasts will have to be thrown in the dustbin.”
All the talk and hype among the clueless masses have been, and still is, about global warming due to human emissions of CO2. Will the temperature rise be 2°C, 4°C or 10°C? Will we be able to avert the climate catastrophe?
Yes, it all sounds like a really bad B-rated movie. But it’s not – it’s all junk science produced by green activists. Ignore it. Dr Benny Peiser here brings our attention to an essay posted at wetter.t-online.de here.
The talk of this essay is not about warming, but of drastic cooling. According to wetter.info:
‘The year 2010 will be the coldest in ten years for Germany,’ says Thomas Globig of the Meteomedia weather service in a discussion with wetter.info.
Now it’s sure: temperatures in Germany this year have averaged 8.1 °C, or 0.2°C below the long-term measured average of 8.3°C.  ‘I’m afraid that by the end of the year, we are going to end up much lower,’ says Globig.”
Us sceptics know that climate goes in cycles. Back in the 60s and 70s Europe got a lot of snow. Then it got milder – due to man-made global warming! – all the government funded scientists opportunistically chimed in. But lo and behold, it’s getting colder again. People have been caught off guard says Globig.
Why is it getting cooler? 
Globig attributes it to natural cycles: mainly the large-scale changes in the air flow over the Atlantic and fluctuating solar activity. There are Lows near the Azores and Highs in the North Atlantic, which means cold Arctic air is getting pumped down across Europe. “The weather situation has been turned up on its head,” says Globig.
Oh – but this is all due to man’s disruption of the weather, the alarmists will tell you. It’s actually abnormal! Not so, says Globig:
This change in the so-called North Atlantic Oscillation is completely normal – only that they are difficult to forecast in detail.’ With storm Kyrill in 2007, it was the peak of air mass flow from the warmer Atlantic into the European region.
Globig points out:

 Since then, the weather over the Atlantic has gotten calmer.”
Calmer weather over the Atlantic? Time for the climatologists to bring their crystal balls in for a major recalibration. Their crackpot models predicted just the opposite.
The NAO has switched. That means we ought to expect more cold winters in the years ahead. That’s right – forget warming. Ignore all the morons in the mainstream media.
These low temperatures could continue for a few years, maybe decades. Even icier winters can’t be ruled out. ‘This has occurred before in the past, and has to do with natural climate changes,’ says Globig. We could even be at the start of a little ice age, ‘the probability is there.’
It has to do with solar activity, according to wetter-t-online.de:
It has gone past its high point of its 200-year high-phase and will decrease over the coming decades. Around the year 2040/2050, scientists calculate there will be a new so-called solar minimum, that means much less feed-in of solar energy into the Earth’s atmosphere.
And when that happens, it means colder times ahead. And that means colder poles, which means expanding Arctic ice. Like Joe Bastardi, and probaly hundreds, if not thousands, of meteorologists, Globig thinks so too.
‘I find it quite plausible that Arctic ice will expand considerably over the next years,’ says Globig. ‘The influence of solar activity on climate has been criminally under-estimated.’
‘We will really know what is in store for us in the next five to seven years,’ Globig believes. Indeed one thing appears to be very probable for meteorologists: ‘We will have to throw some climate forecasts into the dustbin.’
Today, I can practically tell who gets their longterm forecasts from whom. I went to a home & garden center today to buy a snow shovel – they were all sold out. The next shipment? At the end of January! How much worse can you get?
Tomorrow I will call the headquarters of this home & garden center to see if I can find out where they are getting their forecasts. I’ll bet you they are getting them from the warmist DWD German Weather Service.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Edward has just notified me that the Telegraph report was written in 2008! Sorry about that. It got by me.
But hey, it goes to show that the waxwings were right! Winter 2008-2009 turned out to be a harsh one.
My excuse: I wrote the post late last night after having a little fine whiskey with a mate of mine. Surely you can excuse that.
————————————————————-
The UK daily Telegraph has a piece on waxwing birds invading Britain, which means the winter may be a cold one. I wonder if Joe Bastardi takes such factors into account when formulating his seasonal forecasts.
H/T: NTZ reader: Edward.
In my last post I wrote about natural, “non-scientific” indicators for winter forecasting, which are often more accurate than models. The Telegraph piece is just another one to add to that list. So far I haven’t seen many signs that the coming winter will be warm, except that is for the worn out warnings propagated by the warmists and their goofy “models”.
The Telegraph writes:
The birds, from Scandinavia, have appeared all along the east coast of Scotland and England, and have been moving steadily south and west in search of food.

Gee, I thought global warming was supposed to force species further north, and not south. Actually, weren’t we told species were just too stupid to move, and would just die and become extinct. The Telegraph:
Although they are occasional visitors to the UK, the numbers this year are unusually high and have been classed as an “irruption”, to signify a large-scale arrival of a bird not normally found here.
It’s got to be climate change! Yeah, that’s it. Add waxwing birds to the list of things caused by global warming. I bet it aint on the list. Anyway:
Irruptions, or “invasions”, are prompted by failures of berry crops in Scandinavia.
Scandinavia did not have the warmest of summers this year, and light frosts have already hit the region. Good thing that birds are smart enough to adapt and move, and not stay stupid like warmists and just sit there, and rain-dance instead. And, says the Telegraph:
In the UK, large numbers have traditionally been linked to a cold, hard winter.
Another one! Man – I thought cold winters were suppose to be rare, and exciting.
All this of course is anecdotal, and it does not mean that the winter will be cold. It may be just another piece of evidence to support the claim the winter in Europe may be harsh.
And recently, another dodo-bird German scientist said that global warming will mean colder winters for Europe, and so maybe it will be a cold winter for sure. So if it’s cold out this winter – blame it on AGW.
Do read the Telegraph piece. It’s a good article for bird lovers (like my cat Hayli).

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace activists, in yet another reckless stunt to get on TV and in newspapers, stormed an oil drilling platform off the coast of Greenland, reports Der Spiegel here.  According to Der Spiegel, the intrusion forced an unplanned stop in drilling operation.
Whenever a drilling rig is forced to stop operation, it’s expensive. I can’t imagine what these crazed idiots say when storming a platform. “Stop! We’re here to save the planet! Stop drilling in the name of the planet!”
Anyway, Der Spiegel writes:
Four activists of the environmental organisation climbed onto the oil platform in order to protest the test drilling. Scottish company Cairn Energy stopped their work in response, reported the environmental activists.
“Sure lads, whatever you say”.
The Danish police were not amused. They now threaten the planet-rescuers with consequences. Morten Nielsen, Vice Chief of the Greenland Police:
Laws were broken; those responsible will be punished.

Let’s hope. In the meantime, the activists have chained themselves to the platform, and have enough provisions with them to last four days. They say:
 We have to stop our dependency on oil!
I wonder if they themselves paddle their Esperanza ship as they joyride around Greenland. And I’m sure there are hundreds of activists on-board on exercise bikes all pedalling away to produce the electricity the boat needs. Surely Greenpeace broke its dependency on oil a long time ago. Maybe it’s time to do research on the journeys and footprint of the Greenpeace fleet.
Also Greenland Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist had little sympathy for the publicity-seeking activists, reports Der Spiegel, calling their actions an “openly illegal act” and a “gross violation of safety laws”. It is, he says:
really worrying that Greenpeace, with the sole intention of getting publicity in the media, would employ such efforts to break every safety rule in order to protect people and the environment.
Greenpeace intends to exploit the BP Deep Horizon accident to the max, and take advantage of the sour public mood with oil companies. They want to show how dangerous oil drilling is for the environment. Says Tzeporah Berman at Greenpeace headquarters:
The confrontation in the Arctic is only the start.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt used to be that scientists communicated their knowledge through reliable professional journals, which then communicated to the media.
Apparently climate scientists are getting increasingly desperate, and so they are now going directly to the very bottom of the media chain and giving interviews to the mass-market, most sensationalist of the tabloids. Such is the latest with James E. Overland and Germany’s no. 1 tabloid Bild in a story titled:
Climatologist: Deadly Weather Chaos Will Be A Permanent Condition
Who would have ever thought it? Scientists from (once) one of the the world’s most prestigious scientific organisations, now have to go to the yellowist of tabloids to be heard.
Bild, the flagship publication owned by Axel Springer, has a circulation of over 4 million, more than the Wall Street Journal and USA Today combined. It is the paper of choice among the lesser educated in Germany.
In the Bild interview James Overland warned: “Things are going to get a lot worse.”
In the past, warm events were cited as mounting evidence of man-made global warming. But as these events diminish and cold events start piling up, desperate global warming scientists like Overland have been forced to concoct dubious science theories, and now claim the cold events are suddenly sure signs of warming. This is what Overland tells Bild over and over. Bild starts with:
Now a US climate scientist warns: ‘This turbulent weather is only the beginning!’ “
Overland claims that all the cold weather can be explained by a newly found theory: The melting of the Arctic sea has led to a complete collapse of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere air patterns – “the biggest collapse since the start of weather records 145 years ago.”
Overland warns:
The disappearance of the currents paired with the extreme winters are signs of something bigger and organised. It is almost frightening.”
It obvious by now that Overland’s “climate science” and tabloids were made for each other.
No absolute evidence!
Bild asked if there is any data to support this. Overland says:

We still don’t have any absolute evidence, but we have clearly measured that there is 30% less ice cover in the Arctic.”
Therein lies the beauty of tabloid science. Proof? Evidence? Data? That’s for scientific journals. Tabloids don’t need that sort of stuff. Bild then asks Overland about what to expect in the future.
In 30 years 80% of the Arctic ice may be gone. The extreme weather will intensify further. And the dramatic changes of the atmospheric system are obvious.”
And adds:
All our climate models show that the unpredictability of the weather is increasing dramatically as our planet heats up.”
He claims the models show it. They all but confirms the science. But then he adds the models are not able to detect surprises. For example, he was surprised by the 2007 Arctic ice shrinkage. And now they have just found the latest surprise – unforeseen by their models:
And now we are experiencing the next surprise, the collapse of the Arctic current and the flow of cold air to the south. It is alarming. We are entering new meteorological territory: The extreme weather is going to get a lot worse.“
Rahmstorf’s snowjob.
PIK snowjob
Everyone in Germany knows who is behind this Bild snowjob – Stefan Rahmstorf of the alarmist, science front-group Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).
That’s the institute that came out with a similar bogus theory to explain the cold winters, read here. But later even Rahmstorf backpedalled on this dubious Arctic sea ice – cold winter connection, read here. Yet Overland thinks even science rejected by Rahmstorf is good enough.
If you can’t make the case in the professional journals, then you take it to the tabloids and the masses and hope that mass popularity will win the day for your alarmist views.
It really is sad to see a scientist fall to that level of scientific destitution. Postulating is one thing, but calling postulates fact without evidence is quackery. Period.
In case there are any remaining questions as to the seriousness of Bild, here’s what they wrote in 2007:
But the heating of the earth is accelerating! If it gets 2 degrees warmer than today, then hundreds of millions of people will thirst and starve to death. Or they’ll drown in flood waves from swelling oceans.”
Like I say, made for each other.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace is known for breaking the law, trespassing, putting other people at risk, and chaining its members to drilling platforms to protest and, more importantly, to reap the capital of publicity. That’s one thing – but it’s quite another to recruit, psychologically manipulate, and exploit a child for the purpose waging psychological war on people who have different opinions. Greenpeace is ratcheting up the level of violence.
In the video that follows, posted by a reader at WUWT, Greenpeace instrumentalizes a hooded young boy as a propaganda pawn. The boy’s anger is clearly visible as he threatens and intimidates people with generational conflict. His expressions are militant, like those we see on tapes of crazed Islamic radicals released to publicize their threats. This is the new level of violence, directed and produced by Greenpeace.

Above: The new face of Greenpeace
No pediatricians in their right minds would condone such a use (misuse) of children. The boy is likely damaged behaviorally and socially because of it. Greenpeace needs to reflect on what it has done.
The child has been fed a diet of radical, angry and intolerant ideology; he makes his thinly veiled threats as prompted by his adult instructors. It’s possible the child is only acting out the part, so it’s not so bad – some will claim. But what has it taught him? That anger, intolerance and intimidation are power? That this is the way to reach objectives? And what message does he send to other children? It’s hardly an example of rational discourse. In fact it’s militant, shockingly militant.
The child is not even at an age that would allow him to form a balanced, informed and well thought-out opinion on the issue. Clearly he’s radicalized; he’s been manipulated. Greenpeace has preyed on a very young mind and used it as a psychological instrument of attack. These are methods and tactics which were once normally limited to most radical of religious groups. For sure the boy got pats on the back and high fives from his directors for his performance. The clip, after all, went viral. Aggression rules.
This new quality of violence by Greenpeace is not an isolated incident. The increasingly disturbing level of violence the once peaceful organization has resorted to is demonstrated by a rash of other violent incidents. The trend could not be more troubling. Gone are the days of a real environemtalal concern and peaceful protest.
Actively seeking violent confrontation
Today, Greenpeace purposely goes out and seeks confrontation – not in democratic debate with lawmakers, but in violent and at times bloody collisions with companies or organizations it disagrees with. Not long ago Greenpeace attacked French fishermen, who were minding their own business, working long days to make ends meet. See video here. If you’re against over-fishing, it’s okay. But take the issue up with the responsible lawmakers. That’s the appropriate avenue. Don’t go vandalizing and sabotaging legal businesses and putting families in financial jeopardy.

In another incident, a Greenpeace ship rammed into a Japanese fishing vessel, see below. Greenpeace claims, with the cover of the media, that the accident was the fault of the Japanese vessel. Judge for yourself:

Not long ago a leading Greenpeace official made threats directed at global warming skeptics. Prison Planet writes:
An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate activists to resort to criminal activity in an effort to reinvigorate momentum for their stalling global warming agenda, while ominously threatening climate skeptics, ‘we know where you live.’
Demands dissenters be charged with high crimes
The promotion of widespread violence has not only been restricted to Greenpeace. Sympathizers like environmentalist staff writer Dave Roberts of Grist Magazine called for the Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” who were members of what he termed the global warming “denial industry”.
Then NASA’s James Hansen complains about democracy, and is quoted by the the UK Guardian as saying:
The democratic process doesn’t quite seem to be working.
He called fossil fuel CEOs criminals, not citing any particular law – except his own. Read here. Hansen says:
 In my opinion, these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature.
James Hansen, and former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, have actively and openly called for civil disobedience.
Clearly they’ve lost all sense of reason and rationale. With such extreme rhetoric and a poisoned environment, it’s no wonder we got someone like James Jay Lee. And unless radicals like Greenpeace sober up and realize the folly and hazard they’ve become, expect worse to come in the future. It’s time to put these well-known radicals under close observation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading tabloid has a report today called: Expert: More and More Extreme Weather In Germany. What is this claim based on?
It’s based on short-term observations made by official Bild tabloid meteorologist Dominik Jung, who is quoted as saying:
Just take a look at the monthly deviations in average temperature in Germany from 2010. There you’ll notice an almost symmetrical up and down. Every positive extreme has a corresponding negative.”
One year of data says this will be the case for the future, with extremes even growing wider? So claims the Bild weatherman. Strangely, Bild refers to Jung as “Der Klima-Experte” (the climate expert). I thought meteorologists and climatologists were completely different. Obviously, when one makes extreme forecasts of disaster, then it qualifies a person as a “climate expert”.What data does Jung use to draw his extreme weather conclusion?
Numerous weather exremes resulted from the temperature anomalies last year, such as the coldest May since weather records are kept, and the long lasting heat wave of June-July, or multiple high water in East Germany.”
In summary, Jung bases his climate projection on 3 events that occurred in one single year. And my recollection is that the “long lasting heat wave of June-July” was a whole three weeks long, starting at the end of June and extending to about July 22, and was interrupted at least twice by cooler weather. What the heck – good enough to count as an extreme.
Jung then admits in the Bild article that no “general increase in storms or significant weather events” could be detected“, yet, storms will become “always more extreme and violent”. No trend is there? So what – let’s make a sensational baseless prediction – just for the tabloids!

Just how good a meteorologist is Jung? Not very good if you examine his forecast for the winter. On November 9, 2010 Bild published his seasonal forecast for the 2010-2011 winter, predicting Germany would have a very mild first half of December with temperatures reaching 15°C!
The exact opposite was the case.
He also predicted a short thaw in early February, then followed by another cold snap that would extend deep into March. That now looks doubtful. January and February have been a bit over normal, and looks to continue that way. But let’s give him credit where it is due: he predicted a white Christmas, which turned out right.
Lately we have been hearing a lot about weather extremes, many claiming 2010 was an extreme weather year globally. Just how extreme was 2010? You be the judge, from http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~maue/tropical/:
 For the calendar-year 2010:
**66-tropical cyclones globally, the fewest in the reliable record (since at least 1970)
**46-tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere, fewest since 1977
**Global calendar year ACE total of 529 was the lowest since 1977.
**The Northern Hemisphere ACE total of 373 was the lowest since 1977.
**Combined North Eastern and Western Pacific ACE total of 171 lowest since at least 1970.
**Western North Pacific had 8 Typhoons fewest in at least 65-years of records. 
**Eastern North Pacific had 8 TCs: 3 were hurricanes, the fewest since at least 1970. 
**North Atlantic ACE for 2010 was 170, the 11th most since 1950, and most since 2005.

Overall, since 1979: 
**Global Tropical Cyclone ACE shows no upward trend.
**Northern Hemisphere TC ACE shows no upward trend.
**Southern Hemisphere TC ACE shows no upward trend.
**North Atlantic TC ACE has doubled since 1995, exactly compensated by a halving of Eastern Pacific ACE. It appears that in the context of global and NH ACE, the NATL increases are at the expense of the other basins, or simply within the common climate framework.
**Global TCs of Tropical Storm force show no upward trend in frequency.
**Global TCs of Hurricane Force + show no upward trend in frequency.”
Tropical cylone ACE looks to be close to a record low. But that kind of news news doesn’t qualify to be printed in sensationalist tabloids.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wanted to hit the sack but a video clip in English of some excerpts from an interview of John Holdren by German intellectual paper DIE ZEIT. Click here::
http://www.zeit.de/wissen/2011-03/holdren-chefberater-obama
At about the 3:40 mark, Holdren is asked what will be the sciences of the future and the challenges. This takes him to climate change:
We are fortunately getting better, and we need to get better at understanding some very big systems, science systems issues including for example the science of ecosystems, the formation and fertilisation of soil, the pollination of crops, the regulation of climate. All of these things I think sometimes get lost in the discussion of the importance of infotech and nanotech and biotech. We need to understand how the parts fit togther, how they work because we are not yet remotely ready technologically to make planet earth into a speceship where all systems are designed by engineers. We still need nature, We need to understand how it works.”
I thought the science was settled. But  Holden now admits that we still need to understand how it all fits together – how it works. So how CO2 controls linearly controls the temperature, we we keep seeing in their charts, is a bit puzzling to me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m not devaluing what happened back in history. I’m using this to describe the true dimensions of what is about to happen to our rural heritage. This is not hyperbole!
Also see WUWT California reality.
Klimaretter has a useless piece here where the author calls the Fukushima event the spark that is setting off the Green Industrial Revolution, and can hardly contain his glee. That may be true in some countries, at least for now.
Industrialisation of rural and natural areas. Photo credit: http://www.treehugger.com
But what the author does not mention is that many true greens are getting awfully uneasy about the current wide-scale massacre and mechanisation of the the world’s most beautiful mountain ridges, coastal areas and rural landscapes. And unless this madness is stopped, you aint seen nothing yet.
Groups like Klimaretter, irreversibly blinded by dogmatism and anti-carbon fanaticism, hacks of the green industry, anti-carbon religion and Big Green Finance, are unwittingly pushing for the mass desecration of natural landscape and rural beauty. Yes – let’s ruin the surface of the planet because we think it’ll tame and preserve the behaviour of the atmosphere.
“This is atop the breaks in the caprock just south of San Jon, NM.” Source: http://www.wuest.org/mark/NYAdventure.html
True greens and skeptics may not agree on a lot of things, but we can all agree that the industrialisation of our countryside is a mortal sin against our natural heritage.
This is big industry, aided and abetted by the government, making a ton of money at the expense of little guys.
My hope is that the true greens will some day SOON realise that all this hype about CO2 causing climate change is wildy exaggerated by special interests (GE, Big Gas, banks and carbon traders, reinsurers, etc.) and that all this ugly mechanisation is for literally nothing.
My plea to greens is that they reconsider all this – and join up with the budding resistance to this madness – to fight for the preservation of our landscape. Let’s use the legal system to choke these vandalising bastards.
I was born and raised in northern Vermont in some of the most beautíful countryside you can imagine. Today, when I go back and visit, I get so depressed. The Green Mountains are now getting transformed into the Machine Mountains. Mountain tops are being cleared of forests, flattened, and scarred by service roads.

Vermont’s beauty in many of its most treasured rural areas is now gone forever -at least in my case. I will never again see these areas in their original natural beauty- not in my lifetime. Worse – far more of this is on the way. Local residents and their rights have no chance against the might of the industry. They are being steamrolled.
It’s heart-breaking enough to go back to my childhood farm my father owned and to find that it’s been parceled up and homes have been built on it. But it is far more depressing to see that all around the mountain ridges we once marveled have since been industrialised.
Is this what we really want? Is this how we protect the atmosphere and conserve its behaviour? We are living in a nightmare.
http://www.globalenvironmental.com/news/sheffield-wind-project-nearly-complete-123.php
This is only the very beginning – multiply all of this by 100, or even 1000. To fulfil the dreams of the wind energy industry and the financiers behind the carbon credit scheme, MANY MANY MORE are going to be put up. EVERYWHERE.
Thankfully the resistance to this madness has already begun. And so I am pleading for open minded true greens, like myself,  to take a look at grassroots groups that are resisting this massive industrial encroachment into our countryside treasures. See here for example. http://current.com/1cvfm4c, and join up with them.
Sheffield Vermont – mountain land clearing and result Photo credits: http://www.globalenvironmental.com/ and http://www.vermontenvironmentallaw.com
Above are photos of the crimes they have committed against a hilltops not far from my childhood farm. The days of seeing this natural landscape are gone – forever. Some day wiser people are going to say, “My God! what kind of madness and dogmatism could have possibly driven this?” I am sure they will. But in the meantime the price is going to be really high and the scars will take a long time to heal.
I bought some property 5 years ago and here are some of the views in the area.
Free of windmills for now. (Photo P Gosselin)
Rural Vermont – here still free of industrialisation. But how much longer? (Photo: P Gosselin)
I wonder how long it’ll be before that gets industrially vandalised. Worse, this is Vermont, where already 95% of its electricity comes from either hydro or Vermont Yankee nuclear power – i.e. practically carbon-free! So all the wind parks are just monuments of stupidity.
There is one exception in Vermont – in rich Chittenden county, where all the fat-cats live , many of whom are devout “environmentalists”. So much so that no windmills will be installed on the mountain ridges that they view from their mansions on Spear Street in Burlington. Here’s a view from Charlotte. As long as the fat cat environmentalists are living there, don’t expect to see windmills in their backyards. They belong elsewhere.

There are thousands of websites and photos that document the ravaging of the earth’s natural rural beauty. Remember, this is just the beginning of what these bastards intend to do. Again – “caused by arrogance, by dogma, by ignorance” (Jacob Bronowski).
So I strongly urge you all to seek out rural preservationist groups who are fighting to preserve rural beauty and to join their cause. There are other ways of producing energy that are far less destructive.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE 19 July: Steve Goddard has followed this post with a supplement, and provides more detailed information. http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/07/18/sea-ice-news-14/
WUWT following up on my posts a day or two later seems to be becoming a trend over there.
The NOAA is taking the liberty of declaring 2010 the hottest ever, even though it’s only July! So what’s all the hurry? Well, you have to get them scary global-hotting headlines out while you can, and any way you can. When you’re desperate – you’re desperate.
They’ve seen their own forecasts for the rest of the year, and so they know it’s their last chance. Just check the leading climatic indicators on my homepage and you’ll see why.
Now on Arctic sea ice, allow me to use the same NOAA “scientific” method and declare that the Arctic has experienced the slowest July ice melt ever! (Well, at least  so far).
Look at the ice melts from June 30 – July 15 for the following years, taken from AMSR-E.
                 Sea ice melt                
Year      6/30 to 7/15                Daily rate
2002     1.126 million sq km     75,000 sq km / day
2003     1.014                                  67,000
2004     1.019                                  68,000
2005     1.152                                  77,000
2006     1.210                                  80,000
2007     1.742                               116,000
2008     1.216                                   81,000
2009     1.413                                   94,000
2010    0.807                                54,000
Never has ice melted so slowly in mid summer as it has this year. Indeed sea ice melt in July 2010 is less than half the melt rate in 2007. It’s far below anything we’ve seen on record. Would the NOAA already call it a record low melt for the month?
And as Lubos Motl pointed out 3 days ago here, total global sea ice is above normal. Also see here. Indeed sea ice is rebounding, and surprisingly just at a time when  it’s supposively the “hottest ever”.  Someone is wrong, obviously.
Do you think anyone in the media is going to run this story?

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports here on Russia’s extreme heat that’s has contributed to higher death rates and wildfires, plunging Moscow into a thick, choking smog. Hat-tip to reader DirkH.
The following NASA photo shows where it’s hot, and where it’s cool.
So far 7600 km² have burned. NASA’s Terra satellite shows that the fires began in later July, when temperatures in the areas were 12°C and more above normal. One sees how the heat is concentrated in one spot, while the remainder of the continental area is near normal or even cool. Russian meteorologists say they are unable to find anything in the archives that compares to this, not in the last 1000 years.
While warmists are quick to pin the blame on climate change,  others point out that the fires have other primary causes. Der Spiegel writes that much of the blame for the catastrophe goes to the authorities and mismanagement of forests:

Forest fire experts say the authorities also get most of the blame for the catastrophe. Large fires like this one in Russia are caused primarily by man.

According to Johann Goldammer of the Max-Planck Institute for Chemistry at the University of Freiburg:

 There is no evidence that the fires ignited by themselves because of the drought.

Goldammer says that excessive deforestation of the landscape may be a factor in the fires because they leave barren steppe-like landscapes that tend to dry out quickly and become a tinderbox.
But then Goldammer’s makes the dubious claim that this was caused by the fact that the forests had been put into private hands, and then recommends Soviet-style land use!

It has something to do with sustainable land use, like land-use in the old Soviet Union, where it was much more efficient than today.

Now that’s the way to solve problems. I suggest Goldammer read up on how the Soviets managed to run the entire country into the ground.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to innovations-report.de, a new paper on Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet melt will be published in the Geophysical Research Letters later this month. Its title: Acceleration of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets to sea level rise.
It’s authors: E. Rignot and I. Velicogna both of the University of California, Irvine, California; M. R. van den Broeke of the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, Utrecht University; A. Monaghan of the National Center for Atmospheric Research; and J. Lenaerts of the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, Utrecht University claim the trend is “accelerating rapidly”.
According to innovations report (emphasis added):
The authors conclude that if current ice sheet melting rates continue for the next four decades, their cumulative loss could raise sea level by 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) by 2050. When this is added to the predicted sea level contribution of 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) from glacial ice caps and 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) from ocean thermal expansion, total sea level rise could reach 32 centimeters (12.6 inches).
Rignot’s used two decades (1992-2009) of monthly satellite measurements and advanced regional atmospheric climate model data to examine trends in acceleration of ice loss.
The paper’s abstract states:

Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 ± 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 ± 1 Gt/yr2 for Greenland and 14.5 ± 2 Gt/yr2 for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 ± 2 Gt/yr2. This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 ± 6 Gt/yr2). If this trend continues, ice sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century.
Jason/Topex however don’t show an acceleration in sea level rise over the last decade or so. If anything, one sees a deceleration. One has to wonder if ice sheet melt is still accelerating. It may have in the 1990s, but there’s plenty of data that say it isn’t so today.
One also has to question sea level rise due to thermal expansion. Ocean heat content does not seem to be rising. As far as measuring sea level rise, it is an extremely complex affair that is fraught with vast uncertainty. I’d also be very suspicious of anyone claiming they can measure sea levels to the millimetre. It’s hard enough to do it in inches. That’s why sea level projections among experts range so widely. Of course, that allows a lot of flexibility when drawing conclusions.


There are a number of studies out there that show no sea level acceleration. So one has to wonder where all those gigatons of melted ice sheet are going, and how much of it is being compensated by ice accumulation in other areas.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the early harsh winter in Europe and North America, the floods in Australia, snowstorms in USA, bitter cold in China, alarmists never have problems finding creative, acrobatic ways of assigning blame on the most remote of factors (think Tucson and Palin).
According to the warmists, these recent weather events can all be traced back to the sins of man and conservatives.
Alfons Kaiser of Germany’s online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) puts it all in perspective here, keeping a clear and cool head about it – unlike the rest of the catastrophist media in Germany – and attributes it mainly to the current strong La Nina which is now gripping the Pacific.
The FAZ writes about media reporting on the flood in Australia and other catastrophes:
To keep the interest of the distant audience awake, they are made bigger than what they are. Now it is being constantly claimed that in Australia an area as big as Germany and France combined is flooded – this is grossly exaggerated.
The FAZ then describes how this is attributed to the El Nino oscillations that occur every few years in the Pacific region, and how now a La Nina is running rampant and having an impact.
The temperature in the Pacific is sinking, warm moist air is moving over eastern Australia and the people – who up to now were basking in a semi-arid climate – have suddenly gotten 20 inches of rain within 4 weeks.
Naturally, some researchers are blaming climate change for enhancing this age-old weather-phenomena, a claim that the FAZ slaps down.
But even if this is the strongest La Nina phase since 1917, it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with climate change because there was a La Nina that was just as strong back in 1917. Not even complex meteorological models can determine how the CO2-induced temperature increase can enhance the anomaly in the Pacific Ocean. For this reason we should not just immediately doubt the connection, but we also cannot fabricate a causal effect where one doesn’t have to be.

Still, NoTricksZone reader Ike has found a short blurb at the online Suedeutsche Zeitung (South German News) publication called jetzt.de, which found the clip: ‘hilarious’.
The blurb was written by someone who goes by the name okkasionalsozialist and is titled:
What’s in Store For Enviro-Skeptics: ‘No Pressure’
Keep in mind that the Sueddeutsche Zeitung is a leading center-left national daily in Germany. But judging by what it feels is fit to print, I’d say it’s slipping back toward the bottom of the gutter.
Here’s what okkasionalsozialist of the Sueddeutche Zeitung jetzt.de says about the 10:10 clip:
10:10 is a funny British campaign that motivates individuals and organizations of every type to reduce their CO2 emissions. To make their educational intent more clear, they had Richard Curtis produce a hilarious little film, which in my opinion is really a bit expressive though.
Allegedly too many viewers misunderstood the clip, and so it was taken down, at least officially, by 1010.
So there you have it. Appalled viewers are simply not sophisticated enough to understand what the exploding kids who chose to dissent really means.

Wrong.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy bitter, I mean much colder than normal. This is a summary of what the experts are saying and what the data are showing.
We just got a strong El Nino behind us and now a La Nina is forming in the Pacific and is barreling ahead in full development, see the chart below. It’s got the potential to be a big one, meaning global temperatures will go into a nosedive in the months ahead.
Joe Bastardi thinks temperatures will reach levels we saw back when Pinatubo blew its top, and maybe lower.
The next chart shows the NWS/NCEP forecast for the fall and winter. Strangely, the German weather services here are predicting a 60% chance the coming winter in Germany will be warmer than normal – which doesn’t agree with what NWS service is forecasting. Europe is projected to be about normal. Note: As Joe Bastardi’s latest video shows, regional forecasts coming out of NOAA are sometimes very very wrong!

Take a look at the Arctic in the right side panels above, i.e. December to April. We’re talking deep freeze. That’s quite a difference from the constant red bloodbath we’re used to seeing from GISS and NOAA. The months ahead are going to be really tough for those trying to avoid the Al Gore effect.

Average global temps to a great extent will depend on the depth of the La Nina. Look at the following graph and compare this La Nina with the last one back in 2007-08. What do you see? Where were we at this time in 07? Looks to me right around zero. This time around we’re already 1°C below that. Also look at the overall slope in this year’s plummet.
This La Nina will seriously depress global temps in the months ahead, thus throwing ice water on the NCDC’s fantasy of the hottest year ever. It’ll be interesting watching them try to pull it off. They need it for Cancun.
The poles are also indicating lower temperatures. No death spiral in the Arctic. Zed’s dead, baby. The DMI chart already shows freezing at 80°+N latitude. But it has ticked up a bit. No matter it was the coldest melt season in that area on record – in the “hottest year ever”. Go figure!
The Arctic will not set a new record low sea ice minimum this year, as many were hoping, panting and drooling for. It isn’t even going to set the second lowest.  A third lowest is still in the works, though the odds are tightening. Total sea ice of the north and south poles is smack normal – and again, this in the “hottest year” on record.
Okay, a winter’s forecast is not climate – many will crow. Yes, but weren’t we told that such winters were a thing of the past? To the contrary, more and more we’re hearing they may very well be a thing of the future.
Folks, all these nice graphs are available at my Climatic Indicators side bar on my homepage. Take a look and you be the judge.

Tom Moriarty at Climate Sanity has done a thorough analysis of Stefan Rahmstorf ‘s and Martin Vermeer’s PNAS 2009 paper Global Sea Level Linked To Temperature, hereinafter RV2009, which claimed sea levels would rise 1.8 m by 2100 due to rising temperature.
Turns out they used awfully “brutal mathematical contortions” and bad assunptions to reach this figure.
Moriarty finds the paper is riddled with gross errors and false assumptions, read overview here.
New studies have since come out that would allow Rahmstorf & Vermeer to make corrections, but they are perfectly content in letting the press run crazy with their wildly exaggerated 1.8 meter figure.
Keep in mind that practically all sea level experts have called the 1.8 meter fígure hugely exaggerated, some even calling it preposterous. Even the alarmist IPCC 2007 3rd Assessment Report projects a sea level rise of 18 – 57 cm by 2100.
Most skeptic scientists project it will be in the neighbourhood of 20 cm – similar to last century. So how did Rahmstorf and Vermeer arrive at such an inflated figure? Tom Moriarty explains.
Fudging groundwater depletion and reservoir water 
First, Rahmstorf and Vermeer completely neglected the sea level rise correction that is due to groundwater depletion, which is man pumping water from the ground and adding it to the oceans, read here. Moriarty writes:
About 25% of the yearly sea level rise comes from pumping water from the ground and adding it to the oceans, not from melting ice. … “Mistaking this groundwater as ice-melt-water in calculations designed to ferret out the effects of global temperature on sea level greatly prejudices the calculations toward higher sea levels in the future.”
RV2009 improperly, but gladly, applied corrections by Chao to account for man-made reservoirs of water that would otherwise be added to ocean volume, thus boosting computed future sea level rises. But at the same time, they conveniently neglected groundwater depletion because that correction would have led to subtracting from sea level rise caused by rising temperature.
When asked why this was done, Rahmstorf and Vermeer said there were no adequate datasets on groundwater depletion available. Now a recent Geophysical Research Letters paper (﻿Wada, Y., L. Pet al (2010), Global depletion of groundwater resources, confirms that “Vermeer and Rahmstorf were low-balling the effect of groundwater depletion”.
Moriarty, citing Geophysical Research Letters:
It seems preposterous not to include a correction for groundwater depletion when its effect is ‘the same order of magnitude as the contribution from glaciers and ice caps’.”
That means that RV2009 overstated the effect of temperature on sea level rise by a factor of two.
RV2009 also used outdated sea level rise data

Next, Rahmstorf and Vermeer used old, outdated sea level data from Church and White to model sea level rise for the future. At about the time RV2009 was published, Church and White came out with revised data showing that sea levels were rising more slowly instead, read here.
The new 2009 version of Church’s and White’s sea level data extended out to the year 2007.  More importantly, it also had corrections that drastically changed the sea level versus time for the previous 100 years.
What do these new sea level, groundwater deletion and reservoir numbers mean?
When these new numbers are inserted into Vermeer’s and Rahmstorf’s model equation, and 21st century IPCC temperature scenarios are applied, the resulting sea level predictions are half of what Vermeer and Rahmstorf claim. 
Testing the RV2009 formula.
Moriarty also reverse tested the RV2009 formula by applying it to the best sea level data available, from the Topex and Jason-1 satellites, read here. Note how the RV2009 formula-calculated sea level shows an accelerating rise rate, in contradiction to the actual satellite data showing a decreasing rate. VR2009 is off in the wrong direction.

And when Moriarty back-calculated the temperature increase by plugging in the sea level rise data into the formula, the result is a preposterous temperature increase, proving their formlua is junk.
Moriarty concludes:
Let’s face it, Vermeer’s and Rahmstorf’s sea-level rise predictions come from the forced confession of innocent data.  Every effort is made, no stone unturned, in a quest to wring out as much sea level rise as the most gullible audience will believe. 
 RV2009 refuse to correct their projections.
Rahmstorf and Vermeer have yet to correct their calculations, and are content to see the media continue using their wildly exaggerated projection. And let’s not forget that the NAS allowed such a faulty piece of work to be published, likely because it suits the prevailing dogma there.
Moriarty attempted to bring this to the authors’ attention, but without success. He even left a post at RealClimate, where Rahmstorf is a contributor. Not surprisingly, real science has a way of being deleted at RealClimate, read here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo much for settled science! With every new climate study, the science just gets more and more unsettled.
Germany’s Max Planck Institute’s latest press release is about a new paper titled:
Tracking the Evapotranspiration Cycle
Reduced evaporation from the earth’s surface despite warming of the atmosphere
to appear in Nature Journal, click here, and is titled in English: Recent decline in the global land evapotranspiration trend due to limited moisture supply
Nature, 10. October 2010; doi:10.1038/nature09396
The Max Planck Institute press release starts as follows:
The earth’s climate system is complex and is not fully understood. Up to now scientists believed that global warming would speed up evaporation and the evapotranspiration cycle. But now scientists of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemisty in Jena, Germany have run into a huge surprise: using 250 measuring stations distributed over the earth’s surface and satellite data, scientists have determined that the worldwide trend of increased evaporation of the earth’s land surface has weakened immensely, or has even reversed between 1998 and 2008. And this despite that the earth’s atmosphere having warmed up during this time period. One possible explanation is that the scientists found that the ground, especially in southern Africa, Australia and South America, dried up increasingly, and so less moisture could evaporate. Why the land’s surface in the southern hemisphere became drier and whether this trend will continue is still unclear (Online-Version Nature, 10. October 2010).
The scientists of the Fluxnet Initiative have estimated how much moisture rises into the atmosphere. Between 1982 and 2008, 65,000 cubic kilometers of water evaporated globally each year, That’s a water amount equal to the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest lake. According to Markus Reichstein, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemisty in Jena and coordinator of the study:
For the first time our data shows how evaporation has changed during this time period.
First the amount of water evaporating from the global land area rose steadily by 120 cubic kilometers until 1997. But then the trend weakened significantly thereafter. According to Martin Jung, who evaluated the data at Max Planck Institute in Jena:



<!--

That the temperature increased slightly while the rate of increased evaporation weakened was very surprising. After all, warmer air is known to have the capability to absorb more moisture.
Climate scientists thought up to now that a warmer earth would evaporate more water. However, this appears to be limited regionally. Especially in Australia, East Africa and South America the exact opposite occurred between 1998 and 2008. There, much less water evaporated. This decrease was not able to offset the increase occurring in China and India.
The scientists believe that ground in the southern continents has become more dried out, and thus does not evaporate as much water. Jung warns explicitly against concluding that this is a clear sign of climate change: most probably it has to do with a natural fluctuation that cannot yet be explained.
Dr Reichstein says that the trend must be observed for a longer period and that ENSO cycles may play a role.
According to Nature Journal:
Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science.
The scientists are concerned that drier land in the southern hemisphere could lead to reduced photosynthesis, and thus more CO2 in the atmosphere, and thus more warming. But there is still a lot of scientific that needs to be done to understand what is going on.
Future measuremnts will tell us more, says Reichstein.
——————————————————————————————————
Conclusion: Obviously the models used up to now for predicting future climate have had no semblance to what is actually going on out in the field. They’re not even close. The scientists of the prestigious Max Planck Institute are very surprised by the findings. So much is still unknown about how the climate works.

Start thinking cold, cold, cold and colder.
Joe Bastardi, AccuWeather meteorologist, meaning he’s an expert in making forecasts, and not producing goofy climate model scenarios for the next 100 years, has been looking at the oceanic and solar cycles for quite some time.
Those cycles mentioned above, combined with volcanoes, are what he calls the “triple whammy”. He again reiterates his forecast for the decades ahead at his European website.
I surmise, though, given what should be becoming obvious to watchers of these things, that the days of thinking warm, warm, warm are over, and quite the opposite will occur in the coming years and decades, and the populace should understand the honeymoon is over, the marriage of low solar and reversing oceanic cycles along with a third-party (let’s not go any further with non-weather implications… ha, ha), the volcanic activity, should raise eyebrows among the rational. Among others, short of being frozen out of ones abode, there is no getting attention.
Here’s what he’s pretty much talking about
1. Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The cycles of warm and cold in the Pacific move in 30-year phases. In the warm phase, we see more El Ninos, which boost the earth’s temperature, see Figure 1. Recently we have flipped back to the cold phase, which means more La Ninas ahead, which means a cooler planet.
PDO

2. Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation has major impacts globally. Right now we are in the middle of the warm phase, but are now on the way down for the next 10 to 20 years, see Figure 2. Strangely the phases are interrupted at about their midpoints. Perhaps we’ve hit one of these midpoint interruptions.

Figure 2: AMO will be likely in decline from its current warm phase over the next 10 to 20 years.
Both the PDO and AMO show why the globe most likely has warmed about 0.5°C over the last 40 years. Now they give us strong indications of what lies ahead for the next 2 or 3 decades.
Another tiny factor that plays a role in our climate is the sun, believe it or not. Low solar activity has shown to be strongly correlated with cold periods on this planet. Currently, contrary to what was earlier expected by NASA, cycle 24 is turning out to be one of surprisingly low activity. That bodes ill for more cooling.
Figure 3: Solar Cycle 24 is a tame one. The question is: how tame can it get?
Throw in one or two significant volcanic eruptions, and the planet is in cooling trouble. Maybe even major trouble. Clearly, many governments are preparing for the wrong scenarios, as this report here so clearly illustrates.
In fact there is a risk that the whole world could be as unprepared as the UK was for this winter, and that for decades. And they won’t be able to say they weren’t warned!

I got an e-mail message from Theodore Hadzi-Antich, attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation, about the new set of proposed EPA greenhouse gas regulations for governing heavy and medium duty vehicles, such as trucks, tractor-trailers, RVs, etc., the so-called HDVR regulations.
Here’s a YouTube video sent by Ted which illustrates what all this means.

This is serious because trucking represents the backbone of transport and logistics of America’s freight and interstate commerce. Interfering and meddling with nation’s flow of goods is a good way to slow down commerce and to cause much higher prices for the consumers at the end of the supply line.
But this is exactly what the activists want. The activist bureaucrats at the EPA, far away in Washington D.C., think that American consumers and small-to-medium size businesses are spoiled and need to wean themselves off prosperity so that the absurd notion of  saving the climate can be achieved.
Ted Hadzi-Antich writes:
If implemented, these regulations could wreak havoc on the United States economy, and Pacific Legal Foundation is taking immediate steps to block the regulations.
In the video he tells us:
And these regulations, if they go into effect, could have the potentially devastating impact on interstate commerce as we know it today.”
These proposed EPA regulations are going to really hurt small businessmen like Skip Brown, and threaten to run them out of business for good. The big winners will be the big corporations who have the capital, connections and lobbyists in D.C.
Government is supposed to be helping people like Skip Brown, and not be ruining them. This is not about job creation – it’s about killing jobs and businesses. You can visit and contact the PLF: http://www.pacificlegal.org/

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Süddeutsche Zeitung has a report by Peter Lemke, who directs Climate Sciences at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, and was a lead author of the now infamous 2007 IPCC report. He presents his views of the Cancun Agreement.
In the agreement, countries made pledges to limit global temperature rise to 2°C (no word if they are pledging to limit solar radiation, ocean dynamics and the Earth’s orbit as well – just to remind readers of the folly of the entire endeavour).
So what does Lemke think of the Cancun result?
What’s missing are concrete resolutions on cutting back emissions so that these targets can be reached.
The EU has already declared reducing its CO2 emissions by 20 to 30% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. However, these commitments are not binding, and they are hardly sufficient. What is really necessary is that all industrial countries cut their GHG emissions 25 to 40 percent by 2020, and 80 to 95 percent by 2050. So it’s disappointing.
Yes, it is disappointing when people have doubts about why it’s necessary to inflict ritual self-flagellation.
Lemke then provides an overview of the history of CO2 greenhouse physics, mentioning Fourier in the early 19th century, Tyndall, and then Arrhenius. Lemke adds:
Today, using modern climate models, we expect a temperature increase of about 3°C [for a doubling of CO2].

This of course requires FAITH in climate models. Everyone knows they neglect cloud feedbacks, and can’t predict what oceans and the sun will do, and lots of other things, and so are thus just tools of modern-day charlatans.
Yet, Lemke would like to have us think that the models are infallible, and so we ought to commence with the self-flagellation rituals as soon as possible. Here Lemke cites the Holy Bible of AGW, the 2007 IPCC report.
The IPCC report of 2007 asserts that the warming of the earth is beyond doubt and that man is responsible for most of the warming over the last 50 years.
2010 will be one of the warmest years ever recorded. Sea level is rising 3.4 mm per year.”
We just had an El Nino year, and so temperatures have been warm. But that the sea level is now rising 3.4 mm/year is false. I think Lemke is still stuck on the 2007 IPCC report. He then goes on about 1 meter sea level rises and 4°C temperature increases. Remember that all these projections are based on the crystal ball models. Yesterday I wrote about how meteorologists are forecasting the opposite. Lemke adds:
Yet another calculation shows that relative to today’s standards, unusually hot summers like the one in 2003 will be normal by the year 2040, and by 2070 these hot summers will be considered as cool.
I think we’ve heard enough quackery for one day. This of course is all unscientific and is purveyed for the sole purpose of spreading fear and getting  people to start torturing themselves. In Germany, we read such rubbish almost daily in the media. Lemke puts in one last word of support for the climate crystal balls:
And even if the climate models are not perfect, they are still one of the best tools for forecasting; at least they are more reliable than any tax revenue estimate or projection of economic development. For this reason they should serve as the basis for all planning.
Everybody start whipping yourself – because the models say so. Too bad the models couldn’t predict these cold winters just 2 years ago.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote about a Russian-German temperature reconstruction from 1600 to 2000 derived from tree rings from the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia . The paper appeared in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, Vol. 41, No. 4, 2009, pp. 460–468, by Kononov, Friedrich and Boettger. 
In response, German media outlets all hollered “RAPIDLY RISING ARCTIC TEMPERATURES!”, focussing solely on one statement that temperatures have been rising since 1990. 
It’s a classic example of how a scientific study comes up with Result A, but the public ends up understanding Result Z, all thanks to sloppy and incompetent communication that exists between the two. 
The press release here  provides the following Kola temperature reconstruction graph for summertime temperatures:
Kola Peninsula tree-ring temperature reconstruction. Source: Stephan Boehme/UFZ 
Here it’s plain to see that the temperature reconstruction shows that Arctic temperatures in the Kola Peninsula have been rising since about 1670. This corresponds exceptionally well with Loehle’s 2007 reconstruction using 18 non-tree-ring proxies for the last 2000 years shown as follows: 
 
Both graphics show the Little Ice Age from 1650 to 1750, at which point a warming event ensues. Then it was generally flat from 1750 to about 1920, and then followed by another rise that took place until 1950. Then Kola tree-ring proxies show a cooling up to 1990. Since 1990 warming has occurred again, but it’s  a warming that is completely within the natural range of variation. 
The Kola reconstruction (1) agreed with an earlier reconstruction (2) done in the area, see map below.  What’s more, the Kola reconstruction (1) was compared with tree-ring reconstructions from other Arctic regions: Swedish Lapland (3), Yamal (4), and Taimyr (5).
Proxy locations used for Kola comparison. Source: Journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, Vol. 41, No. 4, 2009, pp. 460–468
The result of the comparison:

The reconstructed summer temperatures of the last four centuries from Lapland and the Kola and Taimyr Peninsulas are similar in that all three data series display a temperature peak in the middle of the twentieth century, followed by a cooling of one or two degrees. 
Only the Yamal reconstruction differed completely, resembling the shape of a hockey stick with the blade beginning at 1900. The hockey stick is becoming an artefact of activism.
Except for the Yamal reconstruction, all tree-ring and non-tree ring reconstructions appear to agree, and so indicate no correlation between temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration.
So what could be driving temperatures then? The authors compared the tree-ring based reconstructions with historical records of sunspots (Lean et al, 1995; Lean, 2000), and say: 
We found that over the whole investigated period fluctuations of summer air temperature reconstructed for the Khibiny Mountains in the central part of the Kola Peninsula have a good consistency (r >0.50) with changes of solar radiation (Fig. 10), especially for the low-frequency signal. 
In the paper’s conclusion we read: 
The broad similarity between this temperature construction and solar radiation indicates that solar activity is an important driver of centennial to multi-decadal trends in summer temperatures of the Kola Peninsula. 
So why did all media reports holler “RAPID TEMPERATURE INCREASE IN THE ARCTIC”. Call it complete communication incompetence by the media players between science and the public.
The Kola reconstructions show no link to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It all started with a solid scientific paper, and but then was distorted (purposely?) by a vague press release that culminated in alarmist media headlines. 
Let’s call that press release incompetence-gate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenie Walter Russell Mead has an interesting perspective on Cancun called Bureaucrats Swindle Greens In Cancun. Remember how Cancun was cheered as a success? In his view, Cancun was a complete disaster for the eco-zealots – “a rout”.
Maybe some hard truths are beginning to dawn on the author, like the greens have been led around by the nose for years, or that bureaucracies are lethally inefficient, and once created, are really hard to kill. Let’s not even talk about if they are capable of solving problems (They aren’t – they create disasters). People like Mead are naive if they believe otherwise.
Here are some of his more profound comments:
As green negotiators in Cancun ended their embarrassing two-week junket (videos of partying bureaucrats did not go down well with voters in a northern hemisphere freezing in an early winter), it’s clear that the bureaucrats did what bureaucrats do: they kept a ‘process’ (job-creating bureaucratic gravy train) alive while doing little or nothing about the problem they were supposed to solve.
I just love it when things dawn on people, that moment when they see the light. I thought this world government / bureaucracy and all that was just small-minded conspiracy theory stuff from feeble minded sceptics. It’s not a conspiracy, is it? No. It’s what governments do if there are no checks and balances – when democracy gets pushed to the sidelines. Stuff like Cancun just grow naturally.
Mead is disgusted by Cancun, and the way they pretend to be rescuing the world, when actually they are doing nothing but feasting and freeloading. Well Walter, worse is that they are doing all this to rescue us from a pretend-problem, and ignoring today’s not-pretend problems.
Look around you. Don’t you see the millions children that are dying of hunger today? They aren’t pretending! It’s not a computer model. It’s real.
But no matter: for the bureaucrats and NGO staff it’s a clear and resounding win.  The mice have unanimously voted to keep meeting at taxpayers’ expense until someone bells that pesky cat.  The UN process has kept just enough diplomatic credibility to make several new rounds of vast, unfocused global gabfests of bureaucrats and NGO administrators inevitable.  More pre-meeting meetings will be held; more secretariats will employ new staff; more non-papers will be circulated, marked up and revised.  Paychecks will be mailed; travel vouchers issued.  Life will be good.
And the children continue starving – by the millions, and today! Thanks to the invented distraction called anthropogenic global warming. We’ve forgotten about them.
Mead seems to have woken up to what the charade of the UN (and their mission to rescue the climate) is all about. They aren’t rescuing anything, are they?
How about waking up to the fact that AGW is a charade – the fictitious raison d’etre of a bloated UN bureaucracy.

Next to the bureaucrats and the White House, the real winners are the climate change skeptics.  If you think that climate change is a myth or a naturally occurring phenomenon, Cancun helped you out.
We’re hardly on the same side here. But if Cancun somehow serves to curb the bureaucracy and the kills the myth that bureaucracies can regulate the world’s temperature and weather, then we’ll take the win.
Bureaucrats will dance, journalists will spin and carbon will spew, and the greens will be unable to escape this dysfunctional UN process for years and maybe decades to come.
Mead, did you ever believe that a bureaucracy could regulate nature and climate?  Don’t worry, you’re far from being alone on that.
Mead is clearly frustrated and angry with the UN.
If you are a climate skeptic, a global warming hand-off to the UN is the best thing since the Hummer.
No sane green would want this result, but the greens have run up against a force stronger than climate change, more insidious than the desertification of the Sahel, more inexorable than the rising of the seas: the bureaucratic instinct for process.  Processes and institutions once initiated cannot be allowed to die.
All that is left is for Mead is to wake up and realise the fact that man made climate change is simply an invention of the bureacracy. If you want to kill the bureaucracy, then kill its raison d’etre – the junk science of AGW. Then we coul at least begin to focus on today’s problems.
Mead comments as follows concerning reporters and Cancun
…reporters know that at the level of substance this is a complete travesty and a rout”.
Enjoy reading the rest of Mead’s post on how all it was handled by the media. I can’t help but feel Schadenfreude.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn increased frequency in extreme weather events, a cooling North Atlantic, and growing Arctic sea ice were viewed as signs of climate change. The odds of a warmer climate in the future, according to one scientist, were “at best 1 in 10,000” (see below). That’s what Der Spiegel wrote in a 3700-word article back in 1974, warning the world of a coming ice age. 
Hat tip: oekowatch.org. 
In that issue Der Spiegel described a series of “weather extremes” occurring all over the world, claiming they were unmistakable signs of a climate change to cooling: deluges of rain in West Germany, severe thunderstorms that uprooted trees and blew off roofs in Berlin, the worst storm in 100 years devastating much of Lower Saxony, hurricane Agnes inflicting 3 billion dollars in damage, floods in Japan and Peru, temperatures in Argentina, India and South Africa dropping to their lowest levels in 300 years.
Back in 1974, in its introduction, Der Spiegel wrote:

Is a new ice age coming? Not right away, but the rainy summers in northern Europe, scientists fear, were only a part of the worldwide shift in weather — a preview of cooler and wetter times ahead.

It’s the same type of stuff we’re hearing today from the hysterical media. As Der Spiegel wrote, there were signs of climate change happening everywhere, and the world was seriously threatened. Scientists and experts were forecasting widespread global suffering and that billions could die. Today, thirty six years later, we see they were all wrong.
To provide an overview, look at the NAO 36 years ago (dark blue line is CET, orange/light blue is NAO). Back in 1974 one expert said the warming that followed had only a 1 in 10,000 chance of happening:

North Atlantic Oscillation index compared with CET winter record, 1860-2010 (CET graph source: http://climate4you.com/ ). Right now we really ought to be worried about cooling!
Today life is far better as a whole than what the doomsayers projected – thanks to technology, and to the warming that ensued – against the 10,000 to 1 odds. Strange how governments, media and activists want to return to those cold and miserable days that Der Spiegel complained about in 1974. Back then they were unanimous in saying warmer was better.
Der Spiegel wrote that the signs of cooling were detected in the North Atlantic:
At the latest since 1960, in the NorthAtlantic, meteorologists and climate scientists have believed that something is wrong with the vast system of the global weather: The earthly climate they believe is on the verge of changing over… First measurements showed a cooling of the North Atlantic. There the ocean temperature dropped over the last 20 years from 12°C on average to 11.5°C.
And the Arctic ice was growing at an alarming rate (ignoring man’s emissions of GHG, apparently):
Meanwhile the ice pack and glacier-covered area of the northern hemisphere grew by about 12%, at the Arctic Circle the coldest temperatures in 200 years were recorded.
In the 1974 report, Der Spiegel wrote about the warming period of 1890 – 1945. Recall how many of today’s scientists are claiming that the recent rise in temps over the last 50 years is “unprecedented”. Der Spiegel, however, documents that the same happened in the early part of the 20th century:
In the time between 1890 and 1945 scientists registered a general warming of the earth’s climate. The global annual average temperature rose during this time by about 0.7°C. — in polar regions the rise was even several degrees.
So much for unprecedented. Der Spiegel also wrote about the MWP of 800 years before (which some scientists today say never really existed).

Pessimism back then, like today, was the order of the day
Der Spiegel also wrote about the causes of climate change:
One thing climate scientists know for sure– already very small irritations, and for that reason often they are difficult to measure, can throw the global climate out of whack. A reduction of solar radiation of one percent or an increase in the world’s average cloudiness by just 4% is enough to trigger a new ‘big ice age’.
Der Spiegel then wrote that the consequences of this would be catastrophic, as agricultural output would decline, crops would be wiped out, etc.  US scientist Reid Bryson of the University of Wisconsin said:
If the current worsening of the climate continues, all of humanity will suffer — a billion people will starve.”
US weather researcher James McQuigg:
 The chances of a rash return to the optimum climate of the 1930s are at best  1 in 10,000″.
Der Spiegel wrote:
Some climate scientists even foresee the coming of a worldwide natural catastrophe. That’s what Austrian science author Peter Kaiser (‘The Return of the Glaciers’) believes. Canadian weather scientist Kenneth Hare advises governments of impacted countries to stockpile food.”
Überpessimist Paul Ehrlich warned of the consequences of global cooling:
Only a rapid aid program can prevent the catastrophe, fears Ehrlich. But the rich countries of the west, he complains, proved themselves to be failures during the crisis management of the 1973 oil crisis.
Back in the 1970s, it was common practice to seed clouds as a way of manipulating local climate. Scientists discussed methods that could be used to stop the cooling. But scientists warned of unintended consequences and complex feedback systems. US climatologists William W. Kellogg and Stephan H. Schneider described a climate model back then. Der Spiegel:
Such a climate model, so explain the two US climatologists William W. Kellogg and Stephan H. Schneider, must contain all ‘climatic feedback mechanisms’ of the global weather system — a completely unmanageable chaos of feedback loops and interactions.”
Amazing at how an unmanageable and complex system like climate in 1974 became and elegant and simple system that could be easily regulated today simply by varying the concentrations of a single trace gas. Later Schneider just could not be bothered by complexities.
Kellogg and Schneider also warned of interfering with the climate system.
Both scientists request that an international organisation for climate monitoring be set up as quickly as possible. In the view of the 2 experts, these weather monitors would have the job of maintaining the earth’s climate status quo.
It took a few years, but today we have the IPCC as a result.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMaggie Thauersköld Crusell of Scandinavia's No. 1 climate science blog: http://www.theclimatescam.se
My blogroll has a number of non-English, foreign, skeptic blogsites.
I’ve put them there because I feel it’s important that the rest of the world knows that skepticism is not just a thing one finds in North America, UK and Australia, but all over the world.
One site that caught my eye is Maggie Thauersköld Crusell’s theclimatescam.se/; it’s the WUWT of Scandinavia.
Why do I say that? It’s because even though Sweden has a population of only 9.35 million (compared to USA’s 300 million) and her posts being written in Swedish, she often gets 50 – 100 comments per post, and more, from her readers. By comparison Anthony Watts would have to get 2000 – 3000 comments per post to match her per capita-wise!
A few days ago I got the idea to write a post about the WUWT of Sweden, and so I wrote Maggie to ask her if she’d mind, and included a few questions. She happily went along.
Here’s Maggie on what’s going on with climate science and politics in Sweden, and also a  little bit about herself. Things are looking up in Scandinavia. Hope you enjoy this look at the climate situation in Sweden.

The Climate Scam Website
by Maggie Thauersköld Crusell
The Climate Scam is by far the largest blog about climate issues, not only in Sweden, but also in Scandinavia.

I began blogging at the end of 2007, as a reaction to the “streamlined” reporting on climate issues in traditional media. Soon, the number of visitors doubled, tripled and quadrupled. Obviously, there was a need for an open forum where all views were allowed. The Climate Scam has never been moderated and still isn’t. As long as people refrain from ad hominem-attacks, everyone is free to express their opinion.
Public opinion on global warming is definitely changing in Sweden. After Copenhagen, and the oddly cold winter 2009/10, people are more or less sick of hearing about climate and becoming increasingly skeptical. The phrases “climate change” and “global warming” are used much less today, and mostly by leftish fringe organizations.
There was an election to the parliament earlier this autumn and climate was hardly ever mentioned in the political debates.
What’s bothersome though is that there seems to be a great preference for wind power among Swedish politicians and many dream of wind replacing nuclear and hydropower, which today provide more than 90 percent of Sweden’s energy.
Many people within the environmental movement seem to wish for our society to go back to where it was in 1850s, or even before that, disregarding the fact that technological advances have done so much to improve the state of the world. The hard core of the environmental movement is highly misanthropic and consider humans a plague on earth. Progress is seen as detrimental, consumption as a threat to the environment and population increase as a fast lane to total destruction.
I feel we need to spread a more optimistic view of the future. Today, pessimism is the politically correct attitude and those who are optimists are considered naive and stupid. I am currently writing a book about this very issue.
I follow a lot of blogs, both skeptical ones and more politically correct. Among my favorites are WUWT, Climate Audit and Roy Spencer’s blog. I also subscribe to climate news from all around the world and I receive daily tips from my readers. I have participated in three of Heartland Institute’s climate conferences and would like to recommend them to everyone who wishes to meet some of the most prominent skeptical scientists in the world. I assume there will be a new conference arranged in spring 2011.
One last thing I’d like to add is: treat everyone with respect, no matter what their opinions are. Far too many skeptics and warmists turn to foul play, calling their opponents names and making the debate personal. I prefer to believe that we all want to do good, to preserve our planet and to further evolve humanity. And I try to stay open for views that differ from my own. We can all learn something from each other.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere are lots of stories flying about, some quite wild. Here’s what the IAEA Director says.

The situation at the Fukushima power plant is very serious. Damage to the cores of the three units, unit 1, units 2 & 3, have been confirmed. There has been no serious change since yesterday. The cores remain uncovered, one to two meters. We do not know the exact situation inside the reactor vessels. But the pressure inside remains at about atmospheric pressure. This suggests that they remain largely intact.”

Strangely, this story comes to my attention from a German site: www.donnerwetter.de. Today, February 5, is National Weathermen’s Day in the USA. Actually now it is called National Meteorologists Day.
It is also to honour physician John Jeffries, born 5 February 1744, who kept detailed weather records in Boston from 1774 until 1816.
It’s no secret that a vast majority of meteorologists, i.e. experts in forecasting, disagree with the kook claims made by alarmist “climate scientists”, i.e. physicists who were taken away from their taxi-driving careers, thanks to government job-creation programs.
Okay, I know I’m going to get into trouble with that generalization. I admit – not all climate scientists started out as taxi drivers after getting their Phds.
What meteorologists think of climate science

Here’s what meteorologists think of global warming, according to a 2009/2010 survey of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) that was limited to television weather forecasters who are also meteorologists. Read here www.heartland.org:
* Only one in four American Meteorological Society broadcast meteorologists agrees with the United Nations’ claims that humans are primarily responsible for recent global warming.
* Only 24 percent of the survey respondents agree with United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assertion, “Most of the warming since 1950 is very likely human-induced.”
* Only 19 percent agree with the claim, “Global climate models are reliable in their projection for a warming of the planet.”

* Only 19 percent agree with the assertion, “Global climate models are reliable in their projections for precipitation and drought.”
* The survey results support the claims of rank-and-file scientists who say global warming position statements by the bureaucratic branches of groups such as the American Meteorological Society (AMS) are out of touch with the scientific opinions of member scientists.
Who are are really the better forecasters? 
I’m sure there are readers out there who are going to bring up the academic qualifications argument, as well as claim meteorology and climatology are different…yak yak yak.
All you have to do is look at who has been successful in making forecasts. For example, compare the seasonal forecasts of the Met Office to that of private meteorological organisations – who are not no-risk government-pampered outfits producing results where quality doesn’t matter financially. In fact, the more off-the-wall your results are as a government institute, the more the funding!
If your models cannot even get a 3-month forecast right – don’t even open your mouths about 50 and 100-year forecasts. Even your five and ten-year “climate forecasts” of rare snowfalls and mild winters have been completely wrong. And claiming the appearance of Godzilla is due to AGW and setting your science up as non-falsifiable only make you appear all the more look like charlatans.
Thanks to meteorologists
So thanks to all the meteorologists out there who have made a major contribution in preventing climate science from descending into the realms of mass panic and complete madness. Without you, Al Gore and the rest of the climate kooks would have had us believe that CO2 is the only thing driving the earth’s climate and we would have long since been under enviro-martial law :).
We really ought to make February 5 a national holiday for that.

============================
Are European Winters Going To Stay Warm? By Matti Vooro
North America’s winters have been getting colder since 2006, and Europe had its two warmest winters ever in 2007 and 2008 as the AO, NAO and AMO were all positive. All this may be changing over the next several decades. Cooling was already evident after 2007 as both the winter AO and NAO went negative. 
Figure 1 shows the European winter temperature departures, land and sea, for years 1948 -2009.  The graph shows above normal temperature anomalies in the  period 1948-1964, followed by a cooler period 1962-1987 when the temperature anomalies were mostly below normal except when they were briefly interrupted by a warm period in the first half of the 1970’s due to a number of years with a warm or positive AO. This was then followed by a warm period 1987-2007. Winter temperatures started to decline after 2007.
Figure 1: Impact of winter AO and winter AMO on European winters 
Figure 2 shows again the European winter temperature departures (land and sea) together with the winter AO and winter AMO Indices. Europe‘s climate seems to be significantly affected by AO and AMO. The drop in winter temperature deviations as the winter AO went strongly negative is especially noticeable in the winters of 2009, 2010 and 2011. AMO is still positive or warm.
Figure 2: Correlation with winter AO, winter NAO and European winter temperature anomalies.
Figure 3 shows a correlation between winter NAO and winter AO and both are reflected in the European winter temperatures. One is a subset of the other. The negative phase of NAO implies high pressure anomaly over Iceland, low pressure anomaly over sub-tropical Atlantic, weakened mid-latitude easterlies, colder over Northern Europe, milder over Greenland, colder and snowier for eastern US. This was the dominant phase from the mid 1950s through late 1970s. The negative AO, NAO and AMO seem to be returning.
Figure 3
The annual and monthly AO data can be found here.
The figures below show how the variation in the number of negative or cool winter NAO’s affected the cool and warm periods in the past.
1920 – 1940: 9 negative or cool winter NAO years [WARM PERIOD]
1950 – 1970: 14 negative or cool winter NAO years [COLD PERIOD]
1980 – 2009: 8 negative or cool winter NAO years [WARM PERIOD]
Figure 4 supplied by the NOAA shows the change in the winter AO from basically being positive from 1989 to 2008 to now becoming strongly negative.

Last cool period for Europe
Figure 5 shows the European winter temperature [land and sea] and the winter AO index for the years 1962-1987, the last cool period in Europe. During this time  17 or 2/3 of the winters were below norm  and had an average mean temperature departure of -0.14°C (range of -1.28°C to +0.93°C).  During the  22 years after this period  , the average mean winter temperature was  + 0.63°C with a range of +1.54°C to -0.27° C. 
Figure 5
Recent historical European winter temperature departures from 1961-1990 base for the years 1998 -2009
Figure 6 shows the European winter temperature departure [land and sea] and the winter AO and AMO index   more recently for the years 1998 -2008. Notice that there has been no significant increase in temperature departures other than 2007-2008 and the temperature anomalies have actually started to decline as the AO stared to decline after 2007 and have done so for the last 3 years and possibly 4 years if 2011 is

 Figure 6

I have estimated the 2010 winter anomaly. It is bound to be negative as UK 2010 winter temperature dropped by 1.57 °C over 2009. Table of recent historical European winter temperature departures (land and sea) from 1961-1990 base for the years 1998 -2009
1998  1.23°C
1999  0.45
2000  0.63
2001  1.12
2002  0.67
2003 -0.06
2004  0.65
2005  0.60
2006  0.12
2007  1.54
2008  1.34
2009  0.52
2010  -1.0 (estimated, not available until May 2011)
2011  not available
The average mean winter temperature anomaly during this most recent period of 1998 to2009 was 0.73°C while during the previous cooler period it was – 0.14°C or almost a full degree cooler. La Nina winters have not been exceptionally cold for Europe.  Seven of the last La Nina winters have been above normal and the average anomaly for the last four was o.89°C well above the 0.73°C average above. The 2011 winter anomaly will be down because of the cold December 2010
Data source
All of the above European winter temperature departure data can be found at the following web page of European Environment Agency.
Final comments
I find no evidence in the field during the post 2007 period to support the IPCC prediction that “The warming in northern Europe is likely to be largest in winter…”.  The flat global temperatures for the last 10 years and the recent cooling since about 2006-2007 seem to be consistent with the cooling taking place now all over Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, as the natural planetary cycles enter their cool mode. Once the North Atlantic ocean SST and AMO start to contribute to the global cooling in a more significant way, the global temperatures of the western coast of Europe and the Arctic will be the cooling  more consistently. This cooler period could last 30 years as they have done nearly 20 times during the last 500 years.

UPDATE: Lubos Motl here.
What is it with these intolerant zealots who refuse to learn anything from history?
Right smack on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, German Parliamentarians, in a frontal assault, are now openly calling out and branding scientists for the crime of scientific dissent. These out-of-control parliamentarians are demanding that the German government take a position against dissenting views in climate science.
What a number of zealous German parliamentarians are calling for borders on a call to launch a science pogrom.
The climate dogmatists are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the scepticism, free speech, and dissent now spreading in Germany and Europe, and therefore want to stamp it out using the might of the federal government – and now.
The upcoming 3rd International Climate and Energy Conference, REGISTER HERE, has got them spooked as well.
Journalist Dirk Maxeiner here brings our attention to the latest development on the exploding intolerance that has gripped certain factions in Germany. Maxeiner publishes the text of a query written by the Green parliamentarians sent to the German government, read below.
As the text shows, branding of climate science dissenters has begun. Fred Singer and EIKE (European Institute For Climate and Energy) are the first to feel the sting of the denier-branding-iron. German greenshirts have sent the bloodhounds afterFred Singer because of his speech in a German parliamentary forum discussion on the economic impacts of climate protection held by the FDP Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner of Angela Merkel’s CDU/FDP coalition government. Read background here.
Some may think that I’m being over-dramatic here. I am not. The situation that the few, yet very vocal, sceptics face here is precarious. Just read the following query written by a faction of Parliamentarians to the German Government, translated of the German text presented at Dirk Maxeiner’s site (emphasis added, and note the use of the term “denier” throughout the text):
——————————————————————————————————–
Short Query [from the Green faction of Parliamentarians to the German Government]
from Parliamentarians Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Oliver Kriseher, Undine Kurth (Quedlinburg), Nicole Maisch, Dorothea Steiner and the Parliamentary party BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN (ALLIANCE 90 / THE GREENS)
Subject: Deniers of climate change in the coalition government
The so-called “climate change sceptics” or “climate change deniers” for years have been a permanent fixture in American politics. Their influence on American politics is not insignificant. They are mainly supported and funded by the fossil fuels industry like Exxon (Esso) or Koch Industries. Now it appears that their influence is now growing in Germany and in Europe. In the past weeks various press releases and other reports have appeared in the “Financial Times Deutschland” and news magazine “Der Spiegel” about on how certain climate change deniers were given a discussion forum by the CDU and FDP Bundestag’s factions and that some parliamentarians of the ruling CDU and FDP factions were sympathetic to the ideas put forth by climate denier Fred Singer. This and a range of other activities by the so-called climate sceptics in Germany compel us to ask the German Government for its assessment.
We ask the German Federal Government:
1. Is the German Government aware of a scientifically published paper that has been subjected to peer review that questions climate change caused by man, and that is supported by scientific data?
2. In the view of the German Government’s leadership, is there a scientific discussion on whether climate change is taking place and whether man has a decisive impact on climate?

3. Is the German Government aware of the publications from American physicist Fred Singer on the subject of climate protection? How does the German Government view the scientific reputation of Mr Singer in regards to climate protection?
4. For the German Government, do the arguments made by Fred Singer and other arguments presented have merit and are they “enlightening”? How do you assess the statements by Mr Singer that “Politicians that are embedded in climate change are more dangerous than climate change itself”?
5. Is the German Government aware of the ideas Mr Singer has previously promoted? What is your view on the fact that he, for example, questioned the hazards of passive smoke, or that he contested the fact the ozone layer was damaged by CFCs, or that he trivialized acid rain? With this background, how does the German Government judge the credibility of Fred Singer’s activities with regards to climate protection?
6. Is the German Government aware of who financed Mr Singer for his activities? Is the Federal Government aware of the funders who – like Exxon und Koch Industries in den USA – fund the activities of the climate change deniers in Germany?
7. Does the German Government share the opinion that events involving Mr Singer provide a forum for the pure interests of the fossil fuel industry, and thus enhance their unscientific work and non-serious activities?
8. Are there voices within the German Government who question the anthropogenic causes of climate change?
9. How does the German Government view the activities of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) with regards to climate change? EIKE is supported by Fred Singer. In the Federal Government’s view, does the Institute work on the scientific question regarding the subject of climate change?
10. Is the German Government aware of whether climate denier conferences are also being financed by public funds, for example by the Liberal Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation?
11. Fundamentally, does the German Government approve of the use of public funds for spreading the ideas of climate deniers like Fred Singer?
Berlin, 3 November 2010
Renate Künast, Jürgen Trittin and Fraction
————————————————————————————–
There it is folks. All this because some people are asking questions about the science. These Green radicals are scared crapless.  Their media hacks did everything possible to slander and destroy Fred Singer, EIKE, and other dissenting German scientists – but to no avail.
Now for the first time they’re going after the liberty-oriented Liberal Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation. They are de facto demanding a declaration of war on scientists and groups that have a different opinion. This level of intolerance has not been seen in Germany in over 65 years. This is their “Either-you’re-with-us-or-against us” declaration to Angela Merkel’s coalition government made up of the CDU Christian Democratic Union and FDP Free Democratic Party.
I hope this query backfires. It would be deserved.
Read here on what happens when someone dares to speak up in Germany.

Share this...FacebookTwitterApproximately 3000 delegates from 177 countries flew to China and negotiated 6 days long, trying to find common ground for a treaty in Cancun in December. The news from Tianjin, China  is out. The result?
FAILURE
Der Spiegel writes here:
No concessions were reached on the questions of climate protection, observers reported – despite 6 days of negotiations.
UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres says a general framework will have to be hammered out in Cancun, one that will lead to a treaty later in the future. Efforts to sign a treaty in Cancun will not be attempted.
Der Spiegel reports that the gridlock in the negotiations resulted from disputes between China and USA.
EU delegation leader Peter Wittoeck said:
It is disappointing that we were unable to make the progress we wanted.
Both the US and China blame each other for the failure. To the contrary, we ought to thank China and USA for the SUCCESS!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe drop in Arctic sea ice in the last years caused many to fret over a possible tipping point, after which melting would be unstoppable.
However, new findings from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology show this is highly unlikely. What follows is the Press Release in English:

Hope for the Arctic sea ice
Recent finding show that there is no no such a tipping point for the loss of Arctic summer ice. Instead the ice area responds relative to the climatic conditions at hand. The ongoing loss of Arctic sea ice could slow down or even stop when global warming slows down or stops. Steffen Tietsche, lead author in the study published this by Geophysical Research Letters [1], said he was at first quite surprised by the findings:
‘The possible existence of a tipping point first appears to be completely logical: When the ice cover retreats, the sea water absorbs more sunlight and so it warms up even more, and more ice melts. Such a feedback in priciple leads to an amplification of the Arctic sea ice melt and thus make it independent of the prevailing climate conditions.’
The scientists examined the validity of this concept with a climate model. In this model they completely removed the Arctic ice cover at the beginning of summer in order to maximise the absorption of sunlight by the open water.
‘Indeed we expected that the Ocean would remain ice free after the modelled ice melt because the open water takes up more warmth in the summer,’ said Tietsche. But unexpectedly, the ice sheet always recovered in the model simulation within three years so that the conditions that prevailed before the modelled ice melt were again re-established. These results indicate that the condition of the sea ice is closely connected to the prevailing climate conditions, thus making a tipping point improbable.
The scientists discovered the process that allows the recovery of ice: During the winter, the ocean loses most of the heat absorbed during the summer. Becauseof the missing ice that otherwise would serve as an insulator, heat loss becomes very efficient as the open ocean is in direct contact with the cold atmosphere. In addition the very thin ice grows very quickly because it is more poorly insulated than thick ice. The heat that is given from the ocean through the thin ice then leads to a stronger thermal radiation by the atmosphere into space and also to a reduced heat transport from the south into the Arctic.

The combination of these two stabilizing feedbacks is stronger than the destabilizing feedback from the additional absorption of sunlight by exposed water in the summer time. The study by the Max Planck scientists confirms research conducted by US scientists using a much simpler model [2].
This model agreement of two completely different levels of complexity usually means that the results are reliable,’ says Jochem Marotzke, Director at the Max-Planck-Institute and co-author of the new study.
[Now comes the MPI religious confirmation of AGW belief – necessary for further funding]
The scientists emphasize that their findings do not question the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice because of man-made climate change. ‘If we do not greatly slow down global warming, then the Arctic will be ice-free in the summertime in a few decades,’ says Tietsche. ‘Our research shows that the speed at which the sea ice is retreating is closely related to the rate of global warming. Our work does underscore, however, that we can still slow down and even stop the loss of Arctic sea ice.’ “
Summary:
Firstly, forget the scary tipping points. The laws of thermodynamics and heat transfer say it isn’t possible. The tipping point was the figment of alarmist scientists’ imaginations gone wild. That we pretty much knew already. Secondly, the temperatures in the Arctic govern the melting and freezing of the ice. If the globe cools naturally, then the ice will recover. And thirdly there’s no new data to show that CO2 is the cause of the recent Arctic melt. Remember, the last 30 years show the opposite in Antarctica.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Roy Spencer’s site has posted the UAH MSU temperature for January 2011 and, as we see, the warm temperatures are gone. A La Nina (cool equatorial Pacific water surface temperature) is raging and is linked to playing a role in the storms now hitting Australia and the US.
Let’s recall that just a few short years ago climate “scientists” were claiming that La Ninas were expected to become rare and that the Pacific would find itself more and more in an El Nino mode. Things are turning out differently though. Time to get back to the drawing board for the 7,000th time.
Source of graphics: Dr Roy Spencer’s site

And what’s with global warming causing more preciptiation? The data also suggests the opposite, at least oceanic.

Trend here is downwards for that too. Using the global warming theory, the warmth is supposed to cause more precipitation, and so this indicates the globe is cooling.
For the catastrophe junkies out there who need their daily dose of catastrophic signs, it looks like a cold turkey day today. Maybe the crack-catastrophe pushers GISS and PIK can help you.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDoubt over the science of climate change goes beyond USA, Great Britain and Australia, and is now spreading into mainland Europe, in particular Germany. So much so, that the German Greens are getting alarmed about the waning alarmism.
This is why the alarmists in Germany, led by the Green Party and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research, are now all trembly-handed about it and have organised a pow-wow in Berlin in March on how to counter the growing climate scepticism. The event is called:
The Interest In Doubt – The Strategies of the So-Called Climate Sceptics
Below is a translation of the announcement. As you read it, you will find it confrontational and militant. It’s the paranoid “us against them” mindset.
The climate alarmists simply cannot accept that the catastrophe is not coming. I wrote about why this frightens them: ALARMIST PSYCHOLOGY.
Here’s the event announcement in English
============================================================

What’s it about?
Climate scepticism is not a new phenomena in the debate surrounding anthropogenic climate change. To obstruct an ambitious climate protection program and to hinder energy transformation, the seeds of doubt concerning the findings of science has a long tradition, especially in the USA, where it has reached a new dimension. In addition to spreading lies and untruths, the defamation of politicians and covert operations also belong to the repertoire of climate policy obstructionists. Also in Germany the activities of climate sceptics and climate deniers are increasing. At first these activities were restricted to the Internet and blogs, but have since reached the German Parliament. Politicians of the CDU/CSU and FDP parties even publicly welcome known climate sceptics, and thus provided a forum for their non-serious and unscientific assertions.
In our focused discussion, we wish to cast light on the background the current activities of the climate sceptics. What is the motive behind the current climate-sceptic activites and media attention? What are the strategies of the so-called climate sceptics, who is behind them and who finances them?
We warmly invite you to attend.

I can tell you what this is going to be about: Koch Industries, Fred Singer, Big Oil, Tobacco, etc. the usual crap that appeals to people who crave disaster. Of course German sceptic group EIKE will be a target as well. Incidentally, EIKE has sent a letter to the Green Party, expressing their wishes to attend this conference.
Does anyone believe the tolerant and progressive Greens will welcome them?

Martin Durkin brings his latest swindle documentary: Britain’s Trillion Pound Horror Story. If you don’t remember Martin Durkin, he produced “The Great Global Warming Swindle”.
Personally I’d call it “The Trillion Pound Heist”. Sorry, but all these politicians who have irresponsibly run up the debt, not only in Britain, but elsewhere too, are a bunch of thieving bastards who ought to be locked up – if you’ll pardon my French.

They looted from the next generations, and even unborn generations.
It’s no wonder they now want to rob us blind with their phony climate scam. “It’s only question of time before socialists run out of other people’s money to spend”. I think Maggie Thatcher said that.
UPDATE: Let me add a little more to this. Go to the 34 minute mark of this Mark Levin audio and listen to it. Listen to how Mark is calm – until the caller at about the 35:40 mark says the politicians ought to be ashamed of themselves. Note the amazing speed – within a tenth of second – at which Mark Levin reacts and is set off .
No, they should be in federal prison!”
Mark Levin’s reaction here is spot on. Bunch of crooks.

I recently read a news clipping from the Canadian Press headlined: Never mind that cold snap-fed stats suggest Canadian winters are getting warmer. According to the article, the figures were compiled by Environment Canada and released to the Canadian Press on January 25, 2011.
I checked the Environment Canada data and have come to a different conclusion from their climate data record. I have produced two graphs of past winters from 1998-2010 showing the annual winter temperature departure for 11 of the Canadian regions and Canada as a whole. All temperature data comes from Environment Canada.
Here are the 11 climate zones in Canada:

This is what the graph shows.
Canadian temperatures 1998 - 2011
Here is what the graph tells me in my opinion:
* For Canada as a whole, the average linear winter trend is negative (cooling), see graph above.
* The linear winter trend of 8 of the 11 regional areas was also cooling, see graph below.
* The linear trend of the Atlantic coast is flat.
* Only the linear trend for the Arctic tundra and fiords (far Arctic North) shows warming.
Next is a chart showing the plots for all 11 regions of Canada and their winter temperature departures from 1998 -2010. The Canadian average is also included together with the linear trend for all of Canada.
 
Discussion
What my objection to the Canadian Press article and its headline was that it implies to the Canadian public that Canadian winters are getting milder when they have not for the last 13 years. That is significant.You can’t ignore that if you are going to write an article about changes in Canadian winters. The article compared winter data sets between 1970’s and today. I however compared 1998 and 2010/2011 which is much more current and up to date.  
The 1970s were at the bottom of the climate cycle when both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as measured by AMO and PDO were in the cool mode. Now we are near the top of the current warm cycle and starting to come down fast. So naturally any comparison will show a warming. But it does not mean that the warming will continue. It is like comparing winter datasets to summer datasets and saying we are warming – forgetting that after the summer comes another fall and winter. The PDO and AMO are again heading for the cool phase like the 1970’s.
When costal waters around North America cool, the inland areas will cool first and to a greater degree. This is exactly what is happening in North America and Europe and Asia.
The SST anomalies for US coastal waters [20N-50N] dropped more than 0.65 deg C by January 2011. The January 2011 reading for the U.S. Coast Waters is the lowest on record for the satellite-based Reynolds Oi.v2 SST dataset [as to Bob Tisdale’s recent post on WUWT].
So I think what was missing in the article was the fact that, yes, it is interesting that our Canadian winters have warmed between 1970’s and today but what it did not say is that we should not to expect this to continue, since the climate factors that caused the cooler climate back in the 1970′ are back again and have already caused the cooling to return during the last decade. More cooling can be expected during the next 20-30 years. Even the AGW climate scientists have admitted to the media that there has been no statistical global warming since 1995.
The winter of 2009 perhaps is indicative of what might be ahead for some of the future Canadian winters. It already had winter temperatures close to those of the 1970’s for many regions . Most regions (7 in total) had below normal winter temperature departures except (4) Atlantic coast, Mackenzie District and Arctic Tundra, Mountains and Fjords. The 2009 winter had both the AMO and PDO negative or cool, like what we may get again in the decades ahead.  The 2011 winter also mimiced similar conditions as the coastal waters around North America had cooled to record low levels [similar to a negative AMO and already a negative PDO]

The second wrong message in the article was that the warming between 1970 and 2010 was due to global warming when it has clearly been shown by climate scientists, including the Met Office, that natural planetary cycles ENSO (stronger El Nino’s) were behind the recent warm phase.
Not just Canada is cooling – but the United States too 
http://climvis.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/cag3/hr-display3.pl
– Winter temperatures have been dropping for 10 years since 2000.
– Annual temperatures have been dropping for 4 years.
– US winter temperatures have dropped 6°F between 2000 and 2010.
 Global snow extent
– 2011 winter had the 3rd highest snow extent in the Northern Hemisphere and North America since 1967.
– 2010 winter had the 2nd most snow extent for Northern Hemisphere since the1978/1979 winter [2008 had the 3rd highest since 1967].
– 2010 winter had the highest winter snow extent since 1967 and the extent has been climbing since 2006.
– 5 of the11 highest snow extents for Eurasia have happened since 2003[2003 was the2nd highest since 1967]. 
Let’s do some fact checking about our current GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE ANOMALY
http://climate.rutgers.edu/snowcover/table_area.php?ui_set=1
Other regions of the globe
– The cold weather in US has reached the Mexican/US border with significant lost crops this year.
– Record snow or new cold temperatures set in December 2010 across various parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
– Sweden had coldest December in 110 years and 2010 was the coldest in two decades. Norway had its coldest year since 1941 and 10th coldest since 1941.
– UK had its coldest December since in 120 years. Germany had its coldest December in 41 years, Ireland had its coldest December since 1881 or in129 years
– Similar cold records were set in the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Mexico, China, and India.
– Following another extended stretch of sub-zero temperatures, ice coverage on the Baltic Sea is greater than it’s been in nearly a quarter century, Sweden’s meteorological agency reports.
– The Russian are having one of hardest winter in the last 100 years during the 2011 winter. The average temperature for February in Moscow was 11°C below normal!
Conclusion
So how can we say that Canadian winter temperatures are getting milder when the data shows that Canadian winter temperatures as a whole are getting cooler for 8 of the 11 regions since 1998? Only the high Arctic shows warming.  The more logical conclusion would be the winter temperatures were fluctuating but the trend is cooling. For some regions like the Prairies and Northwestern forest areas, there was 6.6 to 7.1 C  of cooling between 2006 and 2009. Once the 2011 winter gets added to the data, the cooling aspect will be even more evident.
Here are the winter temperature departures for all 11 regions of Canada. As you will note, the linear trend line for all are negative or cooling with the exception of the Atlantic coast which is flat or no real change and Arctic Mountains , Fiords  and Tundra  which show warming or rising trend line.
ANNEX
Trends for different Canadian climate zones:
BC Pacific coast and South BC Mountains winter temperature
MacKenzie district, north BC Mountains, and Yukon winter temperature
Arctic tundra, Arctic mountains, and fjords winter temperature
Atlantic coast, Great Lakes, St Lawrence and NE forest winter temperature
Praries and Northwestern Forest winter temperature

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace has become a bad spirit for the Inuit
Award-winning Daniel Hannan, a conservative MEP of East England, has written a critical piece of Greenpeace called: Greenland to Greenpeace: your hunger for publicity is putting our lives at risk.
h/t: R. de Haan
Readers may have noticed I’ve been focused on Greenpeace over the last week or so. The once peaceful organisation, which used to be concerned with real environmental issues, has long since turned into a militant, intolerant, greedy and increasingly violent group that is bent on forcing others to submit to their will. So I’m pleased when people like Hannan bring it up.
According to Hannan at the Telegraph:
The prime minister of Greenland – a socialist, no less – has attacked Greenpeace for sabotaging an Arctic exploration rig.

When even the socialists get mad at Greenpeace, then it’s a sure sign how radical the organisation has gotten. Greenland’s socialist PM, Kuupik Kleist, is fuming about Greenpeace’s recent criminal sabotage.
The cabinet regards Greenpeace’s action as very serious and an illegal attack on the country’s constitutional rights. It is worrying that Greenpeace, in their hunt for media exposure, violate security rules made to protect human lives and the environment.
I wrote a post about this as well.
Fantasising and drooling over the next Holocaust? 
It seems so. Greenpeace has no resemblance of the organisation it used to be. Even Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore thinks the environmentalists have lost their marbles.

Moore says:
They depict human beings as a malignancy, a cancer on the face of the earth. There’s way too many of us. Guys like Paul Watson and a whole bunch of his ilk are coming out and saying there should only be 1 billion people, and not 6 billion people. 
And: 
I fought for nature all through my years at Greenpeace, and I’m proud of what we did back then. But I do not understand how people can write off the whole human race. 
They’ve gone from green to red, and are now headed for brown.

Stop smoking - save the planet!
Don’t be surprised if someday soon cigarette manufacturers are required to modify their warning labels.
At the online Handelsblatt (Germany’s version of the Financial Times), Michael Kuhndt of the Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production gGmbH replies to a reader’s inquiry on how smoking impacts climate change. Read here.
This is all part of a campaign by the Handelsblatt in cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Environment.  
Yes – smoking is not only bad for your health, but also helps to kill the climate. According the World Health Organisation, about 1.1 billion people worldwide smoke, and this number is expected to triple over the next 25 years.
All that smoke and tobacco farming will surely have an impact on the climate. Smoking alone spews 2.6 million tons of CO2 and 5.2 million tons of methane into the atmosphere every year, says Kuhndt.


But that’s not the worst part, tobbacco farming and disposing of waste has impacts on the environment too. The widespread monoculture inherent in growing tobacco extracts six times more potassium from the soil than growing other plants does.
But now comes the big hammer: 150 kg of wood are needed for drying one kilogram of tobacco, which converts to 1.2 million hectares of forest. About 600 million trees are chopped down annually to make room for tobacco plants. These trees could remove 22 million tons of the climate-killing gas yearly.
Not only that, all those cigarette filters end up on the ground and contaminate the groundwater with nicotine, dioxin, formaldehyde and cadmium, so claims Kuhndt.
Great, now we can blame the next NYC snowstorm on smokers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEd Caryl brings us his latest essay. We are aware that Antarctic sea ice has trended up over the last 30 years or so. Ed takes a look at some temperature plots from stations in Antarctica and compares them to the Southern Oscillation Index and wind. Forget the back seat! – CO2 is only riding the rear bumper of the climate science bus.
A Wind In Antarctica
By Ed Caryl

The Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) crowd claims that warming caused by CO2 will appear first in the Arctic and Antarctic. We showed that there is little to no warming at locations in the Arctic that are sufficiently isolated from Urban Warming. In Antarctica this should not be a problem because research stations are mostly small, and many have been of constant size since they were established. Yet, we have this example to cast doubt on that idea.
Figure 1
(Note: All temperatures in the following charts are plotted in Excel from GISS raw temperature data.)
In Figure 1, McMurdo and Scott Base are only 5 kilometers apart, and Marble Point is just 87 kilometers away from both. Temperatures at all three track one another except that McMurdo and Scott Base are warming at just under a degree over the 50 years seen here, and Marble Point is flat over the 30-year record we have. Why the large temperature difference between McMurdo and Scott Base? Unknown. If any reader has been there, and can answer the question, leave a comment.
The answer may be as simple as that the population of McMurdo is over 1000 people every winter, and Scott Base population is 10 over-winters, and those figures have been roughly the same since the beginning of both bases. Marble Point is an automated station, one of the few in Antarctica that authorities have managed to keep operating with any consistency. Usually the wind blows the automated stations away, or the snow buries them. Automated station = no people = no warming.
If we shorten the records to the last 30 years, we get a slightly different result (Figure 2).
Figure 2
McMurdo has been warming just slightly since 1980, Marble Point is flat, and Scott Base has been cooling nearly as much as it had warmed in the previous 25 years. Conclusion? McMurdo base has an urban warming problem.
Are there other patterns in warming and cooling in Antarctica? 
There certainly are. Here are two charts, both covering the last 30 years, Figures 3 & 4. The cooler stations near the bottom of the first chart are closer to the South Pole.
Figure 3
Figure 4
Notice that the temperatures on the Continental chart and the Peninsula chart go in opposite directions. In any year when the stations around the rim of the Antarctic continent are cooling, the stations on the Antarctic Peninsula tend to be warming and vice-versa. Especially obvious is 1989. Why should this be?
There is a similar pattern in the Antarctic Oscillation Index. The AOI is the difference in mean sea level pressure between 40°S and 65°S latitudes. The same pattern is seen in the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode Index or SAM. This index is similar to the AOI, but it is the pressure difference between 40°S and 70°S. In the plot below, Figure 5, the SAM index is in phase with the Antarctic Peninsula average temperature, and is inverted compared to the Antarctic Continental average. The Continental average has been inverted in this plot.
Figure 5
The Southern Oscillation is also somewhat related to winds and temperatures in Antarctica. The Southern Oscillation is an index calculated from the difference in barometric pressure between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. It is also referred to as the El Niño Southern Oscillation or ENSO.

The SOI is also in phase with the temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula, and inverted compared to the Antarctic Continental station temperatures. This isn’t totally consistent, but remember that these charts are of yearly averages, so some detail is lost.
Figure 6
Figure 6 is also an average of the Antarctic Continental and Antarctic Peninsula station temperatures, the Continental plot is inverted, and all compared to the SOI. 1988-89 was a strong La Niña year. 1995 also had a La Niña, as did the period from 1998 to 2000.
Figure 7
Figure 7 source: http://faculty.washington.edu/kessler/ENSO/soi-1950-98.gif
Is the Antarctic warming? 
So, we still have not answered the question: Is the Antarctic warming? The problem with the answer is that most of the stations in Antarctica, including the peninsula, were only established in the mid-1950’s, during the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year. This means that most of the temperature records don’t span the longest ocean cycles, like the AMO.
Only Base Orcadas, Figure 9, on Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands goes back to the early 20th century, to 1903. It clearly shows the AMO signal of cooling in the 1920’s and 30’s, warming to the late 1950’s, cooling to the 70’s, and warming to the present.
Figure 8
The total warming of Base Orcadas in the last 100 years is about 1 degree C looking at the 6 year moving average. Three other stations are cooling: Halley, Mawson and Neumayer; all are on the Antarctic continent. Only two have records going back to 1957 or earlier, Halley and Mawson. Halley is the only one with significant cooling over the last 50 years (Figure 9).
Figure 9
 So, why is the Antarctic Peninsula warming? The answer seems to lie in increases in the circumpolar winds in that region. These cause increased adiabatic (down-slope) winds as the circumpolar winds blow over the spine of the peninsula. These adiabatic winds heat the air as they compress it flowing to sea level. The resulting heating can be seen in this NASA image, Figure 10.
Figure 10
Figure 10 source: http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/Antarctic_temps_AVH1982-2004%20source%20NASA.jpg
The reason for the heating is paradoxical. The Antarctic Continent is cooling, especially at the South Pole. The continent is mostly a high plateau, subject to continuous high pressure. This leads to winds that flow downhill, the adiabatic winds. The earth’s rotation (coriolis force) bends these winds into the Polar Easterlies. As these flow over the Antarctic Peninsula, the west side of the peninsula is heated.
Figure 11 is the annual average pressure at Vostok Station on the plateau and the wind speed at Syowa Station on the coast. The atmospheric pressure is slowly increasing at Vostok over the period measured and the wind speed is also increasing on the coast. (These locations were picked because they had the most continuous records.)
Figure 11
Will the pressure and wind increase, and the Antarctic Continental cooling and Antarctic Peninsula heating continue? The recent trend in Antarctic sea ice and the current succession of La Niñas suggests not, see Figure 12.
Figure 12
Source: http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/enso/
In the above plot, Figure 12, La Niñas are positive and cooling, and El Niños are negative and warming as in the first SOI plot above (Figure 7). Remember that the ENSO is a pressure difference index. During a La Niña, winds are blowing the warm surface waters away, and during an El Niño, the winds calm, allowing the surface waters to warm. It is rather surprising that these are commonly thought of as equatorial events, but have affects at the South Pole.
What do these indicators say about AGW? It casts doubt. It says that to see the truth, we need to look at more factors over a longer time span, and over wider distances than we have in the past. As in the Arctic, we need a few more years of careful measurements.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot a day goes by without hearing about the “catastrophic BP Gulf oil spill”. Even the media in Europe are fretting hysterically about ocean currents eventually carrying the mess across the Atlantic and over to Europe’s shores – so say all their computer models. There’s now even a lot of discussion about setting up a world environmental court for prosecuting polluters for Crimes Against Nature and Crimes Against Humanity.When I was a kid and milk spilled, we were told not to cry about it, but instead to get up, get a mop, and to clean it up. How are media responding with the latest spill? Many are having fainting spells, some are even leaping out the windows, and the rest just want to beat the crap out of the poor kid who spilled the milk, who by the way gets up early every morning to milk the cow and brings it to the table.
Surely the oil spill was a mess and steps have to be taken to prevent these things in the future. But it’s also important to keep it all in perspective. Globally, once everything settles down, this is not going to be felt at all. It’s reported that 800 million liters have gushed into the Gulf. That sounds like a huge number. Indeed it’s like everyone in the United States dumping 3 quarts.
Pull your head up and look at the big picture. First of all, it has been reported, much to the surprise of the media, that 75% has already been either dispersed or cleaned up. That means 200 million liters are still at large. Of these 200 million liters, what doesn’t end up on shores for manual cleanup, will eventually get carried out to sea.
But for now, let’s stay with the 200 million liters floating out to Europe and beyond. How much is that with respect to the oceans’ sheer volume?
* 200 million liters = 200,000 cubic meters,
* 200,000 cubic meters = 0.0002 cubic kilometers of oil.
* Volume of world oceans: 1.37 BILLION cubic kilometers.
* Concentration of BP oil in ocean: 0.0002 km³/ 1,370,000,000 km³
This equals…folks my calculator doesn’t even get anywhere near that far out! It’s like one rat drowning in Lake Erie. It’s in the trillionths! The average lake has higher concentrations of greasy suntan lotion from swimmers.
Wildlife in the oceans are not even going to notice this, not at all! Fish have other far greater worries on their minds – like not becoming dinner for other fish.

So everybody really ought to just calm down about it. The whole thing has been overhyped a 1000 times.
The Gulf shores will get cleaned up and big mother earth will do the rest.
Source of ocean data: http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/SyedQadri.shtml
UPDATE: Claudia Bradshaw of the BBC blogs plans a radio show about it this evening. http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/worldhaveyoursay/2010/08/is_the_bp_gulf_oil_leak_the_mo.html#241138
I’d like to point out that the media focusses too much on the environmental disturbance of the oil spill and ignores the fact that a dozen people lost their lives in the accident. That’s the real tragedy.
And let’s not forget there have been far worse disasters.  167 people lost their lives on the Piper Alpha, making that in my view far worse than anything else in the oil industry to my knowledge. We ought to keep things in perspective.  The environment will rebound – lost lives don’t. How does someone’s business taking a temporary hit compare to loss of life? You coastal residents – you live in America, and so you’ll all get through it just fine. I know it’s tough, but count your blessings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m alerted by Tom Nelson’s blog of a ZDF German television clip featuring Hans von Storch and Ottmar Edenhofer.  Edenhofer is a researcher at the Potsdamer Institute for Climate Impact Research, which is headed by Prof Doom & Gloom Hans Joachim Schellnhuber and his underling Stefan Rahmstorf. Need I say more?
ZDF clip here (in German)
The ZDF starts out by introducing the 100+ page IAC report, which was critical of how the IPCC worked and how fundamental reforms are required, and also on how other scientific views have to be included. Hans von Storch’s first comment:
Time and again there have been cases where the complete range of scientific knowledge was not included. The task of the IPCC is not to declare the truth about climate change, but the truth about the knowledge on climate change.
Ottmar Edenhofer on the other hand, sees the situation as far less serious, and attempts to play down the IAC’s findings.

I simply do not agree with the claim that the IPCC knowingly kept out knowledge that it found inconvenient, that didn’t fit the overall narrative. For that, also the team of authors was simply too heterogeneous in the past.

Already the first comment out of Edenhofer’s mouth provoked a harsh reaction from Richard Tol here:
The first remark by Edenhofer is a lie. Edenhofer was a lead author in AR4 WG3. That chapter does not reflect the literature. Papers that were at odds with the IPCC authors’ viewpoints were omitted or cited incorrectly.
Here’s the background on why Tol accused Edenhofer of lying. Edenhofer selected gray literature over peer-reviewed literature.Edenhofer does admit that the Himalayan glaciers blunder was embarrassing and regrettable,  and that the use of gray literature has to be restricted to a minimum. Hans von Storch adds (paraphrasing):
I would ban all literature that comes from interest groups like environmental organisations, re-insurers and energy companies.
On The IPCC getting involved with political advocacy, Edenhofer agreed that it has happened in the past, and that it should not occur. He recommends that a code of conduct ought to be followed.
That’s an understatement. How about just bringing in new personnel?
The IPCC has at least taken the first step in an attempt to reform, says the ZDF clip. It has invited von Storch to be a lead author for the next IPCC report.
Hans von Storch is a luke-warmer to warmist scientist, but we can expect him to be, as his website claims, an “honest broker”.

The German online TAZ here reports on Spain’s solar energy industry debacle in an article with the headline:

Botched Spanish Solar Roofs

Yet another example of the havoc governments can cause by excessively interfering in the free market (with the best intentions of course).
The boom was great – while it lasted. Solar panels flew onto the roofs of buildings faster than you could make them, and companies couldn’t keep up with the demand.
The very leftist TAZ writes that in 2008, 2600 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity were installed in 9 months alone. Why so much? Because buyers wanted to take advantage of the generous feed-in subsidies paid to solar panel operators, guaranteed for 25 years, before they expired. Unfortunately, quality and reliability took a back seat in the mad rush for gold. Today, everywhere there are signs of shoddy quality and poor function with the installed solar systems.
The boom turns into a fiasco
And now two years later, the warranty period for the installation work has expired and panel owners are no longer under guarantee. TAZ writes:
50,000 installation with a total rated output of 3500 megawatts are now up and running in Spain. 80% of the systems were installed in 2008. There was a gold rush feeling. Everybody wanted to lock into the feed-in tariffs guaranteed for 25 years. In addition to the known brand-names, some used new brands of solar panels – most of them from China – the opportunity was seized in an overheated market. Installation companies bought whatever they could get their hands on.

All the haste was propelled by generous government subsidies, and everybody wanted to get on the gravy train. Now, just 2 years later, many installations are showing up to be defective, shoddy, and running far below the expected efficiency rates. TAZ writes:
The synthetic resin coating in which the cells are embedded is now turning yellow, electrical contacts are oxidizing, various layers are peeling apart and blistering. In addition “hot-spots” are appearing, which in extreme cases leads to a total breakdown of the entire module. Also the overall design of the system is showing to be considerably shoddy.”
30,000 jobs lost in the last 2 years
And because the exorbitant feed-in subsidies were abruptly canceled, many solar installation companies have since gone bust and have disappeared. TAZ writes that industry associations and unions calculate 30,000 jobs in the photovoltaic sector have disappeared since 2008. Meanwhile the Spanish government has turned a blind eye, claiming there are no reliable figures out there to base conclusions on.
30% is expected to be scrapped in the next three years
TAZ writes that solar panel recycling companies are now poised to take on the big business of recycling all the installed scrap. According to some estimates, 30% of the panels are expected to be scrapped in the next three years alone.
Not so, says a state research center, which insists the figure is too high and is closer to “5 to 10%, which is still a figure that is too high”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German scientists are now spreading fear among children at schools. Is this the indoctrination part of the “Masterplan”?
German science used to be, and is in many areas, still highly regarded worldwide. But in the area of climate science, it has been reduced to politics and masterplanning.
Sadly, Germany’s “leading climate scientists” are far more preoccupied with transforming society and spreading panic among the population then doing science. Spreading panic is a favourite practice of Stefan Rahmstorf who, like his director Hans Schellnhuber, is a “scientist” at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research (PIK).
Rahmstorf is featured in astory at the online Märkische Zeitung, written by Alexandra Amling, who writes how Rahmstorf recently gave a presentation to school students. The Märkische Zeitung writes:
Only when mankind switches over only to renewable energies will we be able to avert the consequences of climate change, Stefan Rahmstorf made clear on Thursday evening in a presentation to school students and interested individuals at the Goethe School.”
Maybe the Märkische newspaper (Ms Amling) confused it, but here it is claimed that using renewables will stop the consequences of climate change, but not climate change itself. I’m having trouble making sense of this. If we use only renewable energy, the climate will change anyway, but the consequences of that change will be averted? Abracadabra.
The Märkische Zeitung then added, quoting Rahmstorf:
‘If extraterrestial life existed and little green men observed us, then they would see a dramatic disappearance of ice in the Arctic and would wonder, shaking their heads, if the earth is so little worth to us,’ said the oceanographer with admonishing tones.”

More contempt for humans – all consistent with the Schellnhuber’s “masterplan” mentality, which views humans as too stupid to run the planet democratically, and so authoritarian means are warranted.
According to Märkische Zeitung, Rahmstorf drives no car and has equipped his house with solar technology, and so we should all do the same. Beacuse if we don’t, we might drown – at least that’s what Rahmstorf’s last slide of his presentation, a doctored photo, implies:
At the end he showed a photo that will certainly remain in our minds: A wall of a house with the writing: ‘I don’t believe in global warning’. However the second line is hardly legible because it is drowning in floodwater.”
Here Rahmstorf is saying that anyone who doesn’t believe his horror scenarios is a fool. Yet ironically, when one looks at the data, Rahmstorf is exposed.
In the event that Ms Amling is interested in facts, then she should consider the following:
FACT: Sea level rise is decelerating.
FACT: Global temperature has not risen at all in the last 10 years.
FACT: Tropical storm activity has been falling since the 1980s.
FACT: A huge number of scientists completely disagree with Rahmstorf.
FACT: Rahmstorf’s sea level projection is an extreme outlier, way out of the mainstream.
We’d be more than happy to point Ms Amling to the data behind these facts, and other facts. I would even appear in front of these children with my own presentation in order to undo the educational damage that has been inflicted by Rahmstorf.
After looking at the data, Ms Ameling might consider Rahmstorf as simply not a serious person who is irresponsibly inserting fear into vulnerable young minds and doing a disservice to his country.

Here’s an ongoing weather event, which is supposed to be rare.
We know it’s been cold as heck in South America. In fact it’s been so cold that fish have been dying on a mass scale. This today is being reported by the German online Stern and other outlets.
Authorities say that 6 million fish have died as a result of the cold. Also read here.  This report writes:
Authorities in the eastern Bolivian province of Santa Cruz declared an alert following the death of fish in the Grande, Pirai and Ichilo rivers that run through the tropical region.
This is an “environmental catastrophe” brought on by the lowest temperatures registered in Santa Cruz in nearly half a century, Gov. Ruben Costas told reporters.
We’ve seen reports on how the cold in South America has been deadly for humans too, see here. Later reports mention 500 dead.
And it’s still cold. And it’s going to remain cold as well, see here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote about Hans Schellnhuber, Climate Advisor to Angela Merkel, and his yet-to-be unveiled  “Masterplan” written by him and his all knowing master elitists on the German Advisory Council on Global Change.
Looking a little deeper we find a strategy paper written last April, in the wake of the Copenhagen collapse, by Schellnhuber and his elitist members titled: Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success. The paper is a strategy Schellnhuber’s “Great Transformation” of society back on track. But before a society can be radically changed, it first has to be taken over. That’s what the strategy paper focuses on.
The paper clearly shows what these characters want – the strategy is summed up in the paper’s conclusion on page 12:
With the international alliances outlined here, European create the political capital and scope for action that it needs to take on a leading role in global climate policy.”
When reading such text, you have to know that it is filled with euphemisms. For example the term climate policy really means “reign”, e.g. global climate policy really means “global reign”. Schellnhuber’s strategy is to look for allies to isolate the USA and other free countries to assert Green reign. The conclusion discloses this aim:
The aim of the new European climate diplomacy would be to generate a critical mass of climate oriented partners so that a course can be set towards a climate-friendly world economy.
Here climate friendly economy is a euphemism for an economy that is so radically dictated that it can no longer emit CO2. It is a planned economy by elitists. It has nothing to do with democracy – it’s all about authoritarianism.
Clearly these master planners are on the Green path to domination. And they are not content with running just their own continent.  Like real control-freaks, they want the whole planet. How much clearer does this have to get? They are not talking about the European economy – they are talking about the “world economy”.

The alliances mentioned above are needed to help…
…to bridge the gap between the basic normative consensus on the need for compliance with the 2°C guard rail and the inadequacy of those structures and procedures in international cooperation that should be playing a key role in achieving such compliance.”
The 2°C guradrail sounds like a noble objective. But it is not.  That too is just a euphemism for draconian authoritarian transformation measures. To stay within the phoney 2°C warming limit, Schellnhuber claims that it is necessary to cut CO2 emissions by 80% or more by 2050 – That means a brutal and experimental – away from free market economy to a centrally regulated economy.
“Masterplan” to be released on Thursday
As far as the “Masterplan” goes we will know more about that on Thursday. It will be officially presented to the eager government at 10 am.
============================================
Whenever you read text from these master Green elitists, use the following short glossary of euphemisms to know what they really mean:
2°C guardrail = authoritarian / draconian restrictions (90% carbon reduction by 2050)
climate policy = reign
climate-friendly = submissive-to-authority
compliance = submission
Great Transformation = destruction of free market capitalism
sustainability = oppression
sustainable – oppressed

Too bad the data does not cooperate.
Reader Juraj. V. has just assembled an interesting graphic that is a composite of all stations located in Greenland.
Temperature chart of Greenland by reader Juraj V. Composite of all Greenland stations
Although I suspect this is only a preliminary, unadjusted plot of all the raw data available in Greenland, it indicates that it was just as warm in the 1850s and 1930s as it is today. I myself added the blue trend lines. The last 10 years or so even show a downward trend. I guess the alarmists simply refuse to look and acknowledge this, and so choose to journey to the Arctic in late summer to get their melt photos.
Schellnhuber confirmed
Therefore it shouldn’t be any surprise when someone like Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says (2003): after examining temperature records of 95 stations distributed over the globe:

In the vast majority of stations we did not see indications for a global warming of the atmosphere.
and:
Most of the continental stations where we observed significant trends are large cities where probably the fast urban growth in the last century gave rise to temperature increases.
and:
The fact that we found it difficult to discern warming trends at many stations that are not located in rapidly developing urban areas may indicate that the actual increase in global temperature caused by anthropogenic perturbation is less pronounced than estimated in the last IPCC Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it – the globe is trending cooler. One El Nino year does not make a trend. All the talk about global warming and snow becoming rare in the wintertime is turning out to be utter nonsense.The AMO, PDO and solar cycles bode cold for the globe. Check very carefully before believing anything else – especially if you’re in the winter sports business.
The Met Office in England even said there’s been no significant warming in the last 15 years. The cold winters are back, and many find themselves caught unprepared.
Too many expected warming
Last winter municipalities were caught without roadsalt because they had gambled on warm winters, and skipped replenishing their winter stockpiles. But then the snow and ice came, and what little roadsalt they had ran out by midwinter. Drivers were left to fend for themselves.
Municipalities will also have to deal with the much higher than expected costs arising from streets being far more damaged by heavy frosts. The deep freezes of last winter wreaked havoc on asphalt surfaces, and many were not properly repaired. This year winter is back with a vengeance, and so the already poorly repaired streets will certainly suffer even more damage. Repair costs will skyrocket, and strain budgets.
Sled manufacturers are caught off guard
They cannot keep up with demand. Everything is sold out, reports Die Welt today here. The traditional manufacturers of sleds are working round the clock at full capacity. And many that had gone out of business over the years, have reappeared. Says Michael Ress, manager of the traditional sled maker Ress-Kuschen in the Lower Franken village of Schwebheim in Bavaria:
Last winter we produced 16,000 sleds from New Year’s to March. The year before it was 3800 for the entire season.

And now the 6-man company is producing 200 sleds a day:
We’ve tripled our production and are practically working round the clock.  We’ve got to make do with 4 hours of sleep.”
Die Welt writes that 30 years ago there were some 20 sled manufacturers in Germany, but as the winters became milder, and the snows rarer, most of the sled makers disappeared.
But now the AMO and PDO have switched to their negative phases, solar activity has petered out, the winters are returning and the sled makers are coming back as a result. KHW Geschwenda in the Thüringer Forest has hired dozens of workers.
Also Company Gloco, which had closed its doors in 2009, has re-emerged and is back in business. Die Welt writes:
Gloco wants to put 30,000 pieces on the slopes this year. He no longer picks up the phone. He just doesn’t have the time for additional orders.
Retailers are screaming for sleds, but only a few are being delivered. Until production catches up, kids will have to make do with plastic bags and the hard shells of old suitcases.
Personally I think the North American toboggan is hard to beat.

What jump outs at me is the number of blue areas that have suddenly popped up on the continents. Where did they all come from?
We keep hearing about the NOAA’s record hot first half of 2010. and seeing these maps covered with all them red dots all them, like this one here for June (sure looks hot, doesn’t it?):
Surely one can see the differences. In some cases they are very dramatic. Compare:
1. Mexico / western North America
2. Greenland
3. Central and Saharan Africa
4. Almost all of Asia
5. Australia
Can the planet really cool that quickly?
You know what I think? I think the NOAA is producing a bunch of crap.
Curiously, the references cited by NASA above all refer to “scorching heatwaves” and “hotspots”. No mention of the cool or cold spots that seem to have the upper hand on the continents.
UPDATE: For more detail and light on this subject, Steve Goddard at WUWT has written up a great analysis, see: http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/07/16/co2-optical-illusion/#comment-432509

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s what the reporter in the following clip seems to suggest. So it means the warmists will start claiming cold winters as proof of warming. A number of blogs are buzzing about the “coldest winter in a 1000 years” being reported here: RT Prime Time. Western Asia and Eastern Europe are expecting a cold winter, but let’s not go over the edge here. This is a nutty claim.
We are not even in a little ice age. Does anyone seriously believe the Baltic Sea, and possibly the River Thames will freeze over, for weeks this winter? Take this notion of a 1000-year winter, or even a 100-year winter, and stuff it. Aint gonna happen.
The TV reporter in the above clip quotes meteorologists: “It’s supposed to be a beast of a winter.” That’s a fair claim.
NOAA is projecting a cold winter for Russia, Siberia and possibly Europe too. The reporter talks about the cold hitting the western Russia-European region.
Joe Bastardi in his latest post, however, did not make any commitment, though he seems to be hinting that we ought to expect cold. I have to say I get the feeling he sees something unusual, and so he’s going to take his time to really make sure – maybe just my imagination is just running wild.
An unusually cold winter is not far-fetched. But a 1000-year winter? Get out of here! That’s TV bullcrap. Unless Joe Bastardi comes out later this fall and says so, I aint buying it.
What are the reasons for the projected vicious cold asks the  reporter in the studio? “Is it climate change?”

They don’t really know. They’re looking at global warming.

That along with other factors. Global warming – what nonsense. The following NOAA chart definitely supports Russian meteorologists’ claims that the winter will be harsh.

Share this...FacebookTwitter2500 years of tree rings.
This newest tree ring study completely refutes Mann’s bogus hockey stick. That question is now forever resolved. There were warm and cold periods – with plenty of extremes. But that’s nothing new for many of us.
Der Spiegel reports on a new study put out by Science where scientists gathered data from a large set of tree rings from the Alps and used them to reconstruct 2500 years of climate in fine detail. The scientists were able to reconstruct past climate with unprecedented precision and found some significant results.
The press here is acting like these results are new. But to skeptics, it only confirms what they’ve been saying all along.
It turns out that Hannibal indeed most likely did cross the Alps with elephants way back in the year 218 BC, at a time when Europe was in a warm optimum. The study shows that weather and climate events triggered human and cultural shifts and events like wars, famine, disease –  or prosperity and growth, depending on whether it was warm or cold.
Der Spiegel writes:
From 9000 pieces of wood from old post and beam homes and trees, scientists Ulf Büntgen of the Swiss WSL Environmental Research Institute and Jan Esper of the University of Mainz read off the climate story – a unique global historical archive was created.”
Der Spiegel presents the most important results, which I myself think are not a surprise. The bulk of the Der Spiegel piece focuses on the hunger and misery precipitated by the climatic cold periods throughout the 2500-year period. One really gets a sense of how temperatures in Europe by no means followed the hockey stick shape proposed by Mann, and went from cold to warm, and vice versa. Numerous other proxies show the same applies globally.
Disease, war, famine and societal collapse  in cool, raw times
Witches were burned for bad weather. (Photo source: http://www.suppressedhistories.net/)
2500 years ago Europe was gripped by a cold period and temperatures were 2°C below today’s levels. Wars raged and societies collapsed. In the 4th century AD, after the Roman Warm Period, the climate again went downhill. It got cold and dry in central and southern Europe. The Huns invaded, and the Roman Empire collapsed. The temperature continued to drop through the 6th, 7th and 8thcenturies – and with catastrophic consequences. Der Spiegel writes:
In the famine year of 784, one third of Europe’s population died. ‘It was a cool summer’, says Büntgen’s sober diagnosis, looking at the data. ‘With the worsening climate, not only did harvests in Europe go bad, but livestock also shriveled away’, reports historian Berninger.”

These cool times continued into the 10th century. Crops continued to fail, famine, unrest, war, disease and misery spread – all because of the cold climate.
Finally, by the 11th century, the climate turned the corner and warm times started up again (all naturally, without man-made CO2). Europe prospered again, cathedrals were built and society advanced until the 14th century.
In the early 14th century, climate-related hunger and famine began to spread again. From 1346 to 1352, half of Europe’s population was killed off by the Black Plague. As the temperature dropped, starvation and misery continued, all blamed on witches, who were burned. Sound familiar?
Europe had plunged into madness. The 30-year war raged across Germany from 1618 to 1648. At this point Europe was in the middle of the Little Ice Age. Der Spiegel writes:
In 1709 the weather in Europe rendered one of the worst natural catastrophes Europe: In the grisly cold of 1709, rivers in Portugal froze, palm trees were buried in snow. All over Europe rivers had frozen fish, livestock froze in the stables.”
Prosperity and the emergence of empires in warm periods
Heydays, the Roman Empire and the German Empire coincided with warm times. For example, by 300 BC, the climate again got warmer, and with rains. It got so warm in fact, that the Alps became passable. The Roman Empire emerged – all helped along by the climate. Harvests were bountiful, and England had vineyards and made wine.  The MWP was similarly warm, read above. There’s ample evidence showing that the Roman Period and the MWP were warmer than today.
Weather extremes were greater in the past than today
Büntgen and Esper’s ring studies also show that rainfall amounts in Central Europe fluctuated much more year-to-year in ancient times and in the Dark Ages than in recent times, and also weather extremes were greater. In the year 1135, very little rain fell and the Danube River almost dried up. Regensburg used the opportunity to build its landmrk Steinernen bridge. The historical records also show a number of great floods, storms and periods of drought during Europe’s history.
That was climate and it was all natural. It was not caused by witches and bad behaviour. This study clearly shows that warm times are good, cold times are bad, and that the past had more extremes than today. Not only is it more nails for the hockey stick’s coffin, but also nails for the AGW theory.

According to MSNBC News here:
Lee said he experienced an ‘‘awakening” when he watched former Vice President Al Gore’s environmental documentary ‘‘An Inconvenient Truth.”
Hey – it’s a planetary emergency, a climate crisis. We have only a few years, or months even. The tipping point is here. This summer’s extremes confirm it. So action has to be taken!
Nothing is more important than saving … the Lions, Tigers, Giraffes, Elephants, Froggies, Turtles, Apes, Raccoons, Beetles, Ants, Sharks, Bears, and, of course, the Squirrels. The humans? The planet does not need humans.
Idiot – he forgot the birds and the bees!  (Oops – I forgot. That’s got somethin to do with parasite human reproduction, and that’s probably why he left them out).
These kooks, Greenpeace included, ought to serve as a wake up call for this gone-amok movement. They would be a laughing stock were they not so dangerously out of control.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnke Richter of Der Spiegel has a piece on tourism at the epicentre of climate change catastrophe: the islands of Tuvalu. According to Der Spiegel, the small group of islands is milking the catastrophe scenario for all it’s worth. Call it Tuvalu-gate.
The tiny islands may disappear under the rising oceans in just the matter of a few decades, so it is claimed. Book now and travel to Tuvalu and see a sinking island for yourself! Catastrophe tourists are now jetting in to the Tuvalu island of Funafuti.

5000 people live on just a few square kilometers on the island of Fogafale, the inhabited island of the Funafuti atoll. The remaining 5000 Tuvalu inhabitants are spread out on the other atolls and islands, which are accessible only by boat.
A paradise it is not. Groups of tourists check into the only hotel on the island. Behind its courtyard one finds rotting garbage between the stones. It reeks of raw sewage. The lukewarm shallow lagoon is littered with broken bottles and cans. Eco-tourism seems as remote as it could get.
But don’t bother with that. Tuvalu is raking in the money with climate catastrophe. Tuvalu even has its own Climate Change Official who telephones and organises tours, interviews, studies or projects for climate journalists and tourists. Even though no one is in danger on the islands, the PR machine needs to tell a different story, describes Der Spiegel.
One main attraction for climate catastrophe tourists  is beach erosion. Uprooted palm trees, bleached by the sun, lay on the coral beach like corpses as tourists snap photos from every angle.
Another sight is the island of Tepuka Savilivili, which, writes Der Spiegel, is the Ground Zero of the south seas: a barren moonscape.  But don’t mention that three typhoons wiped out the island’s vegetation back in 1997. That’s just a minor detail. The day trip out to the island costs $200 – catastrophe tourism pays big.
Afafoa Irata, State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry freely admits it:
 We’re sensationalizing the topic.
The Japanese are especially attracted to the islands. Der Spiegel writes:
No where has the “sinking” of Tuvalu captured more interest than in Japan. Every year in February, when the annual spring flood hits and temporarily divides the island for a short time, an Asian camera-team storms the island. “They always film the same thing over and over, they always ask the same questions”, says Shozo Tsunashima, who works for a Japanese NGO in Tuvalu. “Indeed all the hype is completely beyond reality.”
As the circus takes place, the island inhabitants wonder what all the fuss is about. Focus on other real problems is non-existent. Westerners don’t care at all about the rampant problems of alcohol, diabetes, violence. corruption and pollution.
Der Spiegel writes:

The international audience hears nothing about that.
Instead a media sympathy crusade is being conducted. The propaganda machine is humming. Four years ago then Tuvalu Prime Minister claimed before a UN assembly that the climatic threat for his people was like a slow and insidious form of terrorism. One of his predecessors even called it “genocide through environmental destruction”.
That’s the way to attract international funding.
Not surprisingly, what is being conveyed to the world has nothing to do with reality. Many of the islands are in fact growing a couple of millimeters annually. The situation is the same for all the atolls.
Arthur Webb is coastal specialist at the geoscientific organisation of Sopac in Fiji and says much of it has to do with decadal tidal cycles. Erosion is a natural process that has always existed. The sea takes away the beach at some places and deposits it elsewhere.
Webb says;
Surely climate change is a big problem. But that’s not all that is going on in Tuvalu. That’s only a part of it . The atolls are constantly changing. A lot of this is just getting confused. Suddenly everything is getting blamed on climate change.
Meanwhile, writes Der Spiegel, the Finance Minister of Tuvula has to attend a conference in Brussels to take care of some things involving the UN Global Environmental Fund, which will funnel money to the islands. How much can Tuvalu expect? The Minister says:
We’re supposedly at the top of the list.
Catastrophe have never been so profitable. Meanwhile the next plane lands. Der Spiegel writes:
White people pour out of the plane. One is a photographer, one is a sociologist, and two are volunteers who want to plant trees. The show must go on.
It’s the little island that bilks big – all helped along by the UN.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBack in late October it was all over the media; the jubilation was huge. A German retrofitted Audi A2 equipped with new high-tech batteries was driven 605 km from Munich to Berlin on a single charge with an average speed close to 90 kilometres per hour, read here. It was a new record. The Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, even welcomed the electric car at the Brandenburg Gate – a national landmark. The symbolism could not have been more poignant.
Driver Mirko Hannemann even joked that there was still enough power left to charge the iPhones of the reporters, who had flocked behind the car in a media spectacle along the route. The record-setting trip represented the breakthrough that would herald in a new age of environmentally friendly mobility, and it became a symbol of German engineering prowess.
 The 605 km distance smashed all records. Typically an electric car can travel around 70 km on a single charge, and so the 600 km distance represented a quantum leap. Electric mobility was no longer just a utopian dream. It was now reality.
According to the German Information Centre Pretoria:
In Japan, a battery-powered car has run 1,000 kilometres on one charge. That May feat was the work of Japan Electric Vehicle Club. The German engineers said their car was special because the battery was not installed inside the luggage area, but under the luggage area, meaning the full interior space of the car was still available.
German Economic Minister Reinhard Bruderle made sure to be photographed sitting in the car, indulging in its success.
According to the manufacturer of the batteries and electric motors, DBM Energy, the car has a lithium-metal-polymer battery and can function for 500,000 kilometres.
Hannemann, 27, the chief of DBM energy, said 50 experts spent six weeks adapting and tuning up the car for the run.
It was the long awaited feat needed to launch the German government’s ambitious goal of having five million electric cars on its streets by 2030, and by 2050 most urban transport would do without fossil fuels. Germany was on its way to becoming a world leading climate hero.
Is it all just a fraud?
Yesterday leading German newspaper DIE ZEIT wrote a report titled Dubious Record, raising serious questions about claims made by the heavily subsidized manufacturer. What has really raised eyebrows in particular are DMB’s claims that, as DIE ZEIT writes:
Its battery technology is ready for series production and is already affordable in niche markets, like forklifts. It allows 2000 charging cycles and 500,000 km of travel in an automobile. And that with unprecedented reliability. Even shooting through the batteries with live ammo neither led to a fire nor the release of poisonous gases. The wonder rechargeable battery “was able to maintain a constant power output”.

Those are awfully impressive claims. This led DIE ZEIT to ask: If that is so, then why all the future billions for further development? DIE ZEIT:
If that were the case, the auto industry would be at the start of a technological revolution, the military would have to convert over to this new munition-proof energy source. DBM managing director Mirko Hannemann has already received a top offer for its technology from Samsung for € 600 million – and turned it down. Why?
Independent testing refused
Die Zeit points out that when you’re playing with such high stakes, eventually you have to show your hand and become transparent. Potential investors want to see what’s really behind the mainly tax-payer financed record-setting Munich to Berlin trip. DIE ZEIT probes deeper:  
Hannemann drove the car alone while journalists had to tag along behind.”
And in order for the 600 km trip to be recognised as an official record, it was supposed to be certified by a notary public. And the manufacturer refuses to subject the technology to independent testing. DIE ZEIT:
An invited notary public never showed up. German automobile club ADAC offered to test the super-car and its potent batteries, yet the company declined. Concerning an offer to organise an independent test, no reply came to DIE ZEIT by the press deadline. That’s not a good omen! The “breakthrough” in battery technology could very well turn into a PR disaster.”
Shall we call it electric-car gate? The “record”, which probably led to hundreds of millions more being approved for research, could very well turn out to have been just a hoax. If so – fooled again!
======================================================
Update: hat-tip Dirk:
DBM technology “old and unsafe”. Financial Times Deutschland reports:
A packaging manufacturer had bought a DBM Energy battery for the forklift. Just two months later ‘incompatibility between the battery and the charging unit occurred,’ confirms Papstar-Logistik director Gregor Falke. 100 firemen were mobilized, 7 people had to be hospitalized.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Greens grow silent when confronted with questions on democracy, tolerance and free speech. 
The German Greens think it is their duty to conduct inquisitions whenever anyone challenges prevailing environmental dogma. But whenever they themselves are asked tough questions on democracy and freedom of expression, they go silent and run for cover.
When the questions get tough, the Greens get silent. This is what has recently happened with some Green Parliamentarians in Germany.

           (Photo source: Wikipedia)
The Greens bully those who express different views
Back in August, Fred Singer visited Germany and spoke before an audience at a German parliamentary forum discussion. Many of those listening found Singer’s speech interesting and even “enlightening”, some even calling the climate protection craze that has swept through Europe a substitute religion. At this forum, freedom of thought and expression had been awakened, though only very briefly.
But this questioning of climate dogma borders on crime for the German Greens, who have become Germany’s new and growing intolerant. They, along with the Socialists, were livid and unleashed their hellfire and brimstone at those that expressed different views at the forum, read here.
These same Green Parliamentarians then presented Angela Merkel’s ruling government with a list of 13 questions, demanding how such environmental-blasphemy could have been given a forum within the ruling government, background here.
Asking questions is okay, of course, but the problem was the particularly aggressive, arrogant and intolerant tone contained in the brown Green query, so much so that it set off a wave of outrage throughout the blogosphere, leading many to question whether Germany was on track to a dark time it once had visited in its history.
It didn’t take long for the Greens got answers to their 13 questions; they came swiftly. First from physicist Lubos Motl here, and then from the German CDU/FDP coalition government read here, and from EIKE here.
The Greens (aggressively and arrogantly) demanded explanations and answers, and got them, even though they were not worthy of any response.
But it did not end there. Those on the receiving end of the Greens’ fire had questions of their own for the Greens to answer – questions about tolerance, democracy, freedom of expression, and how science progresses.
The German Free Democrats present 16 questions of their own to the Greens
Wondering if the German Greens still respected free speech, democratic principles and the scientific approach, a group of Free Democrats of the Friedrich Naumann Institute and other freedom-friendly organisations prepared a list of questions of their own for the Greens to answer, and sent it to the Green Parliamentarians. Several thousand concerned persons have also already signed a copy in the Internet.
Here are the questions posed to the Greens, 30 November 2010,  in short:
1, Are the Greens aware of the 800 peer-reviewed papers that question AGW?

2. Are the Greens aware that climate science is a relatively new science that still entails lots of uncertainty, and that there is no consensus?
3. Will the Greens even send a representative to the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy in Berlin?
4. If the Greens think the question of climate change is already settled, then why spend billions more for financing of climate research work?
5. Are the Greens aware of any other institution, except for the Pope and their own party, that claims to be infallible?
6. Are the Greens aware that scientific papers questioning man-made climate change were suppressed, and are they aware of Climategate, Himalayagate, Glaciergate, Amazongate?
7. Are the Greens aware of the scientific achievemnts of Prof. Fred Singer’s distinguished scientific career?
8. Are the Greens aware that Prof. Dr. Judith Curry said: “Man made climate change is a theory and is highly uncertain?
9. Is it the Greens’ view that serious, scientific work is only so if it supports the political standards of your party?
10. Why is it that no journalist has ever gotten the idea to check up on the scientific reputation of experts that are paid by the Greens?
11. What is the Greens’ position on the fact that your politics accompanies the profligate subsidies to solar and wind energy, bought by donations from, among others, IBC Solar AG, SMA Solar Technology AG, Ostwind, Umweltkontor Renewable Energy, EWO Energietechnologie GmbH, Conergy AG, Pro Vento, Nordex AG, Windpark G. W. Meerhof GmbH & Co. KG, Ersol AGder Windpark GmbH & Co. KG, Wind Project Development GmbH, Solarworld AG, SMA Technologie AG, Solon AG fir Solar Technology, AGU Energy and Electrotechnology GmbH?
12. In which renewable energy industries and to what extent have Parliamentarians of the Green Faction invested?
13. Do the Greens intend to continue their constant use of the expression “climate denier”?
14. Will the Greens continue to use public money to encourage and incite others to commit acts of crime, such as vandalizing rail tracks?
15. Do the Greens call protests at nuclear waste storage facilities only when they are in the opposition, and do the opposite when they are not?
16. Are the Greens aware of the point you’ve reached today, when you are asked such questions?
Response: deafening silence
Well, it’s been 2 weeks, and still not a peep from the Greenshirts. And glancing over at the debating-table, we see they have snuck away, bolted through the back door, and disappeared into the darkness.  Their silence speaks volumes.

 This is reported in the German realist blog Ökowatch. Dr. Löschke:
What is happening with regards to the climate hypothesis today is that profound and far-reaching conclusions are being based on pure suspicions. That’s religion, and not science. There are also many other well-founded hypotheses on climate dynamics that allow completely other conclusions to be drawn. But strangely, they are being massively suppressed – simply because they don’t accommodate the political concept of rescuing the planet. That’s propaganda, manipulation, suppression of the freedom of expression and demagoguery. As ‘an educated citizen of former communist East Germany’, I’m experiencing grand déjà-vu.”
Today Löschke is also honorary professor at the Leipzig Technical University, a member of the supervisory board of the Deutsche Bahn AG (German Railway) and a board member of Softline AG.  In the interview with Smart Investor he added:
Rescuing the climate – which is absolute nonsense – and the discussion about energy systems and energy policy, which is absolutely necessary, are unfortunately all getting thrown into one pot and mixed into a formless slop. Moreover, environmental protection is getting lumped with ‘climate protection’, which in turn is only harming the correct idea of environmental protection. Not only does the German Railway (Deutsche Bundesbahn) have to preoccupy itself with the topic of energy, but so do many other large energy consumers. Not in relation to “climate”, but in relation to economics and environmental protection.”

Forget all the satellite photos, charts, meteorologists and their reams of data – and especially all the computer models forecasting barbecue winters – or  barbecue summers. (Right now it seems most computer models are projecting a freezer-winter for the northern hemisphere and Arctic regions).
When you talk to people who make their living working outdoors, like farmers, fishermen, etc., especially the old-timers, they sometimes have ways of making seasonal forecasts that seem just as accurate, if not more accurate, than all them super-computer-satellite generated forecasts. Just ask Hadley!
As a kid in Vermont in Northern New England, I recall hearing that heavy fogs in late summer were a sign of an upcoming snowy winter.
Well, this also appears to be a rule for North Carolina too, read August Fogs Could Mean Lots Of Snow. Here Jason Gilmer writes:

There’s an old wives’ tale that says the number of fogs on August mornings are the same as the number of snows in the winter. According to some reports, there were anywhere between 14 and 31 foggy mornings in August.

It looks like we are going to get the chance to test that theory, at least this winter anyway. Fill up the jar with beans.
And according to Gilmer, SkiSoutheast.com’s Mike Doplehas, who has been covering the ski slopes in the area for 15 years, says this was the first year that each morning has been foggy.
”That much snow would make for another great ski season, he said. ‘

The Farmer’s Almanac also forecasts a harsh winter, according to Jason Gilmer:
Farmers’ Almanac gives these other ways to determine the severity of the winter: the thickness of onion skins, lots of acorns, a small orange band on a wooly worm, pigs gathering sticks and trees laden with leaves late in the fall.

Germany is big on so-called Bauernregeln: farmer rules for the weather. Here’s a list Bauernregeln in German, and a few I’ve selected for the coming winter:
1. Jakobi ohne Regen, deutet auf strengen Winter – Jakobi klar und rein, wird’s Christfest frostig sein. In English: “A Jacobi (July 25) without rain means a hard winter.” A Jacobi that’s clear and clean, means Christmas will be frosty.
Here it was sunny and dry. So it looks like a cold winter.
2. Bringt der August viel Gewitter, wird der Winter kalt und bitter. In English: “If August brings a lot of thunder, then the winter will be cold and bitter.”
Last August was cool and wet, but not much thunder. I guess it could mean a cold winter.
3. Tragt der Has’ lang sein Sommerkleid, ist der Winter noch sehr weit. In English: “If the hare wears its summer fur for a long time, then the winter is still far off.”
4. Ist der November kalt und klar, wird trüb und mild der Januar. In English: “If November is cold and clear, then January will be mild and gray.”
And I’ve noticed our cat Hayli has had a voracious appetite lately, constantly hanging out near her food bowl and yowling for more food. It’s autumn and nature is telling her to fatten up for the winter. This time around nature is screaming at her to do so.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe push towards Green Fundamentalism. This is one of the most dangerous surveys the German government has ever commissioned. 
What do you do when the global warming dogma is collapsing all over the world and people in Germany start expressing doubts, as they shovel snow almost daily and battle the icy cold? You produce a bogus study that shows otherwise. Of course you make the survey look scientific and authoritative (an old trick practiced in climate science).
German government releases its latest environmental survey, which suggests citizens want the government to step in even more. 
The online Handelsblatt reports here on a new survey titled Environmental Consciousness in Germany 2010 – Results of a representative survey commissioned by the German Ministry of Environment.
The text was written by Dr Fritz Reusswig of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Dr. Silke Borgstedt of the Sinus Institute. Consider the whole thing as the Church of Green doing a survey of the faithful, and looking to see if they are worshipping and practicing the green religion enough.
Moreover, the survey is designed to legitimize further government intrusion into people’s lives and their choices in order to make sure they live “green”. That’s the dangerous aspect of the survey. The target is to acheive 100% green intellectual purity in Germany.
The overall result is: People are more environmentally religious than ever, but it’s still not enough! And the survey alleges that the majority of the citizens want the government to step into their lives even more. The survey suggests that people want the government to do more to make everybody green.
The enviro-friendly Handelsblatt provides us with some of the results. But be warned – this study has PIK fingerprints all over it.
85% of Germans believe a changeover to renewable energy is needed, (only 8% actually use it).
34% buy organic food, down from 43% in 2008.
58% want a speed limit of only 30 km/hr in cities.
62% want the government to do more for the environment.
Poor people and conservatives are stupid
They don’t come out and say it, but we know damn well what they are getting at. The survey marginalises conservatives, and de facto declares war on people with other beliefs. That’s the impression the Handelsblatt gives:
The study suggests that well-educated, liberal, young people, who use the internet daily, are more environmentally conscious. But poor and conservative groups see environment and economy as opposites, and take the environment less into consideration.”
Yes, conservatives have the same thinking as those you find in the squalor of the lower social strata, the Handelsblatt suggests. In general, people who aren’t environmentalists aren’t hip. They’re like tea partiers.

But Jochen Flasbarth, President of the Federal Ministry of Environment has some quaint things to say about the poor and the narrow minded conservatives in German society:
Although the traditional postwar generations don’t care so much about environmental protection, they have s smaller ecological foot print.”
That’s because they fly less, shop less, and drive less. So in that sense, we have to applaud them. Is this how people are going to be measured by the state in the future? This is pretty damn scary. Since when is it the the state’s job to dictate how people live. German democracy and freedom are taking a gigantic leap backwards.
According to Section 6.2.4.1 of the survey: “Liberal-intellectuals and social ecological persons look closely to see products have the “Blue Angel” environmental seal.”
A majority are calling for more government and higher taxes
And stricter regulations, too. At least that’s what the Church of Climatology survey claims.
62% says the government isn’t doing enough for climate protection.
89% believe industry is not doing enough.
54% say the citizens aren’t doing enough.
61% say Germany should be the global leader in climate protection.
Handelsblatt writes that between 72 and 89% are in favour of better insulation for homes, more environmentally friendly production, more environmentally friendly cars, higher taxes on products that damage the climate, tougher laws or curtailing subsidies that damage the climate.
But Flasbarth thinks there’s a lack of willingness in contrast:
There’s gap there that is interesting for the state because it shows where we can get started. For me this is a clear mandate for environmental policy not to hesitate in implementing the law.”
Talk about a guy who wants to be an environmental Napoleon!  In Flasbarth’s view it’s: the people want us to regulate them – so give us more power! Handelsblatt writes:
In the rankings, environmental protection ranks third with 20% behind economy and financial policy (24%) and jobs (51%). It moved up one position.”
I find it a bit strange that such a survey was not conducted by an independent polling institute, like Infratest or Emnid. Why is the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research involved? I expect other such bogus studies to be used as the next propaganda tool in other countries – soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter much searching, I found that German Focus magazine actually wrote a whole 2 lines on the 10:10 No Pressure campaign, buried deep in the bowels of its website here.
Exploding Children For Climate Protection
The British climate protection campaign 10:10 sparked outrage with its bloody video. Because of protest, the clip was removed from its site.
Included is also a news video in German.
And so Focus has fulfilled it’s journalistic duty proforma to inform the public!
Let’s give them credit for that, at least.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a brilliant satirical piece on German radio by journalist Dirk Maxieiner on how the state thinks it can regulate weather and climate.
Unfortunately the audio and text are only available in German. To all German readers here, if you have yet to hear it, then you really ought to do so.
Dirk Maxeiner is the author of: Hurrah, wir retten die Welt. I’ve read it, and can only recommend it.
First he focuses his satire on the contradictory predictions made by climate crystal ball forecasters. Stefan Rahmstorf recently declared that cold winters are now a sign of global warming, while Mojib Latif claimed that winters will get warmer. No matter what, it’s proof of man-made climate change. Maxeiner:
Even a new ice age would not refute the theory of unstoppable global warming, rather it would be claimed that it confirms it. Climate debate strongly reminds us of the joke about the four enemies of Soviet agriculture: spring, summer, fall, and winter – as well as the two auxiliary enemies: day and night.”
He points out that even weather normalcy is now viewed as indisputable evidence of man-made climate change. When North Sea storm Kyril hit Germany in 2007, the media was shocked that the storm surge predicted the coast never materialised, and so was thus some sort of surreal extreme event.
Today, says Maxeiner, “Germany is in the grips of ‘Immerschlimmerismus’ (things are always getting worse), even though Germans today are more prosperous and healthier than ever.

People no longer accept taking responsibility, he says. When something goes wrong, it’s never your fault – it’s always the fault of someone else. For example “if you crash your car, it’s not because of poor driving skills, but rather it’s the fault of the Road Commissioner who failed to make traffic conditions safe enough”.
The peak of stupidity, and/or arrogance, is the State’s belief that it can now control our weather, and thus keep the menace of extreme weather at bay. The truth is that the State, the great protector, cannot even control its own spending. Maxeiner describes the State’s policy to regulate climate as:
A type of politics that is not even able to stop health insurance premiums from rising, yet pretends it can regulate the temperature of the globe to 2°C. The climate is thus viewed by the public as a system that can be brought into a state of calm simply by switching off human-made influences.”
Some of us of course ask how is it that some people can be brought to the point of believing such absurdity? A new standard of public-dumbing-down has unquestionably been reached.
Indeed Maxeiner makes us realize that one has to be quite gullible on a variety of issues to believe the State can regulate climate. It’s official:
The State is now responsible for our weather”.
But accountable for bad weather, however, will always be the citizens and their lifestyles. Get ready to sacrifice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnthony Watts reports here on how a Canadian climate bill just bit the dust (hooray!). We also know there’s no chance the US Congress passing anything, and that the French government just killed plans for a Super Environment Ministry, read here. So what on earth are Europeans going to do in Cancun when the rest of the world isn’t playing along with the hoax?
Well, I’ll tell you. They are going to make themselves look more concerned than ever about rescuing the climate, then they’re going to blame the failure on the US and China, and then act all indignant. Of course, they are all going to look a little stupid doing that, especially if the European forecast for the next 15 days holds up.
While Europe preaches in sunny and balmy Cancun about the perils of anthropogenic global warming and the need to limit it to 2°C , many citizens in Europe are going to be freezing their fannies off.

While Europe frets about a heating planet in Cancun, much of it is forecast to be frozen over. 
Source: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html
Expect many of the delegates to extend their stay in Cancun in order to take advantage of the lovely warm climate down there. After all, who is going to want to go back to icy Europe (see above)? Who said awhile back that snow in the wintertime would be rare and exciting?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the amazing thing warmist and alarmist Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has recently admitted, according to Der Spiegel here (read the last paragraph).
Now in English here!
And again they assert that the public is just too stupid to have a say in this important public issue.
Schellnhuber even compares himself, his fellow “climate scientists” and climate science to Albert Einstein and the theory of relativity (read below).
More on that in just a bit, but first during the night, Anthony Watts posted news that prominent scientist Hal Lewis is resigning from the American Physical Society. Anthony asked other bloggers to spread the news. Anthony feels so strongly about this that he even equated it to Martin Luther:
This is an important moment in science history. I would describe it as a letter on the scale of Martin Luther, nailing his 95 theses to the Wittenburg church door.
Dr. Lewis has had enough of the charlatans and frauds infesting climate science all over the world. Read his complete resignation letter here.  In it he writes about Climategate’s aftermath and climate science:
It was a fraud on a scale I have never seen, and I lack the words to describe its enormity. Effect on the APS position: none. None at all. This is not science; other forces are at work.- Hal Lewis
Now, Schellnhuber and Der Spiegel
Two days ago Der Spiegel came out with one of the nastiest hit pieces I’ve seen in a long time called: Crusade Against Science – The Charlatans of Climate Science. (Note they’ve softened the title in English). The title I translated was the one used here, scroll down.
Fred Singer. Photo source: CFACT
Der Spiegel singled out Fred Singer and attacked every aspect about him, rehashing all the old tobacco and merchant-of-doubt stuff. Naomi Oreskes’s fingerprints were everywhere here. Face it, she’s hopelessly infatuated with Fred Singer.
Der Spiegel calls Singer “one of the most influential climate deniers worldwide” and a lead denier in the NIPCC, which it describes:

google_ad_height = 200;

Sounds impressive, but is actually just a collection of like-minded scientists that have gathered around him. Also one German is in it: Gerd Weber. a meteorologist who for 25 years was at the service of the German coal industry.
Der Spiegel also goes after Pat Michaels and Myron Ebell, writing that spreading doubt in USA has been easier than in Europe, but that Singer and the “deniers” are working on that too, and have teamed up with the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE). Der Spiegel:
Behind the impressively sounding name is hardly anything more than a post office box in Jena. President Holger Thuss is a local CDU politician [conservative party].
Indeed it is so. There is simply no funding for them and so this small but committed group is forced to operate on a shoestring. EIKE is not showered with tens of millions of euros like activist groups and warmists are. Yet, notice how fearful Der Spiegel and the Science Establishment in Germany are. Even Der Spiegel feels it has to mobilise and slap down the EIKE shoestring operation.
Schellnhuber and debate
Der Spiegel writes that Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has nothing against having a discussion with serious scientists, but refuses to debate with whom he considers “amateurs”. Der Spiegel:
In the end, the science has gotten so complex that the large part of the population is not able to follow it. The climate sceptics, on the other hand, are satisfying “a need for simple truths”.
And that’s precisely where Schellnhuber sees the sceptic’s secret to success. Unfortunately a public debate would not help: “Imagine if Einstein had to defend his theory of relativity on talkshow Maybritt Illner. He wouldn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell.”
What Schellnhuber is saying here is amazing. He’s saying that his climate science would not stand a chance in a public debate. How right you are Herr Schellnhuber. But here it is so because your science is light-years away from Einstein’s when it comes to quality, and not because the people in the land of poets and thinkers are unable to understand it.
And so that’s why he accepts having a discussion only with people who agree with him.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNTZ reader Edward has brought this here to my attention. Journalist James Delingpole, a tireless sceptic of CAGW, has been awarded the Bastiat Prize for Online Journalism at an awards ceremony in New York last night.
Congratulations James! Keep up the good work.
James indeed has become one of the most prolific and effective journalists when it gets down to reporting on the faults and shenanigans of AGW science.
The Telegraph writes:
James’s posts on the Climategate scandal made a huge international impact on the debate over global warming, raising serious questions about the scientific basis of some of the more extravagant predictions of environmental apocalypse.
He has made an immense contribution in forcing the science back to the realms of sanity. The Telegraph:
After James’s posts appeared, generating in some cases over a million page views each, the scientific consensus over climate suddenly appeared a good deal more fragile than it had previously, as even some supporters of the global warming thesis concede. (Others, in contrast, splutter with rage at the mere mention of Delingpole’s name).
