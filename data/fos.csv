The goal of completely “decarbonizing” the economy would require the elimination of oil, natural gas and coal from the fuel mix, essentially taking away about 83% of our current sources of supply and replacing them almost entirely by electricity generated by renewable energy sources. The key question that one must answer to determine the financial costs and implications of this are therefore related to the consequences of total electrification.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BALLPARKING-THE-COST-OF-ELECTRIFICATION-2-FINAL.pdfBALLPARKING-THE-COST-OF-ELECTRIFICATION-2-FINALDownloadIn this article, I offer a rough estimate of the costs to the Canadian economy of total electrification using a methodology and data borrowed from a similar study published in the United States. I hope that illustrating just the order of magnitude of the costs will help to illustrate for the average person, now probably unconcerned about what climate policy will mean to his or her life, how large the impact may be.Using Tanton’s figures, that would place the costs of electrification at somewhere between U.S. $2.7 trillion (Cdn $3.6 trillion) and U.S. $4.35 trillion (Cdn $5.9 trillion). This does not include the stranded assets costs or the deadweight losses which, based on the value of the proven reserves alone, would appear to be about $9.4 trillion.…A cost of Cdn $3.6 trillion is equal to $95,000 for every person in Canada. A foregone income of Cdn $9.4 trillion is equal to almost Cdn $250,000 per person, or one million dollars for a family of four.What Total Electrification MeansTotal electrification means converting the entire Canadian economy to use electricity as a fuel. This includes all appliances in residential and commercial buildings, all furnaces, all transportation uses in every mode, and all other uses. For purposes of analysis, it includes assuring that 100% of the existing and new demand for electricity is met with renewables plus electricity storage. As no other energy sources would be used, it would mean abandoning the infrastructure now used to produce, transport and process oil, natural gas and coal; these would become “stranded assets”.To calculate the costs of such a transition, we need access to estimates of the costs of different electricity generation options and of the different electricity-consuming applications, such as equipment and vehicles. This analysis is based upon the data from the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA). It also included estimates of the costs to satisfy peak loads that may occur in a weather event or other emergency.There are four generic types of costs to be considered:•The costs of replacing current electrical generation facilities with renewable energy and related storage facilities•The costs of electrifying the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors of the economy•The costs of prematurely retiring the “stranded assets” or fossil fuel production, transportation and processing plants and related infrastructure that would no longer be used•The deadweight losses of forgoing the income from development of existing fossil fuel resourcesOverall, the estimates of the cost of electrifying the United States economy range between $18 trillion and $29 trillion in “first costs”.Translating U.S. cost data into probable costs for Canada requires one to make some assumptions. If the costs of complete electrification in Canada are directly proportional to the current patterns of energy demand by fuel and sector, then the costs of electrification would be at least 15% of those in the United States. That would place the costs of electrification at somewhere between U.S. $2.7 trillion (Cdn $3.6 trillion) and U.S. $4.35 trillion (Cdn $5.9 trillion). That does not include the stranded assets costs or the deadweight losses which, based on the value of the oil sands alone, would appear to be at least $9 trillion.The cost to electrify the U.S. economy would translate into annual cost increases of at least U.S. $5,000 per household, paid directly and indirectly. Annual consumer expenditures for energy would roughly double. Translating this into Canadian dollars and adding 15% would mean that the added cost per Canadian household would be $7,760 per year. This, of course, excludes the cost to the economy for the stranded assets and the deadweight losses. It is also a national average; the costs to households in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador would be much higher.To this one might add the non-monetized costs such as the loss of consumer preference, the increased risks to energy security and reliability and the increased vulnerability of the energy system to disasters.A central premise of those who foresee complete decarbonization of the global economy is that all of the economic sectors and services whose energy needs are now met by fossil fuels can be electrified. Yet, today the technologies needed to make this feasible do not exist outside the laboratory, if there. That is especially the case in the transportation sector, where the high energy density of oil products makes them the ideal source of motive power. With currently available technology, there is no way to switch to the use of cellulosic ethanol, to have hydrogen vehicles, to electrify commercial aircraft for passenger or freight movement, or to electrify commercial trucking. While it is technically feasible to electrify passenger rail and even freight rail systems, the costs of replacing existing locomotives, cars and infrastructure are in the trillions of dollars, and no privately-owned and operated rail company would accept the risks. To claim that this could be accomplished within a few decades is simply beyond the pale of belief.About the AuthorROBERT LYMAN is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

Recent warming of the climate system has been modest and benign, and at the low end of the warming predicted by the computerized climate model projections used to guide changes in national energy policy. Climate model projections of human-caused climate change are based upon the assumption that climate does not change naturally, and so represent an example of circular reasoning. From sea level rise to wildfires to severe weather, there has been little to no change observed which is outside the realm of natural variation. Thus, the “climate emergency” claims are not based upon science.Please contact us at 1-888-789-9597 Ext 2 or email at contact(at)friendsofscience.org for more information.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/26/renewable-energy-outlook-to-2025-the-inconvenient-facts/,Joe Brehm ,Renewable Energy Outlook to 2025 – the Inconvenient Facts," Contributed by Robert Lyman ©2020The International Energy Agency (IEA) last week published its Renewable 2020 Report, an analysis of current trends in global renewable energy markets and a projection of the supply and demand for renewable energy (defined as hydro, wind, solar and biofuels) to 2025.The report began by noting that, in contrast to other fuels, renewables used for generating electricity are projected to grow by 7% in 2020, even as global energy demand declines by 5%.Net installed renewable energy generation capacity will grow by nearly 4% in 2020, reaching almost 200 gigawatts (GW). These additions will account for almost 90% of the increase in total power capacity worldwide. The report stated that solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind are already the cheapest way of adding new electricity generating plants in most countries. It projected that renewables will account for 95% of the net increase in power capacity through 2025. The few media reports on this subject characterized it as showing that renewables are “growing from strength to strength”, and likely to “power past coal and gas”.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Renewable-Energy-Inconvenient-Facts-FINAL.pdfRenewable-Energy-Inconvenient-Facts-FINALDownloadThe IEA’s enthusiasm for renewable energy, and especially, wind and solar energy, should be viewed in the context of several important facts relating to historical global energy trends, the relative importance of electricity in the fuel mix, the real cost of renewables (i.e. taking subsidies and intermittency into account), and important policy and market uncertainties.Inconvenient FactsSince 1994, global energy demand has been dominated by coal, oil, and natural gas. As of 2019, these three energy sources continued to provide 84% of global energy needs.In 2019, wind and solar energy used for power generation constitutes only 2% of global primary energy consumption.Non-hydro renewables, including biomass, supply 5% of primary energy demand.In other words, even if renewables continue to grow in usage at a fast pace, it will be many years before they come to be as important to the world economy as the other energy sources.In most countries, the utilities that produce, transmit and distribute electricity are government owned, operated, controlled, and regulated. This goes a long way to explaining why renewable energy investments are increasing.The cost of overcoming the variability, intermittency and unreliably of solar and wind electrical power is so high that it raises the costs to electricity customers to unacceptably high levels and will continue to do so even if the capital costs of building renewable energy plants continue to decline.The most often published costs of wind and solar energy plants ignore the role of taxpayer subsidies. In fact, there are about 20 generic types of subsidies provided to the manufacturers and builders of these plants.The IEA report assumes that Asian countries, and mainly China and India, will all adhere to their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Most are failing to do so.Supply, demand, and competitive markets have in the past largely determined the role that different energy sources play in the world economy and, climate policy or not, it is difficult to believe that this will not be the case in future.About the AuthorRobert LymanROBERT LYMAN is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/13/shells-guilt-trip-fill-up-with-sinless-driving/,Chris Schoneveld ,Shell’s Guilt Trip – Fill up with Sinless Driving," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020Shell Canada announced on November 12 that it will roll out its Drive Carbon Neutral program in Canada under which “offsets” are purchased to compensate for the emission of greenhouse gases from gasoline consumption.Medieval purgatory – will carbon offset indulgences save drivers?Offsets are a form of credit that consumers are asked to purchase to assuage their guilt for consuming fossil fuels, in keeping with the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming and that this is sinful. In keeping with the medieval practice of requiring sinners to pay indulgences for the absolution of their sins, imposing offsets instills the proper feelings of guilt and discourages people from sinning in future. Like so many climate policy measures, the use of offsets aims to elevate the reduction of GHG emissions to a moral crusade.Shell announced that it would assign to gasoline purchases the offset cost of two cents per litre. The company will cover the initial cost of the program, but starting in 2021, participating drivers can choose to pay the two cents per litre to purchase the carbon credits from a reforestation project in British Columbia. Shell hopes that Canada will develop a widespread regulatory regime and market for “carbon credits” in future.Let us pause to wonder at the foolishness of this program.Federal and provincial governments are already implementing 237 GHG emissions reduction measures on which the Canada reports biennially to the United Nations. These measures include regulations, taxes, tax credits, subsidies of all kinds, consumer information programs, restrictions on energy developments and many more. These measures are both generic, covering all parts of the economy, and sector-specific. There is no country-wide inventory of all measures taken, including those implemented by municipalities, there has never been a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether they are worth their cost, and there is no authoritative analysis of what effect that are having on emissions. The most widely publicized single measure is the carbon dioxide pricing regime, which itself takes three different forms – carbon dioxide taxes, output-based pricing systems applied to large industrial emitters, and emissions trading systems (“cap and trade”). So, the use of market-based pricing as a means to raise the cost of the energy Canadians use is already well in place, and the costs of these measures are rising every year. In the specific case of motor gasoline, the federal carbon pricing regime establishes a minimum rate of $30 per tonne currently, or seven cents per litre. That will rise in 2021 to 9.2 cents per litre and in 2022 to 11.5 cents per litre.The Government is now implementing another regulatory program, the Clean Fuel Standard, that will effectively raise the cost of all fossil fuel consumption much higher, and perhaps double the effect of the carbon pricing regime.Shell Canada, undoubtedly under instruction from its “green” parent company, appears to have decided that these added costs are simply not enough to motivate (or is it punish?) Canadian motorists enough. We all need social pressure to pay two cents more per litre (though the program is voluntary).Two cents sounds like so little, right? How can consumers complain? Well, in 2019 Canadians consumed 43.3 billion litres of gasoline. Two cents per litre, if added to all gasoline sales, would total $866 million. “We see a lot of demand from customers to start helping. How can a customer who maybe can’t afford to buy an electric car, but wants to do something to help the environment, get involved?” said Shell Canada president Michael Crothers in an interview.CTV NewsGasoline is already by far the most heavily taxed energy source. The average tax on gasoline in Canada in 2020 is 42 cents per litre, according to the Canadian Taxpayers’ Federation. See the federation’s 2020 report here: Click to access 2020_CTF_GTHD_ENGLISH.pdf Gasoline only constitutes 44% of the refined oil products consumed in Canada. If the taxes were to be fully apportioned across all oil products, it would have to include diesel fuel (28%), aviation fuel (9%), residual fuel oil (3%), still gas (5%) and others (10%). Carbon dioxide taxes apply to natural gas and coal, too. How long before some supporter of “carbon neutrality” suggests that we all must buy offsets for those energy sources?In Europe, the various offsets and emissions credits systems have proven vulnerable to a series of scams and fraudulent activities run by organized crime. Offsets for forest planting have proven vulnerable to fraud in Brazil. See the following report.https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/Shell may be able to ensure that its reforestation project partner in British Columbia is really planting trees, but we should all be wary of proposals to broaden such programs to country-wide ones.The goal of carbon neutrality is fundamentally flawed, based on a false thesis about the causes and effects of a changing climate, and an exaggeration of the role that countries like Canada can play in influencing the trends in global emissions. Shell can invite its customers to go on a guilt trip, but I won’t be going on the ride. Neither should you.About the AuthorRobert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/13/the-very-opinionated-show-conversation-with-robert-lyman/,Graydon Tranquilla ,The Very Opinionated Show: Conversation with Robert Lyman," Guest blog post contributed by Kate Wand © 2020Kate Wand – The Very Opinionated Show HostWhat on earth is going on with Canadian aviation?Since the unscientific, totalitarian CCP styled lockdown was launched upon western countries in March, there has been an extremely severe global aviation crisis, unarguably the worst in its history, by far. With operations forcibly reduced by 85%, and the resulting decline in CO2 emissions, climate cultists are having a field day.They claim the planet is healing, and that we should stay this way.With global aviation emissions making up an un-whopping 2.5% pre-corona, “green” ideologues claim this is too much, as these carbon-sinning jet-fuel machines known as airplanes cannot ever meet net-zero with present technology. They are not the vehicles of the future, according to the radically dogmatic environmentalists, and Ekranoplanes are, according to the World Economic Forum. Or maybe sailboats.With no alternative in sight to replace current aircraft engine technologies running on incredibly efficient and energy-dense oil-based fuel, few investors will commit to funding research on improbable outcomes; the possibility of phasing out the current aircraft fleet is close to nil.If better technology were to exist, in the era of Tesla’s and Elon Musk’s rocket ships, we would already see its development unfolding in the market.In fact, a perfect example of market-led innovation is the geared turbofan by Pratt and Whitney, currently standard on the C-Series, and on the A320 Neo aircraft. Jet fuel represents approximately 20-30% of airlines cost, therefore there is obviously a strong financial incentive for such energy-efficient improvements in technology, irregardless of the whims of a central planner.As our current federal government worships at the altar of decarbonization, regardless of how much of this is actually feasible, economically ruinous, financially crippling to its citizens, and misery-inducing, I cannot help but wonder, is the lack of bailout to Canadian airlines, something unique to this land of red tape and overbearing government, a purposeful bludgeon to the industry?With the USA having provided billions in bailouts, as well as every single other country globally, aviation workers, the hundreds of thousands furloughed in Canada, have been asking, what about us?https://pickeringairport.org/2155-2/?fbclid=IwAR0EmbNEPf8X-iBQpeO9KXtyHt1WaLGc8XvEGDZbsfnE2zKOjcV_-5ObbbsThe EU likewise, bailing out their industry, albeit with heavy green strings attached, such as carbon emissions reductions, enforced downsizing, and partial state ownership, is steamrolling their way through the U.N. sustainable development goals. They are in the process of sacrificing billions of dollars towards their GDPs, millions of people’s livelihoods and careers, all because of insignificant carbon emissions in an industry which has already become highly fuel-efficient over the decades, improving by leaps and bounds.However, this apparently not being fast enough, OECD countries have now subscribed to CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reductions Scheme for International Aviation, a program that our True North Strong and Free is obviously a part of, which is set to become mandatory in 2027.In this conversation with Robert Lyman, economist and retired public servant with four decades of experience in the energy and transportation sector, as well as environmental policy, his experience and expertise provide some much-sought after fact-based clarity.We talk economics, emissions and aviation. Robert introduces the CORSIA scheme and its role in carbon offsets, emissions reductions, and how it will affect airlines and it’s employees, as well as your average Canadian traveller.As the first guest of my new series, The Very Opinionated Show, Robert gets taken on a few tangents with me, and we also explore the bigger picture of:• Social shaming, snitching, history• Musings over the downsizing of aviation industry to reduce green house gases using the corona crisis• Carbon offset scams and the money trailWe discuss the application of these kinds of so-called green policies, and the real effects on people’s lives. Robert shares his wisdom and experience to speak to what is, in my opinion, the irrational, single-minded, destructive policies of current government, the hubris of central planning, and the cost of ideology.————To watch the full conversation with Robert and Kate, click here:Conversation w/ Robert Lymanhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDi2dYs8XC0R265fbXQ6Y8y2uQ1QMOWPATo subscribe to The Very Opinionated Kate Wand Show, click here:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9kGfLP_dGp0KCDTNiUjowTo watch Kate’s series Aviation Hijacked, click here:AVIATION HIJACKEDhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDi2dYs8XC0ROrqBHI9mYnO6DZMW8eUfVKate Wand on Twitter: kate@katoffensive——————-Sources:https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/covid-19-sustainable-aviation/https://greatreset.com/files/TheGreatReset.pdf p.35, 36, 42https://greatreset.com/Supporting Aviation Key to Canada’s Pandemic Recoveryhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/simpleflying.com/government-bailout-conditions/amp/https://aeroreport.de/en/innovation/geared-turbofan-how-the-engine-of-the-future-was-developedhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/591285/aviation-industry-fuel-cost/The Global Assault on Aviation EmissionsMayday – The Aviation Industry’s Climate Policy OrdealShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['aviation', 'climate change']",2020/11/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/13/climate-and-the-european-parliament-lack-of-calculation-or-demagoguery/,,Climate and the European Parliament: lack of calculation or demagoguery?," by Samuel Furfari © 2020Originally published in the European Scientist, republished as a Google Translated English version with permission of the author.The European Parliament (EP) is accelerating its strategy towards a completely carbon-free European Union. Not content with the ambitious proposal of the European Commission (EC), the parliamentary majority claims that more needs to be done. What they are proposing is unfortunately foolish. This is not an opinion, but a conclusion offered by the historical analysis of official data from Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU.Samuel FurfariINFLATION OF TARGETSAt the Earth Summit in June 1992, the United Nations adopted the Framework Convention on Climate Change. To get to this conference, where he was not allowed to speak, Jacques Delors had a proposal adopted for a directive aimed at the stability of CO 2 emissions in the EU. It was accompanied by a proposal for an energy-carbon tax. France did not want it, arguing that “to fight against alcoholism we should not tax lemonades”, because it was opposed to a tax on nuclear energy, which does not produce CO 2 . Times have since changed.In 2009, at the initiative of Mrs. Merkel, the EU adopted an energy-climate strategy with the objective of reducing CO 2 emissions by 20% compared to 1990. The year 1990 was, and remains, the point of benchmark in the whole climate issue, because it is quite simply the “rounded” year just before 1992. Nicolas Sarkozy, who presided over the EU that semester, had this directive adopted at full speed, because he saw it also a superb promotion of nuclear energy, of which France was a leader. Again, times have since changed.To prepare for the COP21 negotiations, the European Council reached, at its meeting on 23 and 24 October 2014, an agreement on the framework for action for the EU in the area of climate and energy by 2030. It adopted the principle of a binding target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. On 30 November 2016, the Commission, by publishing its “energy-climate” legislative package, this objective of reducing “by at least” 40% by 2030 was made concrete in legislative proposals. But there was no longer any question of nuclear power.During her campaign for the presidency of the Commission, Ms. Ursula von der Leyen promised to raise this target from 40 to 50%. It was a necessary step so that the candidate of the European People’s Party (EPP) could also receive the support of the European left against the socialist Timmermans. Visiting Paris, coming out of her meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, on the steps of the Élysée Palace, the candidate announced that her goal was now 55% for 2030 and 100% for 2050. We can imagine that the reference shareholder of the French nuclear company Areva had used its position of strength in the EP thanks to its elected representatives from the République en Marche. This objective, even more ambitious than the previous ones, was indeed apparently welcome to relaunch the sale of French nuclear reactors,that does not emit C02 and are explicitly mentioned by the IPCC as a source of carbon-free energy essential to achieve its climate objectives.This 55% target for 2030 was endorsed by the EC in its Green Pact in December 2019 and accepted a few days later by the European Council, with the notable exception of Poland. The decision is therefore not yet finalized, Poland having received the promise that billions of euros in aid from European taxpayers would be granted to it in compensation for its acceptance. The great bargaining has yet to take place, probably by the end of this year, bargaining, because the dossier on the rule of law in Poland, managed by Mr Timmermans under the previous Commission, is involved. This country will negotiate hard on its share in the reduction of CO 2 emissions .It will be observed that the objective for 2050 is not “zero carbon”, but “carbon neutrality”. The difference is that no one can imagine achieving zero fossil fuels in 2050, but the inevitable emissions will have to be captured and buried (CCS technology). In addition, the Vice-President of the EC has let it be known that he thinks like Germany on nuclear energy. It is therefore difficult to see how we will be able to reduce CO 2 emissions while abandoning nuclear power. The die-hards believe that the emissions trading mechanism will allow it. It is window dressing, because it is indeed additional emissions.On October 7, the EP raised the already ambitious target of 55% of the EC proposal to 60%. There was a majority of 392 votes, but also a very strong abstention (142), a sign that some, while understanding the exaggeration, were afraid of being castigated, or even ostracized like all those who do not follow without flinching the question. climate. In a lyricism of which only politicians have the secret, The moment has been called a “historic moment”.We did not have the opportunity to verify which Member States the MEPs who opposed (161) or abstained came from, but it is likely that some must have understood the huge trap of this vote. In fact, it provides, above all, that each of the Member States must reduce its emissions.Flashback to understand. The targets of the 20-20-20 strategy of 2009 were binding on each Member State, but those decided in 2016 were only binding on the EU as a whole and not on individual Member States. Environmentalists have tried to impose coercion on each member state, but the Council has held firm. The Bulgarian minister who was presiding over the EU at the time had this word which showed his determination: “  you are not going to bring in through the window what we have brought out through the door  “. The bill for the 20-20-20 objectives had indeed opened the eyes to many countries, which have finally understood that these energy policies are overpriced for mediocre results. Their position can be summed up by the popular expression “courage, flee! “.Because this is the most important point of the decision taken by the EP on October 7. Much more serious than the figure of 60%, it is the obligation for each Member State to achieve this objective. We can bet that the battle will be tough in the Council, because this disproportionate ambition of parliamentarians is unacceptable for many Member States, as we will see with a few simple arithmetical calculations.THE HARSH REALITY OF NUMBERSIn 1990, all the Member States of the current EU (EU-27) emitted 3,925.28 Mt of CO 2, of which 3,549.77 Mt came from the energy sector. If we refer to all greenhouse gases, these figures are respectively 4911.63 and 3734.38 Mt. The difference corresponds to industrial greenhouse gases which are not linked to the production of CO 2 . As these gases are more easily controlled, when politicians claim to limit emissions, it is mainly CO 2 emissions that they are referring. In particular, when environmentalists attack SUVs or airplane vacations, it is not, for example, SF 6 or N 2 0 that they are thinking, but of CO 2 emissions.. These were in 2018 (latest year of official Eurostat data) of 3,184.02 Mt, a decrease of 26.47 Mt per year, which corresponds to a reduction of 19% (still compared to 1990). Between 2018 and 2020, this figure will change and we can therefore recognize that the objective of the 20-20-20 strategy will be exceeded … but “thanks to” the Covid crisis.Globally exceeded! Because if Germany was able to reduce its emissions by 26%, Ireland increased them by 24%, Spain by 22%, Cyprus by 56%, the Netherlands by 3%, green Austria by 10%. and Portugal by 19%. In fact, a significant part of the reduction in EU CO 2 emissions since 1990 is due to the abandonment of the socialist planned economy in the former communist countries. In them, until the end of communism, the price of energy was not real, so there was no need to think about energy efficiency. Thus, once free and having adopted the market economy, Romania and Bulgaria were able to reduce their CO 2 emissions.65% and 43% respectively, demonstrating, if need be, the total ineffectiveness of planned socialist systems, including in energy and environmental matters. Globally, all the Member States that belonged to the Soviet sphere of influence were able to reduce their emissions by 69%, while those practicing market economy by only 17%, because energy efficiency which was part of their practice since the oil crises had already made it possible to achieve good efficiency.But at the same time, on the basis of 2018 data, it must be recognized that the efforts over 28 years have not led to the reduction announced in Western countries. The containment and the terrible recession underway will bring down CO 2 emissions and thus encourage enthusiasts of binding measures to claim that it is possible to achieve “ambitious, but realistic” objectives. This is a shortcut that the millions of citizens who are or will soon find themselves unemployed will appreciate …On average, since 1990, the EU 27 has reduced its emissions by 1.0% per year (1.7% for ex-socialist countries and 0.9% for others). Now, to reach -55% or -60% in 2030, CO 2 emissions should be 1766.38 or 1570.11 Mt, i.e. the annual effort by 2030 ( 12 years from 2018 to 2030) compared to that achieved so far should be 446% or 508%. Difficult to imagine except to consider a complete upheaval (and binding) of current lifestyles and the obligation to face all the excesses to which this upheaval will lead on the part of those who categorically refuse it.But as I wrote above, more dangerous than this 60% target is the will of the parliament to try again to “enter through the window” the obligation for each Member State to reduce its own emissions by 60%. . This means that France will have to multiply by more than 7 for 12 years what it has painfully achieved over 28 years (a reduction of 15%). Belgium should also be 7 times more ambitious. As for the Netherlands, they should be 50 times more ambitious, but in the opposite direction. Perhaps that explains the position of two parties which form the Batavian government to want to relaunch nuclear power?The following table gives, for each country, the ratio between the annual reduction which has been made so far and that which will have to be achieved to achieve the extravagant objectives of the European Parliament. It can be seen that the objectives of the European Commission are just as unattainable (in the table a negative figure indicates that this country has increased its emissions compared to 1990). The graph also illustrates that Parliament’s ambition to want to impose 60% does not in fact change the scale of the challenge compared to that of the European Commission. The bargaining that will take place in the Council to find a compromise between 55% or 60% is just window dressing for the naïve.CONCLUSIONSIs it serious to propose such objectives given the fact that they are unachievable, except to destroy the European economies or to change the economic system, and this, without the approval of the citizens? And this time, there are no more “low-hanging fruits” to take, everything that was easy to achieve has been done; we must now move on to the difficult things. Without forgetting the will of the anti-nuclear activists. Let us also observe that it is not wind or solar energies that can respond to this challenge that the institutions are proposing. Between 2008 and 2018, Germany increased its production of this popular form of energy by 240%, but only reduced its emissions by 12% (this comparison should not be made with 1990 when these energies were practically non-existent.In their next meetings, by the end of 2020, the heads of state and government are expected to debate the proposals of the Commission and that of the EP. The green lobbies will be unleashed in the media, while the industrialists, paralyzed as always on these issues, will begin their declarations with a “we are in favor of the drastic reduction of CO 2 emissions  ” or similar. Until when will European industry continue to be silent to appear green? Until when will the population remain in ignorance of the economic disaster that these parliamentarians cut off from industrial reality are preparing for them? Why is the press silent in the face of such incredible data?This demagoguery of the European Parliament, all parties combined, does not make it grow. Members of the European Parliament do not realize that their demagoguery is detrimental to them. Perhaps, moreover, the European Parliament could set an example, by deciding to abandon its massive transhumance towards Strasbourg four days a month, which also causes emissions?Almost 30 years after the adoption of the United Nations Convention, global CO 2 emissions have increased by 58%. Non-EU countries are heading at full speed towards a continuous increase in CO 2 emissions , because they are the consequence of socio-economic success, which is paramount for them. Despite its extreme positions, the EU is not and will not be the model for other countries in the world.Recall that with its meager 9% of global emissions, going to less than 5% will come at the cost of either a pan-European economic disaster and / or a change of politico-economic regime, about which citizens Europeans were not consulted, and to top it off, with extremely low global impact.The simplistic and grotesque parable of the hummingbird, very fashionable in some circles, and according to which everyone must do their part, however small, is here nonsense: unless the rest of the world follows Europe, which will never happen, this one condemns itself for almost no impact. Certainly, the EU will be carbon-free and will be able to look at the rest of the world from the height of its morale and its self-satisfaction, but it will also be considerably impoverished and will suffer in any case the effects of climate change to which the rest of the world will have contributed.“Should we do nothing then?” “, I am often asked? There are solutions. There have always been solutions; they have always been technological. European political parties and governments should first of all free themselves from their fear of professional green activists, for whom climate change is only the perfect pretext to advance their old goal of “another world”. Then, and consequently, to invest the money of European citizens in this well-controlled low-carbon energy production method, for which Europe has the skills in the legal, political and human sense, and in full technological development, which is the conventional nuclear. Why invest so much in inefficient or science fiction technologies (nuclear fusion, hydrogen as I show in my recent book ” The hydrogen illusion”), while we already have new generation reactors (SMR, molten salts), some of which consume their own“ waste ”?Table 1 Report of the annual changes to be achieved by 2030 compared to those made since 1990.About the AuthorDoctor of applied sciences and engineer, Samuele Furfari has been teaching energy geopolitics at the Free University of Brussels since 2003.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/10/the-paris-gap-pitfall-for-canada/,Susan Ball ,The Paris Gap – Pitfall for Canada," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020In July, 2020, the Canadian Energy Centre, an organization of the Alberta government, published a report based on a study that it had commissioned from Navius Research of the economic costs for Canada of attaining the emissions reductions associated with the Paris Agreement. Navius Research is an economic research and consulting firm based in Vancouver, British Columbia. This article offers a summary of, and comment on, the report.The Nature of the “Paris Gap”At the 20th conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris, France in December 2015, the parties could not agree on a common target or goal for reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions . Instead, they committed to submit a series of voluntary plans to reduce emissions with the ultimate goal of restraining the increase in average global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C, over those that existed in pre-industrial times. Canada was thus free to adopt its own voluntary target. The Harper government proposed in 2015, and the Trudeau government confirmed in 2016, that Canada would aim to reduce emissions by 30% from those that prevailed in 2005 by 2030. In effect, that meant a national emissions target of 511 million tonnes (Mt) per year by 2030.After 26 years of setting (and missing) emission reduction targets, in 2018 Canada’s GHG emissions were 728 Mt. Since 1992, Canada’s federal and provincial governments have introduced an ever-increasing stream of regulatory, subsidy, taxation, and other measures to reduce emissions, but the combined effects of economic and population growth have more than offset the results of these measures. The number and cost of measures has increased considerably since the election of the Trudeau government in 2015 and the approval by federal, provincial and territorial governments of the Pan-Canadians Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change in 2016. The policy and program measures adopted up to 2018 were estimated by Environment and Climate Change Canada as likely to reduce emissions from 2018 levels to 623 Mt by 2030 (I.e. the “Promised Policy Case) , leaving a so-called “gap” of 112 Mt to be reduced.The Research Brief prepared based on the data from Navius Research aimed to measure the impact of eliminating the 112 MT gap, by assessing the impact on the Canadian and Alberta economies, employment levels and investment levels.MethodologyNavius Research uses its gTech model, which it describes as “the most comprehensive model available for forecasting the greenhouse gas and economic impacts of climate policy in Canada. Its inclusion of technological change, macroeconomic dynamics, and fuels markets mean that it is ideally positioned to forecast how the broad range of policies implemented in Canada will affect energy competitiveness and household welfare.” Navius states that the gTech model “provides a detailed accounting of the types of energy-related technologies available to households and businesses to reduce emissions. In total gTech includes200 technologies across more than 50 end-uses.”The federal government’s biennial report to the United Nations lists 237 different emission-reduction policies and measures now in place. Each type of measure has its own costs and effects, both in terms of the economy and the environment. As it is extremely difficult to project exactly which combination of additional measures governments are likely to employ going forward, Navius adopted an important simplifying assumption. They assumed that the federal government would use the single, most economically-efficient measure – an increase in the carbon dioxide tax and the full (i.e. 100%) recycling, or refunding, of the revenues received from that tax back to the public.Using that assumption, Navius estimated that the federal carbon dioxide tax would have to rise from $50 per tonne in 2022 (its projected rate under the current schedule of planned increases) to $116 by 2030.Navius acknowledges that this is a conservative assumption.Economic ConsequencesAccording to the Navius analysis, the economic conditions will be far worse in 2030 than they would have been under the Promised Policy case:• Canadian GDP will be $54 billion lower.• Alberta’s GDP will be $13.5 billion lower• In other words, most of the adverse income effects (i.e. $41.5 billion) will occur in provinces other than Alberta.• There will be 300,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs in Canada• Investment in Canada will be $19.5 billion lower • Investment in Alberta will be $3.5 billion lower• Thus, most of the investment losses (i.e. $16 billion) will occur in provinces outside Alberta.GHG Emissions ReductionsUnder the Promised Policy case, Canada’s GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector are projected to grow from 157 Mt in 2015 to 163 Mt in 2030. Navius estimates that meeting the “Paris gap” would require emissions from oil and gas to decline by 31 Mt, from 163 MT to 132 Mt. Navius further estimates that Alberta oil and gas sector emissions would have to decline from 136 Mt in 2015 to 112 Mt in 2030, or 24 Mt. While Navius does not state the implications, it is clear that that major reductions in planned oil sands expansions would be necessary. Further, the reduction of 12 Mt in oil and gas operations outside of Alberta (i.e. in Saskatchewan and Newfoundland) could have major impacts there as well.Carbon Tax and Revenue ImplicationsAs noted previously, Navius assumed that the carbon tax rate would increase from $50 per tonne in 2022 to $116 per tonne in 2030. It seems to assume that the carbon tax rate under the Promised Policy Case would be $50 per tonne in 2030.Using Navius’ assumptions and estimates, the revenues from the carbon tax in 2030 would be (623 Mt x $50 =) $31.15 billion. With the higher tax rate but lower emissions level, the revenues from the carbon tax in 2030 would be (511 Mt x $116 =) $59.28 billion, almost twice as high.CommentsEconometric models can be useful tools for comparing the potential economic effects of alternative policy measures, but they offer fewer insights concerning the likely effects of a single set of measures. The are usually “general equilibrium” models, meaning that they involve analyses of multiple goods markets, with the underlying assumption that the overall economy will trend over time to “equilibrium”, an economically-efficient or optimum allocation of resources at what may be a higher or lower level of income. The assumed natural tendency of markets to equilibrium often has the effect of producing quite low estimates of the effects of policy “shocks”, with little attention to the “transaction costs” or problems of adjustment experienced as some industries and companies go out of business.The value of such analyses thus depends considerably on the mathematical equations used to construct it and the assumptions used to develop the scenarios.The numbers produced by the Navius analysis should therefore be viewed in context. Generally, they are probably under-estimates. The projected $54 billion in foregone GDP in 2030 is sizeable, but only represents 2.2% of Canada’s GDP in that year. Far more important is which industries, firms and regions will be worse off and which better off, but the report offers only limited insights into this. Proportionately, the Alberta provincial economy and the oil and gas industries will definitely be worse off, which will come as no surprise to those who have observed the effects of climate policy in Canada to date.The projected $41.5 billion reduction in income in provinces other than Alberta in 2030 should serve as a wake-up call to the people living in those provinces. This is especially true in Ontario and Quebec, where the larger part of the income reductions will undoubtedly occur. They will be in the industries that traditionally supply goods to the oil and gas and mining industries and in other emissions-intensive industries, notably metals fabrication, steel, petrochemicals, and cement. The economic pain inflicted by climate policy is about to spread more evenly across the country.For most of the 28 years during which governments in Canada have applied GHG emission reduction policies, they have emphasized regulatory measures and subsidies. Even today, three years after the introduction of carbon dioxide pricing at the federal government level, the lion’s share of emissions reduction arises from non-pricing policy tools. Navius has assumed for simplicity sake that the incremental measures needed to reduce emissions to the 511 Mt level will all be in the form of higher carbon taxes. This is reasonable given the difficulty of projecting the wide range of other measures that will be applied, but it risks significantly under-estimating the economic costs of the measures taken.Probably of equal importance, Navius assumed that 100% of the revenues collected by governments through carbon dioxide taxes will be returned to the public. In fact, under the current federal regime, the government committed to return only 90% of the revenues from carbon dioxide taxes and an unspecified portion of the revenues collected from the output-based pricing system that applies to large industrial emitters. As experience in British Columbia and in most other jurisdictions has shown, the share of carbon dioxide taxes retained by governments to be spent on discretionary programs tends to rise over time. In Quebec, the provincial government has implemented an emissions trading system and made no commitment to return any of the resulting revenues directly to provincial residents. The assumption of a 100% recycling of carbon pricing thus understates the adverse economic effects of the policy measures that would be needed to meet the 2030 target. A “best guess” of the actual recycling would probably be 70% or less.Due to the focus on meeting an emission reduction target in a single year, the Navius analysis does not address how large will be the cumulative costs of the incremental policy measures that may be taken from now to 2030 and beyond. It of course, does not try to estimate the cumulative cost of all the 273 existing measures and of those that went before them from 1990 on.Finally, of course, one should consider the magnitude of the environmental benefits from these economic, investment and employment losses. A reduction of 112 MT in emissions would represent a 15% reduction in Canada’s 2018 total, or 0.3% in global 2018 emissions. That percentage will almost certainly be lower by 2030. The effects on the global climate, in other words, will be too small to measure.According to Bjorn Lomborg’s analysis, if all countries met their Paris Agreement targets there would be vast economic damage and no measurable impact on global warming.About the AuthorRobert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/10/global-warning-climate-and-energy-politics-face-off/,,“Global Warning” – Climate and Energy Politics Face Off," By Michelle Stirling © 2020Despite being a Calgarian and deeply engaged in the issue of climate change, somehow, I missed the October 2019 release of the Mathew Embry film “Global Warning”. Its existence only came to my attention a few weeks ago when someone posted on Watts Up With That blog that the film was up for six Alberta film awards.Watch now – VOD https://globalwarningdocumentary.com/?utm_source=friendsofscience Sponsored Content. Friends of Science Society receives a share of the VOD fee.“Global Warning” has an odd name, perhaps confusing to many people. The film is about global warming and climate change, but also has an inherent warning from various speakers in the film regarding the impacts of climate change policies on people’s lives. Some of the messages are not what you would expect and that is why you should watch the film.First of all, “Global Warning” is beautifully shot by Philip L. Harrison, Director of Photography, and artfully directed by Embry. With every new scene, Embry explores the unexpected next step. Just when you think the ‘logical conclusion’ in the climate and energy discussion should be ‘X’, Embry brings you ‘Y’, and makes you think.One of the featured speakers is Catherine Abreu, named as one of the top 100 influencers in the world on climate change, she is the executive director of the Climate Action Network of Canada. We meet Catherine early in the film at the United Nations COP 25 conference in Bonn, Germany. In conversational exchanges with other climate activists, she states that “Canada has never met a climate target it couldn’t miss” and that “facts don’t change people’s minds; most people accept ‘the science’” on climate change.“Global Warning” circles around the climate policies that are destroying the foundations of Alberta’s economy, namely that of the development of the oil sands – aka “Tar Sands”. Embry takes us on a tour of vacant downtown office spaces in Calgary, now nearly 30%; five or six years ago the vacancy rate was only 2%. What so gutted Alberta’s economy?Catherine Abreu – courtesy of “Global Warming” producersClimate activists.For Catherine Abreu, Germany’s fields of wind turbines and solar panels, the kilometers of high voltage transmission lines, are all beautiful and a sign of the future. She hopes that Canada will look that way one day. As for oil sands workers whose jobs are dying as the world convulses with climate fear of carbon dioxide, she naively states that “building powerlines requires exactly the same skills as digging pipelines”, so Canada should just build an east-west power grid to transmit all that ‘good, clean energy’. (Note: It is not so simple. Do I have a paper for you! Second note: All renewables are made from oil, natural gas, and coal.)Her naivety is terrifying.Image licensed from Shutterstock.Design-Considerations-of-a-Real-World-Interprovincial-Energy-Corridor-Power-Transmission-LineDownloadRaymond Owl – screenshot from “Global Warning”Embry has done his homework and made every effort to include commentary from a spectrum of the people affected by these climate and energy policies. He visits with Raymond Owl, founder of the Traditional Ecological Knowledge network of aboriginal elders. Raymond’s view is that the white man does not have enough money to pay for what has already been taken from Mother Earth and the damage, let alone the kind of resource development they want. Money as compensation does not equal ‘consultation’ for him. While not opposed to progress, he wants it to be to scale and to respect Mother Earth. His constitutional rights to this perspective and related legal process are supported by commentary by lawyer Hon. Stephen O’Neill.Embry goes to the oil sands and has the standard ‘media tour’ of the green, restored lands. Then he gets to go ‘behind the scenes’ to the much-hated tailings ponds, where we learn that oil sands operators pump carbon dioxide into the effluent which makes it a pH of 7, about the same as river water. Though the water in the ponds is not potable, it is just a big ‘dirty mud puddle’ as Professional Engineer Joy Romero explains. She explains how the processes involved remove the sticky black tarry bitumen and leave behind white sandy beaches. Romero says that her great grand children will be able to enjoy the reclaimed areas as any national park.But is that something a climate activist could ever believe?Of course, for climate activists, the “Tar Sands” will only ever be ‘dirty oil’ – the massive, scarred footprint of the open pit mines – and the related carbon dioxide emissions from production. The film’s chopper pilot confirms that no matter what activist he takes for a ride, they all come with preconceived notions that are resistant to oil sands facts.Embry introduces us to oil executive Gwyn Morgan, a farm boy who created an international oil company known as Encana. We also meet Greenpeace campaigner Christy Ferguson who explains that the founders of Greenpeace were journalists whose dynamic photo images changed public opinion.I found it appalling to realize that powerful imagery by some Greenpeace journo activists was all it took to destroy the reputation of the Alberta oil sands industry, built up by decades scientific work, created by thousands of highly educated Professional Engineers, Professional Geoscientists, biological scientists, management experts and skilled trades people. Point in fact, Encana has left Calgary for Denver and changed its name to Ovintiv.Isn’t that a warning, a wake-up call?Dr. Patrick Moore – courtesy “Global Warning” producersLater in the film, Greenpeace co-founder and former president, Patrick Moore, explains that he left the group when its values turned against common sense, as it evolved from the volunteer-based group of hippies wanting ‘to do something real’ that he started with, to a big business with a massive payroll to make.While in Germany, Embry and producer Peter Beyak, tracked down Professor Fritz Vahrenholt. Vahrenholt was one of the first proponents of the use of wind and solar for Germany more than 20 years ago. He is an environmentalist, a professor of chemistry, and author of several books and peer-reviewed papers on climate. His book “The Neglected Sun” explains how the sun drives climate change. His more recent book “Unwanted Truths” explains the things he says in the film – the things no climate activist wants to hear. Global warming is cyclical, and the past Medieval Warm Period was just as warm as today.Professor Fritz Vahrenholt – courtesy “Global Warning” producersVahrenholt is a past Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expert reviewer. He has real life experience as manager of an energy firm that went deeply into renewables. Based on his experience, he explains that renewables are not the answer to the energy transition and that climate hysteria is putting society at risk. He explains that renewables can only be complementary – too much of them and power prices skyrocket, the grid collapses, industry and jobs leave the country, and society suffers. While Vahrenholt agrees that carbon dioxide has some warming effect, he asserts that we have three generations to address the issues related to fossil fuel emissions, not ten or twelve years as activists claim. But activists have the upper hand in communications and children are being scared into believing what is not true.That is the global warning.However, this is not a warning people want to hear.Through some magic, Embry manages to get climate skeptic Dr. Ian Clark and climate activist Catherine Abreu in a room together, after Clark has had her visit the University of Ottawa’s accelerator mass spectrometry lab where the residency of carbon dioxide can be studied. Clark explains to her that based on his scientific review, carbon dioxide is not the control knob on climate, and it has a short residency of perhaps 4 years. Her eye roll says it all.Dr. Ian Clark – courtesy “Global Warning” producersI was shocked to see that activists like Abreu can get face-to-face meetings with Canada’s climate change negotiators, just prior to Canada’s team going into international negotiations.While we also see a scene with Cody Battershill and followers in an “I love Canadian Oil” rally for a pipeline, I am sure we will never see those working people face to face with Canada’s climate negotiators.When I met Mathew Embry to interview him for some short clips about the making of the film (posted below), I was struck by his statement that“ “Global Warning” is a ‘pro-human’ film“. Indeed, the film shows how so many lives are being affected by policies that are being promoted and enacted by people with no scientific or economic training; people who are acting on naïve ideological beliefs. These people are regularly interviewed in the media, while experts like Dr. Clark and Professor Vahrenholt? Well…no one has ever heard of them.Just like this film. No one ever heard of it because, as Mathew explained to me, despite getting lots of media attention over his other award-winning films, “Global Warning” received a media blackout. Energy geopolitics are changing and Canada is missing out on markets due to home grown climate activists.“Global Warning” has many more interesting perspectives than those I picked out here. As noted, it is beautifully shot, especially the pastoral scenes in Bonn, Germany at the UN COP25 climate conference, with the coal barges idly making their way up the Rhine River, into the heart of German industry.Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists, and AAAS.Media Blackout – Climate Conversation with Mathew EmbryClimate Activist Meets Climate SkepticIt’s a Pro-Human, Pro-Environment FilmVoice of Experience – Dr. Fritz VahrenholtShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Canadian charities', 'climate change', 'COP25', 'global warming', 'Tar Sands Campaign']",2020/11/10
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/10/israelis-and-arabs-united-even-in-oil/,,"Israelis and Arabs, united even in oil"," Israéliens et Arabes, unis même dans le pétrole: Une mauvaise nouvelle pour les raffineries européennes, une bonne pour l’Asie.Israelis and Arabs, united even in oil: Bad news for European refineries, good news for Asia.by Samuel Furfari – a Google translated version of the original French article in Atlantico, linked above, by permission of the authorRelations between Israel and the UAE create a new geopolitical situation in the field of energy. While their state of war was the consequence of the oil crises, today it is the opposite. An existing pipeline between Eilat and Ashkelon will be used to send refined products in the Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. This will reduce the price of petroleum products in the EU and add further difficulty to EU refineries. In the other direction, this behavior will allow the oil of Azerbaijan and later that of Turkey still to be produced in the Black Sea to reach Asia more easily. A new geopolitical energy balance is being forged in the absence of the EU.Samuel FurfariWhen peace sets in, everything changes. The EU’s tremendous historic success was based on the peace and reconciliation Robert Schuman wanted after the horrors of two world wars. Schuman had proposed that the energy of the time – coal – be the vehicle for this reconciliation. After years of a state of war, peace between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will deepen reconciliation through another energy – oil. In a recent column, I proposed that Lebanon seek peace with Israel in order to use its natural gas and end the unacceptable pollution of its electricity production from fuel oil. We are going to see in this forum that the Israeli-Arab reconciliation has surprising effects also in the field of energy geopolitics, thus strengthening security in the region, because energy integration is synonymous with security.We are witnessing an extraordinary turnaround in history. The oil crises of the 1970s were due to the will of some Arabs, notably Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, to demand that OECD countries abandon their support for Israel. They had manipulated OPEC by staging an oil shortage. Today, as we will see, Arabs and Israelis are working together to facilitate the global oil trade.When I visited the Israeli port of Eilat on the Red Sea four years ago, the oil unloading facilities and huge storage tanks certainly caught my attention. They had been installed during the time of Shah Reza Pahlévi, because Iran was then trading with Israel. Moreover, these installations found their justification in the oil supply difficulties that Israel suffered after the Six-Day War with Egypt in June 1967. Faced with its shutdown installations, I thought to myself that one day, when the mullahs’ regime is replaced, there will probably be Iranian ships coming back to dock to supply the Hebrew state again. Maybe one day it will happen, but so far it is something similar, but different, which has turned out to be unthinkable only a year ago.Under the cheerful gaze of the Trump administration, the two new friends have opened negotiations on a series of cooperation projects. This is also the case with oil. They will collaborate to transport oil and petroleum products between Eilat to Ashkelon on the Mediterranean coast through an existing pipeline. Europe Asia Pipeline Co (EAPC), a company controlled by the Israeli government, and MED-RED Land Bridge ltd have decided to contribute to this oil peace. The latter is a joint venture owned by Petromal, the UAE government holding company, Israeli firm AF Entrepreneurship, and Lubber Line, an international group active in energy infrastructure.EAPC kept the cycle of the old Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Co Ltd connection built in 1968 by the governments of Israel and Iran. Its aim was to transport 600,000 barrels per day over 254 km from Eilat and to have a storage capacity of 23 million barrels on the heights of Eilat. Since 2003, this pipeline can operate in reverse mode, supplying Eilat from the Mediterranean coast, thus strengthening security of supply. Two other pipelines supply refineries in Haifa (197 km) and Ashdod (36 km).Resolutely turning its back on the Palestinians, the UAE has just signed this agreement in an area that was among Israel’s most sensitive. The security of the oil supply is crucial, because breaking this security parameter would immediately put the country on hold and in danger. This is why the pipeline is under military control. The geopolitical weight of the project is measured by the presence at the signing of the memorandum by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and US envoy to the Middle East Avi Berkovitz. This is certainly a great victory for the Trump administration in this election period, even if the French-speaking press has hardly talked about it.This pipeline retains the same strengths it had in the Shah’s time: oil can flow from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, but after 50 years it is even more justified. Since the fall of Sovietism, oil in the Caspian Sea has flowed through the BTC (Baku – Tbilisi – Ceyhan) pipeline from Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean Sea at the Turkish port of Ceyhan. The news gives reason to its designers who had chosen a contorted route passing through Georgia in order to avoid Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. Thanks to this new UAE-Israel collaboration, oil from the landlocked area of the Caspian Sea will be able to flow to Asia. Originally, the BTC pipeline was intended to supply the countries of the former Soviet bloc of the EU via the port of Trieste. It was also supposed to be used to supply the United States, but since their production skyrocketed from shale oil they no longer need it. Of course, from Ceyhan there is always a way to reach Asia, but you have to go through the Suez Canal. What Israel and the UAE are preparing is a partial bypass of this maritime link at a lower cost, while saving a huge amount of time. The same logic applies if the announcement of the discovery of deposits in the Black Sea made last August Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is confirmed. We understand why the new name of the pipeline is Europe Asia Pipeline Co!Of course, if it remains with its current capacity, this pipeline is not intended to completely replace the Sumed pipeline (for Suez – Mediterranean) which avoids the passage through the Suez Canal to supertankers, by unloading at the Ain Sukhna terminal on the Gulf of Suez off Sidi Kerir, to end in Alexandria. The sizes of these pipelines are not comparable, as Sumed has a capacity of 2.5 million barrels per day. But this new collaboration can easily lead to capacity building and it would then be a serious competitor to the Sumed leadership and loss of revenue for Egypt.The companies leading the project have announced that it will transport refined petroleum products from the Persian Gulf (which Arabs proudly call the Arabian Gulf) to the Mediterranean Sea, possibly bound for the EU. The refining industry in the EU suffers from stringent legislative measures, dilapidated facilities, as well as higher crude prices. Consequently, the profession of refiner is less and less profitable, which explains the successive closures of refineries which nevertheless create added value. Now that the Arab countries have equipped themselves with modern refineries, their petroleum products compete with those produced in the EU. If in addition you eliminate the costs of transport through the Suez Canal, the advantage increases. The indirect consequence of this peace between Israel and the UAE is an additional threat to the highly skilled employment of the European refining industry. From an importer of oil, the EU is in the process of converting itself into an importer of petroleum products which have higher added value and therefore more expensive to purchase.Clearly, European diplomacy continues to be marginalized in the Middle East. The United States, Israel and the Gulf States are developing their geopolitics – and now their geopolitics of energy – regardless of the EU. With the latter now thinking only of decarbonising, it lets economic and diplomatic opportunities slip away, because whether it likes it or not, oil will remain essential for a long time to come. Not about to be replaced by biofuels or hydrogen – “hydrogen utopia” is the title of my latest book – the real issues of the world are woven elsewhere. It is to be feared that the EU remains trapped and alone in the mat it has woven for itself.About the AuthorDoctor of applied sciences and engineer, Samuele Furfari has been teaching energy geopolitics at the Free University of Brussels since 2003.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/11/10/free-science-is-here-and-growing-fast/,,Free science is here and growing fast," By David WojickMost of my readers are interested in science. Many of my blog articles are scientific and these are often followed by lengthy technical discussions in the comments. Some of my scientific articles have had thousands of comments; one article was over 5,000 when comments were closed. And there are many other blogs like this.Thanks to the miracle of online commenting the discussion of science, especially related to policy, is now a major popular pastime.The good news is that the scientific community is responding big time to this extensive popular interest. We are in the midst of a huge wave of activities designed to make the latest science available to everyone who is interested in it, free of charge.Here are just a few great examples:Open access (OA). This term refers to various ways to make journal articles freely available. This is a serious challenge because journals have mostly been paid for via expensive subscriptions, usually by rich university libraries. Total cost is estimated at over ten billion dollars a year. People with no connection to a major school have no access to the journals, which publish well over two million technical articles a year.The most common form of open access is the author pays model, called Gold OA. The author, actually typically the research grant, pays the cost of publication so the article is free to all. There are now many OA journals, as they are called, funded entirely by author pays. Some are huge, called mega journals, publishing tens of thousands of free articles a year. In addition, many subscription journals offer their authors an OA option, for a price.Repositories for articles. Many universities host what is called a repository, where their faculty deposits their published journal articles, which are then freely available to all. If the article is in a subscription journal there is typically a waiting period before it becomes open, usually 12 months from the date of publication. This is called Green OA.By far the biggest system of repositories is hosted by the US Government, under the Public Access Program. Every journal article that flows from federal funding, in whole or just in part, must be deposited by the author. If it is OA then it becomes freely available immediately; if subscription then after 12 months. This includes well over 100,000 articles a year. I helped develop this program. There are also subject matter repositories.Given the huge number of published articles it can be challenging to find the right stuff. By far the best free service for doing this is Google Scholar. It provides full text search for millions of articles in tens of thousands of journals, often going back 60 years or more. There is a powerful advanced search window that supports all sorts of specialized searches. Click on the three horizontal bars in the upper right to get the window. Repository copies are often listed and unlike Google the number of hits listed is real information about how much research has been done,Preprint servers. Here authors post their draft articles before submitting them to a journal. Given that it can take years to get published this is a good place to find the latest science. I recently did an article based on a preprint. Most journals allow preprints and some even use these servers for article submission. In some cases the preprints are never submitted, making them another form of communication. A great many new preprint servers have recently been created. To my knowledge there is as yet no combined search service for these proliferating servers.Speaking of other forms than the journal article, some federal agencies publish the final report from their funded research projects. These reports tend to be much longer than journal articles, often ten times longer, so they contain a wealth of information. Many of these reports can be found using the Science.gov portal, which I also worked on.In turn, Science.gov is part of a global science search system that includes many national systems, called WorldWideScience.org. This global system features a unique translation algorithm that searches repositories in other languages. I helped develop the WWS.org system and the translation feature was my idea. It searches hundreds of millions of pages of science and engineering.In short there are a huge number of science and engineering research results that are freely available to the world with more coming on. Finding just what you need can be time consuming but a lot of people are working on that as well.A grand revolution in scientific communication is upon us. Go for it.Adapted from: https://www.cfact.org/2020/11/09/free-science-is-here-and-growing-fast/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2020/11/10
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/28/money-for-nothing-ev-buses/,Andrew Roman ,Money For Nothing – EV Buses," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced the Canadian Infrastructure Bank’s (CIB) new plan to “invest” $10 billion, allegedly to “create jobs and strengthen economic growth”. This plan, he said, would create 60,000 jobs across Canada.According to the backgrounder that accompanied the Prime Minister’s announcement, the bank’s spending will “accelerate adoption of modern zero-emission bus fleets and reduce greenhouse gases and operating costs over the long term.”“Financing challenges often limit the development and expansion of clean transit systems. The CIB will address financial barriers faced by bus owners, such as transit authorities, municipalities or school bus operators due to high up-front capital costs of zero-emission buses (ZEBs) and associated charging infrastructure.”The government’s goal is to have 5,000 zero-emission school and transit buses in Canada over the next five years.As a generalization, it is difficult to imagine a more wasteful or cost-ineffective way for the federal government to spend money on trying to reduce emissions.The announcement did not provide any estimate of how much money will be given to subsidize each transit or school bus or to pay for the costs of recharging stations. It also offered no estimate of the quantity of emissions that would be reduced.According to Statistics Canada, there are about 67,000 motor coaches, school buses and transit buses in Canada, and they consume 784.6 million litres of diesel fuel per year. That equates to about 2.1 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Canada produced 728 Mt of emissions in 2018. Switching from diesel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles would, according to studies by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), reduce net bus emissions by about one third. So, the actual net reduction in emissions if Canada replaced its entire fleet of diesel buses with electric buses would be 0.7 Mt, or about one one-thousandth of Canada’s emissions. Converting just 5,000 buses would reduce fuel consumption by 19.3 million litres, or 0.16 Mt. The cost per megatonne of emissions avoided is hundreds of times higher than any other measure yet considered.That is just the beginning of the bad news about this particular plan. The Trudeau government may not have noticed, but the management and operation of transit systems and other bus services are usually the responsibility of local governments, and local governments fall within the jurisdictions of the provinces under Canada’s constitution. Surely the judgment as to how to spend funds on transit should be left to the responsible governments.The underlying presumption appears to be that there is a compelling need to further subsidize the ways that Canadians commute to and from work. Yet, according to Statistics Canada, 80 per cent of Canadians commute by car, even in the largest cities. The effect of the coronavirus has been to reduce further the number of people who want to travel in crowded transit vehicles and, it strongly appears, to initiate a substantial, possibly permanent, shift of working patterns to more stay-at-home. Investing a billion and a half dollars to reducing emissions from transit is a completely misdirected expenditure.Nowhere in the world do electric vehicles operate without extremely large government subsidies. The typical ZEB costs $1.2 million or more, three to four times the cost of new diesel powered buses. In some of the cities where electric buses have been introduced as experiments, like Belo Horizonte, Brazil, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, they have had serious operational problems getting up hills with full passenger loads. They get typically around 225 miles per charge in warm weather. One can only imagine how many charges they would need in Canadian winter weather conditions, how broadly dispersed the recharging stations will need to be, or what will be the infrastructure problems associated with locating the recharging stations. The charging stations are expensive – about U.S. $50,000 for a standard depot-based one and two to three times that for longer bus routes, not counting construction costs.Many of the studies that have been done of the economic viability of electric bus systems assume that the large subsidies currently in place in many countries will continue indefinitely and that there will be major continuing declines in the cost of batteries and recharging systems, so that by the latter part of this decade electric buses will be competitive with diesel-powered alternatives. If that really were true, one wonders by which rationale one would rush ahead now to buy non-economic vehicles that have little or no environmental benefit. Why not, instead, wait a few years?Someone should ask Trudeau.About the AuthorRobert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/28/the-hydrogen-illusion-new-book-by-samuel-furfari/,Peter F Gill ,The Hydrogen Illusion -New Book by Samuel Furfari," These are the explanatory notes from the Amazon Kindle page, copied with permission of Professor Furfari. In June 2020, Germany announced its ‘Hydrogen Strategy’. A few weeks later, the European Commission followed up and launched its own. This turned out to be nothing more than a copy-paste of that EU Member State document, Germany being a leader in the energy transition field. Since the money for the recovery plan is freely available, all professional subsidy hunters are rubbing their hands, as it allows them to grab some of the financial windfall for their own benefit, but at the expense of future generations. Professor Samuel FurfariHaving spent my whole work career in the field of energy and pollution reduction–among which 36 exciting years at the European Commission–I was quite disappointed that my former employer suddenly decided to discard its officials’ and European researchers’ 50 years’ experience and know-how and have embarked on a dead-end road, just because it is politically correct, trendy and there is money to spend. Sound public policy should be scientifically correct, effective, well thought-out and mindful of public funds. It goes without saying that the public opinion will give a hearty welcome to this attractive solution, through which the EU hopes to enhance its negative aura. While some of my energy-science-fiction-loving friends told me about their enthusiasm at the news, my old energy colleagues from the European Commission could not refrain sharing their disappointment with me. This is the reason why I have decided to put down on paper what I have learned during my professional career. I would like to show what a strategic mistake it is to call the so-called hydrogen policy a ‘strategy’. This book begins with an explanation of how, through sheer ignorance of science and more particularly chemistry, we hear and read about anything and everything on energy nowadays. I am giving my credentials as a chemical engineer, an ex-senior official at the European Commission and a university professor in the first chapter to show my seriousness and justify that ‘I know what I am talking about’. As it happens, I too believed in the hydrogen illusion until the harsh reality of chemistry–as the numerous experiments and research projects financed by the European Commission and others have shown–reminded me that it was a dead end. Three chapters explain in a simple but rigorous manner what hydrogen is, how it is produced, and why it is increasingly used around the world. This basic product of the industrial chemistry is essential in so many aspects of our daily lives. Technical explanations and chemical formulas, intended for the advanced reader, are placed in footnotes to avoid confusing the reader. No specific knowledge of science is required to read further. The central part explains precisely why all the dreams about hydrogen and other policies, such as biofuels, decided upon by policy-makers who deliberately choose to ignore science, are doomed to failure. And yet some of the high-ranking politicians have been scientists … one can only conclude that the power of politics prevails over science. We will show that the use of hydrogen to store and then produce electricity, but also as a fuel, will not happen for so obvious economic and safety reasons that it is astounding to see European government leaders being dragged into such a bizarre ‘strategy’. But why on earth don’t administrations warn their decision makers or why aren’t them listened to? We will see that this illusion is, above all, a mistake used to cover up a previous mistake on intermittent renewable energies. Throughout this book, the failures of experiences will illustrate in a concrete and referenced way the points discussed. The conclusion is obvious to me: this costly political mistake, which is all the easier to make as those responsible will no longer be in charge when time comes, is certain to fail.Available in English and French.https://www.amazon.com/hydrogen-illusion-Samuel-Furfari-ebook/dp/B08KQ58NYH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=WEBTHCRT022S&dchild=1&keywords=samuel+furfari+hydrogen&qid=1603912092&sprefix=jane+fonda+what+c%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-1 https://www.amazon.ca/Lutopie-hydrog%C3%A8ne-French-Samuel-Furfari-ebook/dp/B08GJ9ZBXH/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=samuel+furfari&qid=1603913322&sr=8-2Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2020/10/28
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/23/slate-climate-crusade-against-the-public-good/,Colleen Martin ,SLATE – Climate Crusade Against the Public Good," There was a story about us in SLATE recently. Some people say that dissenting views on climate change or the ‘climate crisis’ are not legitimate because they never appear in the mainstream press. Few people understand the lock-out mentality of journalists and publishers. Here’s a recent example.On Oct. 1, 2020, we got a press request about various tweets of ours that challenged the claims of climate change as the driver of the California and Oregon wildfires. The journo said she was a freelance science writer doing an article for SLATE…Her bio showed she had written for many prestigious magazines.So, we optimistically sent along a plethora of scientific information on wildfires to the science writer journalist, and boldly included a plea that she also push SLATE to use its media platform for the public good.Here’s our email to her. You can compare the information that we sent to the science journalist in the email below, with what was published in the article in SLATE.Hi ,Thanks for your email, sorry for the delayed response – your message had bounced into spam.1) RE: WildfiresHuman-wildland interface and humans are the largest source of wildfire starts – whether negligence, accident, intention or power lines sparking branches (i.e. human infrastructure being the cause of the start of the wildfire). Thanks for letting us know the ScarsdaleAntifa tweet was suspended and for sending along that Politifact story.As shown in the chart here, humans are a larger cause of wildfires in Oregon than lightning. (also attached as a png).https://www.oregon.gov/odf/Documents/fire/odf-century-fire-history-chart.pdfRegarding the map in the tweet showing that wildfires ‘stopped’ at the border, Canada had a very LOW wildfire season this year, mostly due to climatic conditions and, ironically, the COVID lockdowns. Hundreds of wildfires in BC and Alberta in recent years have been started by humans. The Slave Lake wildfire of 2011 in Alberta was arson. This year it was very quiet.https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2020/09/27/canada-wildfires-at-lowest-level-for-years/Attached are two fire risk maps for you to compare – one being that of Sept 2019 and that of May 5, 2016 when the Fort McMurray wildfire took off. These fire risk dangers sometimes fluctuate on a daily basis. You can see the live and historical maps here: https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/maps/fwThis was May 05, 2016 when the Fort McMurray wildfire took off.This is May 27, 2019 – quite a different scene.2) RE: Tweets critical of California Governor Gavin Newsom or others on the role of climate change in the US West Coast FiresWe work closely with forestry experts on these matters. It is a shame that billions of dollars are being diverted to chase the carbon dioxide molecule and climate change, when real, practical mitigations could better protect people in these extreme wildfire risk areas. California is a desertified area and as described in “The Great Warming” by Brian Fagan (commenting on the work of Scott Stines), has been subject to 100 and 200 year droughts. Attached a screenshot and peer-reviewed paper from Stephens work on prehistoric wildfires in the California region.Stephens-et-al.-CA-fire-area-FEM-2007DownloadTake note of what Stephens et al states in their abstract:“The idea that US wildfire area of approximately two million ha annually is extreme is certainly a 20th or 21st century perspective. Skies were likely smoky much of the summer and fall in California during the prehistoric period. Increasing the spatial extent of fire in California is an important management objective. The best methods to significantly increase the area burned is to increase the use of wildland fire use (WFU) and appropriate management response (AMR) suppression fire in remote areas. Political support for increased use of WFU and AMR needs to occur at local, state, and federal levels because increasing the spatial scale of fire will increase smoke and inevitability, a few WFU or AMR fires will escape their predefined boundaries.”Seems that wildfire is a seasonal norm in California – people are now at risk for not recognizing that this is a fact of life there as is winter snow in New York City.a) Mason et al (2006) discusses the cost-benefit of managing forest fuel loads to reduce the magnitude and threat of wildfire (screenshot and peer reviewed paper attached)Mason_etal_2006DownloadFrom Mason et al (2006) b) About 90% of wildfires in California are started by humans.From our wildfire/forestry expert:What happens after a warm, wet winter in California? You get a huge explosion of herbaceous vegetation. Vegetation that cures quickly and remains standing.This results in fuel loads that are triple for these sites – remember that fire intensity is proportional to the amount of fuel and that the head fire intensity (heat) is a function of the fourth power of biomass..What is even worse is that this fuel remains standing cured – this is known as cribbing. Cribbing creates an air-rich fuel bed that is prone to high probability of ignition and extremely rapid, such as 3 meter tall mustard. (see attached screenshot of person hiking through same).Standing dry vegetation in California.A spark that lights a fire when the Santa Ana winds blow will send ember storms miles and miles away.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-wildfires-cause-wasp-nest-ranch-glenn-kile-investigation-a8954741.htmlc) This very sad editorial on the Camp Fire from the Enterprise-Record shows that people living in extreme fire risk areas are often aware of the risk and do not mobilize their communities or county/state legislature to address it.https://www.chicoer.com/2018/11/17/editorial-camp-fire-the-tragedy-we-were-all-warned-about/?fbclid=IwAR0FN2gbQHofavnd4bggoiVa2MSWyvV3kbiDnlWEoX8exiCwN6msOFJ1cxgd) Attached is the map from CalFire of Extreme Fire Risk areas. Due to high housing prices and urban chaos (i.e. homelessness) many people are moving into these extreme high risk areas – but there is no simple 911 call there for wildfires. Also attached is a Google maps photo of Paradise ‘before’. There you can see that CalFire’s minimum 100 ft guidelines on clearing trees from houses and power lines (screenshot attached) were sadly not being observed.CalFire map of Fire Severity Risk AreasParadise, CA – before CampFire (Source: Google maps)e) It would be worthwhile if the influential SLATE would help people protect themselves, their property and neighbours by promoting the information provided by National Fire Protection Association: https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Wildfire/Wildfire-safety-tips and FIREWISE: https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Wildfire/Firewise-USAf) Both Facebook and Poynter Institute have blocked information about the role of fuel load and human negligence/arson in Australian wildfires (which parallel the causes in California). This puts people more at risk as there is clear evidence that both fuel load and human elements can be mitigated and the public should know that, rather than being terrified about climate change when other practical things can be done to prevent/mitigate wildfires.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/01/13/an-open-letter-to-poynter-institute-and-facebook-fuel-and-poor-forest-management-is-the-main-factor-in-australian-wildfires-not-human-caused-climate-change/g) Video: https://youtu.be/wP1AH-jGlO43) Qanon retweets – as with any random account, we sometimes retweet things we think might interest our followers. We also retweet cartoons.4) Friends of Science has about 800 member/subscribers (not corporations). We are a non-profit society that runs on volunteer power and a handful of contracted services. (Non-profits in Canada are not allowed to issue tax receipts, so we are not tax subsidized like the big ENGOs). Our budget is about $150K/yr from our member/subscribers and their donations. Average donation is less than $500.RE: Fossil-fuel funding claims: In 2015, Ecojustice launched an inquiry into Friends of Science Society’s funding via the Competition Bureau of Canada on behalf of six high profile climate activists. They alleged that we were a proxy for the fossil fuel industries and that we had ‘deep pockets’ behind us and ran coordinated campaigns with other groups. The Competition Bureau has the most sweeping powers of investigation in Canada. They did not find such evidence.5) You can compare who has the big money and influence, and who is funding them, in this report. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-2.pdfAlso worth looking at Nisbet’s work:https://web.northeastern.edu/matthewnisbet/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Nisbet2018_ClimatePhilanthropy_WIREsClimateChange_Final.pdfHope that answers your questions.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/16/unmapped-territory-the-strategic-assessment-of-climate-change/,Andrew Roman ,Unmapped Territory: The Strategic Assessment of Climate Change," Executive SummaryThe federal government recently published its revised requirements for project sponsors related to the consideration of climate change issues when the sponsors of designated projects undergo environmental assessment. Under the new Impact Assessment Act, each project on the designated project list must undergo first a review in principle to ensure its compliance with the federal government’s climate policy framework and indigenous reconciliation goals before undergoing a more traditional project review that examines the specific local environmental impacts. The actual reviews are to be carried out either by the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (IAAC) or the “lifecycle regulators” such as the Canada Energy Regulator (the successor to the National Energy Board), the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Offshore Petroleum Boards.The project list includes the construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of many kinds of projects in the energy, mining, and transportation industries. The same review process requirements can potentially apply to an oil pipeline, a diamond mine, a new powerplant, an airport or a railway, or significant additions to any of these.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/THE-STRATEGIC-ASSESSMENT-OF-CLIMATE-CHANGE-FINAL-Oct-16-2020.pdfTHE-STRATEGIC-ASSESSMENT-OF-CLIMATE-CHANGE-FINAL-Oct-16-2020DownloadThe regulations demand not only that a proponent identify the carbon-dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions directly associated with the construction and operation of the project, but impose additional emission-related information requirements related to upstream emissions, downstream emissions, “net emissions”, acquired energy GHG emissions, carbon dioxide captured and stored, avoided domestic GHG emissions, and offset credits.The legislation approved by Parliament set no specific GHG emission targets for Canada. The Trudeau government, however, has superimposed on the legislative requirements additional ones that derive from its political objective that Canada meet a “net zero emissions goal” by 2050. Further, the government has interpreted this goal to mean that every new or expanded project must itself adhere to a net zero emissions goal.Surprisingly, given their potential impact on projects in a wide range of economic sectors, the new regulations have received almost no news coverage or commentary by think tanks and other expert sources in Canada.There are four main problems with the regulations.First, the federal government expects firms to devise a “credible plan” to achieve net-zero emissions when the government has not released details of its own plan or even a cost-benefit analysis demonstrating how reaching this target would be in the best interests of Canadians. In the process, the federal government is obliging companies to commit to things they cannot possibly predict, such as technological breakthroughs and changes in input costs.Second, the new requirements will substantially increase regulatory compliance costs as firms must now calculate emissions-related information at every stage of the application process. This will add considerably to the number and range of consultants and lawyers that firms will have to hire at a time when the affected industries are already reeling from changes in market conditions and government-imposed shutdowns.Third, the regulations add more to uncertainty, the great investment-killer.Finally, the wide range of projects covered by the regulations (including, for example, the addition of a runway at an airport) will expose many investments to burdensome regulatory scrutiny and increased vulnerability to cancellation due to the opposition of public-funded and politically-inspired environmental and Indigenous groups. For those projects that make it through the impact assessment gauntlet, their costs will be sharply raised, and they will have to pass these on to their customers in other industries and ultimately to the Canadian consumer. This will have large but difficult-to-estimate effects on the competitiveness of Canadians firms.Federal and provincial governments in Canada have already implemented 237 different GHG emission-reduction measures. Some include carbon dioxide pricing (i.e. taxes, emissions trading systems, and output-based pricing systems). The federal government is now layering on to these the costs of the Clean Fuel Standard. It has imposed many restraints on the construction of new oil and gas pipelines, and increasingly discouraged investments in the hydrocarbons industries in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador. It has politicized the pipeline project review process so that it is no longer guided by objective, expert assessments of the public interest. The new Impact Assessment regulations convert the impact assessment process into an onerous and blunt instrument for discouraging any new economic project that causes GHG emissions to rise.Applying such a standard would constrain almost all economic activity and job creation in Canada, contrary to what the government claims are its objectives.About the AuthorRobert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

No Ecojustice in court against you for the umpteenth time, funded by foreign sources, anxious to ‘keep it in the ground’ after they have flown in to appear in court. No West Coast Environmental Law showing up at your AGM to threaten you and your shareholders with legal risks, after your company had followed the prescribed regulations and gained legal approval.For many corporations, it must be blissful to leave Canada and leave all this behind. And they will go and take their emissions with them.But millions of other business people, professionals, and entrepreneurs want to press on, want to live in Canada, want to thrive here, and want to understand how things got so broken that now they are being cowed into silence and coerced into a ‘climate’ COVID recovery, complete with a proposed Universal Basic Income, instead of a rational return to normalcy, where most people earn their living with dignity and respect, happy to do a hard day’s work for fair pay.This report takes a critical look at the Climate-COVID recovery proposals by some of the big green activist groups and finds that little due diligence has been done on any of them.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Penury-or-Prosperity-Part-1-Geopolitical-Context-Oct-11-2020-FINAL.pdfPenury-or-Prosperity-Part-1-Geopolitical-Context-Oct-11-2020-FINALDownloadThis report deconstructs the claim of a climate emergency and finds it to be a front for various transnational corporate and institutional investor interests.This report shows that Bjorn Lomborg’s view that climate emergency is a FALSE ALARM is true, and that billions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted and are being wasted on hidden subsidies to Big Green cronies with undue influence.This report does not argue the climate science case as Friends of Science Society might normally do. Instead, we point out that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change long ago stated that it is not possible to predict the long-term state of the climate.So, it is time that we stopped the charade. The environmental groups crying climate catastrophe at every end and turn, using it to raise money for their causes, to scare the public, to frighten children, to drive off investors, are therefore misrepresenting the facts and violating the principles of the Charities Directorate Policies. They have ceased to provide a net benefit to the public long ago. If the WE Charity scandal shook Canadians, the Conflicts of Interest inherent in these groups, their relationships and their undue influence should enrage every hard-working Canadian taxpayer – more so since their Climate/COVID demands would endanger the future of Canada and turn us into indentured carbon serfs for decades.There is no climate emergency. Canada can no longer be controlled by foreign-funded green activists operating with tax-subsidized charitable funds and government grants.Like a powerful tree, the roots of our prosperity are in the natural riches of this nation, let us grow these existing branches of trade and commerce to return to normal and restore our prosperity. Let us go right and not left.Look at the evidence for yourself. We must quit Paris and Save Canada.Excerpt of Prof. Samuele Furfari’s classes on energy geopolitics.Part 2“Bridge to the Future” with Five Bold Moves or Financial Folly?On September 16, 2020, the Task Force for Resilient Recovery issued a report entitled “Bridge to the Future” which proposed “5 Bold Moves” to stimulate the economy. The Task Force frames itself as: “The Task Force for a Resilient Recovery is an independent group of Canadian finance, policy and sustainability leaders determined to make sure Canada seizes this opportunity.” One week later, the Speech from the Throne closely echoed the “5 Bold Moves”. No due diligence appeared to have been done in either the report or for the Speech from the Throne. Though the Task Force claims to be ‘independent’, one of the participants is Gerald Butts, who has a new position as a Vice Chairman and strategic advisor to Eurasia group, and whose profile makes it clear that he is an influential person in Canadian politics. He operates in many spheres of commercial interest according to his bio.https://www.eurasiagroup.net/people/gbuttsThe question becomes, how independent is this advice, and who will benefit? Why is there no due diligence on the cost-benefit or effectiveness of the proposals, which now appear to have been abruptly adopted as federal policy?https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Penury-or-Prosperity-Part-2-Critical-Review-Bridge-to-the-Future-Oct-11-2020-Final.pdfPenury-or-Prosperity-Part-2-Critical-Review-Bridge-to-the-Future-Oct-11-2020-FinalDownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Canadian charities', 'climate change', 'GHG reduction targets', 'NetZero2050']",2020/10/11
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/10/a-canadian-review-of-the-u-s-democratic-party-2020-platform/,Andrew Roman ,A Canadian Review of The U.S. Democratic Party 2020 Platform," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020[Friends of Science editor’s note: The USA is Canada’s largest trading partner and Republican President Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Thus, it is of interest to Friends of Science Society readers to understand events and proposed policies south of the border.]I rarely comment on the politics of foreign countries, but like many other Canadians I have been struck by the intensity of the presidential election campaign taking place in the United States. Much of the intensity, and apparent ill will, derives from the perceived personality and ethical qualities of the candidates This often seems to crowd out discussion about the comparative merits of the platforms on which each is running.A political party’s platform is the only place that the voter can go to obtain a relatively comprehensive statement of what it would do if granted power by the electorate. A platform is not a guarantee of what will be done, as a party once in office may find itself constrained by all sorts of forces and constitutional arrangements. A platform sometimes may be deliberately vague, and leave out factors to which the party prefers to avoid drawing attention. It is, however, a set of promises about what the party will try to do, and whether it likes it or not, the legitimate standard against which the public can justifiably assess its subsequent performance. In a properly functioning democratic society, in other words, it is not something to be ignored or belittled.During the recently televised debate between the candidates, the moderators asked questions about whether a Democratic Party Administration would implement a “Green New Deal”. During the campaigning for the Democratic Party leadership, different versions of a Green New Deal were endorsed by the candidates. Some of these included not just a profound reorientation of United States energy and environmental policies but also extremely ambitious promises with respect to tax reform, health, education, immigration and social welfare policies and spending. Some of these policies could have significant impacts on Canada.Joe Biden, the Presidential candidate, subsequently tried to distance himself from the term “Green New Deal”, leaving the U.S. public and foreign observers like those of us in Canada to wonder what is really at stake. In a search for clarity, I went to the final text of the Democratic Party’s platform approved in August, 2020, and I selected from it the items that, in my view, may have a very large impact on the U.S. economy and/or public finances. The highlights are summarized in the following four-page document. In it, I have generally stayed as close as possible to the text of the platform, adding notes where I thought it useful to explain why the matter may have important economic or financial implications.Based on this review, I would make four general observations.The public debate about whether or not Joe Biden supports the “Green New Deal” is a rhetorical distraction. As is obvious from the text of the platform, the Democrats are committed to making “climate change” the centre of US public policy. They have embraced goals that will dramatically increase the cost of energy services while reducing their supply and reliability. These goals are unrealistic, extremely expensive and probably unattainable. Moreover, they rest on mistaken premises about what the rest of the world will do to transform its energy use.The platform foresees a vast expansion of publicly-funded services in the health, education and welfare fields. The underlying premise appears to be that there are no limits to the extent to which the U.S. federal taxpayer should pay for increased services to all who are deemed to be disadvantaged in some way.The platform promises an open-doors policy for both legal and illegal immigrants, including extending the benefits of the much-enriched social services regime to them.Finally, and perhaps most important, the platform makes no reference to, or takes any account of, the financial and economic costs of delivering on the platform. There is no doubt in my mind that the costs of the climate policies alone would run into the many trillions of dollars. The result would almost certainly harm the prospects for new infrastructure for the production and transportation of hydrocarbons.There are, interestingly, only the vaguest references to taxes. The message should be very clear between the lines: if the Democratic Party wins the U.S. national elections, taxes there are going up – a lot.THE 2020 U.S DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM        COMMITMENTS WITH MAJOR ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL IMPACTSIntroductionOn August 18, 2020, the Democratic National Convention approved a platform recommended by the party’s Platform Committee. The platform is over 90 pages long and much of it is a series of statements concerning the values and objectives of the party. There are, however, several places where the document states fairly clearly the party’s intentions to take actions that could reasonably be defined as “commitments”. I have read through the document to identify the commitments that appear, on the surface at least, to have significant economic and/or financial implications.The platform does not contain any estimate of what these commitments will cost, either in financial or economic terms. In summarizing them, I will simplify the language used, but provide a reference to the page number so that anyone interested can see for himself or herself the precise wording of the commitment.The following summary follows the same organization of headings as is found in the platform itself.Building a Stronger, Fairer EconomyA Democratic Party Administration will:• Ensure workers are guaranteed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers and family units to recover from childbirth or child adoption. (page 16)• Enact universal, high-quality pre-K programs for three- and four-year-old’s. (page 16)• Install 500,000 public charging stations for electric vehicles.

(page 21)• Raise corporate taxes (by which amount is not specified). (page 22)• Raise estate taxes back to the historical norm (prior to 2018, the estate tax exemption was $5.5 million; the Trump Administration raised the exemption to $11.1 million). (page 22)Achieving Universal Affordable Health CareA Democratic Administration will:• Incentivize states to expand Medicaid and enroll low-income people who do not otherwise have health insurance in a new, high-quality public option, without premiums. (page 24)Reforming the Criminal Justice SystemA Democratic Administration will:• Repeal federal mandatory minimum sentences, incentivize states to do the same, and make all sentencing reductions retroactive so a judge can reconsider past cases where their hands were tied. (page 38)• End the use of private prisons and private detention centers. (page 38)Healing the Soul of AmericaA Democratic Administration will:• Empower local governments to combat gentrification trends that disproportionately harm long-term residents of colour, and create a Community Restoration Fund “to repair the toxic legacy of historic investments in transportation that were designed to enforce racial segregation”. (page 40)• Outlaw discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in housing, public accommodations, access to credit, education, jury service, and federal programs. (page 42)Climate Change and Environmental JusticeA Democratic Administration will:• Rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. (page 50)• “Restore protections” (i.e. reimpose restrictions on energy development) on federal lands and waters. (page 50)• Seek to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions “as soon as possible”. (page 51)• Commit to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants (i.e. shut down all existing coal, oil and natural gas-fired power plants) by 2035. (page 51)• Dramatically expand solar and wind energy deployment through community-based and utility-scale systems, including in rural areas. (page 51)• Within five years, install 500 million solar panels, including eight million solar roofs and community solar energy systems, and 60,000 wind turbines. (page 51)• Invest in interstate transmission projects and grid technologies to link solar and wind power to rural communities. (page 51)• Pay for energy-saving upgrades to up to two million low-income households and public housing units within five years. (page 51)• Set a national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030. (page 51)• Accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the United States. (page 52)• Transition the entire fleet of 500,000 school buses to zero-emission alternatives within five years (such vehicles cost four to five times as much as diesel-powered school buses). (page 52)• Partner with state and local governments to install at least 500,000 public charging stations for electric vehicles within five years (such stations cost at least $2,000 and up to $20,000 each). (page 52)• Apply a carbon adjustment fee at the border to products from countries that “fail to live up to their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement”). Page 52• Plant millions of trees.(page 53)A 21st Century Immigration System(Note: Immigration policies have different, often controversial, impacts on national economies and on domestic security. The economic consequences of the following commitments are thus subject to debate,)A Democratic Administration will:• Immediately terminate discriminatory travel and immigration bans that disproportionately impact Muslim, Arab and African people, and invite those whose visas have been denied to reapply to come to the United States. (page 61)• Support legislation to ensure that no president can enact discriminatory bans ever again. (page 61)• End prosecution of asylum seekers at the border and policies that force them to apply from safe third countries. (page 62)• End workplace and community raids and protect sensitive locations like schools, health care facilities, benefits offices and DMVs from immigration enforcement actions. (page 63)Providing a World-Class EducationA Democratic Administration will:• Support K-12 instruction in civics and climate literacy. (page 65)• Work with states to offer pre-K for all three- and four-year-old’s. (page 65)• Make child care and dependent tax credits significantly more generous and increase funding to states to guarantee that low-income and middle-class families can afford child care. (page 66)• Triple Title I funding, which benefits schools that serve low-income students.

(page 66)• Ban for-profit private charter schools from receiving public funding. Page 67)• Oppose private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from the public school system. (page 67)• Make public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose families make less than $125,000 – roughly 80 percent of the American people. (page 69)• Make community colleges and trade schools tuition-free for all students, including Dreamers. (page 69)• Increase federal support for child care on college campuses and for wraparound services, including covering the cost of textbooks and fees for low-income students and establishing programs to address campus food insecurity. (page 69)• Work to authorize up to $10,000 in student debt relief per borrower to deal with the Covid-19 situation. (page 70)• Work to pause monthly billing and stop interest from accruing on federal student loans for people earning less that $25,000, and cap payments at no more than 5% of discretionary income for those earning less than $25,000. (page 70)• Automatically forgive without tax liability remaining federal student loan debt after 25 years. (page 70)• Support forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student loan debt. (page 70)Revitalizing American DiplomacyA Democratic Administration will:• Fully integrate climate change into U.S. foreign policy and national security strategies. (page 79)• Immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. (page 79)• Restore funding to the Global Environment Facility and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. (page 80) (Note: This presumably includes resuming contributions to the global Green Climate Fund, which would entail about $33 billion per year in U.S, payments)About the Author: Robert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/10/unwanted-truths-on-climate-unerwunschte-wahrheiten/,Philip Mulholland ,Unwanted Truths on Climate – Unerwünschte Wahrheiten," There is no climate crisisUnerwünschte Wahrheiten Authors: Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning (Germany).Dutch Translation: Martien de Wit. (the following is a Google translation from the Dutch to English)The judgment about CO2 and the industry associated with it has long been passed: “harmful, dangerous, must stop ”.It is always surprising that people seem to forget that CO2 is the building material of life and that despite all the possible negative effects, food yields, such as wheat and rice, have increased by about 15% due to the increased CO2. Who can tell the students of ‘ Fridays for Future ‘ that without the increase in CO2, we would certainly have had too little food to feed the world? Just 15% less rice, wheat and soy would be unbearable for the world’s population in the long run. None of this causes CO2, or releases it to us humans who, in 150 years, have dramatically improved the living conditions for all people on Earth by developing an industrial society. A society that also has the CO2 concentrationboosted from 0.018%. up to 0.041%. What we don’t know with enough accuracy is how much this and further increase will change the climate .Unwanted truths The judgment about CO2 and the industry associated with it has already been made harmful and dangerous must stop.Sebastian Lüning.Sebastien LüningThere is no doubt that in the course of this century the global community will have to respond and reduce CO2 emissions. However, the primitive climate models should not be used as a basis for this. In these models, a 50% higher temperature rise is calculated compared to reality. That means that we have twice as much time. Not in 2050, but in 2100 we will have to say goodbye to a large part of fossil fuels.In any case, low-carbon technologies must be developed. Germany plays a bad role in this. Everything that could satisfy the global hunger for renewable energy, besides wind and solar energy, is not taking place. Every year the Greens submit a motion in the Committee on Budgets to end funding for nuclear fusion research, research into inherently safe nuclear power plants in Germany is banned, fossil power plants with CO2 separation (CCS) are also banned.After the destruction of the German auto industry, the goal is to replace carbon in industry, steel mills, cement mills and refineries as well. Anyone who to look around, see what W e could still do without petrochemicals. So without medicines, without CDs, without mobile phones or telephone screens, without cable sheaths, cosmetics, paint, synthetic fibers, adhesives, detergents and cleaning agents. Substances we depend on every day.Electricity demand in Germany would more than triple. And this must be met through the insane plan to meet our energy and hydrocarbon needs solely through the use of nature-destroying wind power plants and inefficient solar roofs in Germany. It would therefore be extremely foolish to go down this path and rule out other options a priori .If the climate response to CO2 at a climate sensitivity (the warming when the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere doubles) is about 1.5 ° C , the warming by 2100 will certainly not exceed a warming of 2 ° C. We then have until 2100 to reach pre-industrial emissions levels. In any case, it makes no difference whether Germany and Europe reach net zero in 2050 or 2100. The decisive factor is: what is the world doing and especially what is China doing?To believe that China, as promised in Paris, its CO2 emissions will increase from 8.9 billion tonnes to (only!) 12.5 billion tonnes will return in 2030 and then to zero in 20 years, would be really naive. The Chinese government itself expects the same emissions in 2050 as now, which would require an enormous effort. Or is it European logic that we destroy our industrial society so that China can really flourish?In 62 countries around the world, 1,600 (1,600) coal-fired power plants are currently being built, most of them by Chinese companies and with the help of Chinese loans. In total, the capacity of coal-fired power stations worldwide will not be reduced, but will be increased by 43%. This is not a theoretical model calculation, but reality. And Germany is in the process of phasing out nuclear power by 2022 and domestic lignite by 2038.Many disaster warnings have already been passed . Such as the warning for the Little Ice Age in the 1970s, the warnings from the Club of Rome that we will run out of resources in 2000, the end of the German forests around 2000. Often things turned out very differently than expected. But the most obvious scenario right now would be: the world is changing very slowly by 2100 and Germany will go down in ten years time if the infantilization of politics continues at the level of ‘ Friday for the future’ .Unwanted truths The judgment about CO2 and the industry associated with it has already been made harmful and dangerous must stop.In the short term, new scientific insights are not expected to lead to a policy change. There is and there is much loss of wealth will be e ist by people with a policy based on fear of climate disasters; There has been much too often proclaimed 100% truth, so that people are open to course corrections.If the emergencies do not occur and were not justified, the climate forecasts would collapse because part of the warming turns out to be a natural development and CO2 has a less warming effect than assumed.Not only climate science, but also politics in Europe as a whole has a serious credibility problem.This is a summary of a recently published book by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning : Unerwünschte Wahrheiten.See here .

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/10/alberta-cities-buying-renewables-ppas-taxpayer-death-by-debt-and-taxes/,Andrew Roman ,Alberta Cities Buying Renewables PPAs =Taxpayer Death by Debt and Taxes," By Michelle Stirling and Kent A. Zehr, P. Eng. © 2020This op-ed rebuttal was submitted to the Calgary Herald but, to date, has not been published.A recent op-ed of Sept. 10, 2020, in the Calgary Herald by a group of people with no expertise in power generation proposed that Alberta cities could stimulate jobs and economic recovery by simply signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) for renewable energy. PPAs are contractual arrangements whereby you guarantee a profit to someone whether or not you need or want their product, which might also cost you money to dispose of when you cannot use it. The op-ed authors claim that by cities signing such PPAs this would then drive the construction of new renewable projects like wind or solar facilities. They claim this would produce jobs, give Alberta a ‘greener’ reputation, reduce air pollution, and stop climate change. They also claim that electric vehicles (EVs) will ‘soon’ have long-life batteries and thus EV owners could make money off their cars while parked, by selling power back to the grid and this would stabilize the power grid. They claimed since the renewables jobs are outdoors, any Coronavirus contact issues would be low.There are several problems with the op-ed.Renewables cost taxpayers money, lots of money, through direct and indirect subsidies and through the costs of grid integration. Alberta power generation experts have said it costs about $1 million/MW to integrate wind to the grid. Renewables require additional transmission lines. The line from Calgary to Pincher Creek wind farms cost $2.2 billion. So much for ‘free’ wind.Wind and solar energy must be used in the moment it is created or if not needed locally, then it is ‘spilled’ to some other jurisdiction, often at below market rates. A parallel conventional fossil fuel power generation system must be in place and have ‘spinning reserves’ on standby to take over instantly when wind or solar drops off. This is typically done with natural gas combined-cycle plants that can ‘ramp up’ quickly to fill demand – or the entire grid can blackout.People like to say Alberta is ideal for wind and solar, but it is problematic for both. The problem with wind is its randomness, wind is completely uncorrelated with demand. If the Alberta gov’t adds another 5,000 MW (as the NDP proposed) then the total wind capacity would be ~6,500 MW. Typically, this amount of wind would randomly experience 80% or higher ramps one or more times per week. This would be the equivalent of ramping 6.5 Shepard natural gas plants from off to full to off again. These plants are unable to do this over the long term. They may end up having to put in simple cycle units instead which, from a carbon dioxide (CO2) perspective, would pretty much defeat the purpose of adding wind.For solar, we are too far north. Any solar farm north of the 35 N latitude is an energy ‘sink’ – meaning it took more energy to produce the panel than it will return in its lifetime.As for EVs as battery storage feeding the grid, this is fantasy. Alberta is particularly unsuited to EVs due to the temperature extremes. Battery life is short in extremely cold or hot weather. Likewise, EVs require additional infrastructure which is very expensive – not just the charging stations. Once there are more than a handful of EV’s on a block, the distribution lines and transformers must be upgraded; once there are more than a few hundred EVs in a city or town, the transmission and distribution lines must be upgraded.Ironically, the only thing the public love to hate more than pipelines are… power lines.Likewise, for the current federal EV policy, Alberta would have to create 16% more conventional power generation to meet the EV demands, or about 2,599 MW. That would be equal to about 3 more Shepard Energy Centre natural gas plants. Shepard cost $1.4 billion and took 7 years to build, with some prior years of planning. There is presently no such project on the drawing board for Alberta and overall, these projects need a 20-30-year horizon.As for jobs, renewables typically create very short-term jobs for the construction phase and limited maintenance jobs after that. Where renewables DO create jobs is overseas – mostly in China – where pollution is rampant, few health and safety regulations exist, the environment is treated like a garbage can, the air like a sewer, and reclamation is virtually unheard of.The authors of the article claim renewables would offset our ‘huge’ global greenhouse gas footprint – which is comical since China emits in one month (819 Mt/month) about what Canada emits in one and a half years.The op-ed authors say wind and solar are ‘clean’ – but wind turbines create huge wakes of suspended particulates which, for many people, drive asthma and other respiratory conditions. Likewise, wind farms close to residences create many health hazards and reduce property values. Solar panels are made of toxic ingredients and there is no way to recycle them.Unlike oil, natural gas and coal, which are market commodities that Alberta can sell for profit internationally, which are portable, storable forms of energy, which are energy dense, which have vast product streams that create millions of by products and jobs, and which drive global economies, wind and solar have no inherent value-added qualities. Canadians and Albertans need to earn more money, not pay more taxes!https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/fossil-fuels/joules-btus-quads-lets-call-the-whole-thing-offWind and solar run on subsidies. At a time like this, no one can afford to ‘go green’…and no one should continue the charade that there is anything ‘green or clean’ about wind and solar devices. They are mined and made under the worst human rights and environmental conditions, they are unrecyclable, and for wind, the turbines are death to bats and rare raptors. Wind and solar offer only broken promises, empty pockets, and empty wallets.-30-Michelle Stirling is Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society and a member of the CAJ and AAAS. Kent A.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/10/10/in-defence-of-affordable-housing/,Andrew Roman ,In Defence Of Affordable Housing," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020In major cities across North America, there is a convergence of political forces that supports the increased densification of cities, largely through land use planning, zoning and taxation measures. Usually, advocates claim that this is needed in order to achieve more “livable” cities and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a global mission to address allegedly catastrophic climate change. If fact, the main effects of these policies are to reduce the availability of new housing within urban boundaries, sharply increasing housing costs and placing home ownership further and further beyond the reach of people with lower incomes.Much of the inspiration for the densification policies comes from experience on the United States west coast, and especially California. In the post-war period up to 1990, the land available for residential development there increased steadily at rates that aligned with the state’s growing population. Over the past three decades, but especially after the introduction of restrictive climate policies, stringent land use regulations have driven up land prices so much that middle-income, single-family housing is now virtually impossible to build.Median house prices in the major coastal cities are far above the U.S. national average. According to Demographia’s International Housing Affordability Survey, average home costs in San Jose are 10.3 times the area’s median income, 9.4 times in Los Angeles, 9.1 in San Francisco and 8.4 times in San Diego, far above the 5.7 ratio in New York. Median gross rents, which tend to follow house prices, are more than 75% higher than the national average.“Homeless in san francisco mission district California” by shanestar is licensed under CC BY 2.0 This is not due to a shortage of land. Urban areas cover just 5% of the state but house 95% of the population. The lands near the cities are not being developed because the majority of California cities and counties have adopted one or more growth control measures. These measures make it impossible to build more than one house at a time on rural lands, and make even building that one house difficult. California counties charge developers fees so high that developments often are not feasible, as the resulting house prices would be unaffordable. Furthermore, pressured by environmental groups, the courts have interpreted the California Environmental Quality Act to prevent counties from developing rural land without an environmental impact report that costs around $20 million to complete.Social justice advocates maintain that, as single-family neighbourhoods have historically been white, their perpetuation is racist. Density activists claim that living close together fosters greater community spirit and positive social results, a claim seemingly not borne out by experience in American ghettos. The editor of the environmental magazine Grist recently commented that “a lot of green good comes from bringing fewer beings into a polluted and crowded planet” – the logic presumably being that living in single-family homes encourages people to have children and thus increase emissions. The politically powerful transit lobby supports densification along transit routes; after all, the average light rail line in the United States costs up to $80 million per route-mile (and up to $200 million per route mile in major Canadian cities).The reality is that California’s determination to undo the primarily suburban, single-family development model in order to “save the planet” has raised housing prices well above national average levels and created a supply shortfall estimated to be 3 million homes. By 2016, the homeownership rate in the state was just 54%, compared with 64% in the rest of the U.S. The largest declines in home ownership have been among minorities. In 2016, for example, only 31% of African-Americans in the San Francisco Bay area owned homes, well below the 41% in the rest of the country. Today, 8 million Californians live in poverty, by far the most of any state. Yet, the cost of building affordable housing in urban areas can exceed $700,000 per unit. Due to high construction costs, rents for mid-rise and high-rise rental units near transit stations in most cities are at least $3,000 per month, and are affordable only to those with family incomes exceeding $100,000 per year.The situation in Canadian cities is not yet as dire as that in California, although the same climate policy and densification policy views are moving cities like Toronto and Vancouver in that direction.A strong land-owning middle class has been a key feature of western democracies, especially in North America, for many generations. Today, through deliberate policy, some jurisdictions are undermining the aspirations of that class, and in the process damaging the economic prospects of all sectors of society.About the Author: Robert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/09/30/the-economics-of-wind-power-in-future-blindness-and-insight/,,The Economics of Wind Power in Future – Blindness and Insight," In one of a series of articles entitled Briefings for Britain, John Constable and Professor Gordon Hughes provided their recent findings with respect to the capital and operating costs of onshore and offshore wind generation in the United Kingdom. They then used this data as a basis for assessing the latest set of future electricity cost estimates published by the U.K. Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The full text of an article on this subject can be found here:https://briefingsforbritain.co.uk/the-costs-offshore-wind-power-blindness-and-insight/The purpose of those note is to provide a short summary of the article.Based on reports in the mainstream media and statements by governments in the U.K (as well as in Canada), the average person has been repeatedly told that the costs of electricity generation by offshore and onshore industrial wind turbines are falling “dramatically”. This claim is demonstrably false. Instead, wind power over the last two decades has become more expensive. This finding is based on a detailed review of the audited accounts of the capital and operating costs of 350 onshore and offshore wind farms in the United Kingdom, a set that includes the majority of the larger wind farms (i.e. with capacities exceeding 10 megawatts) built and commissioned between 2002 and 2019. It is the largest study of its kind to date.The main findings of this study are that:• The actual costs of onshore and offshore wind generation have not fallen significantly over the last two decades and there is little prospect that they will fall in the next five or even ten years.• The weighted return for investors and lenders has declined sharply, especially for offshore wind. These “gains” in cost have been offset by higher operating and maintenance costs.• The actual capital costs per megawatt (MW) of capacity to build new wind farms increased substantially from 2002 to 2015 and have, at best, remained constant since then.• The operating costs per MW of new capacity have increased significantly for both onshore and offshore wind farms over the last two decades. Operating costs for existing wind farms tend to increase more rapidly as they age, due to the frequency of equipment failures and the need for preventative maintenance.• The combination of increasing operating and maintenance costs with the decline in investor yields due to aging means that at current market prices the expected revenues from electricity generation will be less than expected operating costs after the expiry of contracts, guaranteeing above-market prices.Based on these findings, the article forecasts that the offshore projects now being constructed and planned in North Western Europe will only be able to repay lenders and offer a return to equity investors if the average wholesale market prices of power rise to at least three to four times their current level throughout western Europe. That would only happen if the market price of natural gas (i.e. the competing source of fuel for generation) were much, much higher (highly unlikely) or carbon taxes were raised to at least 200 Euros per tonne (about Cdn $300 per tonne).The article compares the BEIS projected costs for onshore and offshore wind plants entering service in 2025 with actual recent experience.Based on BEIS assumptions, the capital costs will be 1.30 million pounds per MW of onshore wind and 2.16 million pounds per MW for offshore wind. This compares to actual reported capital costs of 1.61 million pounds per MW for onshore wind and 4.49 million pounds per MW for offshore wind. In essence, BEIS is projecting offshore wind costs about half of what it costs today, even though most future projects will necessarily be at greater depths and distance from shore, thus incurring much higher capital costs for both turbines and transmissions.Based on BEIS assumptions, the operating costs for an onshore wind turbine commissioned in 2025 will be 47,000 pounds per MW and for an offshore wind turbine will be 109,000 pounds per MW and, in both cases, the costs are projected to be constant over their full operating lives. Actual operating costs for a recently commissioned onshore wind turbine were 77,000 pounds per MW in the first year and projected to increase to 114,000 pounds per MW 15 years later. Audited accounts of recently completed offshore wind turbines indicate actual initial operating costs of 184,000 pounds per MW in the first year, with the expectation that this will rise to 426,000 pounds per MW at age 15. Over the lives of the projects, experience indicates that total operating costs for new turbines commissioned in 2025 will be several times higher than what the British government is estimating.The BEIS analysis assumes constant load factors of 34% over long periods for onshore wind projects and 51% for offshore projects. Actual experience with onshore wind turbines in Denmark indicates that the current generation of onshore turbines of greater than 2 MW capacity declines at the rate of about 3% per year. The average load factors for offshore wind farms less than five years old in Northwest Europe fall into the range of 40-45% and are expected to decline.Constable and Hughes ask an interesting question, i.e. “Why are large companies committing substantial capital to very large projects that are almost certain to make a loss under anything like current market conditions?” They offer three possible answers. First, the offshore wind sector is dominated by large, often state-controlled, companies that are under little pressure to cut costs for their customers or to return cash to their shareholders. Second, operators expect to be able to sell a large portion of the shares in their projects to over-optimistic investors with little appreciation of the risks involved. (Also, projects rely heavily on debt provided by naïve or “socially-committed” lenders.) Third, operators and financial investors are aware of the risk but expect to be bailed out.“Once economic reality becomes undeniable, there will be a huge lobby to pass on the full costs of offshore wind to either electricity consumers or taxpayers. The obvious instrument is carbon taxation, but the increase required would be very large, and the economic harm would be politically contentious to say the least… A government trapped between intense political opposition and the ever-widening ramifications of the financial collapse of the offshore wind sector will behave in ways that cannot be predicted confidently, but investors in renewables should be very nervous.”So should electricity consumers and taxpayers.About the Author: Robert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/09/30/fact-checking-the-climate-clock/,Cindy ,Fact Checking the Climate Clock," The New York City “Climate Clock” is the latest piece of climate fear mongering that has been recently unveiled. It follows the one erected in Oslo and the 2019 clock placed on the historic Gasometer in Berlin.PDF VersionThe site climateclock.world states that the “clocks are drawing the world’s attention to the urgency for action. But if our species is to survive, we need a constant, public reminder of our climate deadline — everywhere!” This is pure brainwashing 101. Let’s leave the psychological pressure analysis and delve into the science.At time of posting the climate clock site reports these numbers:The SEE THE SCIENCE button gives us:The Climate Clock shows two numbers. The first, in red, is a timer, counting down how long it will take, at current rates of emissions, to burn through our “carbon budget” — the amount of CO2 that can still be released into the atmosphere while limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is our deadline, the time we have left to take decisive action to keep warming under the 1.5°C threshold. The second number, in green, is tracking the growing % of the world’s energy currently supplied from renewable sources. This is our lifeline. Simply put, we need to get our lifeline to 100% before our deadline reaches 0.Red “Deadline”To evaluate how much time we have left before we burn through our “carbon budget” we must start with the commonly used temperature dataset which is the HadCRUT4.6. Temperatures have negative values due to having been normalized to the temperature average from 1961 to 1990.The IPCC SR15 report averages temperatures from 1850 to 1900 as an estimate of pre-industrial temperatures, which yields -0.312 °C. Then since the annual temperature for 2019 was 0.736 °C we calculate that 2019 was 1.048 °C above pre-industrial times.An issue with the HadCRUT dataset is that it is not corrected for the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE). The UHIE is the urban warming, primarily post 1970, that contaminates the surface temperature record and in turn results in exaggerated temperature trends.The UHIE is removed by simply subtracting 0.0042 °C/year starting in 1980. The result for 2019 then is that the temperature becomes 0.572 °C once corrected. Consequently the corrected estimate for 2019 becomes 0.884 °C above pre-industrial times.Now we have two temperature ranges for an estimate above pre-industrial times:The pessimistic scenario of 1.048 °C from the blue uncorrected datasetThe optimistic scenario of 0.884 °C from the red corrected datasetThese in turn yield the amount of temperature increase we have left to reach 1.5 °C:The pessimistic scenario is 0.452 °CThe optimistic scenario is of 0.616 °CFollowing from Gregory (2020) Climate Sensitivity by Energy Balance with Urban and Natural Warming we can calculate when we reach 1.5°C above pre-industrial times following these assumptions:• CO2 increases exponentially with no meaningful mitigation policies• Non-CO2 Green House Gases (GHG) stay constant at 0.18% of CO2 forcing• CO2 climate sensitivity parameters are o Transient Climate Response (TCR) = 0.83 °C o Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) = 1.04 °C• Temperatures are corrected for UHIE• No natural climate change occurs after 2019.As presented by Gregory “the exponential GHG growth is offset by the logarithmic radiative forcing so that the temperature forecast is nearly a straight line.” Figure 6, copied here below from the paper, summarizes the findings as a forecasted warming of 0.63 °C from 2019 to 2100, or 0.00777 °C/year.Now taking our two scenarios we have:The pessimistic uncorrected scenario of 0.452 °C / 0.00777 °C/year = ~58 years from 2019 or 2077The optimistic UHIE corrected scenario of 0.616 °C/ 0.00777 °C/year = ~79 years from 2019 or 2098Both of these numbers are a far cry from the ~7 years presented on the clock. Obviously, giving people almost a lifetime would not be frightening enough.Green “Lifeline”To evaluate how much of the world’s energy is currently supplied from renewable sources we need some facts. BP p.l.c. provides an extremely detailed annual report that summarizes world energy consumption and generation; website and the 2020 full pdf report.Graphics and data below are sourced from their full report.As shown, renewables only produce 4.96% of the energy consumed worldwide.Some may disingenuously think that electricity generation may be used as a proxy for world energy. We see once again from the data below that electricity generated from renewables is only 10.39% of the total world electricity generation.Do we need to take “decisive action”?The climate clock activists assume that a global temperature rise of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures will trigger “global climate catastrophes” and that we only have this short time to take “decisive action”. Actually, the social net benefits of emissions are positive and continue to increase long above the assumed 1.5 °C threshold according to the FUND economic model results as specified in Gregory (2020).In our two cases we have GHG induced global annual net benefits accrued after 2019 in constant 2019 US dollars of:US$865 billion for 2077 (58 year pessimistic uncorrected scenario)US$1318 billion for 2098 (79 year optimistic UHIE corrected scenario)The benefits do not stop once we reach the magical 1.5 °C temperature threshold. For example a further 10 years of emissions after reaching 1.5 °C gives global net annual benefits of:US$1079 billion for 2087 (pessimistic uncorrected scenario)US$1649 billion for 2108 (optimistic UHIE corrected scenario)ConclusionIt is apparent that the deadline of just over 7 years and the lifeline of 27.7% being touted by the Climate Clock are gross exaggerations not based on factual data. It is also incredible that we would want to stop a warming trend that will actually enrich people all over the globe. So, NO we should not pursue this foolish decisive action.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2020/09/30

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/09/15/do-the-hustle-climate-monarchy-want-carbon-serfdom-for-you/,Eric Vieira ,Do the Hustle! Climate Monarchy Want Carbon Serfdom for You," A Review of “Climate Hustle 2” – New Marc Morano/CFACT Movie By Michelle Stirling © September 2020(Calgary, Alberta) I wish I could have seen it on the big screen in the theatre as CFACT had planned, but I curled up with my popcorn and YouTube and my private pre-release link back in May, to watch “Climate Hustle 2 – Rise of the Climate Monarchy”. It was astounding. The planned theatrical release was delayed by lockdowns, but now “Climate Hustle 2” is coming to your home – get your tickets now for the online premiere, September 24, 2020!Online screening – tickets available for Sept. 24, 2020 premiereMini AOC kicks off this story with some of her witty quips on how the climate elite of the world are planning to make you all into carbon serfs. Then Kevin Sorbo takes on the Herculean task as host, linking together a global whirlwind tour of climate insanity and dangerous thinking.https://live.climatehustle2.com/index/climate-hustle-2The inimitable Marc Morano starts us off in Versailles, posing the notion that the climate elite are well on their way to establishing a new climate monarchy that is based on faulty but frightening scientific premises and media mantras – with the ultimate goal of….no. Not saving the planet. Money. Power. Ideology. Control. Of you and me. The peasants will soon be carbon serfs, allotted an annual ‘carbon ration’, unless we stand our ground.When some people think of the monarchy, they perhaps think of the hard-working, stoic, benevolent Queen Elizabeth, but climate monarchs are nothing of the kind. They are the elitist ‘let them eat cake/off with their heads’ people, as Climate Hustle 2 reveals.Numerous celebrities are skewered for their Hollywood hypocrisy of ‘do as I say, not as I do’ – Harrison Ford, James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and of course Al Gore.Climate science, public policy, and economics experts and authors like Richard Lindzen, Lord Monckton, Mark Steyn, Don Easterbrook, Ross McKitrick, Judith Curry, and more are peppered throughout the show, highlighting key points and flaws of climate dogma.Host Kevin Sorbo points out that so much of the climate gig is about conformity. Tim Ball recounts the tremendous damage he and his family have experienced from his willingness to challenge the alleged ‘consensus’ climate view.Indeed, the personal price was also high in the old days when anyone challenged the king. Today’s climate monarchs are not much different, with folks like Bill Nye, David Suzuki and Robert Kennedy, Jr. saying those climate dissidents are guilty of “crimes against humanity” who should be imprisoned. In fact, true science progresses through persistent, hard-nosed skepticism.https://www.nap.edu/read/4917/chapter/2Climate Hustle 2 explores interesting themes of the religious overtones of the climate movement as well as themes of communism. Vaclav Klaus, former president of the Czech Republic has sobering comments about how hard they struggled to be free of such totalitarianism, and how so many people in the ‘free’ West, now willingly fall in line with climate compliance.If the actual outcomes of ‘climate action’ were about mitigating human impact on the planet, that would be one thing, but the series of climate experts shows that climate emergency and catastrophe claims are a charade.I thought I knew the climate field of dreams and wacky ideas pretty well, having worked in it for over a decade, but the collection of “Bad Ideas” really blew my mind. What do these climate monarchs have in mind for you? Bugs for supper. Drugs to make you comply. Bioengineering to shrink your carbon footprint by shrinking you. And hey, maybe just getting rid of people.And the creepiest thing is the influence the climate monarchs have over children. Holly Swanson, author of “Training for Treason: The Harmful Political Agenda behind Education for Sustainability” talks of the implications for children with this agenda-heavy climate dogma, while climate scientist Judith Curry notes that she sees no reason to teach kids about climate.As host Kevin Sorbo points out climate monarchs want to “get ‘em early”.But back to Vaclav Klaus who clearly sees totalitarian, anti-democratic, top-down economic management taking over every part of life though the climate hustle narrative.We are in a fight for freedom is the ultimate message of the film. But are we fighting for it, or just going along to get along? I was left wondering if we need a new Magna Carta? Or shall we just stand up for the old one that destroyed the divine right of kings.As noted in the opening of my article, I had a pre-screening in May and had ended this review with the statement: “Past conflicts between kings and peasants led to bloody battles, riots and revolutions. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.” – indeed that has come to pass! You may dismiss this, thinking the present civil unrest is about climate and racial justice, but is it? By Trump pulling out of Paris, he pulled out a bottom card from the Democrat-favored house of global climate carbon trading.As French economist Henri Lepage wrote this spring, the global recession was occurring before Coronavirus hit – COVID just provided a handy cover for the collapse. Maybe decades of public moneys being drained through subsidies to renewables, and offsets into carbon markets, which entail ‘the lack of delivery of an invisible substance to no one‘, finally caught up with the Climate Lords and Ladies – the green crony capitalists – whose personal version of the Mississippi Scheme or Tulip-O-Mania now reaps what they have sown. Those early Ponzi schemes traded in an invisible promise that relied on mass public delusions, which bankrupted France and Holland in the 1700s and 1600s, led by the wealthy elite. The carbon con bluff was called by Trump when he pulled out of the Paris Agreement. The Climate Monarchy are desperate to keep it that Ponzi scheme alive.Climate Hustle 2 is a full meal deal and a rather long film, but well worth it. Once you see it, you can’t unsee the damage the climate monarchy is doing to every aspect of scientific inquiry, to freedom and to democratic society.30 –Michelle Stirling is Communications Manager with Friends of Science Society.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/09/13/stranded-assets-are-a-myth-mark-carney/,Andrew Roman ,"Stranded Assets are a Myth, Mark Carney"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © September 2020In late December, 2019, the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, gave a speech to a Lloyd’s of London dinner. In it, he warned members of the international financial industry that their valuation of loans and investments should be reduced to consider the losses that fossil fuel companies will suffer from a catastrophic collapse in value as a result of climate change policies. The key danger, he alleged, was that changes in government policies will leave oil drillers and coal miners with stranded assets – reserves that have little value because the fight against climate change will “require” them to be left in the ground.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stranded-Assets-Myth-Sept-13-2020-FINAL.pdfStranded-Assets-Myth-Sept-13-2020-FINALDownloadIn this article, I will compare Carney’s claims with what is actually happening in global energy markets, as well as what can reasonably be expected to drive energy markets over the foreseeable future, according to the best authorities available. I will try to show that the financial institutions and energy companies that pass up opportunities to invest in fossil fuels will run a far greater risk of foregoing significant profits.Global demand for oil, natural gas and coal is now and will continue to be driven by demographic and economic trends in Asia, not in Europe and North America. The resulting large increases in demand for these fuels, which will probably become evident no later than 2022, must be satisfied. If government policies and investor reticence and/or lack of investment capital result in insufficient supply to meet this burgeoning demand, prices will rise significantly. While that, in turn, will dampen demand growth, it will yield very large profits to producers and provide them with the cash flow needed to expand reserves and production with less reliance on traditional sources of lending.In such a future, the institutional investors can, of course, refuse to join in the profit-taking. I doubt they will.About the Author: Robert Lyman is an economist with 27 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, and environmental policy.

Parkinslt-to-president-of-U-of-A-FINALDownloadFriends of Science Society is a non-profit society in Alberta, founded and operated by volunteer retired and semi-retired Professional Geoscientists, Professional Engineers, solar scientists, atmospheric scientists, and citizens. The organization’s objectives are to provide insights on climate science and related energy policies to inform the public and policymakers and to advocate for full cost-benefit analysis of proposed policies.Many of our members are alumni of the University of Alberta – especially geosciences, engineering, and business management.In the May 2020 publication named above, several false statements were made about Friends of Science Society. It is very surprising that grad level students made false assumptions based on articles in the press and their own biases instead of sending an inquiry directly to Friends of Science Society, an organization located in Calgary and offering a toll-free contact number and email.We request a retraction of the aforementioned paper for the reasons in the attached document.Sincerely,Michelle StirlingCommunications ManagerFriends of Science Society Errors and False Statements in “Assessing Barriers to Renewable Energy Development in Alberta: Evidence from a Survey on Wind Energy with Rural Landowners”Misquoting Friends of Science Society’s position on Climate ChangeIn the first place, the authors misquote Friends of Science Society’s position on climate change. We agree that humans affect climate change, but the evidence shows that natural forces are more powerful. We agree there has been warming since the end of the Little Ice Age (~1860), we agree that carbon dioxide from human industrial activity has a nominal warming effect, but the climate sensitivity (warming effect) of carbon dioxide is now deemed to be small.Misrepresenting the science on Extreme WeatherThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued the SREX report in 2012 which confirmed that there is little evidence that weather extremes are caused by human influence on climate.One of our key scientific advisers is Dr. Madhav Khandekar, a former U of A professor of atmospheric sciences. In 2000, Dr. Khandekar conducted a literature review for the Alberta government, assessing the Uncertainties in Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change. In a recorded interview in 2018, Dr. Khandekar stated that those uncertainties are still the same and that there are many more.Dr. Khandekar’s presentation at our 2018 event was “Climate Change and Extreme Weather: Perception vs Reality”, wherein he shows that extreme weather events are integral to climate. In a warming world, Polar Regions are expected to warm faster than tropical regions, reducing the temperature gradient that powers storms. A warmer world should have fewer, not more, severe storms.The frequency trend of strong +F3 tornadoes in the USA has declined by 57% from 1958 to 2019. The frequency of all global hurricanes has also declined since 1980. Global hurricanes’ total energy exhibits decadal variability but show no increasing trend. Global drought has been declining since 1972. See our Extreme Weather information here and here.Misrepresenting Friends of Science Society by claiming the organization is ‘anti-climate action’ or that the group spreads ‘misinformation’Friends of Science Society has been engaged on the public debate on climate change and related policies since the days of the Kyoto Protocol. The Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists (APEGA) published this debate in their journal “The Peg” in 2002, featuring astrophysicist Dr. Sallie Baliunas, earth scientist Dr. Tim Patterson, and Allan McRae, P. Engineer, debating with two members of the Pembina Institute. You will note that Pembina Institute simply argued the IPCC political line which Baliunas, Patterson and McRae argued the science. Dr. Baliunas and Dr. Patterson were our first scientific advisors.The Sun is the main driver of climate change as it affects all climatic processes on earth. The Sun’s solar wind varies in response to gravitational effects of conjunctions of the major planets. The solar wind affects low cloud formation and ozone in the upper atmosphere, both of which likely affect surface temperatures more than the direct changes in solar heat output. Solar cycles vary on timescales ranging from the 11-yr cycle to thousands of years.As well, there are cyclical patterns within earth’s climatic system, including ocean cycles of multi-decades to thousands of years. The Earth has been warming in part since 1970 due to the millennium warming cycle from the Little Ice Age, and the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (60 years), and poorly researched subliminal geothermal activity in the oceans which appears to affect sea ice variability and regional atmospheric warming.The climate sensitivity to increasing CO2 can best be estimated by the energy balance method which compares the Earth’s historical warming net of natural climate change and urban warming to greenhouse gas forcings. When this is correctly done, climate sensitivity is found to be about 1.0 °C per doubling of CO2, which is less than a third of the average of the climate models of 3.2 °C as reported in the IPCC’s fifth assessment report. Climate models over warm the Earth’s surface by a factor of two since 1980. The increasing CO2 fertilization effect on crops and the net benefits of warming increase the global wealth by over a trillion US dollars/year by 2100.Friends of Science Society is ‘pro-climate science information’ and opposed to poor climate or energy policies based on myths that humans can control the climate of earth by taxing people.“Assessing Barriers…” commenting on topics outside their field of expertiseIt is curious that grad students and professors who are not in the physical sciences, presume to pass judgement on the work of Professional Geoscientists, Professional Engineers, atmospheric and solar scientists, when they are not academically qualified to make such judgements.Making unwarranted, derogatory, and inaccurate statements about Friends of Science Society’s motivesThe “Assessing Barriers…” report goes on to suggest that Friends of Science Society is “motivated by the financial gain of reducing climate action regulation.” As a non-profit society, operating on about $150,000/yr. from individual member/subscriber donations, the society cannot cause any financial gain for its members.The authors of the “Assessing Barriers…” report reveal a poor level of research by citing claims in the press that Friends of Science Society were creditors of the Peabody Energy bankruptcy, when in fact, Friends of Science Society’s name only appeared in the ‘cull’ list of the bankruptcy trustee (i.e. at the outset of a bankruptcy, all emails of an organization are culled and parties notified of the bankruptcy to determine creditor status).The only reason Friends of Science Society’s name was in the Peabody email register, is that in 2014, we had sent this rebuttal to Peabody, responding to a Greenpeace intimidation attack on corporate directors/executives. This is a form letter that was sent to as many of the corporations as we could find from Greenpeace documents.This is the concurrent press release from 2014.Had the researchers contacted Friends of Science Society directly for confirmation of the press claims, we could have provided them with this evidence.A search of the Peabody creditors did not find Friends of Science Society listed as a creditor.The same search revealed that the Sierra Club was a creditor of Peabody.Making false statements about Friends of Science Society’s origin and fundingThe authors of “Assessing Barriers…” claim that Talisman Energy, then a Calgary-based oil company, funded the creation of Friends of Science Society. This is false. Talisman financially supported the production of a documentary, for which Friends of Science Society were volunteer script consultants, featuring numerous scientists, discussing how climate change is driven mainly by the sun, with carbon dioxide having a lesser impact. Talisman Energy’s then CEO, Dr. Jim Buckee, holds a PhD in solar physics from Oxford University.Friends of Science Society was founded by a group of retired and semi-retired scientists and funded by member/subscribers who subsequently joined. In 2015, Ecojustice, on behalf of a bevy of climate activists, demanded that the Competition Bureau investigate Friends of Science Society as a ‘front’ for industry with ‘deep pockets’ and for misleading statements on our billboards. Competition Bureau did not find such evidence.Misplaced concern about Friends of Science Society’s alleged influence on public opinion – no due diligence by authors of “Assessing Barriers…”The authors of “Assessing Barriers…” also reference Mittelstaedt’s article in the Globe and Mail wherein Environmental Defence is quoted as saying:Rick Smith, executive director of Environmental Defence, a Toronto-based conservation advocacy group, contended that a national advertising campaign would be beyond the reach of any organization relying on small, individual donations.“We’re a shoe-string operation running on small donations and there is no way in hell that we can afford the kind of advertising campaign they’re undertaking,” he said.Environmental Defence, which is also a non-profit, reveals the names of those who give donations of more than $500 in its annual report.In fact, Environmental Defence at the time, according to their 2009-2010 Annual Report, had $3,534,444 in tax-subsidized revenues (a federally registered charity, not a non-profit), far surpassing Friends of Science Society’s annual ~$150K. Environmental charities were not permitted to spend funds on similar public advertising at that time. Likewise, as a registered charity, since donors receive a tax deduction, names are published. There is no such reporting requirement for a small non-profit like Friends of Science Society as there are no tax benefits to individuals who support us. Most Friends of Science donations are under $500.Excerpt: https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Protest-vs-Green-Trade-War-rebutting-Enviro-Defence-FINAL-Aug-17-2020.pdfEnvironmental Defence was also a recipient of substantial foreign funding to participate in the economic ‘green’ trade war operating under the guise of the Tar Sands Campaign, which has destroyed Alberta’s economy and put thousands of highly trained, skilled University of Alberta alumni out of work. The Tar Sands destruction of the Alberta oil sands reputation has also devastated the University of Alberta’s funding base.Foreign funding to Canadian environmental law ‘charities’.Environmental Defence has a large staff and substantial budget, according to Blumberg’s Charity Data.https://lobbycanada.gc.ca/app/secure/ocl/lrs/do/clntSmmry?clientOrgCorpNumber=13022&sMdKy=1599318371358Environmental Defence also has 11 registered lobbyists in Ottawa. Friends of Science Society has none.In light of the above, it is curious that these University of Alberta professors and grad students state that “Concerns about anti-climate action interest groups spreading misinformation are pressing in Alberta….” When it is obvious that the more pressing concern is the foreign funded, taxpayer subsidized, ENGOs, spreading false and misleading information about the Alberta oil sands, and pushing ineffective, unreliable, expensive “renewables” like wind and solar and the foreign ClimateWorks “Design to Win” cap and trade/price on carbon campaign, acting as an apparent “grassroots proxy” for foreign interests.According to the UofA website, the grant for the report “Assessing Barriers…” is associated with a Social Science and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant:Imagination, expectation and deliberation: Pathways to wind energy landscape transitions in Alberta. Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), Insight Grant, $199,730 (2017 – 2021). PI: Parkins (Alberta). Collaborators: Anders (Alberta), Sherren (Dalhousie), Davidson (Alberta)It is alarming that the document “Assessing Barriers…” did not have to go through technical peer-review by power generation engineers, particularly as the University of Alberta’s reputation is at stake and the SSHRC grant money comes from taxpayers.Misrepresenting Alberta’s renewable market“Assessing Barriers….” Stated in the abstract that “…the Province of Alberta is slow to adopt wind energy.”In fact, the first wind farm in Canada was built in Alberta in 1993, some 27 years ago. Alberta also the first jurisdiction in North America to legislate mandatory greenhouse gas reductions, the first in Canada to mandate greenhouse gas reporting, among other climate and environment initiatives, in the Climate and Environment Legislation of 2003. Alberta was the first province in Canada to have a Ministry of Environment.By 2005, the Alberta Electric System Operator was signalling one the key problems of wind/solar renewables for on-grid operation – that being, you need equivalent conventional back-up for every MegaWatt installed – and that transmission line upgrades would be required.The addition of wind farms to Alberta’s grid, far from being ‘free’ and renewable’ has resulted in the need to build a $2.2 billion transmission line from Calgary to Pincher Creek wind farms and the $1.4 billion Shepherd Energy Centre combined-cycle natural gas plant in Calgary. It costs about $1 Million/MW to integrate wind to the grid. These additional costs are passed on to consumers, ultimately causing heat-or-eat poverty. There are Dire Consequences to early coal phase-out and carbon pricing for Albertans, including the billions of dollars in penalties due to botched management of the process, resulting in billions in compensation required to be paid to wealthy corporations for years on end. The carbon pricing that was supposed to underwrite the renewables incentives is an albatross around the neck of Albertans.According to a 2012 Morrison Park Advisors report for the Market Surveillance Authority of Alberta, there was no investor interest in wind and solar in Alberta because Alberta’s power prices were too low. Obviously, the advent of wind/solar promoters and investors in Alberta means the market mechanisms will raise the prices of power and provide various forms of subsidies, all from tax payers for unreliable, intermittent, energy forms that do not address climate change and that cannot support even basic society.The Wind Power Production Incentive program was set up to help establish wind energy in Canada by providing a financial incentive of about 1 cent per kilowatt-hour produced from the installation of up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new wind power capacity in Canada by 2007. Eligible recipients claim payment of the incentive over a 10-year period. The program contributes to the production of new electricity from wind energy projects. The program approved 22 wind projects for a total capacity of 924 MW.NOTE: The total contribution funding for the program is $324 million, of which $314 million has been committed to wind projects. Actual spending will be spread out over several years until 2016-17. The initial Wind Power Production Incentive program G&C budget was $254 million and an additional $69.9 million was allocated in 2005-06.https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/nrcan/transparency/reporting-accountability/plans-performance-reports/wind-power-production-incentive-contribution-program/17057Regarding the future of the NDP climate plan to put 30% renewables on the grid, ironically the AESO presented this long-term forecast in the winter of 2017 at an engineering managers luncheon showing that most of the reliable renewable energy would come from combined heat co-generation, most of which is produced by the oil sands.Disregard for serious environmental damage by wind farms; damage to humans and property valueIt is very surprising that people in the University of Alberta Department of Resource Economics and Environmental Sociology do not account for the devastation to rare raptors and slow-breeding bats, killed by wind farms.University of Calgary research shows that bats that approach wind turbines have their lungs exploded by the change in air pressure. Bats are a crucial part of the agricultural ecosystem, devouring millions of pestilential insects, but they are also slow breeders.Likewise, these U of A social scientists have no regard for the human suffering caused by wind farms destroying the health, property values, land and lives of rural Albertans, many of whom strongly oppose wind farms, contrary to the claims of the report. The authors have no regard for the destruction of rural China where neodymium is mined, the people now live in a toxic wasteland.Lack of due diligence on wind, solar and geothermal for AlbertaEven in the United States, the world’s largest power generation market for geothermal (0.4%) and one with decades of massive investments in wind (6.6%) and solar (1.6%), these provide nominal sources of power.Source: US EIAWe have a number of plain language resources on alternative energy options and related pitfalls and challenges.In conjunction with Friends of Science communications team, Alberta power generation experts have compiled this report “In the Dark on Renewables” on the issues with wind and solar. Video overview.Robert Lyman, former public servant who spent years working on greenhouse gas and energy related policies for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years, has compiled a series of reports on renewables:Broken Promises: Why Renewables Offer No Resilient Recovery – Part 1Empty Wallets: Why Renewables Offer No Resilient Recovery – Part 2Empty Pockets: Why Renewables Offer No Resilient Recovery – Part 3Grid-Scale Battery Storage – An Anecdotal ReviewSeveral Professional Geoscientists collaborated on the compilation of this document:“Geothermal for Alberta? A Case for Caution”And regarding climate change per se, two reports rebut claims of an impending climate emergency.“Facts vs Fortune Telling: Alberta’s Climate Future Report Review”“Climate Change Your Mind – Responding to the Canadian government’s “Canada’s Changing Climate Report” (CCCR2019)“Faulty Premises = Poor Public Policy on Climate” – responding to IPCC SR1.5Video overview.In ClosingWe request that “Assessing Barriers…” be retracted for the foregoing reasons.Far from Friends of Science Society being a minority voice, some 900 international scientists and scholars who are signatory to the CLINTEL – Climate Intelligence declaration, hold similar views on climate change science and policy to those held by Friends of Science Society for the past 18 years. It may be wise for the University of Alberta to consider adopting CLINTEL’s “Magna Carta Universitatum 2020”.We hope you will enjoy our billboard campaign, presently running in Edmonton.Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETYShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'climate change', 'University of Alberta', 'wind farms']",2020/09/12

If necessary, filmmaker Marijn Poels (Meerlo, 1975) borrows a camper from father or uncle and tours, criss-crossing the Netherlands. To promote his films, to engage in dialogue with experts, entrepreneurs, and farmers. He flies across continents to find that one unique answer to that one question that haunts his mind.Republished with permission. This is a Google translated version, with minor corrections, of this original story by Sietske BergsmaWith “RETURN TO EDEN” the last part of his trilogy, award winning filmmaker Marijn Poels is briefly putting together a masterclass ‘man and nature’.When the first part of his trilogy (“The Uncertainty Has Settled”) was released in 2017, Poels breathed new life into the concept of “seek and they will find” in this way. What were we all doing with that climate policy?! Who benefited from that? Like a child learning to walk, he navigated the irrationality and sometimes even brutal lies of a deeply politicized scientific and ideological world.He ended that movie with the ironic phrase, “Here I am, just as smart as I was before.” Poels himself could not yet comprehend what he had discovered. That the so-called consensus on global warming and the solutions to it were rattled. And that the leftist worldview, with which he had always felt at home, was hostile to climate skeptics and free thinkers. The second part of the trilogy was about the latter: “PARADOGMA”. That film was probably mainly a processing of the first shock. That he was now suddenly “right”. A label that does not mean anything to him now, he says.Mentally, Poels is not afraid of long distances either. For three years he patiently sought openings for the (climate) debate, he tried to bridge prejudices, he was threatened by left-wing extremists (online and on the doorstep of the cinemas) and after a career with many award-winning films, he was abruptly ignored by the mainstream media as well. Unlike the raging anti-Trumper Michael Moore, who also released a climate-critical film this year, Poels’ style was always one of consideration and doubt, or as he likes to put it himself: ‘letting the viewer answer what is going on’. Return to EdenNo more time for climate madnessBut with the film “Return to Eden” he breaks through in style. Perhaps his patience was running out, or the gravity of the situation became increasingly clear to him. Poels has become more daring in his assumptions, more progressive than many eco-modernists. Where in ‘The Uncertainty Has Settled’ he needed an hour and a half to knock down sacred houses, in ‘Return to Eden’ he breaks the climate madness down to the core in one short, funny animation video: the canonization of Greta, the hysteria about melting ice, the ‘eleventh hour’ narrative, the Sun King behavior of Frans Timmermans, the attacks on dissidents, etc. Poels seems to want to say: ‘We now know that. And if you don’t know, I don’t have time anymore. “After” PARADOGMA “Poels is back to his more journalistic side. And again, not out to make friends. He now knows the kind of friends that are of no use to you anyway. Pandora’s Box no longer closes.“Return to Eden” is more than a sum or a conclusion that follows from the first two documentaries. Yes, it is a signature Poels film, about people and the climate, but with surprising twists. He puts the axe at the roots of the dominant, leftist idea of human progression, that in which man is (sometimes quite literally) distanced from the world. That concept is driven by managers and climate celebrities in Brussels. Who imagine themselves to be the masters of the universe.In Enkhuizen, where I spoke extensively and photographed Poels at the end of August, he compared humanity with the fungi in a forest. “The forest thrives in chaos, and we humans are chaos, you shouldn’t want to manage, control or contain that.” The myth of untouched nature and wilderness without human interference is the real ‘eleventh hour’ theme in “Return to Eden”. In the film, an American couple is interviewed who ran a successful family business, an oyster farm. “Until the extremists came,” the man says. “Other animal species, they said, would suffer from the oysters, and whenever it turned out to be the contrary, the eco extremists came up with a different objection.” Only after the entire farm was gone would the area be done justice, the policymakers concluded. The oyster farm family had to close and went out of business. The area is now empty and deserted. The seals that were there in their day are now gone too. It is not true that humans do more harm than good. Just like the claim that raw materials, such as coal and oil, would be bad. “A raw material can never be bad,” says a noted ecologist in the film.Humankind is no longer guiltyThat confidence and belief needs a rebirth, as the impudent title suggests. A return to the oh-so-simple but almost revolutionary idea of humans in the world. That people are not guilty and harmful to the planet but an important part of it. And that people let God (or whatever you believe in) turn the knobs of everything else.Poels, who can now often be found in his garden in Germany, where he grows fruit and vegetables and keeps some chickens, warns that if we start to see humans and livestock farming as the problem, this will have disastrous consequences. For the entire ecosystem. That we make some mistakes and that we do some harm does not mean that we have to withdraw from the world, but do better, is his implicit message.After watching the movie, you immediately feel like starting a vegetable garden. And keeping goats. I do not think I ever had that feeling after a movie. When asked how he managed to put that positive message in an otherwise rather bleak scenario (which also deals with the coming of the Fourth Industrial Revolution), he told me that ‘we as individuals are increasingly losing control over our lives, but that regaining control lies with yourself ‘.The garden as the key to freedomThe likelihood of returning to such a garden for all of us, in which chaos and order are in balance, so in which a certain “imperfect perfection” reigns and the serpent keeps reminding us of our fall, depends on ourselves. And hopefully from the inspiring people that Poels got in front of his camera. The Ethiopian desert farmers, the Dutch entrepreneurs in Egypt, the ecologist who shows that the solution to drought lies in keeping livestock. Hoofed animals that are close together turn the earth. Loose soil retains moisture better and so grass and other crops can get a chance. The almost impossible turns out to be very simple. Cultivate desert land, prevent forest fires, redirect trade winds, and breathe new life into a continent. Making Egypt a beating heart again. That is something different from a little aimless reduction of CO2. Or attach a heat pump to your home.The idea of the garden is as simple as it is grand, and an important key to regaining our freedom. It is indeed a fight to the death, he tells me. The alternative is that the garden of Eden will only be accessible to the elite, who will of course be chased out of it in the long run. By default and hubris. But I personally will not wait for that moment.“Return to Eden” will premiere on September 16, 2020 in the Ketelhuis, Amsterdam (sold out).

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/09/04/a-model-for-a-sensible-climate-policy-for-canada/,Rodney Reid Stuart ,A Model for A “Sensible” Climate Policy for Canada," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020. Robert Lyman is an economist with 35 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation and environmental policy. He also has eleven years’ experience as a private consultant conducting policy research and analysis on energy and transportation issues as a principal for ENTRANS Policy Research Group. For the last five years, he has been a frequent contributor to the publications of the Friends of Science, a Calgary-based independent organization concerned about climate change-related issues. He resides in Ottawa, Canada. Full bio.Far too often, those who seek a proper balance among economic, social, environmental and other considerations in climate policy devote all their attention to criticizing the measures now being implemented by governments. While the criticisms are usually valid, the overall impression often given to the public is one of negativity and lack of “vision”. This note is intended to stimulate thinking and exchange of views in another, more constructive, direction. It seeks to do so by answering the question, “What should the federal government’s climate policy be?”Some will respond that the following response to that question is not radical enough, and that all federal climate policy should be reversed and the measures ended. To that, I simply respond that a credible policy position must be moderate enough to attract broadly-based support, and it must be pragmatic rather than absolutist. In other words, the following is my view of a potentially acceptable compromise.Foundational PrinciplesFor too long, Canadian public policies concerning energy, the economy and climate have been dominated by the politics of fear – the irrational claims that small changes in carbon dioxide emissions here will have disastrous effects on the global weather and climate. It is time to base policy on the politics of hope and prosperity.Canada is blessed to have immense, secure natural resources, including all forms of energy, minerals, forests and water. We also have an educated, technologically advanced population. This has been the basis of rising incomes and standards of living throughout our history and they can be again.To achieve this, we must implement a framework that encourages investment in all our industries, that emphasizes technological innovation and development of all our human resources, that offers economic opportunities for all regions and income groups, and that stresses income growth not just income redistribution.The effects of climate policy on Canadians are widespread and diverse. Policy development should take place in an environment is which the different interests and regions are represented and respected, and all constructive views are welcome.Regulatory certainty, efficiency and predictability are important for people to plan. These conditions must be restored in industries affected by climate policies.The federal government must play its proper role as protector of the Canadian economic union, and address by legislation or other direct measures as necessary the use of political and legal tactics to block interprovincial trade and the legally approved construction and operation of interprovincial and international energy infrastructure.Policy MeasuresFederal and provincial governments should reform the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change to ensure that all emission reduction measures are subject to benefit-cost analyses and that GHG emission reduction objectives are no longer treated as over-riding policy goals.The federal government should review all outstanding federal programs that promote GHG emissions reduction through subsidies, regulation, tax measures and social marketing to ensure that they only continue if they can be justified on the basis of cost-effectiveness and non-duplication with provincial measures.A moratorium should be placed on further increases in the federal carbon dioxide minimum tax so that it will not rise above the $30 per tonne rate that took effect in 2020, pending a full evaluation of the impact of the tax on the competitive viability of emissions intensive industries in Canada. Such a moratorium also would allow for a fulsome review of the real effects and consequences of such taxes applied at the federal and provincial levels.There should be a rigorous and publicly transparent review of the implicit social cost of carbon to be included in all benefit-cost analyses of climate mitigation policies, programs and tax-related measures to ensure that the social cost of carbon is justified by the underlying data and that it is harmonized with practice in the United States.Canada should place a much higher priority on measures that enable the economy to adapt to whatever climate changes may occur. This is a sensible insurance policy, and the benefits of adaptation measures will adhere entirely to Canada.The legislation that substituted partisan political consideration for independent, merit-based review of new energy pipeline projects (Bill C-69) must be repealed.The federal Parliament should declare that the Trans Mountain Expansion Project and related works is for the general advantage of Canada. Justice Canada must challenge any and all court actions that impair the prompt implementation of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project and related works.Canada should withdraw, at the earliest possible date, from the 2015 Paris Agreement.In the meantime, Canada should impose a moratorium on all payments to the United Nations Green Climate Fund, pending completion of a thorough assessment by Environment and Climate Change Canada, Foreign Affairs Canada and Finance Canada to determine to what extent the countries that are the intended beneficiaries of these payments are in fact using them to reduce emissions in a manner consistent with the stated intent of the 2015 Paris Agreement.Canada should reduce the economic burden of current climate policies on the transportation sector, motorists and taxpayers. Specifically, it should align the emissions intensity standards for light and heavy duty vehicles with standards applied at the federal level in the United States. It also should terminate the existing large subsidies for electric vehicle purchases.Canada should promote research and development of new energy technologies applicable in Canada’s climatic and geographical conditions.Canada should conduct a policy review based on the most up-to-date scientific information available to determine whether current federal regulation of the construction and operation of nuclear power plants in Canada and provincial government electricity policies are inordinately impairing the role that nuclear power reactors can safely and economically play in meeting Canada’s future energy supply requirements.ConclusionI hope that these proposals will receive wide distribution and debate in different fora and will be conveyed via different means to those who have influence with the federal political parties before the next election.These proposals do not necessarily reflect the views of the Friends of Science Society or Canadians for Sensible Climate Policy, the two organizations that have most often published my articles. I take sole responsibility for them.Your comments will be most welcome.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change']",2020/09/04

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/08/26/do-charities-in-canada-need-more-public-funding/,Craig Jowett Ph.D. P.Eng.(r) ,Do Charities in Canada Need More Public Funding?," About the author: Robert Lyman is an economist with 35 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation and environmental policy. He also has eleven years experience as a private consultant conducting policy research and analysis on energy and transportation issues as a principal for ENTRANS Policy Research Group. For the last five years, he has been a frequent contributor to the publications of the Friends of Science, a Calgary-based independent organization concerned about climate change-related issues. He resides in Ottawa, Canada. Full bio here. The recent scandal concerning the federal government’s announcement that it had awarded the WE Charity the right to administer a $900 million…almost one billion dollars…student grant program has had many dimensions. Most of the public controversy has focused on the improper relationships between Justin Trudeau and Bill Morneau and their families and the WE organization. There has been less attention to the implications of the scandal for government funding of charities and non-profit organizations overall.Charities generally benefit from the public perception that they perform a public service in a more efficient and lower cost way than government institutions can. As recently as January, 2018, a Special Senate Committee on the Charitable Sector submitted a report which, while not examining the efficiency and cost considerations, concluded that the funding for the sector was “constrained” and that new measures were necessary “to ensure strong and stable funding for the sector”, including “the provision of predictable and sustainable grants and contribution agreements”.Is it true that charities need more public funding? The following graph illustrates the trends in funding for Canadian charities from 1997 to 2016, with partial results for 2017.Source: Compiled from CRA filings and data. As is indicated, charity industry revenues increased from $100 billion per year in 1999 to about $260 billion in 2016. Most of the growth in revenues was from governments, with that from provincial governments dominating.In 2017, the gross revenues of charities rose to $280 billion, of which governments provided $184.4 billion. The federal government share was $9 billion. If $184.4 billion in government revenue is not enough, how much more support is necessary? All levels of government spend about $800 billion annually on program expenditures; $184.4 billion to the charitable sector thus accounts for 22% of total programme expenditures.A recent Financial Post article suggested “We can reduce the poverty gap by making work pay more“, claiming that some $5,460 should be a wage subsidy. As it turns out, the analysis of charity funding indicates governments are annually granting the equivalent of about $5,000 to Canadian charities from every man, woman and child/pplkind of Canada, with no agreement or direction from those taxpayers/citizens. These contributions are purely at the discretion of government.  As it turns out, the analysis of charity funding indicates governments are annually granting the equivalent of about $5,000 to Canadian charities from every man, woman and child/pplkind of Canada, with no agreement or direction from those taxpayers/citizens. These contributions are purely at the discretion of government. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-2.pdfIt seems evident from the trends in funding that provincial governments have off-loaded a significant share of their programs onto the charity industry. They have done so, one can presume, because of the perception that this will lower costs. However, the expenditure of funds by arms-length organizations is subject to far less scrutiny by legislatures and by Auditors General than are those by government departments and agencies. As the WE Charity scandal has demonstrated, the use of outside charities is also more vulnerable to improper relationships between politicians and charity organizations. Charities in Canada must submit annual reports to the Canada Revenue Agency, but they are subject to far less detailed reporting, and therefore public scrutiny, than their counterparts in the United States. Further, as a result of recent court decisions, Canadian charities are virtually free to spend a large share of their funds on political activities, so long as they are not obviously partisan.Surely the time has come to impose a higher level of scrutiny on the operations and funding of charities in Canada and to impose some empirical tests on whether they in fact offer an efficient service that justifies the reduced accountability.  It should be clear by now that many of these ‘charities’ are first and foremost businesses – businesses that, contrary to their carefully manicured public image, subsist on government funding. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/07/environmental-charities-a-compilation-of-reports-on-their-finances-power-and-implications-for-canada/Updated Aug. 27, 2020 to correct “$900 million…almost a billion dollars…” [previous typo incorrectly stated it was a $900 billion grant program]https://youtu.be/WNjtPT5pUEk Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Canadian charities', 'climate change', 'We charity']",2020/08/26
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/08/17/protest-vs-green-trade-war-rebutting-environmental-defence/,,PROTEST VS GREEN TRADE WAR Rebutting Environmental Defence," In July 2020, Environmental Defence issued a paper entitled “Not Just a Canadian Phenomenon: Citizen opposition to oil and gas production around the world.” The objective of their document seems to be to try and draw a parallel between citizen protests in various countries against local oil/gas/coal/fracking concerns, and those of the Tar Sands Campaign in Canada. Environmental Defence implies that there is nothing unique about the decades-long Tar Sands Campaign against the Alberta oil sands. This report will disabuse the public of that notion. According to the Tar Sands Campaign documents, it appears to be unique in the world, well-funded, well-strategized, well-coordinated – in short, whether intended as such or not, the outcome is a ‘green’ trade war against Canada by various players and other opportunists.In most Western democracies, republics, or constitutional monarchies (like Canada), citizens have a legal right, enshrined in law, to peacefully protest.FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMSEveryone has the following fundamental freedoms:• (a) freedom of conscience and religion;• (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;• (c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and• (d) freedom of association.

According to Tar Sands Campaign documents, it has been about an internationally strategized and partially foreign-funded campaign to denigrate the reputation of the Alberta oil sands, to drive up costs, to drive off investors, to add more regulation, to block and delay infrastructure and energy development through law suits and coordinated group actions against legally authorized development projects. That is the difference between a protest and a trade war that Environmental Defence fails to clarify, and no wonder. According to this power point, Environmental Defence is part of the Tar Sands Campaign.https://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rockefeller-82144578-Tar-Sands-Presentation-July-2008.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Tar Sands Campaign']",2020/08/17

Lyman’s bio can be read  here. Recently, five Canadian Environmental Non-governmental Organizations (ENGOs), most of which are federally registered charities, came together to publish a demand for a Climate Accountability Law in Canada which would set legally enforceable targets for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reductions. The ENGOs are: Ecojustice, CANRAC (an organization of more than 100 ENGOs), West Coast Environmental Law, Equiterre, Environmental Defence, and Pembina Institute. To appreciate the power and influence of such a collaboration, one should read Robert Lyman’s  series of reports reviewing the financial power and new political freedoms of the top 40 ENGOs in Canada. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dark-Clouds-of-Conflicts-of-Interest-on-Climate-Accountability-Law-Aug-11-2020-REV-1.pdfDark-Clouds-of-Conflicts-of-Interest-on-Climate-Accountability-Law-Aug-11-2020-REV-1DownloadSubsequently, the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices, (formerly Ecofiscal Commission/Pan-Canadian Collaboration), issued a report on a similar theme entitled “Marking the Way: How Legislating Climate Milestones Clarifies Pathways to Long-Term Goals.” The objective of these groups’ demands for a climate accountability law would be to force Canadian industry (and Canadians) to meet the purely voluntary and aspirational targets that are based on the non-scientific claims of the COP21, 2015 Paris Agreement. It should be noted that environmental non-governmental organizations and environmental charities are unelected, unaccountable, and some – like WWF and Greenpeace – are transnational bodies that operate for their own objectives, not those of Canadian taxpayers and citizens.This paper will argue that under existing Competition Bureau and Canada Revenue Agency laws and guidelines, these organizations are greenwashing the public on the obligations of the Paris Agreement, using distorted claims about climate change and the misrepresenting the effectiveness of proposed climate mitigations like renewables. It is our view that these groups are acting against the interests of Canadians. The Premise – Meeting Paris TargetsBoth reports premise their argument for a “Climate Accountability Act” by focusing on an apparent need to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets laid out in the Paris Agreement.According to Ottawa energy policy consultant, Robert Lyman, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years, the Paris Agreement is entirely voluntary, aspirational, and Canada has no formal obligations to meet targets.As he writes in his report “Litigating Climate in Canada”:Canada ratified the Paris Agreement on October 5, 2016. Canada’s treaty obligations under that Agreement do not include any requirement that Canada: • meet any specific GHG emissions reduction target; • pay any penalty if it fails to meet its voluntary emissions reductions targets; • pay any specific amount or share of the collective financing for developing countries; • use any specific set of policy instruments (e.g. taxes, regulations, subsidies, etc.) in pursuing its voluntary emissions reductions goals.Consequently, other than creating another burdensome layer of government, populated with more public servants who will be counting carbon dioxide molecules, it is difficult to see why a Climate Accountability Law is required. Canada already has more than 600 different greenhouse gas reduction/’clean’ incentive regulations in place today, and Canada’s fuel tax is already more than $192/t carbon tax equivalent. A Questionable PurposeCanadians should challenge the fundamental rationale for legislating emissions reduction requirements. It is clear that no such obligation arises from the Canada’s political commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Very few other countries that are signatory to the Paris Agreement have imposed upon their citizens such legal obligations – certainly, none of the countries where the most rapid emissions growth is occurring, such as China and India.So, what would be the real purpose of the law?Canada does not need a law to establish a target. We already have done that. We do not need a law to establish a pan-Canadian Policy Framework; we already have that. We do not need a law to establish hundreds of programs; we already have those. We do not need a law to authorize a Canada-wide carbon dioxide pricing regime; we already have that. We do not need another law to imbed climate considerations into the regulatory framework that governs the review of new energy infrastructure projects; we already have that. We do not need a law to allow us to maintain records of the progress being made in reducing emissions; we already do that without a law.So, what is this really all about? What it means is that the proponents of such a law want to take decisions on climate policy and measures out of the hands of democratically elected governments and place them under the purview of the courts. They want to give environmental lobby groups and their foreign funders an additional weapon to use against energy producers and users – the ability to challenge in court new projects of any kind that increase emissions, and thus to add enormously to the costs and risks of all new resource developments or new emissions-intensive industrial plants in Canada. In other words, inspired by their ideological commitment to place emissions reduction above all other public policy objectives, they want a way to impose a legal strangle-hold on the Canadian economy. This represents is a fundamental attack on Canadians’ economic freedoms and Canadians’ best economic avenue and hope for recovery from the present economic recession. Canada needs to use our natural resources as powerful levers to grow our income and employment. Canada does not need another weapon that radical environmentalist with deep pockets and crafty lawyers can use against taxpaying workers and the Canadian economy.As Phillip Cross wrote of economist Robert Schiller, beware of powerful narratives that contradict the facts, noting that “Climate change is another powerful narrative fused with celebrity to brow-beat the public into accepting poor policies that are harmful to the economy and do little to change the climate.”This report will lay out the facts for your consideration.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate accountability law', 'climate change']",2020/08/11

Lyman’s bio can be read  here. This report has been reissued to update the emissions data on page 12.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY “…extraordinarily expensive and dangerous political grandstanding…. Canadians deserve better.”All major political parties in Canada publicly accept the thesis that humans are causing potentially catastrophic global warming and that Canada must “take action” to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, even if that imposes large costs on the Canadian economy. They implicitly accept the claims of proven science, low costs of mitigation and high environmental benefits.LINK to full report: Futile Folly FINALhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Futile-Folly-aug-2020-Reissued-FINAL.pdfFutile-Folly-aug-2020-Reissued-FINALDownloadThis paper challenges one of those claims; that is, that emissions reductions by Canada will have a beneficial effect on global emissions trends or, assuming one accepts the thesis that humans are the primary influence on climate, global temperatures.With verifiable facts and data, it demonstrates that: Global greenhouse gas emissions are increasing, not declining. The source of those increases is primarily the economic growth occurring in the developing countries. The growth of emissions in the developing countries far exceeds the reduction in emissions in the OECD countries. That growth is likely to continue. Many, if not most, developing countries will not honour their commitments at COP21, the United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change in 2015, to reduce emissions; these commitments were political, not legal. The developing country commitments were partly contingent on massive funding by the OECD countries, which will not be provided. Canadian emissions constitute a tiny percentage of global emissions; and The emissions reductions that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claims are necessary to avoid calamity are so large as to be impossible to meet in political, economic and technological terms. In short, the policies now being followed by federal and provincial governments in Canada amount to extraordinarily expensive and dangerous political grandstanding that will have no offsetting global environmental benefit.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change', 'GHG reduction targets']",2020/08/11
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/08/04/countering-andrew-leach-on-the-fiasco-that-is-albertas-energy-war-room/,Dr Francis Manns ,Countering Andrew Leach on “The fiasco that is Alberta’s energy ‘war room'”,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman ©  2020. Lyman’s bio can be read  here. Andrew Leach has an op-ed on CBC entitled “The fiasco that is Alberta’s energy ‘war room'”.Leach makes three arguments that those who are skeptical about current climate policy and supportive of Alberta’s oil and gas industry should counter. First, he argues that the numbers used to estimate the contribution of oil and gas to Canada’s GDP are exaggerated. Then he questions the value of the industry’s direct, indirect and imputed contribution to employment in Canada. Finally, he argues that the Alberta War Room will do nothing to convince opponents of Canada’s oil and gas industry to change their minds, nor to attract investment to Alberta.With respect to the contribution to GDP, the War Room may have erred by quoting Natural Resources Canada’s figures, a criticism more properly directed to NRCan. That hardly suggests that the industry’s contribution to GDP is inconsequential, especially to the economy of Alberta. Those same NRCan data sources show that the energy sector’s direct nominal GDP in Alberta was $75.2 billion in 2018. This was after three years of declines due both to reduced international oil prices and the injurious effect of federal and provincial government climate policies. Those policies impeded market access, added substantially to industry taxes and increased regulation. When governments choose, in the middle of a market downturn, to harm an industry’s investment prospects, it is not surprising that the sector’s contribution to provincial and national income declines.The public discussion about employment in the energy industries has becomes highly politicized. People like Mr. Leach like to trivialize the estimates of employment spinoffs because the largest effects often occur over two to three-year construction periods and the number of people required to operate a large capital-intensive project is far smaller. (The same people then ignore this consideration when it comes to the construction of wind and solar plants.) The best way to consider the employment effects of any project is in terms of person-years to employment, but this standard is rarely used because of the politics surrounding the issue. A more fundamental point is that, from an economic policy perspective, the goal is not to create as many jobs as possible, but rather to produce as much energy as possible at the lowest possible cost, and that means doing so with the fewest energy workers. The oil and gas industry features relatively lower employment but exceptionally high value-added, because of the high output of valuable products. The higher productivity, other things equal, justifies higher wages per worker.If Mr Leach really wished to assess the value of the oil and gas industry to Canada and Alberta, he would not just quibble about GDP and employment numbers but examine the sector’s impacts on other economic outputs. Oil and gas remains one of Canada’s largest sources of export earnings, which is why the value of the Canadian dollar is often influenced by changes in international oil prices. The contribution of the oil and gas industry to government revenues, even though reduced from the pre-2015 period, averaged $16.8 Billion per year over the 2013-2017 period, according to NRCan. Compare that with the taxes paid by the renewables industry, if you can find any evidence of it.Will the War Room convince the opponents of Alberta’s oil industry to change their minds? Not if their minds are closed to the facts concerning both the nature of the climate problem and the role that Canada’s oil industry plays in global emissions (hint: the oil sands in total constitute one one-thousandth of global GHG emissions). Will the War Room attract investment to Alberta? Who can say, when the environmental lobbyists and certain international financial institutions ally with the Trudeau government to make the investments less attractive? Should Albertans and other Canadians fight to overcome these obstacles to prosperity? Hell, yes!https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Futile-Folly-aug-2020-Reissued-FINAL.pdfRobert Lyman is an economist with 35 years’ experience as an analyst, policy advisor and manager in the Canadian federal government, primarily in the areas of energy, transportation and environmental policy.

This is the last part of his planned controversial trilogy. September 17th the film will be broadcast via the You Tube channel Friends of Science for free. Poels will also screen his film in the European Parliament in Brussels on 30 September. In 2017, his notorious first part “The Uncertainty Has Settled” appeared. In it, Poels discussed various scientific assumptions about climate change and also visited climate critics. This film left him with hundreds of hate mails and threats from activists. In many places the film was refused and taken out of cinemas under political pressure. Independent filmmaker Marijn Poels, on location during filming of “Return to Eden”That’s why he decided to produce his second part “Paradogma” where he investigated the toxic state of the current public debate and made themes such as polarisation, conformism and intolerance visible. In the third part “Return to Eden”, Poels returns to climate change and agriculture. In more than 100 minutes he asks the question to what extent we humans are part of nature and where the boundaries lie in the urge to regulate climate, nature and our food supply. Is climate change really a problem or just a distraction from the real problem? In order to find out, he travels through Europe, Africa and America and visits inspiring experts in search for understanding, solutions, and hope. Far away from collective climate hysteria, fear and chaos, there is hope, inspiration and solutions. Across political colours. Averse to framing. Full of deep wisdom from people who approach solutions ecologically. Marijn Poels on location during production of “Return to Eden”Where the globalised farmer is strangled between government subsidies, banks and buyers and sucked into the core of the problem, the independent entrepreneur grows his local food in an inspiring way, in the middle of the desert. And that may well offer more solutions than just for our food. A healthy, living soil consumes large quantities of CO2. But can it even go a step further? Can healthy soil calm the climate and even prevent hurricanes? “The boundary between regulating and manipulating is razor-thin,” says Poels. “As citizens, we have to guard these lines very critically. Especially in agriculture. Sustainability and CO2, in particular, can indefinitely be misused as tools to push global political agendas. Centralization of power, agriculture and our food is ripping us further apart from our biological and natural balance. Common sense can be quickly confused with spreadsheets and technology. Chaos can grow very well on those. The technological revolution is an exciting direction which is not essentially wrong. But to what extent does our technology now support life? “Today’s technologies can imperceptibly swallow culture, agriculture, identity and turn our daily system into chaos. Creativity, freedom, innovation, and fundamental biological connections are at great risk. “We are the only species on earth rapidly separating themselves from their biological origins. Is that clever and where is the boundary?” That is what Poels is trying to discover in a thought-provoking story which will be online after September 17th.Marijn Poels is an independent filmmaker.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/07/23/you-wont-die-from-climate-change-heres-why/,Andrew Roman ,You Won’t Die from Climate Change. Here’s Why,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman ©  2020. Lyman’s bio can be read  here. The media often report stories intended to scare people about the possible effects of climate change. Some of these stories are based on the statements of scientists who should know what they are talking about but in fact are relying on mistaken information. The purpose of this note is to explain, in relatively simple terms, why people should not be frightened.The global climate has been changing for billions of years, as long as the earth has existed. Climate change is driven by dozens of natural influences, including solar cycles, the relationship between the oceans and the atmosphere, clouds, aerosols in the atmosphere, land and water disturbances and the presence in the atmosphere of certain gases. One of the gases is carbon dioxide, which is present in trace amounts of just over 400 parts per million. The claims that the world may be dangerously warming are based on the view that human-caused carbon dioxide emissions have a larger effect than all the other sources of natural climate variability. This is an unproven theory, not a fact.There are many reasons why this theory is false. Fundamentally, there are no empirical data (i.e. proof) that carbon dioxide has been or ever will be one of the main drivers of climate change. Global temperatures have risen and fallen for millions of years in ways totally unrelated to human emissions, which only began to increase significantly in the middle of the 19th century. Average global temperatures were as high or higher than they are today 1000, 1500, and 2000 years ago.Nonetheless, people have tended to focus on what has happened over the last 150 years and what might happen in the future. Since 1850, in fact, average global temperatures (to the extent that we can actually measure them) have risen just over one degree Celsius. This is well within the range of natural variability. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an international organization formed around 1990, was mandated by governments to examine the climate exclusively in terms of human influence. The actual trends in temperature show no reason to believe that the climate is changing in harmful ways. The alarm comes from the way the IPCC forecasts future temperatures. It does so by using a series of mathematical models. The IPCC assumes, incorrectly, that the models it uses to project future climates are based on a perfect knowledge; they are not. Computer models are a collection of best guesses; they do not “prove” anything. To imagine what might happen if their assumptions were correct, the modelers made up some scenarios. The scenarios are based on Transient Climate Response (TCR) defined as global average surface warming of a doubling of CO2 concentrations at that time, which is about 130 years. The IPCC estimates that the TCR probably falls in the range of 1.0 to 2.5 °C . Whenever you read a story about how we are headed toward catastrophe if we continue living “business as usual” (meaning if we do not sharply slash carbon dioxide emissions), the reports are almost always referring to one of the IPCC scenarios called Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, or RCP8.5. What you will not be told is that RCP8.5 is an implausible worst-case scenario that was never meant to represent a likely outcome. You also will not be told that scientists have been severely criticizing the use of RCP8.5 as a predictor of doom. For example, since 2000 world coal consumption has risen about 30% and is now slowly declining. The RCP8.5 scenario instead projects coal use to double by 2060 and almost triple by 2070. This is completely counter to current trends and the predictions of all authoritative sources of global energy analysis; it borders on the impossible. Yet, this is what the “Extinction Rebellion” and journalists who claim we will all soon die rely on.The flaw with constructing possible scenarios is that some people imagine them to be predictions rather than possibilities. So, instead of informing governments and the public about what potentially could happen, they become interpreted as warnings of disaster. This is exactly what happened. More recent studies of the TCR from the historical climate record obtain values of the TCR of about 0.85 °C with a range from 0.62 to 1.07 °C. In other words, a doubling of CO2 emissions would raise global temperatures but cause no catastrophe. Moreover, the actual temperature changes since 1990 have been less than half those projected by the models; i.e. the models run “too hot”. To further complicate matters, climate model projections for the 21st century focus only on the effects of human CO2 emissions, and make no attempt to predict climate variations from the natural sources, even though we seem to be entering a period of reduced solar activity that will reduce average global temperatures.So, let’s state the facts instead.First, no credible scientific body has ever said that climate change threatens the collapse of civilization, much less the extinction of the human species. Even if one reads through every IPCC report, you will find no reference to billions of people dying. Second, some people warn about short term disasters and claim that extreme weather events are being caused by climate change. Yet, the IPCC, while acknowledging that weather-related disasters occur, finds “limited evidence that climate change or sea-level rise is the direct cause”. In fact, there has been a 99.7% decline in the death toll from natural disasters since 1931.Third, humans today produce enough food for 10 billion people, or 25% more than we need, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization forecasts crop yields increasing 30% by 2050.Even the IPCC projects that the global economy will be 300 to 500% larger than it is today by 2100. If there are some adverse effects of climate change, the world will have the income needed to adapt. So, don’t panic. You are not “gonna die” from climate change.Appendix 1What About All the Warnings in Movies Like “An Inconvenient Truth”?There are a number of highly credible scientific organizations that have analyzed the effects of current climate trends. These include notably the Non-Governmental International Panel on Climate Change and CLINTEL, an international group of ~900 scientists with headquarters based in Europe. For a short-form version of the analysis, done in a “fact-checking” style, you can read the rebuttals posted by ACRESEARCH online. For each claim of alarm, here is a short statement of the actual trends.Sea levels – sea levels have been rising slowly since the last Ice age, and are now rising at about 9 inches per century; where the rate is increasing it is largely due to local factors such as land subsidence (i.e. sinking).Heat waves – Heat waves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the US and globally.Hurricanes – The decade just ended is the second quietest for landfalling hurricanes since the 1850s.Tornados – The number of strong tornados has declined over the last half century.Droughts and floods – There are no statistically significant trends.Snowfall – Contrary to claims snowfall would end, it has been increasing in the fall and winter in the Northern Hemisphere and North America, with many records being set.Arctic, Antarctic and Greenland Ice – The polar ice varies with multidecadal cycles in ocean temperatures. Current levels are comparable to or above historical low levels. Ocean “acidification” – The ocean PH levels have changed to become very slightly less alkaline over the last century, which is a non-problemPolar bears – Polar bear populations in the Canadian Arctic are well above levels of fifty years ago.

WildeDo you believe in the existence of the night? Is it likely that a mathematical process that relies on the suspension of belief in the reality of one of our most fundamental natural experiences can be true? Put more simply, if you were asked to believe that the sun shines on to the ground at night, how would you respond?By Anonymous – Camille Flammarion, L’Atmosphère: Météorologie Populaire (Paris, 1888), pp. 163., Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=318054 When we approach the issue of the reality of night, we are acknowledging the existence of the earth’s shadow, for that is precisely what night is; it is the realm of the shadow, the place where the sun does not directly shine. The night is the environment of cold, the dark side of our world, the antithesis of the warmth of the sunlit day.In the application of science to the study of the natural world we seek to identify the fundamental elements of the process we are analysing. In the case of climate, the study of the process of the heating of the surface of the earth by the warm light of the sun, the irreducible fundamental division on the surface of our world is the presence of the warm sunlit day and its equal and opposite partner, the cold dark of the night.The process of reductio ad absurdam lies at the heart of the mechanism by which an assertion can be shown to be false. This simple and powerful technique, known and used by the Greeks of the ancient world, has been ignored by climate scientists who sing the siren song of absurdity; that the powerful sunlight of the day must be reduced in intensity, by averaging to a feeble twilight, because over the course of a year, the sunlight falls on every part of the surface of the earth.So, in climate science there is no day or night, just a single uniform dimly lit surface environment, a twilight zone of the simmer dim as the Shetland Islanders would call it. How did this ludicrous nonsense of averaging the strength of sunlight into feeble insignificance arise, and what is the implication of its adoption as a false logical truth? Climate science takes as its fundamental cause the so-called vacuum planet equation. This calculation was devised by astronomers to determine the surface temperature of a planet with no atmosphere floating in the vacuum of space. With the algorithm, and assuming that rapid daily rotation of the solid surface occurs, it is possible to calculate the average surface temperature of a vacuum planet by measuring its heat rays, or more accurately its thermal radiant emission to space. While this astronomical equation is a noble contribution to science, its adoption by climate scientists as the fundamental metric of climate has not one, but at least two egregious errors.First, and most obviously the earth is not a vacuum planet, it has a perceptible atmosphere of mobile gases as well as a significant surface covering of ocean water. In truth our home planet can be more accurately described as a world of liquid water, rather than one of solid earth.The second error is more subtle but no less damaging. By adding an atmosphere to a vacuum planet, climate science assumes a fundamental hierarchy of cause as to the means of distributing heat around the globe. This hierarchy is planetary rotation first and planetary atmosphere second, with no account made for the ability of a mobile atmosphere to distribute heat around the globe. When we approach the question of how this basic thesis of the vacuum planet equation can be applied to a slowly rotating tidally locked planet that has an atmosphere, climate science has no answer. This is because no account is taken of the lateral energy distributing capability of a mobile atmosphere.Even the great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov incorrectly assumed that on the dark side of his imagined tidally locked Ribbon World, where the sun never shone “the oxygen would run like water” (thereby completely ignoring the ability of a mobile atmosphere in transferring energy from one side to the other and back again).Reality has a habit of disabusing our imaginings. There are two terrestrial worlds in our solar system that both have an atmosphere and are also slow rotators, the planet Venus and the Saturnian moon Titan. Both worlds possess uniform surface temperatures with a minimal diurnal range, and a heat transport atmospheric circulation system that extends from the equator to the poles of rotation. From this we can deduce two things:That on slowly rotating terrestrial planets and moons with an atmosphere, the lack of a diurnal temperature range shows that it is the mobile non condensing atmosphere of meteorology that distributes the intercepted solar energy from the sunlit side to the dark night side. It is not the daily rotation of the solid surface that distributes the energy as required by astronomy and climate science, because this mechanism is too slow.That it is the thermally driven atmospheric circulation cell which is the fundamental meteorological element of climate. This second point is critical to the argument as to the nature of climate.The definition of climate as a simple average of weather is disingenuous. The original ancient Greek concept of climate referred to the slope of the face of the earth that is exposed to the rays of the sun. Aristotle identified just three climatic zones, and our modern meteorological understanding of the location of the earth’s three atmospheric circulation cells, leads naturally to a definition of climate as the presence and action of an atmospheric circulation cell over the surface of a planet. Aristotle would not have known of the earth’s three atmospheric circulation cells, but could perceive their three dissimilar effects on the surface across the then known world.So, what about the issue of the strength of the sunlight? The meteorological process of climate is the consequence of the action of the weather machine, a gigantic heat engine made of air and powered by sunlight, the driving force, but restricted by planetary gravity and daily rotation rate, the restraining forces.As with any heat engine the temperature of the exhaust is always lower than the temperature of the powering gases. This must be true, else the machine would not be capable of producing work. The weather machine of our planet clearly does produce work, the driving motion of the trade winds, the lifting of water to the tops of every mountain range on the planet is proof of this assertion. In fact, the weather machine would still be inevitable even with no radiative gases in the atmosphere at all, because the driving force emanates from temperature and density differentials in the horizontal plane.The vacuum planet equation of astronomy only measures the thermal radiant exhaust temperature of a planet, so it does not measure the temperature of a surface beneath a mobile atmosphere. As its vacuum name implies this boundary is at the top of the atmosphere which is in contact with the vacuum of space. The meteorological process at the surface requires the undiluted power of the sunlight, plus an additional permanently retained quantity within the atmosphere to provide the total internal energy needed to perform its function. This retention of energy within the atmospheric reservoir results in a higher surface temperature. So, the idea that the sunlight strength of the lit hemisphere must be diluted by four prior to calculating the surface temperature, because that gives the relative size of the exhaust radiator is clearly false. The mobile atmospheric system obviously needs an additional component of retained energy at the surface for it to maintain that mobility.Once we remove the false need to dilute sunlight intensity by four, then there is no need to restore power to the atmospheric heat engine by back-radiation as the established paradigm of greenhouse gases requires. The greenhouse gas conjecture of thermal radiant opacity as the mechanism to restore the unnecessary loss of power to the atmosphere is a phantom process more insubstantial than the gas it purports to heat.The proof of this assertion is the existence of slowly rotating planets with an insignificant temperature differential between the lit and unlit sides. The slow rotation means that the cause of that difference cannot be back radiation because back radiation requires rapid daily rotation to transfer energy from one side to the other. No rapid rotation means it is atmospheric motion and not solar illumination that provides the indirect heating for half of the planet, and thus there is no back radiation on the unlit side.This leaves the mobility of the atmosphere as the universal cause of the enhanced surface temperature at the basal boundary beneath all forms of atmosphere, and on all types of terrestrial bodies. In that respect, we refer readers to our various Research Gate papers at this link:https://www.researchgate.net/project/Dynamic-Atmosphere-Energy-Transport-Climate-ModelThis work fully describes the relevant mass motion mechanism for a range of different terrestrial bodies and atmospheres in space, and also to our latest International Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences paper “Return to Earth: A New Mathematical Model of the Earth’s Climate” published here.Philip MulhollandStephen P.R. WildeA piercingly bright curtain of stars is the backdrop for this beautiful image taken by astronomer Håkon Dahle. The silhouetted figure in the foreground is Håkon himself surrounded by just a couple of the great dark domes that litter the mountain of ESO’s La Silla Observatory. Many professional astronomers are also keen photographers — and who could blame them? ESO sites in the Atacama Desert are among the best places on Earth for observing the stars, and for the same reason, are amazing places for photographing the night sky. Håkon took these photos while on a week-long observing run at the MPG/ESO 2.2 -telescope. During this time, the telescope was occasionally handed over to a different observing team, giving Håkon the opportunity to admire the starry night — as well as to capture it for the rest of us to see. The Milky Way is brighter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North, because of the way our planet’s southern regions point towards the dense galactic centre. But even in the South, the Milky Way in the night sky is quite faint in the sky. For most of us, light pollution from our cities and even the Moon can outshine the faint glow of the galaxy, hiding it from view. One of the best aspects of La Silla Observatory is that it is far away from bright city lights, giving it some of the darkest night skies on Earth. The atmosphere is also very clear, so there is no haze to further muddy your vision. The skies at La Silla are so dark that it is possible to see a shadow cast by the light of the Milky Way alone. Håkon submitted this photograph to the Your ESO Pictures Flickr group. The Flickr group is regularly reviewed and the best photos are selected to be featured in our popular Picture of the Week series, or in our gallery.By ESO/H.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/07/20/the-clean-fuel-standard-the-latest-in-climate-pancaking/,Dr Francis Manns ,The Clean Fuel Standard – The Latest in Climate Pancaking,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman ©  2020. Lyman’s bio can be read  here. Executive SummaryCompanies that have been adversely affected by multiple climate policy measures sometimes refer to the process as “policy layering” or “pancaking”. One of the newest and most damaging examples of this is the federal government’s Clean Fuel Standard.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/THE-CLEAN-FUEL-STANDARD-FINAL.pdfTHE-CLEAN-FUEL-STANDARD-FINALDownloadThe Clean Fuel Standard (CFS), for which only the proposed regulatory approach has been published so far, is not the same as the motor vehicle fuel emissions standards. Those standards apply to motor vehicle manufacturers and Importers. The CFS is a system of regulations affecting the suppliers of fossil fuel products – generally oil, natural gas and coal -used as energy sources. The suppliers will be required to reduce the annual carbon dioxide “intensity” of the fuels every year, based on a standard and schedule of reductions set by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The “intensity standard” measures the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy output, but with a twist. The fuel companies will be regulated on the basis of the emissions from the entire fuel cycle. In other words, in the case of a gasoline supplier, he or she will be held accountable for the emissions per unit of the gasoline taking into account the emissions at the production, transportation, refining, marketing, distribution, and final combustion stages. Just trying to figure out what these intensities are will prove challenging. ECCC will use a new mathematic model, along with an extensive system of data collection, to determine what is the “right” emissions intensity and what is the “right” rate at which fuel suppliers will be required to lower it. To do this, fuel suppliers will be expected to change their own operations and those of their sources of supply, but they will also have a limited option to meet the requirements by buying credits from low-emission energy sources. These are the usual beneficiaries of government climate measures – wind, solar, ethanol, biomass, electric vehicles, and other industries. The credits, in effect, are backdoor subsidies to the “green” industries. There will be an elaborate system for verification, validation, certification, and compliance. The CFS will raise the cost of fossil fuel energy and thereby, in theory, lead to reduced use of fossil fuels and increased investment in lower-emissions energy sources. This is exactly what the carbon dioxide pricing system was intended to do. In fact, while the regulatory mechanisms are different, the CFS is so like carbon taxes, output-based pricing systems and emissions trading systems (the various forms of carbon dioxide pricing) that one can fairly call it a duplication. Based on experience with more limited Clean Fuel Standards used in California and British Columbia, the federal CFS may have the effect of doubling the cost of carbon taxes.The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has published an excellent analysis and commentary on the proposed CFS based on what has been published so far (the draft regulations are not yet available). The Chamber cautioned that the “pathways to compliance are inefficient and overly prescriptive” and the “pancaking of different carbon prices and increased cost of compliance from jurisdiction overlaps will needlessly raise the costs of compliance for Canadian businesses.” The Chamber also warned that the differences in the availability of “credits” in different provinces may cause some provinces to be much higher cost jurisdictions in which to operate. The complexity of the regulatory system proposed resides in its many components, its use of unfamiliar procedures and modelling approaches, its requirements for large amounts of data, its difficult-to-understand inter-relationships with existing programs and credit systems and its reporting system. In this respect, it is reminiscent of programs implemented under the 1980’s National Energy Program. The CFS is arguably more important for its economic impact on Canadian business firms, and especially the emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries, than it is for emissions reduction. Yet, its administration is being handled by ECCC, a science-based department of government whose Minister and political staff have shown themselves to be very closely aligned with and influenced by environmental non-governmental organizations. One might have thought that, if such a measure were really required, it could be delivered by a new organization with an economic as well as environmental policy mandate that stood at arms’ length from the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change. The CFS adds to the 237 existing federal and provincial climate policies and measures. This will make it difficult to assess its incremental effect and cost. The addition of such a complex regulatory regime demonstrates remarkable confidence in the computer modeling skills and policy judgment of ECCC officials. We shall see whether that is warranted.Image licensed from Shutterstock.

The term ‘climate deniers’ used by Climate Power 2020 is inappropriate as persons who challenge the paradigm of dangerous climate change do not deny that climate changes or that human-caused carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions cause some climate change. The vast majority of skeptical climate scientists use empirical data to show that natural climate change is large, and the climate is much less sensitive to CO2 emissions than that claimed by the IPCC and that there is no climate crisis.Effectively, the non-scientist activists of Climate Power ask you to defy the National Academies of Science principle of responsible conduct in research and scientific inquiry – that being:  “Science has progressed through a uniquely productive marriage of human creativity and hard-nosed skepticism, of openness to new scientific contributions and persistent questioning of those contributions and the existing scientific consensus.”Ms. Thorning-Schmidt must certainly be aware of the work of Dr. Bjorn Lomborg. In his new book “False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet”, Dr. Lomborg references the science of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and uses their model to show that the Paris Agreement, even if all parties met the objectives and targets, would result in a minuscule reduction in warming, and yet would cost trillions. Lomborg uses the economic analysis of Nobel Laureate William Nordhaus to show that climate damages by engaging in adaptation would be nominal and the benefits would be many, compared to pushing ahead with concepts like a ‘Green New Deal”. He demonstrates that renewables are not the answer to climate change and that they do not provide suitable power for modern society. He supports adaptation over mitigation, common sense over climate fear. He explains why there is no climate emergency.This is the type of vital information for society that Friends of Science Society has provided since 2002. More recently, an independent organization called “CLINTEL – climate intelligence” has formed in The Netherlands, under the direction of Prof. Guus Berkhout and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, both highly esteemed scientists, scholars, and public policy experts in Europe. CLINTEL now includes an international collection of some ~900 scientists, scholars, and professionals who hold the view that there is no climate emergency, that we ‘do have time’, and that natural factors are more influential on climate change than human industrial emissions of carbon dioxide. Facebook has blocked our popular video (>700,000 views) that simply reports on the origins of this group and their first press release. To block the message of these (then) 500 scientists, Facebook relies on the assessment of a handful of partisan climate activist scientists of “Climate Feedback”/”Science Feedback”, rather than allowing the public to evaluate the views of the now ~900 CLINTEL scientists. How is this democratic or rational on the part of Facebook?As noted in the activists’ open letter to you, climate change is a fact. The ratio of human vs natural influence has not been determined. The climate sensitivity of carbon dioxide (warming effect) is in question. Climate change science addresses a complex, non-linear, chaotic system. The science is far from settled.Freedom of expression is a human right under the UN Charter, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the US Constitution, and the EU Parliament.In 2002, our scientific advisor, Dr. Madhav Khandekar, a 40 year veteran research scientist of Environment Canada, former WMO regional expert, and acknowledged world expert on the monsoon phenomenon, did a literature review for the Alberta government assessing the “Uncertainties in the Greenhouse Gas Theory of Climate Change.” In a 2018 interview with him, he noted that now there are many more uncertainties.Dutch filmmaker Marijn Poels framed it best in his two films “The Uncertainty Has Settled” and “Paradogma”. In “The Uncertainty Has Settled” he talked with Dr. Hans von Storch who agreed that human caused climate change was an issue for society, but probably not the most important one. Poels interviewed physicist Freeman Dyson who noted that climate models are useful for understanding climate change, but useless for predicting it. Yet public policy is set based on climate models – often referencing the least likely scenario, RCP 8.5, which has been promoted by green billionaires. In Poels’ film “Paradogma” he shows why ‘heretics’ are vital to society.In NATURE, a group of mainstream climate science leaders called for the authors of the IPCC SR1.5 report to speak out and calm the ‘climate emergency’ claims and the climate deadline media-hyped fear of an existential end, writing: “The imagery of deadlines and countdown clocks offers an illusory cliff-edge after which the world heads inevitably to its imminent demise. It promulgates the imaginary of extinction and the collapse of civilization. The impacts of climate change are more likely to be intermittent, slow and gradual.” This information is not front-page news on Facebook. If anything, the frightening claims of Greta Thunberg proliferate, a young woman being exploited as a proxy for a carbon offset/social media/social engineering platform. Her passionate, fearful diatribes are considered to be acceptable by Facebook, but the rational, evidence-based views of qualified, dissenting scientists are not?More recently, climate activists like Michael Shellenberger and Michael Moore have taken a critical look at the climate change dogmas they supported for years and have found them wanting. Facebook is deplatforming our site for posting Shellenberger’s statement. But the things Shellenberger is saying are echoed by Dr. Lomborg and his team of economists and researchers, and by the ~900 scientists and scholars of CLINTEL. These are things we have been saying since 2002 in the published APEGA debate with the Pembina Institute.The principle of CLINTEL is “Audiatur et altera pars” – Let Both Sides Be Heard.This is what we ask of you. Respect the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and national constitutional and charter rights of Freedom of Speech. Respect the National Academies of Sciences principle that ‘hard-nosed skepticism’ and ‘persistent questioning’ is how science progresses. Stop deplatforming and censoring rational, dissenting scientific views on climate change and related energy policies. By doing so, you are creating a Climate Lysenkoism and we only need look at history to see where this leads. This issue must not be taken lightly.“In the terrible history of famines in the world, no substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent and democratic country with a relatively free press. We cannot find exceptions to this rule, no matter where we look: the recent famines of Ethiopia, Somalia, or other dictatorial regimes; famines in the Soviet Union in the 1930’s; China’s 1958-61 famine with the failure of the Great Leap Forward; or earlier still, the famines in Ireland or India under alien rule. China, although it was in many wasy doing much better economically than India, still managed, unlike India, to have a famine, indeed the largest recorded famine in world history. Nearly 30 million people died in the famine of 1958-1961, while faulty governmental policies remained uncorrected for three years. The policies went uncriticized because there were no opposition parties in parliament, no free press, and no multiparty elections. Indeed, it is precisely this lack of challenge that allowed the deeply defective policies to continue even though they were killing millions of people each year.”–Amartya Sen, Nobel Prize for economics “Democracy as a Universal Value” (1999)Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETYPrevious open letters and videos to Facebook on Poynter Institute, the International Fact Checking Network and Climate Feedback Analysis of Climate Feedback Response to 500 Scientists’ Declaration to UN “There is No Climate Emergency” Nov. 12, 2019Analysis of Climate Feedback Response to 500 Scientists’ Declaration to UN “There is No Climate Emergency”An Open Letter to Poynter Institute and Facebook – Fuel and Poor Forest Management is the Main Factor in Australian Wildfires, Not Human-caused Climate Change Jan 13, 2020An Open Letter to Poynter Institute and Facebook – Fuel and Poor Forest Management is the Main Factor in Australian Wildfires, Not Human-caused Climate ChangeFacebook Censors Free Speech Feb. 14, 2020Clintel.org – Checking the Facts and Ethics of the International Fact-Checking Network of Poynter Institute April 2, 2020Clintel.org – Checking the Facts and Ethics of the International Fact-Checking Network of Poynter InstituteShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Freedom of Speech']",2020/07/10
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/07/06/a-rebuttal-of-the-short-list-by-michael-barnard/,Bob Lyman ,A Rebuttal of “The Short List” by Michael Barnard," Contributed by Kent Zehr © 2020.IntroductionA friend sent me the article “The Short List” by writer Michael Barnard. I read the article, and as I am an electrical engineer with more than forty years experience in the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electricity I was more than a little interested in the facile and simplistic treatment of some very complex issues. Interested enough to write this rebuttal which uses the same section titles as written by Mr. Barnard in his article.Electrify everythingIgnoring for the moment the outright mistakes and over-simplifications in this section, the most egregious error comes from the statement that “the US throws away two thirds of all primary energy”. The article goes on to say that “We only have to replace a third” making it sound like that is an easy thing to do, implying, why not? The reality is that the US used about 2,400,000 ktoe (a very large unit of energy) in 2018 according to the International Energy Agency. Now, that same agency for that same year reports that biofuels and waste accounted for 107,251 ktoe, nuclear accounted for 219,216 ktoe, and solar and wind combined accounted for 44,915 ktoe.Image licensed from Shutterstock. The remainder, about 2,000,000 ktoe, is produced from oil, gas and coal. Well, since, according to Mr. Barnard, we only need to replace a third of that, we only need an additional 650,000 ktoe of solar and wind power to replace that. Which of course means that we would need to increase the existing solar and wind capacity by a mere 1,400 %, yes, fourteen times, what it is currently. Such an increase would force the relocation of tens of millions of people from Florida to California and would destroy the agricultural capacity of much of that area as well since using land for solar power prevents all other uses. Good luck with that!Even if a substantial portion of the increase was to come from windmills, such an accumulation of windmills would undoubtedly alter normal wind patterns resulting in unknown but not likely benign climate changes elsewhere and comes with its own seeds of environmental disaster in the disposal of worn out windmill parts.Overbuild renewable generationOther forms of generation were indeed overbuilt, for the good and valid reason that the overbuilding created redundancy which lead to nearly perfect reliability of supply. There have been rare, very rare, instances of power outages affecting some parts of North America and Europe, for example, but in no case has a whole country suffered a complete blackout for a material time duration and indeed, in North America no country has ever been completely blacked out.That redundancy was achieved with a mix of power generation that includes hydro, nuclear, coal, and gas, networked together over large areas virtually eliminating single points of failure that could affect large areas for long periods.Wind and solar do not offer that same redundancy since for at least half the time there is no sun shining, and for some or all of that time the wind may not blow. The last major power outage that affected almost all of Germany and Denmark was in fact related to a cloudy day and the wind stopped blowing. Germany has since restarted some coal plants and is re-examining nuclear generation.So simply overbuilding solar and wind, putting all your eggs in the same basket, is not a recipe for success in the power generation business. As for the cost estimate proposed for this monumental undertaking, considering the very low energy density possible with solar or wind, it is unlikely that a significant part of the vast amount of real estate required could be obtained for that amount of money, never mind the cost of connecting all that low density generation to the remaining load concentrations. Rose colored glasses are not appropriate wear for power engineers.Build continent-scale electrical grids and marketsHVDC, high voltage direct current, transmission is definitely a real thing done daily in many places for very valid reasons. It is not, however, magic, and is subject to the same physical laws as the alternating current power lines in common use. The physical laws, while exactly the same, apply in different ways not necessarily as benign as Mr. Barnard seems to think.A recently completed conceptual design for such a continent-spanning line used an estimated length of 2,500 kilometers. The line design was specifically modified to take the most advantage of the direct current character and was sized to deliver sufficient power to replace two or three typical coal fired generating units. In spite of the specific optimization, over the continent-scale, the line losses (waste heat mainly) amounted to eighteen percent (18%), of the input power. Based on real-world input power costs, the delivered power would have been too highly priced to be viable and replaced at most only a few coal fired generators. Adding more lines will not improve the physics or the price of delivered power.Build a fair amount of hydro storage Mr. Barnard states pumped hydro storage is efficient. If we ignore the losses in the transmission line bringing energy to be stored in a hydro dam, we can estimate the efficiency of the process simply as follows:In other words, for every 10 megawatts of excess generation we want to store using pumped hydro, more than 4 megawatts will disappear as waste heat in the process, so we can supply 10, but we only get back 6 out of storage, and that’s only if we ignore the transmission line losses, that apply in and out. As a business model, imagine you want to save $10 in your local bank. Now imagine if it costs you $1 to get to the bank, so you need $11 starting out. You put your $10 in the bank after you get it there. When you want to get it out, guess what, they only give you $6 back. And then they charge you another $1 to get out of the bank. So, you end up with $5. Why would you not want to do this every day?With respect to battery storage, if the world is trying to electrify transportation, requiring huge numbers of large and larger batteries, the price competition for the supplies of lithium and cobalt, the most widely used elements in batteries, will become untenable given their very few sources in the world.In other words, the diversity and reliability of the current electrical generation system will not be equaled by simply increasing wind and solar sources. Plant a lot of treesSounds easy, until you remember that mankind cut down those trees Mr. Barnard so blithely wants to replace so that we could grow food and build travel ways and towns. So, no, planting a trillion trees will not happen unless we stop food production and living on the surface of the planet.Change agricultural practicesOnly subsistence level farmers practice high-tillage agriculture. The farms that feed the bulk of humanity have been progressing to, not minimum tillage as is advocated, but to zero tillage in a process that began at least 30 years ago in North America. However, the difference this makes to how much carbon is sequestered over long enough time frames is debatable. Sooner or later all the organic material that can be stored in the soil, is, and some is broken down for nutrients every crop cycle, releasing store carbon.Zero tillage is much more energy efficient though, so there was a definite gain, but it is mainly in the past and not helpful going forward.Fix concrete and steelThe process of making Portland cement was invented by the Romans and the process has not changed except for the process machinery used. Limestone or gypsum is heated to first drive out the moisture inherent in any natural substance, and then to drive the carbonates apart freeing them up for future re-bonding to make concrete. It sounds simple until the tonnage made around the world every day is considered. Adding heat in the quantities required is easily done with larger burners blowing into rotating kilns and the exhaust gases are sucked out by a large fan. The blower, the rotator, and the exhaust fan are all normally electrically driven in conventional practice. What is not electric is the heat source, usually oil, coal, or gas, and the usual electric heating elements everyone is familiar with are not capable of the necessary input volume at the required temperature, even scaled up many times. Large plasma heaters have been built that turn electricity into super hot plasma which can then be blown/sucked into the kiln.But, in the large quantity of air sucked into the kiln to absorb the intense heat of the plasma, the nitrogen will inevitably be combined with the oxygen present producing nitrous oxides which will then be able to combine with the moisture as it is driven off and be evacuated as nitrous acid. Acid rain anyone? Reworking the process machinery to reduce the plasma temperature so these normal reactions do not take place will be very expensive and not simple at all. Making steel is a different prospect completely. Yes, there are many electric minimills around, as stated by Mr. Barnard, that turn scrap recovered steel into new steel products. That process will simply not work for the smelting of iron ore as those ores are normally good to excellent electrical insulators as opposed to scrap steel, (and in fact, are applied as insulators in some electrical services). But, again a but, the installed weight of steel around the world grows more-or-less constantly, requiring new steel to be made from iron ore, not only for new work, but also for critical applications where the contaminants from scrap steel are not acceptable. The process of making the millions of tonnes of so-called virgin steel is not a new process but requires two steps, first to melt the iron ore and burn out most of the impurities by heating them in a blast furnace where the ore must be supported on top of the fuel for the heat. That fuel is coke, manufactured from coal, carefully made, such that it retains its necessary strength and resistance to crushing, even while burning at white hot temperatures, so that it can support the weight of the ore and the flux materials above it in the furnace. World wide trade in “coking” coal runs to hundreds of millions of tonnes every year to support this process. No one has succeeded in remaking this process to use anything else in spite of many years of driven research.There is no simple or easy answer to electrifying more of the steel making process.Price carbon aggressivelyTaxing carbon dioxide production, and make no mistake, it is a tax, not a “price” affects the base costs of almost all modern day activities. The farmer raising your food pays it for fuel, the trucker hauling your food to the city you live in pays another tax for his fuel, everything that interacts with your food pays the tax unless completely electric and all the electricity used is from carbon free sources, very unlikely in most of the world, first and third. So, unlike a value-added tax with rebates for taxes paid on inputs, the carbon taxes as-implemented result in a compounding of input costs. Governments often start out by rebating taxes to people who did not pay them as a way to say they did not harm lower-income families, but the eventual reality usually has been that the taxes become just another income stream. If increasing input costs, diminishing investment opportunities, and reducing employment levels are the desired outcomes, then pricing carbon aggressively is the way to get there.Shut down coal and gas generation aggressivelyIf you still believe that everything can be electrified as easily as Mr. Barnard stated in his opening paragraphs, then there will be no need to shut down coal and gas generation because they will be priced out of business. But of course, that nonsense has already been dismissed. Aggressively shutting down coal and gas generation will result in many people freezing in the dark.As a final note, biologically sourced methane produces exactly the same amount of carbon dioxide when burned as does natural gas. So, it might signal virtue while burning, but does nothing to reduce carbon dioxide output.Stop financing and subsidies for fossil fuelPeople, such as Mr. Barnard, cannot point to a single piece of legislation anywhere that was proclaimed as a subsidy to fossil fuel, but quite the contrary, fossil fuels are generally taxed for production (known as royalties) and get only the usual blessings for making the required investments. In addition to being allowed to earn their own money back, if they are successful, they also get to depreciate production assets, like every other business, and if they are in a particularly risky investment, they may get the benefits of an accelerated capital return schedule. But if the business fails, they lose their investment. None of the list of financial treatments above is in anyway a subsidy, it is not a subsidy to allow people to recover their investment, if successful. On the other hand, especially for electricity produced by renewables, with the exception of hydro, few investments made sense without substantial government intervention, sometimes in the form of guaranteed purchase agreements, generally for very high and uncompetitive prices. No advocate of green electricity ever mentions those subsidies though.Eliminate HFCs in refrigerationOne thing Mr. Barnard has right is that business as usual around the planet does produce millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. Therefore, the escape of some few tonnes of HFC is not even a drop in the bucket, not even a drop in a swimming pool, so this whole idea is merely virtue signalling. There are some mildly controversial things left out of this listThat is the heading of the final section. Mr. Barnard goes on with generally the same level of accuracy and truth as the foregoing headings displayed, but I think by now most readers will have a sufficiently informed opinion such that I do not need to continue.ConclusionThe facile ideas proposed by Mr. Barnard as improvements and as necessary for the future are all simply unfounded in reality. Physical laws are not subject to court rulings or the approval of public opinion. Gravity is gravity, thing always fall down, and always will here on the planet. Thermodynamics always operates, and always operates by the same three laws.If the ideas espoused by Mr. Barnard are adopted, I feel very sorry for the people who will be trying to eke out their existence after about 2050. I will not likely be around but hopefully some of the brilliant people I have mentored will be willing to help. Because the need for change will be obvious to everyone by then.Kent Zehr, Electrical Engineer, class of 1971A-Rebuttal-of-The-Short-List-1DownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change']",2020/07/06

Lyman’s bio can be read  here. Executive SummarySome prominent law firms in Canada have recently published papers analysing what many see as an increasing trend – the filing of lawsuits that seek to hold governments and private companies liable for the damages allegedly caused by climate change. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Litigating-Climate-Change-FINAL-rev.pdfLitigating-Climate-Change-FINAL-revDownloadNote: An earlier version of this report was corrected on page 6, to change the word ‘inappropriate’ to be ‘appropriate’ for court review.Thirteen cases of climate litigation have been filed in Canada. Of these four are particularly worth noting. In November, 2018 Environment Jeunesse (ENJEU) filed a class action lawsuit against the Government of Canada claiming that the federal government’s failure to adopt certain greenhouse gas emission targets violates the rights and freedoms of the “class”, defined as all Quebec citizens aged 35 and under. ENJEU stated that the government’s “inaction” on climate change constitutes bad faith and is an unlawful and intentional interference with the right of class members to life, liberty, and security of the person as well as their equality rights. In July 2019, the Quebec Superior court rejected the lawsuit while finding that the issues were appropriate for court review, thus leaving the door open for another claim.In October, 2019, a group of 15 youths, aged 10 to 19, from across Canada filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Canada against the federal government claiming that the government had failed to “maintain a stable climate system capable of sustaining human life and individual liberties, thereby violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and failing to protect public trust resources and Canadian children. They sought declaratory relief, as well as an order requiring the federal government to implement an enforceable Climate Recovery Plan to achieve emission reductions. West Coast Environmental Law claims: “A first step in demanding accountability is realizing that you’re entitled to it.” This is part of their campaign to have cities sue Big Oil. https://www.wcel.org/program/climate-law-in-our-hands/bc-communitiesThere also are a number of new or incipient cases of litigation by municipalities against Alberta-based oil companies. In January 2019, the City of Victoria was the first to file a class action lawsuit against Alberta petroleum producers. Other British Columbia municipalities subsequently joined in. These lawsuits seek to recover costs incurred by municipalities to prevent and clean-up damage caused by events allegedly linked to climate change, such as floods and wildfires. In the case of Syncrude Canada Ltd. v Attorney General of Canada, Syncrude challenged the applicability of criminal law to the regulations requiring that diesel fuel in Canada contain at least two per cent renewable fuel. The Federal Court disagreed with Syncrude’s assertion that the production and consumption of fossil fuels are not dangerous and do not pose a risk to human health and safety. In an example of the use of “judicial notice” (i.e. a matter “clearly uncontroversial and beyond reasonable dispute”), the court stated that climate change “is a real, measured evil, and the harm has been well documented”. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld this finding.There are at least five legal principles that would be involved in the resolution of present and possible future climate damage lawsuits in Canada.• Canadian courts generally refrain from interfering in government policy decisions because “policy and planning decisions are discretionary decisions normally made at the high level of government dealing with the allocation of resources and the determination of priorities in respect of governmental services. The decisions involve economic, social and political considerations in deciding which statutory powers will be exercised, when they will be exercised, where they will be exercised, and how they will be exercised. These are uniquely governmental decisions and the remedy for bad government lies in the ballot box, not the courts”. • With respect to lawsuits against petroleum companies in Canada for performing their business activities of developing, producing and transporting petroleum products, it must be noted that such companies are authorized by federal and provincial authorities to conduct their affairs for the public and economic good and are highly regulated and taxed at all levels of government.• In claiming damages, a claimant must demonstrate a causal link between the activity of the defendant and the alleged damage. In other words, a party claiming climate change damages against a government in Canada or against a firm operating in Canada that has emitted carbon dioxide must show how those emissions constituted an interference with the public good (e.g. by causing floods, drought or heat waves).• The Rules of Evidence generally require that a plaintiff show, through a clear chain of logic supported by verifiable analysis and facts, that there is demonstrable causality between a defendant’s actions and the damage claimed. In the Syncrude case, the court used judicial notice to evade that requirement.• Attribution: When, as is the case with greenhouse gas emissions, the alleged damage is a function of accumulated emissions by millions of emitters world-wide over at least a century and a half and the effects, if any, will be suffered by millions of parties over the next century and beyond, how can one attribute responsibility for damage and qualification to receive compensation?Canada ratified the Paris Agreement on October 5, 2016. Canada’s treaty obligations under that Agreement do not include any requirement that Canada:• meet any specific GHG emissions reduction target;• pay any penalty if it fails to meet its voluntary emissions reductions targets;• pay any specific amount or share of the collective financing for developing countries;• use any specific set of policy instruments (e.g. taxes, regulations, subsidies, etc.) in pursuing its voluntary emissions reductions goals. It is troubling to see that, in all of the lawsuits that have been launched by and against governments in Canada to date, in no case has a government or company challenged the scientific or economic grounds on which the claims for injury were made. One can only speculate about the political judgements that lie behind such failures to address what is arguably the weakest parts of the environmentalist legal case. Sooner rather than later, some government or other party with the funds to take a stand may have to rise to the occasion.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon dioxide', 'climate accountability law', 'climate change']",2020/07/06

Some of these scholars previously issued the “Acting on Climate Change” report of 2015. We have reissued our rebuttal to that report, entitled “Reality vs. Climate Change Uncertainties” as it provides substantial evidence refuting the claims and proposals of the present “Springing Canada Forward/Notre plan de relance d’un Canada vert”. Their proposals are all about spending money we do not have. Instead, we should focus on restoring investor confidence. Canada has lost more than $100 billion in “Prosperity Foregone” due to a variety of influences related to environmental activism and unwarranted climate alarmism. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/reality-vs-climate-change-uncertainties-final-reissued-July-2020-1.pdf reality-vs-climate-change-uncertainties-final-reissued-July-2020-1DownloadThe authors of “Springing Forward/Notre plan” claim there is a climate crisis, and if we review the original “Acting on Climate Change” report, we find that on page 18, there are two ‘scenarios’ referred to from the Representative Concentration Pathways of van Vuuren et al (2011). However, as recently revealed by Roger Pielke, Jr., these scenarios are not predictive and were not meant to be used in this way. Indeed the ‘catastrophic’ scenario, RCP 8.5, has been promoted by ‘green billionaires’ Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer in their “Risky Business” report as if ‘business-as-usual’ when most climate scientists see RCP 8.5 as needless catastrophizing. Indeed, recent books by two mainstream environmentalists – Bjorn Lomborg’s “False Alarm” and Michael Schellenberger’s “Apocalypse Never” – show that even those who accept the theory of potentially catastrophic human caused global warming through carbon dioxide emissions, have realized that humans are adaptive, that renewable/low carbon ‘solutions’ are costly green crony capitalist projects that impoverish the poor and destabilize the grid. They realize there is no imminent catastrophe and no climate emergency, a view supported by many mainstream scientists whose comments are simply not reported by headline-seeking media.In the “Springing Canada Forward/Notre plan de relance d’un Canada vert” we find there is a lack of due diligence regarding the proposals.  a)  Claim: Small-truck delivery fleets well-suited to electrification. Reality: Canada does not have sufficient power generation capacity as it is to meet the EV goals of 2040. Small delivery vehicles which must stop and start frequently are very unlikely to be able to withstand Canada’s temperature extremes and offer reliable performance.  b) Claim: Recovery a great time to fund wide streets and bike lanes. Reality: Canada is a cold country for more than half the year when biking is limited. In a constrained economy post-COVID-19, investing in resilient health care systems makes much more sense than bike lanes. c) Claim: “No regrets – Climate lens of Infrastructure Program. As shown above, there is no climate emergency, therefore viewing infrastructure development through a ‘climate lens’ means skewing investments based on ideology, not making the most practical, effective use of funds. Reality: No ‘climate lens’ required and the goals of investing in a ‘clean, green, low-carbon’ economy are not supported by the evidence. Michael Moore’s “Planet of the Humans” reveals that low-carbon energy generation offerings like biomass, wind and solar are not clean or green and are a world of regret. Robert Lyman is a former public servant of 27 years and diplomat of 10 years, and his trilogy of reports – “Broken Promises”, “Empty Wallets”, and “Empty Pockets” – explain why renewables offer no resilient recovery. Renewables offer only broken promises in performance and cost, they do not stop climate change and are destructive to the environment, clean tech is not a growth industry in Canada, and job losses increase the more one tries to ‘green’ the grid. There must be a “Transition to Reality”. There is no such thing as green infrastructure offering a ‘climate-proof’ watershed or coast against flooding, nor will heatwaves be stopped by such measures. Extreme weather events are integral to climate, as explained by Dr. Madhav Khandekar, a 40-year veteran research scientist of Environment Canada, past IPCC expert reviewer, former WMO regional expert. d) Claim: “National program of whole house energy retrofits will reduce energy demand…” Reality: As explained by Robert Lyman, referring to a cost-benefit analysis of a similar program considered in the UK: “If the cost of major housing retrofit here were the same as in the U.K., the cost to halve GHG emissions would be $3.6 trillion.” Clearly in a time of economic constraint post COVID-19 this would be a terrible waste of money, and certainly Canada’s Infrastructure Bank should avoid unicorn investments such as this like … the plague. e) Claim: “…climate-literate construction workforce should be a key point of Canada’s recovery investments…” Reality: A far more important push would be for energy literacy amongst all Canadians. For the work-force, we need to jump start Canada’s energy economy of oil, natural gas, coal, oil sands and mineral development, as all of these are essential goods that are in demand worldwide, and required for the creation of any renewable devices.  Scholars and academics must stop “Biting the Hand that Feeds You”. In a time of post-COVID19 recovery, we should be selling our resources on world markets to reduce the debt and make a comfortable future possible for our children and all Canadians, including Indigenous people. Many Indigenous people, like the National Coalition of Chiefs, see resource partnerships and development as an inclusive means of defeating on-reserve poverty.- Let’s give all Canadians a rewarding future with opportunity; let’s not leave anyone behind, burdened by debt and lost in energy illiteracy. There is no ‘climate justice’ or ‘gender equity’ in making people poor and burdening them with unreliable, unaffordable ‘green’ energy projects and carbon taxes that make rich people richer, destroy the middle class, and tempt the poorest people with ‘carbon rebates’, the ultimate social Ponzi scheme.Canada already has some 600 greenhouse gas regulations and incentive programs through federal, provincial and municipal governments. Fuel taxes are already more than $192/t carbon tax equivalent. Climate change policy is destroying Canada, exacerbating regional differences, and making the country uncompetitive on world markets. Climate prophecy has failed for >30 years. To save Canada, we must quit the deeply flawed Paris Agreement, cancel the carbon tax, build pipelines and LNG ports to reach out to world markets.

His on-camera career began at Shaw Cable in North Vancouver in 1988 where he hosted a half hour news-magazine program.After completing his diploma in Broadcast Journalism at BCIT, he began his career in daily news working at what was then CKVU (now City) and at the same time at Equity Magazine.In the fall of 1989 BCTV (now Global) recruited Stu and asked him to join the team at the NewsHour with Tony Parsons. Over the course of his career at BCTV he produced close to 2,000 stories. Memorable series were the Nanaimo Commonwealth Holding Society, Leaky Condos, the Forest Practices Code and his coverage of Delgamuukw.While at BCTV Stu’s work was recognized by the Jack Webster Foundation when he was presented with the award for Best Television Reporting.In 1998, Stu left the station to start Oh Boy Productions. Over the past 18 years the company has produced a number of news magazine programs including North of 49, Empowered Health and currently Conversations That Matter which Stu hosts.In addition, the team at Oh Boy has produced thousands of videos for a wide range of clients in business, Not for Profit, government, sports and for campaigns ranging from political to fundraising and referendums.Stu says, his entire career has been devoted to telling stories that matter. All of the work he has done has lead to the creation of Conversations That Matter a weekly interview show that is broadcast on numerous media outlets.Over the past six years more than 300 episodes of Conversations That Matter have been publishing on TV and on the Postmedia group of newspaper websites across Canada. In addition Simon Fraser University embraced the show and lends its’ name to the program through the Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue.The show has expanded to a channel of associated programs that include health, genomics, salmon, politics and now, “Food for Thought” an examination of Canada’s food supply.Stu says, “This is the most important work I have done”.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/06/19/a-short-history-of-greenhouse-emission-reduction-targets/,peter s. badenoch ,A Short History of Greenhouse Emission Reduction Targets,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman  ©  2020. Lyman’s bio can be read  here. BackgroundThe Trudeau government has announced that it is committed to attaining a “net zero” greenhouse emissions (GHG) reduction target by 2050. While that term has not been precisely defined, it appears to mean the virtual elimination of human-produced GHG emissions and therefore ending the use of fossils fuels like coal, oil and natural gas in Canada. The New Democratic Party and the Green Party also subscribe to this goal. In the present competition to determine who will lead the Conservative Party, both of the front runners, Peter MacKay and Erin O’Toole, also have endorsed this target. The only candidate who has explicitly rejected it is Derek Sloan. The People’s Party of Canada has longed opposed present climate change policy and indeed has advocated the departure of Canada from the Paris Agreement.Unfortunately, most of the public has little understanding of what the net zero target means or what is its background. This note is intended to provide that explanation.HistoryIn 1992, the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including Canada, agreed to set voluntary targets to stabilize their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. A small number of European countries (notably Germany and the United Kingdom) met this goal. Almost all others, including Canada, did not.In 1997, the countries party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to a formal treaty (i.e. the Kyoto Protocol) under which they would commit to reduce GHG emissions by 5% on average from 1990 levels by the end of the “first commitment period” in 2012. Canada signed the treaty and committed to reduce emissions by 6% from 1990 levels.The United States Administration signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, but did not submit it for ratification to the US. Senate. In 2011, Canada, Japan and Russia declared that they would not take on further Kyoto targets. Canada announced its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol in December, 2011, as it was clear by then that continued adherence would expose Canada to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties.Almost all of the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol missed their emission reduction targets.A second commitment period started in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. Under this agreement, 37 countries set binding targets; almost all of them were European countries. In 2012, Canada committed voluntarily to reduce emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. By 2018, it was clear that Canada would not meet this target, either.In 2015, prior to the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) Conference in Paris, Canada voluntarily committed to an even more stringent target, that is, to reduce GHG emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Agreement reached at that conference did not require countries to accept legally-binding commitments, only to submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), or emission reduction plans, every five years. Neither China nor India, the two fastest growing sources of GHG emissions, committed to make reductions by 2030. The United States Administration announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2016.COP26 was supposed to occur in 2020, before which all of the Parties were committed to submit updated INDCs. Due to the coronavirus, the conference has been rescheduled to 2021. Only seven countries have submitted INDCs, and only one has announced a voluntary commitment to a more stringent emissions reduction target by 2030 or beyond. As of 2019, it was clear that, with the possible exception of the European Union, none of the ten largest GHG emitters in the world, representing 79% of global emissions, would meet its 2030 target. The Canadian Minister of the Environment and Climate Change acknowledged publicly in 2019 that, based on currently implemented and planned measures, Canada will not meet the 2030 target. The New York Times published a story in September, 2019 stating that the United Nations estimated that 60% of the countries party to the Paris agreement had committed to reduce GHG emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The source of this claim is unsubstantiated and cannot be verified on the basis of INDCs that have been filed.CommentaryAccording to the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy, global GHG emissions have risen steadily throughout the period since GHG emission reduction targets were first set. They were 21.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1990 and they were 34.2 billion tonnes in 2019, a 59% increase.Canada’s emissions grew from 591 million tonnes in 1990 to 729 million tonnes in 2018, a 23% increase. After every target is missed, governments adopt more stringent, more difficult to attain, targets.“Net zero emissions” by 2050 is demonstrably impossible to attain in economic or technological terms, and it would entail unprecedented costs and reductions in standards of living that few, if any, countries living under democratic governments would accept. The continued practice of adopting more and more expensive and less attainable targets can perhaps only be understood as demonstrations of political cynicism. There is no political “downside” to promising to reduce GHG emissions – only to actually doing so. That judgement, however, misses an important consideration. Politicians who embrace radical environmental goals yield the moral high ground to the environmental groups; they are forever afterwards vulnerable to unremitting criticism for “breaking their promises”.

Keller et al have reported that the complete electrification of road transportation in British Columbia is possible and that incorporating a requirement that the additional electricity supply required be 93% renewable in nature is also possible and increases the perceived benefits. While their logic is impeccable, it is founded on naive, simplistic, or just false assumptions. Consideration of the corrected or realistic assumptions invalidates all the conclusions of the paper. The faulty premises underlying Keller et al will have serious socio-economic consequences for the people of British Columbia if no further critical assessment of their proposals is undertaken by policymakers.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/06/17/climate-sensitivity-by-energy-balance-with-urban-and-natural-warming/,,Climate Sensitivity by Energy Balance with Urban and Natural Warming," Contributed By Ken Gregory, P.Eng. 2020-06-14The sensitivity of the Earth’s climate to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) is the most important parameter in climate science. Climatologists Nicholas Lewis and Dr. Judith Curry published a paper in the Journal of Climate in 2018 (LC2018) that used the observationally-based energy balance method to estimate the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and the Transient Climate Response (TCR). The ECS is the global average surface temperature change due to a doubling of CO2 after allowing the oceans to reach temperature equilibrium, which takes about 1500 years for the upper 3 km of the ocean. The TCR is more relevant to climate policy as it is the global surface temperature change at the time of the CO2 doubling assuming that the change in forcing takes place gradually over at least 70 years, which it does for the base and final periods used. A doubling of CO2 at the current exponential growth rate of 0.60%/year would take 116 years. The LC2018 paper states “The energy budget framework provides an extremely simple physically-based climate model that, given the assumptions made, follows directly from energy conservation.” The energy balance method relates the ECS and TCR to changes in the global mean surface temperature (GMST), the effective radiative forcing and the planetary radiative imbalance between a base and final period. The radiative imbalance is the downward solar radiation net of albedo (reflection) less the upward longwave radiation from the surface and the atmosphere at the top of the atmosphere.The surface temperature change is based on the HadCRUT4.5 data set. LC2018 uses the GHG forcings as estimated in the fifth assessment report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), except for an upward revision of the methane forcing, an upward revision of the lower uncertainty bound of the aerosol forcing and updating the forcings to 2016. Earth’s top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance is necessarily equal to the total heat uptake by the climate system, which is over 90% by the oceans. The preferred base (1869-1882) and final periods (2007-2016) were chosen to avoid the period of sparse temperature data before 1869, avoid significant volcanism and to have the largest change in forcing so to give the narrowest uncertainty ranges. The long time between these periods averages out the temperature effects of short-term ocean oscillations such as the ENSO, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.The energy balance method employed by LC2018 is deficient for two reasons; • it falsely assumes that all of the temperature change from the base period was due to anthropogenic causes (other than a small solar irradiance forcing) and, • it doesn’t account for the urban warming contamination of the surface temperature record which exaggerates post 1970 warming. A paper by Gebbie and Huybers (GH2019) used an ocean circulation model and modern and paleoceanographic observations from both the end of the 19th century and the end of the 20th century to show that the deep Pacific Ocean is still cooling. The paper says “historical model simulations are biased toward overestimating ocean heat uptake when initialized at equilibrium during the Little Ice Age”. The ongoing deep ocean cooling revises Earth’s overall heat budget since 1750 downward by 35%. Taking this into account would revise downward the ECS calculated by energy balance. Solar forcing may be several times larger than just that caused by the change in the total solar irradiance (TSI) as interpreted by the IPCC. A paper Scafetta et al 2019 shows that the TSI increased from the 1986 minimum to the 1996 minimum by about 0.45 W/m2 and that 2000–2002 was likely a grand solar maximum. This implies that the TSI forcing was greater than that used in LC2018. There are several estimates of TSI. Two historical TSI reconstructions are presented as figures 1 and 2. They are quite different but what is clear is that generally the TSI has been increasing through the 20th century and is significantly higher than that in 1600-1700 and 1800-1820.Read the full paper here.Climate_Sensitivity_Energy_Balance_Gregory-2020-1-1DownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'climate sensitivity']",2020/06/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/06/17/le-quebec-vert-et-propre-natteindra-pas-ses-cibles-climatiques/,,Le Québec “Vert et Propre” n’atteindra pas ses Cibles Climatiques,"  Les Contradictions de la Politique Climatique du Québec English: https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/News/Friends%20of%20Science%20Press%20Release%20June%2017,%202020.pdf 17 juin 2020(Calgary, Alberta) En dépit de vastes réserves d’énergie hydraulique et d’un très bon système de Métro, la province de Québec n’atteindra pas ses cibles climatiques, selon un nouveau rapport “Les Contradictions de la Politique Climatique du Québec”, affirme la Société Friends of Science. Le rapport a été publié en français et en anglais, accompagné de vidéos. L’auteur du rapport, le consultant en politique énergétique à Ottawa Robert Lyman, a été fonctionnaire pendant 27 ans et diplomate pendant 10 ans. Selon M. Lyman, il y a des contradictions majeures dans la politique du Québec qui rendront ses cibles extrêmes de réduction de gaz à effet de serre (“GES”) extrêment difficiles à atteindre. Le Québec est l’une des jurisdictions avec les plus faibles émissions de GES. Malgré tout, le Québec a adopté les politiques climatiques les plus strictes de toutes les provinces canadiennes. Tout en se considérant “verts et propres” avec leurs vastes ressources d’énergie hydraulique à la Baie James, les Québécois ont rejeté les pipelines de l’Alberta largement sur des bases de changements climatiques. En réalité, le Québec est le deuxième plus gros marché de pétrole au Canada. Les industries et les résidences sont largement dépendantes du pétrole et du gaz.Bien que le Québec ait choisi une entente de “plafonnement et échange” avec la Californie au lieu de se rallier à la taxe canadienne sur le carbone, l’efficacité du système a été atténuée dès le départ par des exemptions ou des permis gratuits aux principales industries émettrices au Québec. De même, le prix des permis d’émission représente maintenant un incitatif financier moindre comparativement à la taxe fédérale sur le carbone. Le gouvernement fédéral exige que toute alternative provinciale à la taxe fédérale sur le carbone soit équivalente à la taxe sur le carbone, présentement à $30/t. Lors de la dernière enchère pour les permis d’émissions, le prix moyen de règlement était de 23,77 $ CAN la tonne (17,87 $ US la tonne). Le Québec voit les véhicules passagers au coeur de la réduction des émissions provinciales, mais la réduction maximale probable serait de seulement 5 megatonnes, pas assez pour faire une différence notable. De même, les investissements du Québec dans le transport en commun ne changent pas les habitudes de déplacements; quelque 70% des travailleurs montréalais utilisent leur véhicules pour se rendre au travail, pas le Métro. Bien que les véhicules électriques gagnent en popularité, leur nombre demeure toujours à environ 2% des ventes.  Plusieurs s’imaginent que les vastes ressources hydrauliques du Québec peuvent décarboniser la province et alimenter une flotte complète de VÉ. Cependant, dans une récente analyse dans le Financial Post, Jean Michaud et Germain Belzile font remarquer que remplacer le nombre courant de véhicules par des VÉ exigerait environ 37 350 MW pour seulement recharger quotidiennement la flotte de VÉ. Cela représente près de l’entièreté de la production “fiable” de 44 000 MW d’Hydro Québec. Il n’y aurait pas assez de puissance pour les besoins présents.Le Québec se voit et se présente au monde comme une société progressiste qui s’occupe de sa population. Sa politique climatique de “plafonnement et échange” ne comprend aucun remboursement de taxe pour ses citoyens, et elle est donc régressive. Le gouvernement fédéral canadien prévoit que, au cours de la prochaine décennie, les émissions de GES par l’industrie à l’échelle du pays vont augmenter. Le Québec sera mis au défi pour atteindre des réductions notables, à moins de faire les choix difficiles et politiquement impopulaires de réduire les émissions industrielles, ce qu’il a été réticent à faire jusqu’ici.Les émissions du Québec en 2015 étaient de 80 Mt. La cible pour 2030 est de 54 Mt, et la cible pour 2050 est jusqu’à 4 Mt, une cible beaucoup plus difficile.Les Contradictions de la Politique Climatique du Québec Resumé  Rapport  VidéoThe Contradictions in Quebec Climate Policy English Summary English Report  VideoAu sujet de la Société Friends of Science La Société Friends of Science est un groupe indépendant de scientifiques de la Terre, de l’atmosphère et du soleil, d’ingénieurs, et de citoyens qui célèbre sa 17ème année d’offres de perspectives en science climatique.

Hon besökte Kanada och gjorde sitt bästa för att påverka valet på ett olagligt sätt. Hennes kritik har motbevisats av dig.Riksdagen följer upp sin klimatlag med en “En samlad klimatpolitik – klimatpolitisk handlingsplan”.Denna lag som beslutades den 10 juni har 132 olika handlingsplaner för att uppfylla Parisavtalet och rädda oss från CAGW. Lagen föreskriver att klimatfrågan måste komma på topp i alla andra beslut som fattas av regeringen och statliga och regionala myndigheter. Denna plan måste uppdateras varje ny mandatperiod oavsett vilket parti som styr landet. Vart fjärde år, det vill säga efter val.Motivationen i regeringens lagförslag till riksdagen är den kompletta uppsättningen av lögner, som Antonio Guterres hade i sitt öppningstal i Madrid. Det är så hemskt detta är. Det är rättvist att säga att Greta Thunberg på sin Nordamerikas missionsturné pressade till åtgärder i linje med detta.Den mest sannolika effekten av sådana här lagar är mindre på klimatet, men negativt för ekonomisk tillväxt och återhämtning efter krisen.

Listen to the science – without preconceptions.," Contributed by Evert Andersson © 2020Swedish: https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/06/15/greta-thunberg-kraver-att-lyssna-pa-vetenskapen-det-ar-en-bra-ide-om-vi-verkligen-gor-det-utan-forutfattade-meningar/Only one nation has made the Paris agreement into law – Sweden. There is a wide spread demand from the alarmists to use the recovery after the COVID-19 crisis to change the society to be more green and resilient. From the Swedish government, without opposition. From the European Union there is talk of a Green New Deal.This seems to be on the agenda also in Canada. Sweden and Canada has many similarities. The land is sparsely populated, which means transportation is important. We are on the same latitude and therefore similar need of energy. And ambitious in climate politics. We also both suffer from the Greta Thunberg effect. She visited Canada and did her best to impact the election in an unlawful way. Her criticism has been debunked by you. The Swedish Parliament follows up its Climate Law with a “Comprehensive climate policy – a climate policy action plan”. This law decided on June 10th has 132 different action plans to meet the Paris agreement and save us from CAGW. The law stipulates that the climate issue must come on top in all other decisions taken by the Government and all government and regional agencies. This plan has to be updated every new term which ever party is governing the country. Every fourth year that is, after election. The motivation in the governments bill to the parliament is the complete set of lies that Antonio Guterres had in his opening speech in Madrid. That is how terrible this is.It is fair to say that Greta Thunberg on her North America missionary tour pushed for action in line with this. The most likely effect of such laws is less on climate, but negative for economic growth and recovery after the crisis. Let us hope that the crisis helps to open eyes and allow an open debate based of real science. Greta Thunberg calls for listening to the science. That’s a good idea if we really do that without preconceptions.Read the article: Should we accept laws based on lies?http://www.klimatupplysningen.se/2019/12/20/ska-vi-acceptera-lag-baserad-pa-logn/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Greta Thunberg']",2020/06/15
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/06/12/greta-thunberg-wrong-on-canada/,Andrew Roman ,Greta Thunberg: Wrong on Canada," Response-to-Greta-Thunberg-on-Canada-Commentary-to-UN-Small-Islands-Ambassadors-FINALDownloadFor the attention of Ambassadors & Permanent Representativesof Small Island Developing States to the United Nations, New Yorkand Sr. Antonio GuterresJune 12, 2020Your Excellency,We are deeply concerned about the misrepresentations about the Alberta oil sands of Canada in a recent letter from climate activist Greta Thunberg, co-signed by certain Marshall Island youth activists, and 22 scientists.First of all, the Small Island Developing States that advocate for climate action should not be passing judgement on other countries of the world regarding the use of fossil fuels. The Marshall Islands is home to the second largest ship registry in the world (RMI). Large container-ships can emit the equivalent of 50 million cars in terms of pollution and the carbon dioxide of 20,000 cars. It is thus hypocritical for Small Island Developing Nations to claim any moral superiority over other nations when their global presence and finances rely on this fossil fuel-based industry.Despite the Small Island Nations concern for the impacts of climate change, Dr. John D. Harper, FGSA,FGAC, PGeol., former director of the Geological Survey of Canada, explained in a 2016 interview that small islands are more subject to effects of erosion by the sea than sea level rise from climate change. Research indicates that some small islands are even growing in size. Other islands, like the Maldives, have made significant investments in paving their precious and small land base into airports to encourage tourism. One report indicates that: “Maldives, the most dispersed country on the planet with 1,192 islands spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres, already has 11 airports, including three international airports.”Clearly, these nations must have access to these fossil fuel powered industries of international shipping and international aviation/tourism in order to survive economically. Therefore it is hypocritical of such nations to accuse others, like Canada, of not meeting climate targets when only one nation is close to meeting said targets – that being the United States – which pulled out of the Paris Agreement, and the other being the EU (as a body), but at the expense of an ‘industrial massacre’, as stated by Antonio Tajani, former EU industry commissioner, due to high energy prices.While we don’t expect young people like Greta and her co-signatories to appreciate the complexities of global economics, the adult scientists who signed the letter certainly should.Robert Lyman is a former Canadian federal public servant of 27 years and was a diplomat for 10 years. He has authored several insightful reports on climate and energy issues. In “Promises vs. Performance: The World’s Largest Emitters since COP-21” it is clear that targets will be missed by virtually all the Paris signatories. Therefore, Canada should not be singled out by Greta and her colleagues. Likewise, in “Futile Folly: Canada’s Climate Policy Goals in the Global Context”, Lyman points out that China emits more in a month than Canada does in an entire year. Indeed, he writes: “Canada’s total emissions represent about three and a half months of China’s emissions growth. If someone one could instantaneously wipe Canada off the map, so that it produced zero emissions forever after, this would have a modest-to-negligible effect on global carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere in 2100, and it would make no difference whatsoever as to whether the IPCC emissions reduction targets (i.e. 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees C.) were met.” Indeed, Bjorn Lomborg has shown that if all signatories of the Paris Agreement met their targets, global warming would only be reduced by 0.05 degrees Celsius (five one hundredths of a degree), but the costs would be in the trillions of dollars. Surely that money could be better spent on improving the lives of millions of people and adapting as necessary according to changes in climate.False and Misleading Claims about the Alberta Oil SandsGreta and co-signatories make false and misleading claims about the Canadian oil and gas industry. They make false claims about subsidies to the Canadian oil and gas industry which are not born out by the evidence from credible authorities like economist Chris Ragan. In an interview with Steve Paikin on TVO, Mr. Ragan stated: “In 2009 and 10 I somehow got assigned to be and labelled as Canada’s expert on the fossil fuel subsidy issue for the G20 discussions because the G20 countries had made a commitment to reduce fossil fuel subsidies. And one of the things that I learned at Finance Canada is that in fact we as a country do not have explicit fossil fuel subsidies.“ (bold emphasis added)Greta and colleagues do not understand the fact that Export Development Canada offers loans to various industries in Canada, that are to be paid back with interest. This is not a subsidy. Canada does not directly subsidize oil and gas, though during the COVID19 recovery, it may be prudent for the nation to offer substantial support. We advocate for that in our open letter of March 30, 2020 to Prime Minister Trudeau. Industry should be supported particularly in light of the fact that governments have allowed the foreign-funded ENGO-led Tar Sands Campaign to decimate Canada’s excellent reputation world-wide, creating a sense of fear and loathing of this exceptional technological and engineering marvel, where once it was a source of national pride and a driver of about one third of the Canadian economy. Certainly, if Norway can own 67% of its petroleum company, surely Canada can and should provide simple interim financial support for its oil, gas, and oil sands corporations – particularly as Canada is the coldest, second largest nation on earth.  There would be mass deaths through rapid decarbonization as proposed by Greta and colleagues – and as you will see below, NetZero2050 is unnecessary.Indigenous RelationsGreta and colleagues attempt to smear Canada regarding oil and gas and Indigenous relations. Canada’s oil and gas sector has been one of the strongest supporters and job creators for Indigenous people in Canada, developing the innovative trades training program with the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) which takes a mobile trades training facility directly to remote communities. Hundreds of successful graduates immediately found work during the oil sands boom.It should be noted for those who care about social justice, that the oil sands companies are the largest employer of indigenous people in Canada and the National Coalition of Chiefs sees the resource industry as crucial to lifting aboriginal people out of poverty. In fact, leading aboriginal scholars like Calvin Helin decry the damage that ‘eco colonization’ has done and that it is the main obstacle to improved lives for aboriginal people.Government Ownership of PipelinesIt is hypocritical of Greta and her co-signatories to speak of Canada’s ‘government-owned’ Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) pipeline when the tiny nation of Vanuatu is associated with West Coast Environmental Law, a foreign-funded, Canadian-based activist environmental ‘charity’ which, according to their own documents, ran Kinder Morgan out of Canada and off the TMX project by threatening them with legal risks at several of their AGMs. These legal risks were based on stories of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster. The Exxon Valdez was a single hulled oil tanker with no modern GPS (which was not invented then); today’s tankers are double-hulled and hi-tech. It seems likely that the Canadian government chose to buy the TMX pipeline from Kinder Morgan rather than face legal demands for compensation for the Canadian government allowing the on-going obstruction of the federally approved project by numerous Canadian-based, foreign-funded, foreign-strategized Tar Sands Campaign ENGOs. Hypocritical Greta et alIndeed, very hypocritical of Greta and colleagues to speak of ‘government-owned’ oil facilities when Equinor (formerly Statoil) of Norway is 67% owned by the government of Norway, and Sweden’s Lundin Petroleum is part of the Johan Sverdrup play. In fact, it was Lundin Petroleum of Sweden that discovered the Johan Sverdrup field in 2010. But there is no mention of the Swedish oil company in Greta’s letter. Surely Greta and friends should clean up her own backyard before wading into international matters.Geopolitics and Carbon Offset ActivistsOf course, the underlying issue is said to be climate change, but as illustrated above, the letter from Greta et al more appears to be part of a geopolitical trade war against Canada based on misinformation. Indeed, one of the parties associated with the Tar Sands Campaign is the Citizen’s Climate Lobby group, the executive director of which is on the board of the non-profit foundation of the carbon offset/social media/social engineering firm “We Don’t Have Time” with Greta Thunberg. Citizen’s Climate Lobby (CCL) is dedicated to pushing a price on carbon. Most recently, US climate scientist James Hansen has been advocating on the CCL’s behalf for a Canadian-launched petition demanding that the government impose a $210/t carbon price on citizens by 2030. This suggests serious conflicts of interest from Greta and her colleagues, though we suspect her passion and trusting nature is being exploited. She and her youthful colleagues are likely unaware of these extended connections.Page 80, Swedish language IPO for “We Don’t Have Time” Note: Canadians were already paying a carbon tax equivalent of $192/t in fuel taxes prior to the April 1, 2020 hike, and Canada has some 600 various greenhouse gas reduction regulations and incentive programs. None have been audited for effectiveness. https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/06/Lyman-carbontax-1.pdf James Hansen incited global hatred of the Canadian oil sands by calling this natural resource a ‘carbon bomb’ – which was nothing more than empty rhetoric. Weaver and Swart (2012) found that even if all the oil sands were extracted for use, which would take over a century to accomplish, the cumulative global warming impact would be 0.02 to 0.05 degrees Celsius (two hundredths to five hundredths of a degree Celsius) – probably much less than the impact of all the ships in the Marshall Islands’ marine registry. Climate ChangeRegarding climate change, Friends of Science Society has studied this issue in detail for the past 18 years. We have long held the view that the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change as an external force, dynamically interacting with terrestrial and oceanic forces.In 2004, numerous scientists in “Vegetation, Water, Humans and the Climate” determined that human activities of agriculture and deforestation were more influential than human industrial carbon dioxide emissions. In 2005, the National Research Council coordinated a review of the theory of the “Radiative Forcing of Climate Change”. This large body of scientists began a search for a new metric for human effect on climate, rather than the radiative forcing theory as it had many uncertainties and no longer explained the evidence. However, in 2006, Al Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” alarmed the world and inspired investors to get into renewables, low-carbon concepts and carbon trading. The scientific message of the uncertainties of the carbon dioxide forcing theory did not get out to the public. However, by 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued the AR5 report which clearly stated there had been no statistically significant rise in global warming for the preceding 15 years – before Kyoto was ratified – despite a very substantial rise in human industrial carbon dioxide emissions (CO2).This led Dr. Judith Curry to state in testimony to the US Senate in 2014 that: “Motivated by the precautionary principle to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change, attempts to modify the climate through reducing CO2 emissions may turn out to be futile. The stagnation in greenhouse warming observed over the past 15+ years demonstrates that CO2 is not a control knob on climate variability on decadal time scales. Even if CO2 mitigation strategies are successful and climate model projections are correct, an impact on the climate would not be expected for a number of decades owing to the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere and thermal inertia driven by the ocean (AR5 WG1 FAQ 12.3); solar variability, volcanic eruptions and natural internal climate variability will continue to be sources of unpredictable climate surprises.” “Carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can fine tune climate.” Dr. Judith Curry, Jan. 16, 2014, Testimony to US SenateNo Climate EmergencyThe view that there is no climate emergency is shared by these climate experts in this NATURE commentary, who called for the IPCC SR1.5 authors to speak out and calm down the frenzied population’s fears of imminent threat, which the media and climate activists like Greta had extrapolated and exaggerated from the IPCC SR1.5 report, saying: “This rise of climate deadline-ism raises a central question about the role of science in politics. Despite good intentions, the rhetoric of a 2030 deadline is the political (mis)use of science for setting an artificial deadline. Although the rhetoric is usually seen by scientists as a misleading interpretation of the IPCC findings, the IPCC and most climate scientists have so far kept silent, thereby implicitly seeming to endorse it. However, given that the IPCC’s SR15 report helped to create the condition for this rhetoric, as the institutional authority for climate science the IPCC should take responsibility for more actively engaging in political conversations around it.”Indeed, the authors of the NATURE commentary also correctly perceived the unfortunate political and social outcomes that we are witnessing today with demands for sweeping changes to society, an enforced climate lockdown like that of the COVID19, demands for a Green New Deal and centralized Great Depression-style management of the economy or World War II-style industrial focus on wind and solar. Michael Moore’s film “Planet of the Humans” has shown that renewables cannot perform or exist without fossil fuels. Others have demonstrated that 100% renewable goals are not possible with existing technology. Therefore it would seem the fearful public are demanding something that cannot be done, but in their fear and rage, driven by the presumed existential threat, some have resorted to desperate acts that are harmful to themselves or others, or to society at large.“Pushing hard to meet a deadline may also cause (unintentionally) dangerous political side effects. For example, deadline-ism incubates the political opportunism of declaring a climate emergency. It is no surprise that new political movements calling for the declaration of a climate emergency in parliaments, cities, schools and universities have arisen in the months after the release of the IPCC SR15 (see https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/climate-emergency-campaign ). The rhetoric of emergency emerges from the worldview of millenarianism and its conception of ‘compressed time’ that calls for immediate actions before it is too late. However, regardless of the original intentions, an empty call for emergency actions can be interpreted in myriad ways. In the worst case, the emergency rhetoric could become ‘stolen rhetoric’, used as justification for solar geoengineering and potentially for more authoritarian forms of governance and regulation.”The “Climate Mobilization” campaign referred to in the link above is the material frequently spouted by Greta Thunberg, claiming “Our House is on Fire”, when this is not the case. The “Climate Mobilization” material was developed by a clinical psychologist, using psychological techniques to scare people into compliance, an immoral aberration of the healing techniques of psychologists. This fact further explains the powerful influence of this apocalyptic material on the unsuspecting public.In addition to the scientists noted above, who object to climate deadline-ism, more than 800 others who are signatory to CLINTEL – climate intelligence group of The Netherlands say:• there is no climate emergency, • natural factors are more influential on climate than human forcings, • carbon dioxide is not the main driver of climate change, but rather it is the sun and other natural forces and that • we should address adaptation, rather than impossible mitigation plans like decarbonization/NetZero2050 or • we must stop impoverishing ordinary people with carbon taxes, renewables subsidies, unaffordable energy – all inherently associated with global cap and trade.CLINTEL issued a letter to Sr. Antonio Guterres last fall when Greta attended the UN and claimed that we had all stolen her future. That is untrue. Surely a group of more than 800 scientists, scholars and professionals have a clearer view of climate, energy, and economic policies than a young woman frightened by the musings of a clinical psychologist. “Material Change” in the role of human industrial carbon dioxide on climate has not been picked up by the banking, insurance, and investment communities. The public is being greenwashed.Much of the climate industrial complex relies entirely on the premise that carbon dioxide is a tradeable commodity. In fact, this industry entails ‘the lack of delivery of an invisible substance to no one.’ This is an important material change that global bankers and investors should have noted in their offerings of stocks and bonds, but in 2014, two ‘green billionaires’ reportedly promoted the most alarming but least likely climate model scenario, known as the RCP 8.5, in a publication entitled “Risky Business”. This appears to be at the heart of Mark Carney’s view of climate, and that of many investors and major businesses, but it does not reflect reality. This catastrophic view became embedded in scholarly publications, insurance company references, institutional investor directives, and media reports. Roger Pielke, Jr. and Justin Ritchie have studied the “Systemic Misuse of Scenarios in Climate Research and Assessment”.These revelations suggest serious conflicts of interest between certain parties and the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures.CDP Worldwide and UNPRI Skew Investment Markets with Misinformation on the Oil Sands and CO2The letter by Greta to the UN and the Small Island Developing States is another misinformed, international attack on the Alberta oil sands and part of a geopolitical trade war against Alberta, in this case, apparently led by someone representing the oil competitor nations of Sweden and Norway. Perhaps the intent of the letter is also to force global carbon prices higher or to institute a global carbon tax law – something that several of the signatory scientists to Greta’s letter have advocated for over the years. We believe a Global Carbon Tax Law is a Road to Ruin.Image licensed from Shutterstok.Read our report: Faulty Premises = Poor Public Policy on ClimateFor the past decade or more, investment markets have been skewed against the Alberta oil sands by the Rockefeller CDP Worldwide reports, a transnational body that has no government authority of any kind and no due process; a body that creates ‘black and white’ lists of corporations and cities, upon which trillions of dollars of investment decisions are made based on the faulty premise of a climate emergency. The UNPRI, a body of some ~1,000 institutional investors with ~$90 trillion in assets under management, rely on CDP reports to direct their ‘sustainable’ investments. Thus in 2016, the CDP report “In the Pipeline” seriously damaged investor interest in the Alberta oil sands, coincidentally driven by the hateful hype of the international Tar Sands Campaign. It appears that much of this activity is related in some way to the ClimateWorks push for global cap and trade. The Calgary DeclarationJust as tiny islands have attempted to sway global politics with things like the SUVA Declaration, so our organization also speaks up with our Calgary Declaration. The preamble states: We believe that every nation has its challenges and Canada’s are not being heard. In particular, our unique climate and weather conditions do not permit our country to reduce or eliminate fossil fuel use without causing death. Current #ParisAgreement greenhouse gas reduction targets for Canada are unattainable without causing the destruction of Canada. This is contrary to the fundamental principles of the UN Charter – Article 2.1 which guarantees equal sovereignty and Article 55 which promotes economic development, full employment and higher standards of living.In Closing – Reject Climate Change Hysteria and Stop the Denigration of Alberta and CanadaWe are not interested in the further destruction of the economy and reputation of Alberta or Canada and we ask that you reject the hypocritical misinformation presented by Ms. Thunberg and her collection of signatories related to the Alberta oil sands. The oil sands are a great natural resource like any other; Canada’s scientists and engineers have met world class environmental standards in oil sands development and established innovative new technologies.We also do not want our children going to bed afraid of the end of the world or feeling rage against their parents and grandparents for the false claim that we have imperiled their existence through the use of oil, natural gas and coal. Nothing could be further from the truth. Climate change is real and mostly natural. We do have time. Let our children enjoy it!We are not commenting for or against any country’s participation on the UN Security Council. We are demanding a stop to the Tar Sands Campaign against Alberta and Canada.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/06/09/the-net-zero-emissions-myth/,ed Hoskins ,The “Net Zero” Emissions Myth," Contributed by Robert Lyman  ©  2020. Lyman’s bio can be read  here. The Trudeau government has made the financing facility providing loans to large employers affected by Covid-19 conditional on the companies’ signing certain covenants. One covenant would require the firm to publish annual reports indicating how it will contribute to achieving Canada’s climate commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement and the goal of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The government also has indicated that it will tailor Canada’s economic recovery from the coronavirus to its vision of a “Green and resilient” model, even where that stands in sharp contrast to the natural resource-based and energy intensive industries that have led Canada’s economic development in the past. Rarely, if ever, in the past have governments conditioned their economic assistance on demands for adherence to environmental policy goals. These goals, however, only make sense if they really contribute to a global transformation to a “decarbonized” economy.What if the world is not on a decarbonization path?The Parties to theU.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change have been meeting to set emissionreduction targets since 1990, thirty years ago. None of the targets has everbeen met. Prior to the COP21 Conference in Paris in 2015, the Parties submittedplans indicating how they would reduce emissions in the period to 2030. They weresupposed to submit updated commitments this year, but only seven countries havedone so up to now. Carbon Action Tracker, a non-governmental organization thatmonitors countries’ performance, reports that, of the world’s ten largestemitters representing 78 % of global emissions, only the European Union maymeet its commitment. The goal of “net zero” emissions was added later, afterthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018 published scary claimsabout what would happen if global temperature rises exceeded 1.5 degreesCelsius. This inspired declarations of a “climate emergency”. In the meantime,according to the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy, theworld’s energy consumption and resulting emissions are trending exactlyopposite to the U.N.’s goals. Over the last decade, emissions rose 12%, andwere accelerating until the coronavirus hit. Demand for oil and natural gas isat its highest level in history. Natural gas demand is growing three times asfast as renewables demand measured in energy-equivalent terms. Contrary to thegeneral perception in the media, coal remains the largest source of powergeneration, and its use is rising very quickly in China and India.Canadians are led tobelieve that all this will change because of a virus or because this time theU.N. will have its way. That is not, however, what the most authoritativesources of analysis on future energy trends are saying. Notably, the U.S.Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently published its projections to2050. In its reference case, the EIA projected that GDPin non-OECD countries will increase by 150% between 2018 and 2050, compared toless than a 50% increase in the OECD.  Consequently, the EIA projects global carbon dioxide emissions to grow, not decline. Indeed, it projects global emissions to increase from about 35 billion tonnes in 2020 to 43 billion tonnes in 2050, with all of the growth occurring in the non-OECD countries. By 2050, the combined emissions of China and India may constitute 40% of the world total, while those of Canada and the United States combined only 13%.In addition to the potential consequences of economic trends and political commitments, we must consider the limitations of technology. Vaclav Smil is a Professor Emeritus of the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Manitoba and perhaps the foremost expert on the history of energy transitions. He considers that transitions take 50 to 70 years to unfold, partly because of the long lives of existing energy production facilities and economic infrastructure. Wind, solar and biomass energy sources have increased from negligible levels of use fifteen years ago to 4% of global energy use in 2018, but at a cost of U.S. $2.5 trillion in subsidies. Much of the future growth of renewables as contributors to the electrical energy system depends on an as-yet elusive technology breakthroughs. For example, technologies are needed to lower the cost of battery storage, which now is about $1,000 per kilowatt hour. We await similarly elusive technology and cost breakthroughs with respect to the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, the production of cellulosic ethanol, and the electrification of transport, especially in the aviation, marine and surface freight modes. Governments simply cannot control the pace of scientific discoveries or the rate of commercialization of the discoveries that do occur.Source unknown.Almost a billion and a half people in the world have no electricity or modern energy services. Many more want access to better housing, increased mobility, higher incomes from industrialization, and the hundreds of energy services available from increased electricity use. If they can exercise their choices in free, competitive markets, there is no doubt that they will opt for proven technologies that offer secure and affordable energy. That means increased use of fossil fuels and increased emissions.  In short, no matter how many costs and constraints the federal government imposes on Canadians, global decarbonization will remain an environmentalist’s dream, not a realistic guidepost for national policy.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2020/06/09

Lyman’s bio can be read  here. EMPTY POCKETS:WHY RENEWABLES OFFER NO RESILIENT RECOVERY Part 3 – Executive SummaryIn this part, I will offer views and evidence as to why the economic spinoffs of increased government spending on so-called “clean energy” will harm Canada’s economy far more than help it.I and others have written about the economic toll already imposed on Canada by climate policies. In assessing the potential economic effects of ever more climate-inspired policy measures, therefore, we know that the costs to date already have had a large negative effect.“CLEAN TECHNOLOGY” IS NOT A GROWTH INDUSTRY IN CANADAStatistics Canada refers to a group of economic activities as “clean technology”, and groups them in two categories: “clean energy and environmental goods and services” and “the environmental and clean technology products account”. The Clean Technology Goods and Services category is very diverse. Of the total income to this category in 2017, $32 billion, most of it is in industries not related to climate policies (e.g. equipment and services relating to waste management, site remediation, water management, municipal sewage treatment and spill response, and others). In fact, arguably, only about $5.5 billion of the total is unquestionably driven by climate policies.The Environmental and Clean Technology Products Account, usually referred to by the government as the “Clean Technology Sector”, had a total income in 2018 of $66.3 billion. This account’s share of Canadian GDP has been about 3% since 2007, despite the fact that Statistics Canada constantly adds more industries to the category. For over a decade, the Environmental and Clean Technology Products Account has held a shrinking share of Canada’s economy. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Empty-Pockets-No-Resilient-Recovery-Part-3-Final.pdfEmpty-Pockets-No-Resilient-Recovery-Part-3-FinalDownloadTHE CLAIMS ABOUT “GREEN JOBS” ARE EXAGGERATEDAccording to Statistics Canada, an estimated 317,000 jobs were attributable to the Clean Technology sector (as previously described) in 2018, comprising 1.7% of all jobs in Canada. The goal of Canada’s energy sector is not to create as many jobs as possible, especially in politically-favoured and heavily subsidized renewable energy industries. Rather, the economic goal is to produce as much energy as possible at the lowest possible cost, and that means doing so with the fewest energy workers. It is a common mistake of politicians and the media to treat jobs as an economic benefit, when in fact jobs are an economic cost, or price of production. The appropriate economic objective is to have the fewest number of workers producing the highest amount of output. The higher productivity, other things equal, justifies higher wages per worker.Advocates of renewable energy subsidies and mandates do not consider the direct and indirect adverse effects (including job destruction) on a wide array of energy-intensive industries, and the effects of increased prices for consumers. Experience in other countries provides ample evidence of this. Studies in Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom all found that for every job created in the renewable energy sector, two to three jobs were lost in energy consuming sectors of the economy.Government intrusion into energy markets amounts to little more than attempting to prematurely force businesses to abandon current generally well-known and proven production technologies for new and more expensive ones.CONCLUSIONExperience in other countries and in Canada shows that the economic spinoff effects of policies that divert money from the general economy to subsidize renewable energy result in lower value employment in the “Clean Tech” industries, disproportionate loss of employment and income in the broader economy, higher costs for consumers and loss of competitiveness. Despite immense subsidies and a long list of government-conferred advantages, the “Clean Tech” industries hold a smaller and smaller share of Canada’s economy. This is not the way to a post-coronavirus resilient economy.Read the series:Broken PromisesEmpty WalletsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['clean-tech', 'climate change', 'economy']",2020/06/01

Lyman’s bio can be read  here. One of the central claims of those who advocate “decarbonization” of the world’s economy is that in the medium-term future (i.e. by 2050) all energy services can be electrified and that the electricity generation sources can be converted from fossil fuels (mainly coal and natural gas) to renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy. Wind and solar energy, however, are intermittent sources of supply, whose production varies with the time of day and season and not in ways that match consumer demands. When skeptics point this out, the answer decarbonization advocates usually give is that new grid-scale electricity storage systems will be installed to assure security and reliability of supply. The availability and affordability of grid-scale electricity storage is stated as an article of faith, not to be challenged. This article is intended only to offer some anecdotal evidence that takes issue with “assured storage” thesis. I leave it to those far more expert than I to explore all the technical issues.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Battery-Storage-Costs-FINAL-May-30-2020.pdfBattery-Storage-Costs-FINAL-May-30-2020DownloadRead more of Robert Lyman’s series on renewables.Broken Promises: Why Renewables Offer No Resilient RecoveryEmpty Wallets: Why Renewables Offer No Resilient RecoveryShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'renewables']",2020/05/30

Doug WylieYour Worship and Council,RE: Enactment of City of Calgary Climate Plans and Impending Major Decisions such as the Green LineWe have recently completed a critical review of the “Alberta’s Climate Future” report by Dr. Katharine Hayhoe and colleague Anne Stoner. We understand from various public sessions, that the City of Calgary has been consulting with Dr. Hayhoe regarding climate change matters.We find that Dr. Hayhoe’s findings are misleading and inaccurate and ask that the City of Calgary pause their imminent decision process to review the findings in our report “Facts vs Fortune Telling”. There is no climate emergency imminent and no need for drastic ‘climate action’ – it would be wise to slow down, think twice, and deal only with practical municipal needs for the foreseeable future.The City of Calgary has been on a long, hard trail on climate change matters. Since 2010, ImagineCalgary and the Sustainability 2020 task force have been busy planning for a prosperous future by 2020 with full employment for all. Whatever the City of Calgary spent on this collection of task forces is obviously wasted money, and though COVID19 has exacerbated the challenges facing Calgary, it did not create them. The focus on ‘sustainability’ through unsustainable practises like going 100% renewable is costly and a simple self-deception, one that we cannot afford anymore.In 2013, we sent you our report “Renewable is not so Doable” which rebutted the Pembina Institute’s claims that renewables were an inexpensive and cleaner/greener way to power the city. Based on their recommendations and the influence of other climate activist groups, the City of Calgary has proclaimed itself to be 100% renewable, which in effect means you are using taxpayers’ money to purchase carbon offsets, because the Alberta power grid runs on fossil fuels, not the wind. The C-Train runs on fossil fuels. Not the wind. According to the Rockefeller Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP Worldwide) page on Calgary:In 2012, the city approved a motion to purchase 100% renewable electricity to cover all electricity consumed in City operations. This policy resulted in electricity provider, ENMAX, constructing and operating two wind farms with a total capacity of 144 MW in southern Alberta. Additionally, the city has installed more than 3000 kW of solar photovoltaic systems on city-owned facilities.As Robert Lyman’s recent reports show, renewables offer “Broken Promises” to consumers and “Empty Wallets” to taxpayers. As stated in our recent Open Letter to Premier Kenney: “The promise of renewable energy to provide economical electricity and declining emissions has failed. From 2006 to 2017 nearly U.S. $2.5 trillion of subsidies were provided to renewables while oil demand grew twice as fast as renewables and global emissions increased by almost 20%. The fact that many institutional investors, representing public sector pension plans, cash in on these subsidized renewables industries constitutes a form of taxation without representation, not to mention the greenwashing involved. Contrary to claims of ‘sustainable’ development, this is an unsustainable burden on taxpayers, based entirely on faulty scientific premises.”We believe Calgary taxpayers are owed clarity on whether or not municipal unions have direct or indirect (i.e. mutual funds) investments in any of the companies that are beneficiaries of the 100% renewable or “Sustainable” program spending – whether the carbon offsets companies, natural gas, wind or solar device manufacturers, transmission line companies or any part of the supply chain for the Green Line.As Councillor Sean Chu has tweeted, the costs of Calgary’s make-believe wind-powered train and other offsets are exorbitant. In this time of austerity, how can this continued expenditure and activity be justified?See Alberta electricity supply and demand and power generation source on the AESO website – updated every 15 mins. http://ets.aeso.ca/ets_web/ip/Market/Reports/CSDReportServlet The Green Line is born out of the objectives of Sustainability 2020 – a program that has failed miserably. Calgary’s downtown is virtually vacant, small-and-medium sized businesses are groaning under the burden of taxes, and yet you persist in attempting to reach the strategic objective of the failed Sustainability 2020 plan, by pushing ahead with the Green Line.As Robert Lyman has reported, mass transit is “Squandered Money: Funding Mass Transit to Reduce Emissions”.Calgary Climate Hubs offers tax receipts via Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project CanadaAround the world, climate change programs are being cancelled because of two things. Climate Prophecy has Failed – and taxpayers are broke and unwilling to become carbon serfs to green billionaires or subsidize their ‘charities’ like Al Gore’s Climate Reality, and the carbon offset kings of “We Don’t Have Time” who are exploiting Greta Thunberg and terrifying millions of children worldwide.Carbon offset billionaire backers of Greta.

Please step back, cut back, and come back down to earth.Calgary is a jewel that has seen many hard times, but few such times have occurred by the city actively engaging in activities that can only be described as self-harm. In doing so, all the citizens of Calgary are suffering in one way or another.Please review our reports.Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETYShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Calgary', 'changement climatique', 'climate change']",2020/05/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/05/28/letter-to-a-friend-of-science/,,Letter to a Friend of Science," Contributed by Philip Mulholland © 2020I believe that Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) due to the radiative greenhouse gas/CO2 forcing theory is a hoax, but where should I start my explanation to you of how I justify my belief? Perhaps some personal background information will help you to understand my position: I am a committed environmentalist, with a Bachelor’s degree in environmental science (Lancaster, England 1974) and a Master’s degree in conservation (University College London 1980). I have always had a great appreciation of trees, the first one I grew was a laburnum seedling I found in our family garden in Liverpool at the age of eight. I took this sapling to our new home on the Wirral and tended it for many years in our garden there. My interest developed and at University College London my MSc dissertation was a study into the process of the natural regeneration cycle of Epping Forest. I learnt a lot about ecology from growing trees and since then I have continued to grow saplings as a hobby, so the idea that we are going to save the planet by burning trees is something I abhor.My great interest in both geography and botany at school led me to apply for a first degree in Environmental Science (ES) at the University of Lancaster. I got in on my second attempt in 1971 at age 19, having lost a year because I failed my maths A-levels and had to re-sit. My father, a maths teacher, was not best pleased at my poor performance. My grades were not good enough for the competing ES course at the University of East Anglia, but in retrospect Lancaster was the better choice for me. The ES department at Lancaster was founded by Professor Gordon Manley, the renowned climatologist, and the modular course he organised provided an excellent grounding in a wide range of geoscience disciplines.So, I know about greenhouse gases from my time at university. I well remember how we were specifically told in the ES lecture theatre at Bailrigg campus that the vacuum planet equation of astronomy, used by climate science was a mathematical trick. The sole and only purpose of this equation is to calculate the radiant exhaust temperature of a planet. So, I will start here at the core of climate science, the mathematical trick that seems to hoodwink so many into believing that the sun shines at night. Yes seriously, that is the correct description of the idea that it is logically permissible to divide the radiant intensity of incoming solar energy by 4, because the outgoing surface area of the radiant emission from the planet is four times the cross-sectional area of the intercepting disk silhouette. Once you go down the rabbit hole of believing that the rule of divide by four can be applied to incoming solar energy, and therefore make sunlight too weak to heat the planet, then you are lost.In order to destroy completely this palpable piece of garbage, I created a new mathematical model based on the meteorological principles that my co-author Stephen Wilde supplied. This new model uses as its minimum irreducible basis the presence of the two complementary environments on every solar lit globe, namely day and night. My model uses as its starting point a geometrically valid divide by 2 for the process of radiant solar flux intensity dilution, because only half the surface area of a planet is ever illuminated at any one time. In order to force the issue of acceptance of the meteorological process we are describing, I set the initial condition for the model as being a tidally locked planet. This is in contradistinction to the standard vacuum planet equation of climate science that starts with a rapidly rotating world, and relies on the solid surface translation provided by daily rotation to convey the intercepted high frequency solar energy from the day to the night time side.What was truly surprising to me was that the meteorological model that I created fully and completely replicates the vacuum planet equation of astronomy. So, my model proves the truth of the greenhouse gas conjecture? Not a bit of it. The new climate model that matches the vacuum planet equation is the diabatic (50% – 50% partition) version in which both day and night time radiation environments are identical in character. But the sun does not shine on to the ground at night! During the day the process of forced radiative convection alters the environmental lapse rate and creates a process by which thermal energy is preferentially retained by the rising air. Adiabatic convection is a pressure related phenomenon that is completely independent of the thermal radiant opacity of a gas. The canonical model with its uniform surface environment and diabatic (50% – 50%) process of energy partition does not describe the real world. It is this uniform day and night environment, that relies on the presence of greenhouse gases to create surface heating by low frequency thermal back-radiation from the atmosphere, that is the fatally flawed concept at the dead heart of climate science.As an important part of our collaboration Stephen and I attempted to have papers developed from our work published in the official journals, Icarus and the Royal Met Socs International Journal of Climatology. In one case our work was rejected before peer review on the grounds that it did not reflect main stream understanding. So, applying the principle of “softly-softly” I wrote and had published on the WattsUpWithThat (WUWT) blog hosted by Anthony Watts the following sequence of essays: –Calibrating the CERES Image of the Earth’s Radiant Emission to Space. In this first essay I demonstrate that the outgoing radiant flux of the Earth is related to the zones of the atmospheric circulation cells for the planet, and how by using simple meteorological parameters the average global temperature can be calculated.An Analysis of the Earth’s Energy Budget. In this second essay I apply the logic of Climate Science and show how by using the canonical rules of divide by 4 for the solar energy dilution divisor, and the interception rule of “half out to space and half back to the ground” for the low frequency energy transmission through the atmosphere, the process of energy capture by the atmosphere is self-limiting. Consequently, it is impossible to explain the high surface atmospheric temperature of the planet Venus by a radiant energy greenhouse effect.Modelling the Climate of Noonworld: A New Look at Venus. For this third essay I introduced my new climate model concept of a tidally locked planet (Noonworld) and show how this meteorological model fully replicates the canonical vacuum planet equation. The critical modelling distinction however is this – the presence of the dual environments of day and night in my model – whereas there is only a single uniform surface environment in the canonical model. This surface duality allows for the option to have an environment dominated by radiant cooling for the night, and an environment of forced solar radiant convection for the day. This critical distinction between adiabatic day and diabatic night time processes then allows for the creation of a dynamic-atmosphere energy-transport (DAET) process that mimics the natural environmental process of a thermal Hadley cell. My model clearly shows that the presence of thermal radiant opacity (aka greenhouse gases) is irrelevant to the process of energy retention by the atmosphere.Return to Earth: A New Predictive Model of the Earth’s Climate. In this next essay I apply the Noonworld model to the Earth’s climate system, by creating a three-element parallel model that replicates the three atmospheric cells of Hadley, Ferrel and Polar, first discussed in the CERES essay. This adiabatic climate model creates the required greenhouse effect in the Earth’s planetary atmosphere without invoking the need for greenhouse gas generated atmospheric thermal opacity effects.Using an Iterative Adiabatic Model to study the Climate of Titan. This final essay discusses the application of the adiabatic DAET climate model to Titan, the giant moon of Saturn. Titan has an almost pure nitrogen atmosphere that is too cold to contain either water or carbon dioxide. The canonical explanation for the climate of Titan involves methane as a greenhouse gas, but the DAET model demonstrates that it is air pressure alone that generates the atmospheric greenhouse effect on terrestrial planets and moons.The table that captures the fundamental issues of our work is this:Following the advice of a friend we were able to have our work peer reviewed and published by the Science Publishing Group. To date two papers have appeared:An Iterative Mathematical Climate Model of the Atmosphere of Titan. Inverse Climate Modelling Study of the Planet VenusOur third paper in this series “Return to Earth: A New Predictive Model of the Earth’s Climate” has passed peer review and is in press. We hope to complete the set with a modelling study of the atmosphere of Mars.The key difference between the new climate model we have devised and the canonical formulation is that our model is predictive.What I mean by this is that for the following 4 key input variables:Sunlight strength at the top of the atmosphere (Insolation intensity)The planet’s optical brightness (Bond albedo)The surface global average air temperature.The atmospheric thermal lapse rate.We are able to determine the following parameters:The height of the tropopause (which is a proxy for pressure).The temperature of the tropopause.Knowledge of the temperature of the tropopause is a metric that is particularly interesting. For the Earth this model temperature closely matches the freezing point of supercooled water. Solid ice particles in the upper atmosphere are highly efficient emitters of thermal radiation. So there now appears to be a link between planetary brightness (albedo) caused by the freezing of the primary atmospheric volatile (water), the height of the tropopause and thermal radiant emission to space.When applied to Venus the new climate model also predicts the height of the Venusian tropopause and its emission temperature. What is truly interesting is that the emission temperature of the Venusian tropopause is close to one of the stable freezing point cusps for concentrated sulphuric acid. It is clouds of concentrated sulphuric acid droplets in the upper atmosphere of Venus that gives this planet its extreme brightness. Like water for the Earth the freezing point of these droplets of sulphuric acid therefore creates efficient thermal radiating particles in the upper atmosphere of Venus.In both cases (Earth and Venus) the new climate model provides insights that suggest a relationship between albedo caused by the freezing point of each atmosphere’s primary condensing volatile and troposphere structure (temperature profile and atmospheric pressure) that are completely novel. This is also why I describe the canonical model as being a descriptive physical equation (with no predictive power) and ours as being an explanatory mathematical model.Philip Mulholland MSc Independent Researcher https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philip_MulhollandShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'climate models']",2020/05/28

Our review finds that the Hayhoe & Stoner work fails to consider the available long-term temperature and extreme weather event records for Alberta, thus giving a skewed and inaccurate assessment. We recommend that you reject the “Alberta’s Climate Future” report.Our team reviewed the longest-term temperature records in the province and found there is little evidence to support any of the claims in the Hayhoe & Stoner report. Hayhoe & Stoner only used data from 1950 to 2013 which gives a falsely exaggerated rising temperature trend. Long-term records that our team examined show that some regions of Alberta have experienced a cooling trend and fewer hot summer days, contrary to claims of Hayhoe & Stoner. Hayhoe & Stoner refer to two ‘Black Swan’ events as if caused by human-caused climate change; the 2013 Calgary flood and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire. The long-term records reveal that eight of the worst floods in Calgary’s history occurred before 1933 and two were more extreme in peak flow than that of 2013. The 2013 Calgary flood was due to a rare but known set of meteorological conditions. The largest recorded Alberta wildfire was that of the 1950 Chinchaga Fire Storm, which released a smoke pall seen around the world. The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire was sparked by human negligence, not human-caused climate change. The fire went rogue due to a sudden shift in high fire risk conditions and strong winds – and also due to lack of preparedness on the part of the province. The Flat Top Complex Wildfire Review of 2013 (in response to the Slave Lake wildfires of 2011, started by arsonists) had advised the province to have firefighting crews at the ready by April 15th. In 2016, Alberta’s forested areas were also affected by a strong 2015 El Nino warming which led to exceptional winter wood curing conditions for that year. Failing to include this information suggests a selection bias on the part of Hayhoe & Stoner.Hayhoe & Stoner use a method called “downscaling” where they attempt to apply the projections of global climate models to a specific region like Alberta. Global climate models (complex computer simulations) are known to ‘run hot’ – predicting much higher temperatures than those observed – consequently similar false ‘hot’ results were obtained for Alberta.Likewise, Hayhoe & Stoner’s report refers to two modelled scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways – RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 – as if these are ‘choices’ of how to achieve emissions reductions. The RCP8.5 is known to be an extremely unlikely scenario and has been rejected by most mainstream climate scientists, and neither scenario was meant to be used for comparative purposes for setting public policy. In fact, as reported in Forbes by climate policy analyst Roger Pielke, Jr., the RCP8.5 scenario has been embedded in the scientific, business and public conversation by a strategic promotional campaign of two ‘green’ billionaires, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg in the form of the “Risky Business” report. “Climate catastrophe” clearly feeds the commercial objectives of the carbon trading and renewables industries. Renewables promoters proclaim they offer a low-carbon ‘free’ energy solution when the truth is that they offer “Broken Promises” and “Empty Wallets” for taxpayers. The promise of renewable energy to provide economical electricity and declining emissions has failed. From 2006 to 2017 nearly U.S. $2.5 trillion of subsidies were provided to renewables while oil demand grew twice as fast as renewables and global emissions increased by almost 20%. The fact that many institutional investors, representing public sector pension plans, cash in on these subsidized renewables industries constitutes a form of taxation without representation, not to mention the greenwashing involved. Contrary to claims of ‘sustainable’ development, this is an unsustainable burden on taxpayers, based entirely on faulty scientific premises.We find it disconcerting that in a public presentation at the University of Calgary, Dr. Hayhoe, lead author of the “Alberta’s Climate Future” report, stated that China’s implementation of renewables is reducing global emissions, when in fact China is the largest emitter of all, with emissions growing by 28% between 2008 and 2018. As noted above, despite significant addition of renewables, global emissions have risen, not dropped. Thus, that comment by Dr. Hayhoe suggests either a pro-renewables ideology or ignorance of the facts on the part of Dr. Hayhoe. Canada’s climate and carbon tax policies are crippling our economy with Futile Folly and Canadians deserve better. Carbon taxes are ineffective and, as our report reveals, carbon dioxide is not the main driver of climate change. Canadians already have more than 600 greenhouse gas reduction or incentive policies imposed upon us which have never been audited for effectiveness. Canadian fuel taxes are more than $192/t carbon tax equivalent. Carbon taxes have not been effective in Norway or Zimbabwe. Why would they work in the coldest, second largest country in the world?As noted by these mainstream climate scientists, there is no reason to set a climate deadline and no emergency.One of Friends of Science Society’s Canadian scientific advisers, Dr. Madhav Khandekar, produced a literature review of climate science for the Alberta government in 2000, entitled “Uncertainties in Greenhouse gas Induced Climate Change”. In a 2018 interview, Dr. Khandekar indicated that after 18 years there are many more uncertainties. The science is not settled. We believe the Hayhoe & Stoner report should be rejected for all the failings as outlined in our report. Alberta taxpayers should not have to pay for fortune telling when the facts are available.But this matter goes beyond the concerns of Albertans. Recent controversy of a group of 265 academics, posting an open letter to the Prime Minister opposing support for the oil and gas sector, resulted in some academics claiming that Premier Kenney’s criticism of their stance was an effort to silence their opinions and they championed academic freedom. We also champion academic freedom. Just as our partner organization – CLINTEL – has asked UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for a high level ‘red team’ review of climate science orthodoxy, we propose that the University of Alberta host an International Climate Challenge Conference with a proposed working title of: “Dissenting Views: No Climate Emergency – We do Have Time”. We foresee a balanced spectrum of scientists from diverse disciplines and perspectives to engage in the sound and ancient principle that both sides should be fully and fairly heard. Audiatur et altera pars!Friends of Science Society is a group of earth, atmospheric, solar scientists and APEGA registered Professionals celebrating its 18th year of providing insights on climate science and related energy policies. We support the international CLINTEL Climate Intelligence network of over 800 scientists, scholars and professionals who state that there is no climate emergency and that natural forces, particularly various influences of the sun and ocean cycles, are the main driver of climate change. We would be happy to answer any questions.Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETYhttps://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Alberta%20Climate%20Future%20rebuttal.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'changement climatique', 'climate change', 'CLINTEL']",2020/05/26

Lyman’s bio can be read  here. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYIn a previous report and post entitled, “Broken Promises: Why Renewables Offer No Resilient Recovery: Part 1″, I began to respond to the claims of renewable energy advocates that governments should devote far more taxpayers’ money to renewables as a way of stimulating economic activity after the current Coronavirus pandemic subsides. Part 1 explained the trends in global energy markets and compared the markets for oil and natural gas with those for wind, solar and biomass energy sources. In this part, I will present an analysis of the costs of renewable energy sources.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EMPTY-WALLETS-NO-RESILIENT-RECOVERY-PART-2-Final-cover.pdfEMPTY-WALLETS-NO-RESILIENT-RECOVERY-PART-2-Final-coverDownloadRenewables were heavily promoted in Ontario by environmental groups as a less costly energy solutionOntario and Germany offer real-life examples of what happens when governments chose to spend billions of electricity ratepayer’s dollars on renewable energy sources (i.e. industrial wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels, and biomass-burning power plants). Both jurisdictions offered feed-in-tariffs whereby renewables generators were given above-market prices for power purchased under long-term contracts. Renewables also received “first-to-the-grid” rights and many other subsidies and advantages not available to conventional energy suppliers. The rates for residential consumers in Ontario doubled after the Green Energy Act was passed in 2009. In Germany, electricity prices rose to the equivalent of Cdn $1.42 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), nine times the price that would have applied with no solar and wind capacity. If people in Canada were forced to pay electricity rates at German levels, the annual household bill would be over $4,600. In Ontario, the cost of the Green Energy Act contracting is over $4 billion per year. The cost of new renewable energy added to the electrical grid is a subject of great controversy. Under the “levelized cost of energy” (LCOE) calculation, which attempts to measures all costs over the life of an investment, the cost of wind and solar energy to be added in 2025 has been declining rapidly. That analysis, however, has been strongly contested for what it leaves out, notably the systemic, or grid-wide, costs of intermittent energy. To illustrate, electricity that can be supplied by a wind generator at a levelized cost of 6 cents per kWh is not “cheap” if the output is available primarily at night when the market value of electricity is only 2.5 cents per kWh. The cost reductions wind and solar have experienced so far are nearing the limits of what physics allows. The consideration of costs would be incomplete without taking into account the extraordinary subsidies and other advantages granted by governments. From 2010 to 2019, total U.S. federal government subsidies for wind were $36.8 billion and for solar energy were $34.4 billion. When measured in terms of per unit of electricity generated, the subsidies were U.S. $82.46 per MWh for solar and $18.86 per MWh for wind. Unfortunately, comparable figures are not available for Canada. Modern biofuels, which include ethanol and biodiesel for transportation and woody biomass for electricity generation, are not economically viable in the absence of government subsidies or mandates. Biodiesel costs about U.S. 55 cents per liter to produce, or 20% more than corn-based ethanol. The long search for a technological breakthrough that would lower the cost of cellulosic biofuels has not succeeded. Today, if a commercial-scale plant were available, cellulosic biofuels would sell at U.S. $35 per gallon, more than ten times the price of gasoline in the U.S. today. Because woody biomass is based on plant growth, it is treated under U.N. greenhouse gas accounting rules as having zero emissions. In fact, a recent U.S. study found that a biomass-fueled electricity generation plant emits 50 to 85% more than a coal plant, and 300% of a natural gas-fired plant.The declining capital and operating costs are more than offset by the extremely high grid system management costs of introducing solar and wind. They represent low-productivity energy sources that are not self-sustaining, use a disproportionate amount of land, have deleterious environmental effects, and pose risks in terms of the stability and reliability of energy supply.The ultimate energy and climate policy considerations should be the ones that are almost never taken into account by governments in Canada and other OECD countries – the costs per tonne of GHG emissions avoided and the marginal benefits of lower emissions on the climate. If they were, it is unlikely we would invest in renewables at all.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/05/22/global-climate-experiment-associated-with-covid-19-pandemic/,Jack Averill ,Global Climate Experiment Associated with COVID-19 Pandemic," Contributed by Pavel Kalenda, CoalExp, Pražmo, Czech Republic  © 2020 Globální-klimatický-experiment_7_ang-2DownloadAbstractThe coronavirus pandemic allowed a global climate experiment by shutting down the global economy and hence stopping theCO2 production. The drop in CO2 concentrations was observed at the Mauna Loa Observatory 35 days after the Chinese holidays and stop of production. The increase of CO2 concentration to the previous values, which followed the secular trend and the annual cycle, confirmed the hypothesis that the anthropogenic CO2 is not the essential reason for the long-time increase in CO2 concentration,but it only moved the stable balance on the ocean surface by the constant value, but without any influence on the secular trend.The present coronavirus pandemic enabled an otherwise unthinkable global experiment – a complete shutdown of the largesteconomies of the world for a period of time long enough to measure changes in CO2 concentration at the Mauna Loa Observatory.Macroeconomic indicatorsAccording to the Bloomberg agency (2020) the economy in China dropped 80% after the Lunar New Year (January 25, 2020), when traditional holidays were followed by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, lasting through the whole February and a part of March (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 – China’s economic recovery after the Lunar New Year (time 0). Comparison of year 2020 (blue) with year 2019 (white). (source – Bloomberg 2020)In February and March the production in most enterprises in Europe was down, and so was the international air transport after the spread of COVID-19 in Italy and eventually in all Europe. The US production only went down at the end of March. China accounts for the largest output globally, so carbon emissions should be driven mainly by the Chinese economy and less so by the European and US economies. Analysis of CO2 concentrations data If the assumptions of all the IPCC models were correct, the drop in carbon emissions in China should be also seen in the data, measured mainly at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii (ESRL 2020). Daily, weekly and monthly carbon dioxide concentrations for the last year between March 1, 2019 and March 30, 2020 are in Fig. 2.Fig. 2 – Daily, weekly and monthly CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa Observatory between November 1,2018 and May 19, 2020 (ESRL 2020) A turn in the development of CO2 concentrations is clearly apparent since the middle of February 2020, but the trend and the annual course of CO2 concentrations need to be taken away for the exact analysis of the size of the anomaly. Firstly, the monthly CO2 means were reduced by the secular trend, archived in the ESRL database (2020) (see Fig. 3 – red curve). Linear approximation of the trend (y = 0.0078 t + 407.13 ppm) was taken away from the weekly data from the period between January 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020. The resulting values of concentration (Fig. 3 – violet curve) were bind to the curve of the annual course (Fig. 3 – blue curve) by subtracting the 0.4 ppm CO2 (natural fluctuations of CO2 concentrations). Fig.3 – Changes in CO2 concentrations measured at Mauna Loa. Red curve – monthly means of the secular trend after the removal of the annual course, blue curve – monthly means corrected to the secular trend, violet curve – weekly means of CO2 concentrations after subtracting the linear approximation of the trend and natural fluctuation (correction = -0.4 ppm), yellow – the rising part of the annual course (between December and May) during 2018 and 2019 and shifted in time by 730 or 365 days (ESRL 2020). Arrows mark the periods of annual mild variation (drop) in CO2 concentrations possibly related to the Chinese Lunar New Year.Fig.4 – China’s economy output (red) (credit Bloomberg 2020) and anomaly of CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa in 2020 (credit ESRL 2020). The arrow marks the Chinese Lunar New Year (January 25, 2020). Subsequently, both parts of the annual courses of monthly means of concentrations in the period between December and May 2018 and 2019 were moved forward by 730 and 365 days respectively (Fig. 3 – yellow curve). Both curves completely overlap, which cannot be recognised in the thickness of the curve and they also follow up the curve of monthly means of concentration at the beginning of 2020. This yellow curve, that is the rising part of the annual course of CO2 concentrations (dependence on the annual course of temperatures and photosynthesis), was interpolated with a straight line (y = 0,0285 t – 21,21 ppm), which is taken as a “basis” for the measurements of anomalous deviations of weekly CO2 concentrations in 2020 (see Fig. 4).The clear anomaly of CO2 concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory starts one month after the Chinese Lunar New Year and the depth of the anomaly is approximately 1.6 ppm (Fig. 4). A similar drop in CO2 concentration after the Chinese holidays has been seen every year (drop in the Chinese production approx. 20%), but the depths of anomalies have been at the level of natural variations, i.e. totally insignificant (see arrows in Fig.3).An assumption can be made that if any human production completely stopped (and the CO2 production as well), CO2 concentrations could drop by even 10 ppm, which is to the value of about 403 ppm. However, as it is evident from both the curve of the annual course (Fig. 3) and the curve of the anomalous development in 2020 (Fig. 4), after the economy recovery, the CO2 concentration was at the same level as before the production decline. It can be concluded that anthropogenic CO2 and its amount does not affect substantially either the dynamic balance on the surface of the world’s oceans or the long term trend in concentrations, which can be explained by the changes in temperatures of the oceans and atmosphere and the equality of partial pressures of CO2 at the surface (Salby 2012).

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/05/22/a-public-response-to-the-open-letter-to-pm-justin-trudeau-by-265-canadian-academics/,Warren Blair ,A PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE OPEN LETTER TO PM JUSTIN TRUDEAU BY 265 CANADIAN ACADEMICS," Contributed by Allan MacRae © 2020 Some 265 academics, overwhelmingly NOT from the technically-competent fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine recently wrote a foolish letter to Canada’s Prime Minister, stating the following false nonsense:“Instead of purchasing equity in oil and gas, Canadian governments should pursue the retraining of fossil fuel workers, and public ownership of Canada’s renewable energy sector, where government coordination and large-scale investment are needed in the short term and where investments will be repaid.”The Calgary-based group “Friends of Science“ posted a detailed review of the academics letter, entitled “BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU”, not too subtly suggesting that these academics do not pull-their-weight in the economic spectrum, and were dependent on real wealth-producing enterprises like the energy industry to support their pseudo-intellectual blatherings:https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BITING-THE-HAND-THAT-FEEDS-YOU-1.pdfIt is past time that these technologically-innumerate academics learned some basic scientific and economic realities, knowledge that many of us acquire as children:A GREEN ENERGY PRIMER – GRID-CONNECTED WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY BOTH FAIL DUE TO INTERMITTENCY AND DIFFUSIVITY.INTERMITTENCY means the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow 24/7, and the electric grid needs reliable dispatchable generation, not generation that goes up and down uncontrollably. Battery storage is touted as the solution, but it does not economically exist at grid-scale.DIFFUSIVITY means it takes far too much land area to replace conventional energy with wind and/or solar generation – it would take fully ~10% of all the land area in Britain to do so. In the USA, this 10% would total about 300,000 square miles, or all of Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.Energy experts have known these facts since ~forever. In 2002 my co-authors and I published the following statements that have both proven correct–to-date:a. “Climate science does not support the theory of catastrophic human-made global warming – the alleged warming crisis does not exist.”b. “The ultimate agenda of pro-Kyoto advocates is to eliminate fossil fuels, but this would result in a catastrophic shortfall in global energy supply – the wasteful, inefficient energy solutions proposed by Kyoto advocates simply cannot replace fossil fuels.”“DEBATE ON THE KYOTO ACCORD”Published by APEGA in the PEGG, reprinted by other professional journals, The Globe and Mail and La Presse,by Dr. Sallie Baliunas (Harvard-Smithsonian), Dr. Tim Patterson (Carleton U) and Allan MacRae, November 2002http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/KyotoAPEGA2002REV1.pdfDr. Sallie Baliunas on “Weather Cooking with the Help of Satan”Dr. Sallie Baliuna on “weather cooking with the help of Satan’ – how Little Ice Age ‘climate heretics’ were burnt at the stake for questioning the ‘consensus’…and the same occurs today.Since then, trillions of dollars of scarce global resources have been squandered on worthless green energy schemes that are not green and produce little useful (dispatchable) energy. The result of this green energy virtue-signalling has been the destabilization of electrical grids, runaway energy costs, energy poverty, increased winter deaths, and INsignificant reduction in CO2 emissions. What a foolish green debacle!I also suggest they read the following paper. In the unlikely event that they become even marginally competent, they will reverse their erroneous positions on climate and energy, and retract their imbecilic letter.THE CATASTROPHIC ANTHROPOGENIC GLOBAL WARMING (CAGW) AND THE HUMAN-MADE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISES ARE PROVED FALSE By Allan M.R.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/05/22/the-montreal-nursing-homes-massacre/,,The Montreal Nursing Homes Massacre," Contributed by William Walter Kay BA LL B © 2020William Kay blogs at Ecofacism.comWe are deeply concerned about the climate advocates tying the COVID19 pandemic to a push for ‘green’ initiatives; equally concerning, many ‘green’ activists advocate for depopulation. Contributor William Kay has written extensively on the green movement and depopulation. At this year’s World Economic Forum in DAVOS, depopulation was a theme, as was climate change – but the real risk of pandemic or infectious disease (top of mind in 2006) had been displaced entirely by climate change.Reportage on Canadian euthanasia invariably highlights the pioneering role Quebec’s euthanasia movement plays within the country.In June 2014 Quebec’s Assembly became Canada’s first legislature to legalize euthanasia. The Bill, introduced by the Parti Quebecois then moved forward by Liberal Premier Couillard’s government, passed 94 to 22 with no abstentions. The Act Respecting End of Life Care was the fruit of years of labour by pressure groups like Quebec’s chapter of Dying with Dignity and the 600-member Quebec Palliative Care Association (QCPA) whose General Manager also presides over the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes. QCPA’s Manifesto extols citizens’ rights to a “good death” and to professional counseling regarding end-of-life options. On the eve of the vote Quebec’s College of Physicians endorsed euthanasia; something neither the Canadian Medical Association nor any other provincial College had done.Similarly, the Archdiocese of Quebec parted with the many Canadian Catholic clerics who deny funeral sacraments to those who die via euthanasia lest they endorse sinful suicide. Quebec’s euthanized are buried as per normal; an approach the Archdiocese claims complies with Pope Francis’s teachings. Quebec’s medically-assisted death squads waited for the greenlight from Quebec’s Court of Appeal then, between December 10, 2015 and March 31, 2019, either through medically-assisted death or terminal sedation, they terminated 5,856 Quebecers’ lives. Around 4% of all Quebec deaths are now induced.This percentage is not high enough for some. At a November 29, 2019 presser Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann, flanked by three supportive opposition politicians, advocated comprehensive soliciting of advanced consents from the elderly so that should these folk later lose capacity to legally consent, they could be dispatched without much ado. McCann went on to comment on the status of a Quebec Superior Court ruling rejecting the Criminal Code’s criterion that a patient’s “death must be reasonably foreseeable” before euthanasia is permitted. Quebec never appealed this ruling. (The matter is now in limbo with pundits expecting Ottawa to delete this troublesome criterion mid-July.) Thus, the Covid-19 (C-19) response roadshow hit Montreal just as their euthanasia lobby forged a momentous compact among judges, bishops, politicians and the regional medical oligarchy. Of course, this euthanasia drive is not the sole key to unlocking Quebec’s peculiar C-19 response; but it must be held in mind; …and what a peculiar response Quebec’s has been!  Quebec’s 8.5 million residents constitute 22.6% of Canada’s population (37.6 million).  Quebec’s 3,483 C-19 fatalities constitute 62.5% of the Canadian total (5,595).  Ontario, population 14.6 million, reports 1,858 C-19 deaths.  The rest of Canada (pop 14.5 million) reports 345 deaths.  In terms of C-19 deaths-per-million citizens: Quebec registers 409; Ontario registers 127; and the rest of Canada: 24. Four million Quebecers reside in Greater Montreal. Another 2 million reside within a 100-kilometre radius of Montreal. This combined area witnessed 90% of Quebec’s C-19 fatalities partly because this area hosts most of Quebec’s 2,600 long-term care facilities (“nursing homes”). Said facilities are mostly run by the provincial government. Officially, 75% (2,601) of Quebec’s C-19 fatalities occurred inside nursing homes. There is clear evidence of under-counting of nursing home fatalities. Nursing home plus geriatric ward fatalities exceed 90% of all fatalities.Official figures do transpose nicely upon reported ages of C-19 fatalities. Almost 40% of fatalities were aged 80 to 90. A third were over 90. Quebec reported its first C-19 death on March 18. Six of Quebec’s first 9 fatalities happened in nursing homes. By March 27 nursing homes were obvious biohazards. On April 1 officials revealed that 519 nursing homes harboured at least one C-19 case.On April 8 news broke that 115 of 250 residents of a Laval nursing home were C-19 positive. Thirteen residents there had perished. On April 10 ambulance crews discovered residents malnourished, dehydrated and covered with feces at Dorval’s Residence Herron. Crews found corpses Herron’s staff were unaware of. A dispute erupted between provincial health officials and the ambulance service over how many body-bags had been dragged from Herron and over how many of those bags contained C-19 fatalities. Herron, which averages 4 deaths per month, had 31 deaths in 14 days. One hundred-fifty residents and staff tested positive.On April 13 authorities noted a government-run home in Lasalle had 26 C-19 fatalities and 351 cases. At an April 14 presser Quebec’s Director of Public Health stated that he had originally operated on the assumption that asymptomatic C-19 carriers were not contagious. This derriere covering arrived just as news outlets dropped bombs like:“…as in Italy and Spain, Quebec focussed on freeing up hospital and ICU capacity, and in some cases preventatively transferred seniors out of hospitals into care facilities. At the same time, it established recommendations to those care facilities restricting the transfer of residents back to hospitals should they fall ill. The result has been a humanitarian disaster of still undetermined proportions…”Health authorities knew intimately where they were sending and confining these patients. Problems at Quebec nursing homes have been studied ad nauseam. Many homes have crowded communal dining rooms and narrow hallways. Many have wards with multiple beds per room and shared toilets. Most have residents incapable of following elementary hygiene protocols meandering about the building. Staff often work at more than one home and continued to do so during the pandemic. Also amidst the pandemic, nursing home staff earning little more than minimum wage were expected to buy their own personal protective gear. By April’s end thousands of nursing home staff had contracted C-19 or had walked off the job. One home had 2 staff attending to 60 bedridden patients.On April 30 the government reported 6,603 C-19 cases among nursing home residents.Quebec’s elderly C-19 sufferers were sent to and/or confined in circumstances approaching the opposite of quarantine. The contagious were not isolated and well-tended. They were herded into cloistered proximity with the most vulnerable, then abandoned. Quebec has 9,280 C-19 cases aged over 70. Quebec is only treating 1,763 C-19 sufferers in hospital (many of whom caught C-19 whilst in geriatric wards). Hence, thousands of C-19 patients continue to languish inside bio chambers alongside tens of thousands of elderly neighbors.A wise man once opined: never presume there is a conspiracy behind any disaster that sheer stupidity or mere incompetence might explain. That said: are we to be blind to the fact that the demographic cohort which the euthanasia boosters have long sought to snuff-out is the same cohort now being extinguished by C-19?Beyond the gormless promises and thespian commiserations proffered by Legault’s team one espies a shadow party of Montreal-area politico-medical elites who during the years immediately preceding the pandemic obsessively clamoured for the social licence and legal permission to exterminate the precise people who are now dropping like flies under their watch.

Petersberg Virtual Dialogue).With all due respect, your appeal to use the corona pandemic to deindustrialize the West by moving to green energy is based on speculation and will destroy the global economy for many decades.Please be aware that the corona pandemic is not caused by climate change but by the fact that UN’s health organization WHO was incapable to take action in time. If the WHO had been more alert by reporting the outbreak immediately when it was first detected, and had insisted to Chinese authorities to promptly isolate the Wuhan area, they would have saved the world from a global crisis. This has nothing to do with climate change but with irresponsible behaviour.Please be also aware that mankind is incapable to stop the big natural forces that cause changes in the climate. Instead of fighting against these causes (‘mitigation’), we should timely act against the consequences whenever they become a threat (‘adaptation’). In past decades UN’s IPCC mitigation policy has never spared one life, while adaptation has saved the lives of hundreds of millions.Idealistic attempts to re-engineer nature with super computers and green deals in the hope of preventing natural change, are pointless. Mankind cannot prevent or control the occurrence of natural events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, extreme weather, global warming and cooling, virus mutations etc. When such ‘Black Swans’ occur, we should identify them early and adapt to them promptly.History tells us that the success of civilization depends on our ability to adapt to inevitable change. Adaptation works and mankind is good at it. Forms of life that could not adapt did not survive. To get the economy on its feet again, please stop preaching doom and gloom. Stop promising the impossible – a perfect Earth. With all due respect, your green deal plans are scientifically and economically far from realistic. They will lead to a deeper recession and an unprecedented poverty worldwide.We would also like to point out that your demands violate the fundamental principles of the UN Charter – Article 2.1, which guarantees equal sovereignty, and Article 55, which promotes economic development, full employment and higher standards of living. Your plans do not follow these principles. Actually, they reach the opposite.Finally, on 23 September 2019 we have sent you a registered letter, which you never answered. We repeat our invitation to you to organize with CLINTEL a constructive high-level meeting between world-class scientists on both sides of the debate on your green plans. A ‘Red Team Meeting’ will give effect to the sound and ancient principle that both sides should be fully and fairly heard. Audiatur et altera pars!Please let us know your thoughts about such a joint meeting.Yours sincerely,President of CLINTELProfessor Guus Berkhout President of CLINTEL  Ambassadors of CLINTEL, Nobel Laureate Professor Ivar Giaever – Norway Professor Reynald Du Berger – French speaking Canada Terry Dunleavy – New Zealand Viv Forbes – Australia Professor Jeffrey Foss – English speaking Canada Jens Morton Hansen – Denmark Morten Jødal – Norway Professor Demetris Koutsoyiannes – Greece Rob Lemeire – Dutch speaking Belgium Professor Richard Lindzen – USA Dr. Thiago Maia – Brazil Professor Henri A.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/05/20/please-help-prevent-foss-from-becoming-the-next-covid-casualty/,robert graham ,Please Help Prevent FoSS From Becoming The Next COVID Casualty," PRESIDENT’S FUNDRAISING APPEAL to our loyal 50,000+ visitorsWe are truly living through an unprecedented, interesting time period. Never in the history of mankind have so many nations purposely been forced to shut down all sectors of their economies simultaneously. The daily reports of strife in all sectors are saddening.I have always believed in the resiliency of businesses in difficult times but every sector is being forced to beg for bailouts. These bailouts will balloon our national debt and will impact our children and grandchildren with record indebtedness, future tax increases and lower economic productivity.As well, Canada’s Federal Government, likely guided by the new “climate change” fixated governor of the Bank of Canada, now requires that “companies must disclose their climate action plans and sustainability goals in order to qualify” for financial aid. Setting “climate change” as a priority over helping companies maintain payroll is a new virtue signalling low.It is very frustrating to see this is not simply a Canadian mindset but it is global as the “world’s richest nations must ensure their COVID-19 recovery plans are sustainable and help meet the goals of the Paris climate accord”.Friends of Science Society is also experiencing the pain of the economic crash. We find ourselves in a funding crisis: our operational funds will run out in September if we do not receive significant cash infusions.As I mentioned in my August 2019 post, we survive on ~C$150,000 per year and we provide you with the critical review of ideological climate and energy policy claims. Please note that we do not qualify for any of the bailout packages “available” for non-profit organizations.As of today we get more than 50,000 individual annual visitors to this blog. You are not an insignificant group. If all of you would send us $10 each year, we would never have to worry about funding. We would then be able to focus on providing you with the information you have come to expect and we would increase our number of posts and reports.In Canada, we have political “leaders”, Elizabeth May of the Green Party and Yves-Francois Blanchet of the Bloc Quebecois, declaring that “oil is dead” and that “putting more money into” the oil industry “is a very bad idea”. These groups and others support the notion that the pandemic is an “opportunity” to destroy the petroleum industry that has been the economic engine of Canada for decades.For those of you that are already saying “not another pro-petroleum article”, I stop you. Look around, what industry is spared from this rhetoric?If you listen closely, the “new normal” means no more shopping centers, no more beef, no more flying, no more socializing at restaurants or bars, no more sporting events, no more tourism, no more anything in the “new normal”. We are being told the pandemic is a chance for humanity to examine what is essential.I know what is essential. All jobs are essential. Canada was built by past generations that had the opportunity to pursue their own lives in a country that provided them the space to make something of themselves through hard work. The resource industry has been the historic engine for our great country. Anyone arguing that this country will flourish without extraction of resources is fooling themselves.The environmental “green new deal” movements have been manipulating western economies for decades to support renewable energies which supposedly would save us from the false narrative that human made CO2 is killing the planet. The truth about wind, solar and biomass has been recently exposed by Michael Moore’s Planet of the Humans video. His revelations have exposed the Big Green industrialists that hide the fact that their technologies do not replace hydrocarbons. Some have even hailed the video as pro-hydrocarbons, but do not be fooled. His video blames “over-population” for destroying climate and his proposal to “get ourselves under control” is a not so subliminal hint at depopulation.I am glad to see the flaws of the Big Green movements being revealed by this video because over the years the mainstream press has been a disgrace and done nothing to expose these issues. Let me point out that we at FoSS have been at the forefront of revealing the flaws in the “renewables replace hydrocarbons” deceits since 2013. Our reports: Costly Misinformed Diagnosis, The UN’s sneak attack on your pension, Undue Influence Markets Skewed, A Confluence of Carbonbaggers, In the Dark on Renewables, Shocking Reality, and Look Before You Leap are just a few of the times that we shed light on the “renewables are the solution” and “green tax” movements. FoSS wants to continue being your source of evidenced-based, critical review on climate science and policy. As President of our society, I am asking for your support.Too many groups want to use the global economic pandemic shutdown as the template for their green new deals. The hubris of these groups that think we can create a thermostat that will modulate climate is dangerous. Their aim to a zero CO2 environment fails to understand the economic connections that intricately bind global economies together. Constant panic is only a recipe for global economic destruction. This in turn will drive millions into or further into poverty.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/04/22/inconvenient-facts/,Amin Purshottam ,Inconvenient Facts," Contributed by Robert Lyman  ©  2020. Lyman’s bio can be read  here.Every two years, Natural Resources Canada publishes the Energy Fact Book, a compilation of statistics about Canadian energy supply, demand, trade and related topics. I recently reviewed the Energy Fact Book 2018-2019, and was impressed by how many of the facts, honestly and accurately reported by the department, contradict the usual storylines of those who claim that environmental, and especially climate “emergency”, considerations should govern energy and environmental policy decision-making in Canada. I urge those who are interested to read through the report, which can be found here:https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/pdf/energy-factbook-oct2-2018%20(1).pdfI offer this selection of factual highlights from the book in contrast to the usual claims of climate alarm.Energy and the EconomyClaim: Energy is not a major contributor to Canada’s income, especially outside of Alberta.Facts: While the energy sector GDP in Alberta in 2017 was the highest in Canada at $79.6 billion, it was significant in all provinces, including notably Ontario ($15.9 billion), Quebec ($14.9 billion), Saskatchewan ($13.2 billion) and British Columbia ($12.9 billion).Claim: The energy industry does not contribute much to government revenues.Facts:The average annual government revenue from the energy industries over the period 2012-2016 was $17.8 billion. Of this, the oil and gas industry accounted for $15.8 billion, or 89%, with the upstream portion of the oil and gas industry providing $12.9 billion, or $72%.The energy sector’s share of total taxes paid by all industries was 8.4%.Research and DevelopmentClaim: Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) receive an undue share of federal and provincial government energy research and development expenditures.Facts:In the 2016-2017 fiscal year. Federal, provincial and territorial government spending on R&D related to fossil fuels totaled $173 million (compared to $983 million by industry). The same year, governments spent $312 million on renewable energy R&D (compared to $361 million by industry) and $177 million on energy end use (compared to $219 million by industry). In other words, government spending on oil and gas R&D was only 26% of government energy-related R&D.“Clean Technology”Claim: The “clean technology” sector is a very important part of Canada’s economy.Facts:In 2016, the clean technology sector accounted for 1.3% of Canada’s GDP.Claim: Renewable energy is a source of increasing investment in Canada.Facts:Renewable energy investments declined from a peak of about $6.8 billion in 2014 to $2 billion in 2016, before partially recovering to $3.3 billion in 2017. Investments in solar PV declined from about $2.2 billion in 2014 to $300 million in 2017.Emissions ReductionClaim:Average Canadians should pay more for energy to reduce demand and GHG emissions.Facts:In 2016, the average Canadian household spent $4.086 on energy, 6.6% of household consumption. Energy costs have risen faster than inflation since 2002.Claim: Canada has not done well in reducing GHG emissions per capita.Facts:From 2000 to 2016, Canada’s GHG emissions declined by 23% per dollar of GDP and by 18% per capita.Claim:GHG emissions from electricity generation are too high.Facts:Canada’s percentage of electricity generation from non-GHG emitting sources is 81%, among the highest in the world. Hydro made up 59%, nuclear 15%, and renewables 7%. Electricity sector emissions declined from about 130 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2000 to about 70 million tonnes in 2016.Transportation SectorClaim:Electricity is a major part of the energy sources needed to fuel transportation.Facts:Electricity provides less than 0.5 % of the energy needed to fuel transportation in Canada.Industry SectorClaim:Fossil fuels are not important for Canada’s industrial sector.Facts:In 2015, 73% of the energy used by Canadian industry was based on fossil fuels. Twenty per cent was from electricity and seven per cent “others”.Commercial and Institutional SectorClaim: It is easy to reduce energy consumption in the commercial and institutional sectorsFacts:Between 1990 and 2015, commercial and institutional energy use increased by 35%, even as energy intensity declined by 8%.Residential SectorClaim:Space heating and water heating does not depend on fossil fuels.Facts:In 2015, natural gas provided 68% of the energy for water heating. Natural gas and heating oil provided 57% of the energy for space heating.Oil sandsClaim:The GHG emissions intensity of production from the oil sands is increasing.Fact:From 2000 to 2016, oil sands emissions per barrel decreased by 29%.Claim:The oil sands are a large part of global emissions.Fact:The oil sands account for 0.1% of global GHG emissions.Claim:Oil sands production takes up too much land.Facts:The total area being mined for oil sands is 901 square kilometers. That is 0.009% of Canada’s area. Electricity GenerationClaim:Fossil fuels are not important for electricity generation in Canada.Facts:Here are the shares of electricity generation provided by coal, natural gas and oil by province and territory in 2016:Nunavut: 100%Alberta: 88 %Saskatchewan: 84%Nova Scotia: 77%NWT: 58%N.B.: 38%Ontario: 9%Claim: Wind and solar energy are important sources of electricity generationFacts:In 2016, 57.5 % of renewable energy production was hydro, 23% biomass, 5.4% wind and only 0.5% solar.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'economy', 'energy']",2020/04/22
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/04/22/but-what-an-oil-shock/,,But what an oil shock ?!," April 22, 2020By Samuele Furfari.Yes, the oil market starts to work, and too bad if traders lose money!A Google translate from the French original, with permission of the author. https://www.contrepoints.org/2020/04/22/369770-mais-quel-choc-petrolier  Samuele FurfariWhen electricity from wind or solar sources is regularly “sold” at a negative price because nature produces when the market does not want it, nobody takes offense. Yet this unnatural price comes from the pocket of all consumers. We accept – or rather we do not talk about it – because it is “green” and therefore no definition is good.But it is enough that the oil is sold for a few minutes at a negative price for all the media, in particular social media, to go wild.The future of the oil market This technical epiphenomenon is hardly determining for the future of the oil market. As with any raw material, between production and consumption, there are more or less large volumes of storage. The economic collapse brought about by the Covid-19 led to an unexpected drop in demand for oil.A similar phenomenon occurred on September 11, 2001 and during the Subprime crisis in 2008, but this time it is the whole world that is affected, longer and more deeply. So that oil stocks are saturated, tankers and supertankers still have some capacity, but storage prices have exploded. It is sometimes cheaper to sell at a loss than to pay for storage.Yes, the oil market is starting to work, and too bad if the traders lose money!The Covid-19 crisis revealed to the general public, and to certain journalists who had in mind that “the end of oil”, that the main energy market (35% in the EU) is working and is no longer under the control of OPEC countries or elsewhere of OPEC plus Russia (OPEC +).Inventories are so large that it will take months, or even a year or two depending on the strength of the recovery, to bring them back to the normal level of a fluid market.The return to normal No one can predict when the recovery will return to consumption close to that before the crisis (close to 100 million barrels per day).As a result, an abnormally low price of oil can be expected during the period of freeing up stocks and well beyond. Of course, as soon as the planes resume their normal course, the trucks will transport the raw materials or the finished products and that the automobile transport will resume, the demand will allow the oil companies to get out of the rut.In countries which have had the experience of working from home during confinement, a modest fraction will continue it, mainly in the administrative field and certain services. But that will not be generalized: it is an illusion invented by who knows who that one is going to be able to make the world work from his home. Go tell it to traders, restaurateurs, tourist operators, construction workers and contractors, and teachers! It’s simply incongruous.In any case, with a sluggish economy for too long and the pressure of the decreasing followers, the EU will never again be the engine of growth; the EU will passively watch the growth in demand that will take place outside and in spite of itself.A worrying phenomenon? The very people who support the oil industry are concerned about the damage that is going to be in this sector. But it is part of life in a market economy. There will be bankruptcies in the free world, but let’s not forget that 90% of the reserves belong to states.The companies of the Middle East states have nothing to worry about: they will not go bankrupt. In the free world, there will be and it will lead to cheap repurchases by those who had the means to resist during this crisis.A wave of consolidations at the end of the 1990s already took place, creating each time a group more powerful than the sum of the parts. Exxon bought 82 billion Mobil to partially reform Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. BP merged with Amoco. For the French and the Belgians let us recall the merger between Petrofina and Total which ended in an absorption, Total also rapidly absorbing Elf.This natural phenomenon is nothing to worry about. On the contrary, it is economic efficiency (also energy efficiency!) Which creates essential synergies to pursue the technological innovations which are the real engine of business growth and which ultimately led to abandonment of the punitive geopolitics of certain oil-producing countries.Of course, this will also happen in the field of source rock oil (shale oil) in the USA. But this is nothing new. I often like to recall that in December 2009 during the COP-15 which was held in Copenhagen, while the EU was trying to convince developing countries to follow it in order to reduce their CO2 emissions by 20% shimmer with 7.7 billion euros in aid, ExxonMobil bought the unknown XTO Energy for 41 billion dollars.It was to capture the deposits that the small business owned when the majorn had not come to bring about the magnitude of the change – including geopolitics – that was going to create the mother rock oil. Other acquisitions, this time driven by necessity, will take place. So what ?What will happen to the price of oil? As it is essential and that it will remain so, its price will be determined above all by demand, because the reserves are amply sufficient and above all better diversified and distributed than during the oil shocks of the 1970s. This market is so huge that variations in Even low prices generate huge gains or losses, and so journalists will continue to tell us stories of ups and downs that in fact should only be of interest to traiders.Fortunately, the title of yesterday’s Boursorama article “After the health crisis, preparing for the next oil shock” is actually a question. The article is good to talk about “impossible containment” of the fall in price.The trend was already quite bearish before the Covid-19 crisis and he is therefore right to say that “no realistic reduction agreement could revive prices”. But from there to speak of shock seems excessive to me, the more so as “shock” remains in the collective imagination a shortage of oil. The reverse will happen.As soon as the demand has to be satisfied, the pumps will restart in the existing wells and if necessary prospecting and completion of new wells will occur. The abundance of reserves, the war between Saudi Arabia and Russia which did not stem the fall and the inexistence of Iran and Venezuela sufficiently demonstrate that the geopolitics of the shortage does not exist more and therefore the price of oil will be “reasonable”.The politically correct declarations of Shell or BP which announce that they will reach carbon neutrality in 30 years (it is still necessary to know if such announcements mean zero oil) are absolutely not likely to disrupt the huge, unavoidable market of oil, the Asian countries will take care of it.Besides, what can the European Green Deal claim to add to replace oil by 2050? The obvious failure of biofuels policy in recent years has closed their doors to them, including for environmental reasons. So transport will become all electric?It takes a lot of faith to believe it, especially since it is also claimed that heating, which represents 50% of the final energy demand in the EU, must become completely electric (let’s forget the fantasy of heating with wood if only for environmental reasons)? Of course all electric means for the EU all renewable!Yes, there would be another solution: to continue confinement so as to stop transport definitively, which some of the Green Deal’s defendants do not hesitate to propose.One industry that is currently losing, but one that will benefit when the situation returns to normal, is the petrochemical industry. The closure or reduction of refinery activity caused by the drop in transportation could cause a shortage in the petrochemical chain. The basic material for petrochemicals is generated during the refining of petroleum into petroleum products, but it is of course the demand for fuel for transport which determines production since petrochemicals represent only 13% of the demand for petroleum.ICIS, a consultancy in the sector, estimates that of the 12.1 million barrels distilled daily in Europe, 6.6 million barrels are random with a reduction of 2.2 million barrels already effective. As a result, naphtha is becoming scarce and its price is increasing. CIHI estimates that 26% of the ethylene market in Europe is at risk. The price of the raw material could increase. But subsequently, when the price remains normal, the production price of petrochemicals, and therefore of plastic, will remain low.I take this opportunity to make the reader aware of the importance of plastic. All the images of laboratories or hospitals that we are currently seeing are a demonstration that without plastic there would be none of this.Rather than looking at the tree, it would be better to observe the forest in wonder. The revelation is not the low price of oil, but the paradigm shift we are experiencing. Oil – but also natural gas – are so abundant that it is urgent to change our key to reading the geopolitics of energy and its corollary, that is energy policy.About the AuthorDoctor of applied sciences and engineer, Samuele Furfari has been teaching energy geopolitics at the Free University of Brussels since 2003.

They also take advantage of these events to involve the development of this pandemic with … global warming.It is to forget a little quickly that humanity has always been the victim of devastating epidemics, of which here is a very incomplete description, and limited to Europe.430 – 426 BC: Plague of Athens – around 70,000 dead.165 – 189: Antonine plague (smallpox?) – about 10 million dead541 – 747: Justinian plague – 25 to 50 million dead1348 – 1352: Black plague – around 25 million dead, or 50% of the European population.1629-1631: Italian plague – 1,100,000 dead (25% of the Italian population)1664: Great plague in London around 100,000 dead.1675 – 1676: Maltese plague epidemic1720: Plague of Marseille – around 100,000 dead in Provence.Apart from the great plague epidemics mentioned above, very numerous occasional resurgences have arisen in many places.1779 – epidemic of dysentery in France. About 175,000 dead. (Many other specific epidemics in history)1823: cholera epidemic1832 – 1833: Cholera – around 160,000 dead1840 – 1860: Cholera – 1 million dead in Russia.1863 – 1875: Cholera1899 – 1923: Cholera1918 – 1919: Spanish flu – 25 to 50 million dead.1957 – 1958: Asian flu H2N2 – around 2 million deaths worldwide.1968 – 1969: Hong Kong flu (or Asian flu) – one million deaths worldwidenineteen eighty one – ? : AIDS HIV – Approximately 36 million deaths worldwide to date.2003: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS.2009-2010: H1N1 flu –Measles: persistence since the 7 th century BC, – 200 million deaths to date.Smallpox: persistence since 10,000 BC – declared eradicated in 1977 – 300 million dead.Tuberculosis: persistence since the appearance of humanity.Poliomyelitis – declared eradicated in Europe since 2002.Seasonal flu – 250 to 500,000 annual deaths worldwide.Mother Nature, who is rather a stepmother, had already raged before even the appearance of man and until today, by multiple and devastating meteorological and geological disasters, by constant volcanic, oceanic, seismic phenomena etc …It would therefore be wiser to say that the human species must constantly protect itself from the deadly traps that Mother Nature strives to multiply around her!Jo Moreau.WELCOME ALSO ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE:https://www.facebook.com/BELGOTOPIA-82840099725/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'COVID19']",2020/04/22
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/04/14/mayday-the-aviation-industrys-climate-policy-ordeal/,,Mayday – The Aviation Industry’s Climate Policy Ordeal,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here. In December, 2019, I posted an article on the Friends of Science Society blog entitled The Global Assault on Aviation Emissions. In it, I described the efforts of the European Union and of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to establish a global regulatory regime that would sharply reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from aviation. The previous article can be read here:The Global Assault on Aviation EmissionsIn brief, the efforts to reduce aviation emissions include three broad approaches:• The public “shaming” and intimidation of individuals and companies that are deemed by climate activists to be unduly using aircraft to transport people and goods;• The imposition of regulatory requirements (now only in Europe) on airlines annually to report and verify their emissions and to purchase emissions “offsets”, or credits, for emissions above a certain level; and • The introduction in phases of similar regulatory requirements at the international level under the auspices of ICAO; this regime is called the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or CORSIA.CORSIACORSIA’s objectives are to “facilitate carbon neutral growth” for international aviation from 2020 on. The 192 country Parties to ICAO reached an agreement in 2016 that will eventually oblige all airlines to offset their increases in emissions after 2020. They must do this either by improving the emissions intensity of their operations or by purchasing “credits” from emissions mitigation projects outside of the aviation sector. Between 2020 and 2027, the system is voluntary, but after that it will become mandatory for all countries, with some important exemptions (i.e. for least developing countries, like Cuba); for landlocked developing countries, like Afghanistan; and for small-island developing states, like Mauritius). The European Commission estimates that 80% of the increase in aviation emissions projected by 2050 will be covered by CORSIA, which indicates that CORSIA alone will not achieve carbon-neutral growth in the aviation sector, even if it works perfectly. It will not even achieve emissions reductions from current levels.CORSIA is due to come into force in January 2021 but will be voluntary for the first six years. That means that only flights between countries that have volunteered to participate in the scheme will have to “compensate” for the growth in their emissions. From 2027 on, offsetting obligations will become mandatory for all international flights. “Offsetting” means either reducing emissions through technology change or changes in operations, or by purchasing “offsets” most of which will be subsidies to renewable energy projects. Bad TimingThe introduction of CORSIA internationally could not come at a worse time. In practice, meeting the CORSIA requirements will mean that airlines will incur increased costs, which they will either have to absorb as reduced profits or pass through to passengers and air freight customers in the form of higher fares. There are no credible estimates yet available as to how much fares will have to increase, only the virtual certainty that, as air traffic increases and the number of offsets to be purchased rises, the costs for airlines and/or their customers inevitably will rise as well. The Coronavirus pandemic is already placing unprecedented financial pressures on airlines. According to analysis released by IATA on April 2, 2020, airlines will burn through U.S. $61 billion of their cash reserves during the first quarter of 2020 ending June 30, while posting a quarterly net loss of U.S. $39 billion. Under a scenario in which severe travel restrictions last for three months, full-year 2020 demand for passenger aviation services will fall by 38%, and full-year passenger revenues will drop by U.S. $252 billion compared to 2019. Passenger revenues in North America alone are projected to fall by U.S. $50 billion in 2020. No one has yet dared to estimate what the losses will be if severe travel restrictions last longer than three months.While fixed and variable costs will also fall, the financial position of many firms in the industry will be so seriously affected that they are making urgent appeals to governments to provide bailout packages. In March, the United States Administration approved a U.S. $50 billion bailout package. Estimates of the amount of assistance needed by Canadian airlines ranges from CDN $5 billion to CDN $10 billion, but the Trudeau government has not yet indicated how much, if any, assistance will be provided. One might think that this is hardly the time to be adding the costs of emissions reductions to airlines’ bills. In fact, the airlines through IATA have sought some modest relief in the form of a change in the formula that determines their offset obligations, so that the base year would be 2019 or an average of 2019 and 2020, thus reducing the magnitude of the emissions offsets they would need to purchase in 2021. Within the European Union, these appeals are being resisted by Green Party members who argue that the price of emissions permits are also falling due to lower energy demand overall. Piling OnIn fact, environmentalists are using a recent study conducted by researchers from two Swedish Universities to make the case that additional measures beyond CORSIA will be required. The studypaper evaluated three additional national aviation climate policy options, as summarized in what follows:A Tax on Jet FuelMany countries, like Canada, already have taxes on carbon dioxide emissions which theoretically will impose a technology-neutral penalty on emissions regardless of source. Imposing an additional tax on jet fuel would be a way of targeting a specific sector (for punishment?). Today, only Norway and Japan have taxes on jet fuel.In fact, whatever its merits or demerits, a tax on jet fuel for international aviation is not permitted under current international agreements (ICAO, 1993). They are also prohibited by the European Union Energy Tax Directive. Despite this, it might be possible to introduce a tax on jet fuel for international flights between two or more countries. If governments in Canada, the United States and Mexico, for example, wanted to impose special taxes on jet fuel for flights within North America, they could do so. A tax on jet fuel could also be imposed on domestic aviation, although there could be problems administering it. According to the IPCC, domestic aviation accounts for about 40% of global aviation emissions. The tax on jet fuel would be intended to provide an incentive to airlines to reduce emissions or to raise the fares charged for passengers and freight. The Swedish study could find not clear evidence based on taxes in place today whether such taxes are effective.Distance-based Passenger TaxAn alternative is to tax tickets. The United Kingdom implemented an Air Passenger Duty in 1994, and similar taxes have since been implemented by Germany, Sweden, France, Norway, Austria and South Africa. It seems likely that the taxes were imposed more to increase government revenues than to discourage airline emissions. There are no current restrictions on introducing such a tax on international aviation.Distance-based passenger taxes, in fact, do not give airlines any incentive to reduce emissions. They operate by altering the price relationship between air travel and other transport modes, along with other categories of consumption. The UK passenger tax is the equivalent of 15 euros (CDN $23) for flights under 2,000 miles and 88 euros (CDN $134) for flights over 2,000 miles. While passengers would be irritated at the higher charge, these rates probably would have only a modest impact on the use of flights or the distance travelled. The conclusionmessage drawn by the proponents is that tax rates would have to be much higher than the UK ones. Quota Obligations for BiofuelsGovernments that now seek to increase the use of biofuels do so by placing restrictions not on buyers but on the companies selling fuels. In Norway, for example, from 2020 on, 0.5% of all liquid fuel sold must be advanced biofuels, with the aim of reaching 30% of the market in 2030. There are no legal restrictions on other countries imposing the same type of requirements.Many airlines have made occasional flights with biofuels. The aviation industry in Sweden, remarkably, has committed to achieving 100% biofuels for domestic aviation by 2030.Today, very small volumes of biofuels are produced and prices are high. The long-term future path of biofuel prices is difficult to foresee. More important, the emissions benefits of using biofuels are questionable. A recent study found that the climate impact was higher from biofuels produced from cane, maize, wheat, rapeseed, palm-oil and soybean than from regular motor gasoline and diesel fuel. Other options for reducing aircraft emissions, involving the use of different technologies, continue to be debated. Electric-powered aircraft are simply impractical (the weight of the batteries required to fuel an aircraft is roughly 30 times higher than the weight of the jet fuel). Hydrogen-fueled aircraft are similarly beyond the pale of possibility for cost and safety reasons. Nuclear-powered aircraft are a complete non-starter, for a long list of reasons, starting with problems of public acceptability.Consequently, the advocates of radical reductions in aviation emissions are constantly thrown back onto two options: using offset requirements or taxes to so raise the cost of flight that passengers and freight will be forced to seek alternatives, with the consequent effects in terms of delay, or imposing regulatory restrictions on the use of aircraft. The latter would seem to be a non-starter politically, but in a public environment immersed in the ideology of “climate emergency”, who can tell what will be politically acceptable or not in future?CommentCanadians remain largely unaware of the ongoing development within Canada and internationally of policies that, in the name of reducing GHG emissions, will severely raise people’s cost of energy services or reduce the availability and security of supply of those services. The principal adverse effects of those policies to date in Canada have fallen mainly on hydrocarbons producers in western Canada and electricity consumers in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia. However, as illustrated here for the aviation sector, policies are being developed that within the next seven to ten years will have major adverse effects on all sectors of the Canadian economy and all regions. It is remarkable that the broadcast and print media in Canada take so little notice of these developments in their news reporting.With respect to aviation, we today are witnessing an extraordinary conflict in how governments and international organizations define the public interest. On the one hand, the federal and provincial governments seem willing to spend hundreds of billions of borrowed dollars to partially reduce the cost to business and workers in most industries as a result of a health emergency. On the other, to address a potential climate problem seventy years hence, a major international organization supported by Canada, ICAO, is turning a blind eye to airlines’ requests for partial and urgently-needed financial relief. Indeed, environmentalists are seeking ways to increase airlines’ costs. As has often been commented, you can’t make this stuff up.Industry turbulence ahead for aviation.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['aviation', 'climate change']",2020/04/14
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/04/08/les-contradictions-dans-la-politique-climatique-du-quebec/,,Les Contradictions de la Politique Climatique du Québec," RésuméLes provinces canadiennes ont toutes adopté jusqu’à maintenant à peu près les mêmes approches dans leur politique climatique, mais aucune n’est aussi sévère que le Québec. Cette dernière présente cependant des incohérences flagrantes. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LES-CONTRADICTIONS-QUÉBEC-Final-May-19-2020-.pdfLES-CONTRADICTIONS-QUÉBEC-Final-May-19-2020-DownloadL’économie québécoise génère de très faibles émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES) comparées à celles de d’autres territoires. Le Québec a par contre adopté les mesures les plus contraignantes de toutes les provinces afin de réduire les émissions futures. Les Québécois et leur gouvernement ont exprimé beaucoup d’hostilité pour les carburants fossiles, et cela malgré que leur activité économique dépende largement du pétrole et du gaz naturel. Comme les émissions de GES québécoises sont relativement faibles, très peu d’options s’offrent aux Québécois afin de réduire leurs émissions futures. Les domaines où les coupures d’émissions devront être effectuées, sont cependant ceux où les réductions seront les plus difficiles et coûteuses. Le Québec a privilégié le système de plafonnement et d’échange (cap and trade) comme façon de négocier ses émissions de carbone. Mais ce faisant, il en a considérablement atténué l’efficacité en accordant des exemptions aux industries aux émissions les plus intenses. Le Québec a opté pour le plafonnement et l’échange en croyant choisir ainsi pour son industrie une option meilleur marché que le système fédéral de la taxe de carbone. Si cela a été parfois vrai depuis 2007, le Québec doit satisfaire maintenant à des exigences fédérales qui font que le plafonnement et l’échange pour lequel il a opté, donne le même résultat que les taxes de carbone fédérales. Le gouvernement québécois aime bien se présenter comme étant socialement « progressiste ». Par contre, de toutes les provinces, le Québec est certainement celle qui adopté l’attitude la plus régressive dans la redistribution des revenus du marché du carbone. La réduction des émissions dans le transport routier des passagers est devenue cruciale si le Québec veut atteindre ses cibles de réduction d’ici 2030. La meilleure combinaison de mesures provinciales et fédérales à date que l’on puisse mettre en œuvre, ne produira cependant qu’une réduction de 5 Mt, bien en dessous de celle nécessaire pour atteindre les cibles. Les prévisions gouvernementales fédérales d’émissions industrielles de GES montrent une augmentation et non une décroissance pour 2030. Bien qu’au Québec les mesures provinciales mènent à des réductions d’émissions grâce à une meilleure efficacité, elles ne seront pas suffisantes pour atteindre les cibles. Des réductions industrielles plus importantes nécessiteraient des choix politiques que le Québec s’est montré à date très réticent à faire. Si la tendance se maintient, il est très peu probable que le Québec réduise suffisamment ses émissions pour atteindre ses cibles de 2030. Malgré cela, ses cibles pour 2050 sont encore plus illusoires.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/04/04/biting-the-hand-that-feeds-you/,Al Leach ,Biting the Hand that Feeds You,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here. On March 25, 2020, a group of 265 academics from across Canada signed a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressing concern that, according to a Globe and Mail report, the federal government was considering a $15 billion “bailout package” for oil and gas companies. Please read the report [below], which includes additional graphs and information, as well as a full list of the relevant academics in Alberta and Saskatchewan. A full list is here.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BITING-THE-HAND-THAT-FEEDS-YOU-1.pdfBITING-THE-HAND-THAT-FEEDS-YOU-1DownloadThe group’s objections reveal, among other things, the usual biases held by those who believe the theses that human emissions are causing catastrophic global warming and that actions to harm the Canadian hydrocarbons industries will somehow stop this. To quote from the letter:“It is not acceptable to give privileged access to big business associations while excluding representatives from trade unions, universities, municipalities, Indigenous communities and non-profit organizations that work on behalf of the public interest. Public investment in oil and gas at this time is a highly speculative proposition, and particularly unwise given the urgent need for strategic investments in economic recovery. Premier Kenney argues that Canada ‘cannot afford to lose the single largest subsector of the Canadian economy’. We question whether Canada can afford to continue to support it. To presume that this industry can be protected with subsidies from the broader circumstances threatening the oil and gas sector globally is folly. As the current price war makes clear, Canada has no control over global oil prices, and growing demand for climate-friendly energy sources threatens the viability of high cost, carbon-intensive oilsands production. Let us consider some statistics concerning the financial contribution of the oil and gas industry:• According to the Canadian Energy Centre, an Alberta Crown Corporation, between 2000 and 2018, Canada’s oil and gas production industry paid almost $240 billion in direct provincial revenues and $66 billion in direct federal revenues. In addition, through the income taxes paid by industry employees, the industry indirectly paid nearly $54 billion in federal and provincial taxes.• Of these amounts, $36.7 billion were paid to provincial governments in corporate tax revenues.• From 2008 to 2018, $166 billion was paid in rents and royalties to provincial governments• Alberta accounts for about 82% and Saskatchewan for 12% of Canada’s oil and gas production, and the revenues to the provincial government roughly mirror that spilt.• Oil and gas industry revenues accounted for 11% of total Alberta government revenues in 2017-2018. • Individual oil companies have made major contributions to capital projects in Alberta and Saskatchewan universities.So, who are these university professors who think so little of the oil and gas industry? A list of their names and university affiliations is attached as Appendix A in case any of those who read this article and live in Alberta and Saskatchewan might want to contact the professors to express their appreciation and gratitude for the position they take.A Few FactsI do not know the status of the federal government’s consideration of assistance to the oil and gas industry or to any of the other Canadian industries affected by the Coronavirus and by the forced closing of workplaces, but I do know a few things about why the oil and gas industry faces such difficult financial circumstances. This goes well beyond the trends in international oil markets and prices.• Over the last three years, federal government decisions, influenced greatly by the organizations with which many of the letter signers are associated, were responsible for the loss of $32.5 billion of capital investment in oil pipelines that would have assured access to export markets, along with the loss of 3,500 long-term jobs.• Over that same period, $67 billion in capital investment in three liquified natural gas plants were foregone due to delays and opposition from the same groups.• This year, the Tech Frontier Oil Sands mine, a $20 billion investment that would have provided 2,500 long term jobs, was cancelled due to federal delays and barriers, again promoted by these same groups.• Over the 2014-2018 period, Canadian heavy crude producers lost $40 billion due to market discounts directly resulting from inadequate pipeline capacity.• Canadian oil producers now pay $30 per ton in carbon taxes that are not paid by competing energy producers in other countries, and that tax rate is scheduled to continue increasing.• According to the C.D. Howe Institute, Canada lost $100 billion in upstream oil and gas investment over two years, due almost entirely to government policies.• In 2012, Alberta’s employment rate was 70%, the highest of all provinces. The unemployment rate in Alberta was 7.2 % at the end of 2019, much above the national average of 5.9% at that time.• Despite the claims in the letter, the federal and provincial governments provide several subsidy programs to the renewable energy industry and none to the oil and gas industry. There is a difference between the two industries in this regard. The so-called “subsidies” paid to the oil and gas industry are investment incentives, payments that the industry converts into very large investments and billions of dollars in taxes and royalties to governments. These so-called ‘subsidies’ fall under categories common to virtually all businesses in Canada. By contrast, the subsidies to renewable energy industry run the gamut from research and development assistance to supply subsidies to favourable regulations to tax exemptions. Try to find out how much the renewables industry pays in taxes; you won’t because it doesn’t.• Global oil demand grew by over one million barrels per day per year from 2012 to 2019 and is at its highest level in history; almost every other major oil producer has been able to benefit from this growth through increased investment and production and will go on doing so after the coronavirus pandemic passes – investment in Canada’s industry has declined because of government climate policies. Canada is the only one of these top six competitor nations constrained by the International green trade war known as the #TarSandsCampaign and stringent, ever-changing, climate policies. To be sure, declining international crude prices have reduced the funds available to invest in the Canadian industry. However, investment has increased sharply elsewhere, like the United States, while declining in Canada. In other words, it is not only the market that has done harm to the oil and gas industry. It is Canada’s own citizens. People like those who signed the letter. I personally object on principle to the idea that governments should provide taxpayer subsidies to private industry, but with the current Coronavirus, we find ourselves in unique times. Having decided to shut down a substantial portion of the Canadian economy in the name of slowing the spread of the virus, governments are now morally obliged to attempt to offset the more adverse consequences for companies and their employees of the restrictions imposed. To suggest that the oil and gas industry should be deprived of assistance available broadly to other industries betrays an ideological bias. In the case of the oil and gas industry, the damage caused by government policies has far exceeded that imposed on any other sector of the economy, so the assistance provided, if any, should reflect that.Instead of purchasing equity in oil and gas, Canadian governments should pursue the retraining of fossil fuel workers, and public ownership of Canada’s renewable energy sector, where government coordination and large-scale investment are needed in the short term and where investments will be repaid.”Those few quotations demonstrate a variety of misconceptions, logical inconsistencies and special interest pleadings. I’ll come back to that later. The purpose of this article is to take note of the identities of many of the academics who signed the letter.  Thirty-eight of the signees are working at Alberta universities and eight are working at universities in Saskatchewan. They work in a broad range of disciplines, but only three in economics in Alberta and one in economics in Saskatchewan, a rather small cohort considering that the main thrust of their letter relates to a possible economic policy decision. Given the hundreds of professors working in universities in Alberta and Saskatchewan, we need not take this sampling to be particularly representative. Eighty of the signatories to the open letter are serial letter writers and signatories – that is individuals who have signed similar open letters in the last few years on a variety of issues such as the UNIST’OT’EN activist efforts to block the Coastal GasLink project, opposition to British Columbia’s Site-C hydroelectric dam, the TECK Resources Frontier oil sands mine, and the TransMountain Expansion oil pipeline project.We should, however, note the incongruence between the role that the oil and gas industry has in the economic fortunes of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the antipathy demonstrated by those who directly benefit from the revenues so provided to their employers. Provincial governments pay about 70% of the operating costs of the universities, including, of course, these professors’ salaries, so where universities get their funds matters. The universities that are the beneficiaries of oil industry taxpayer support are not responsible for the political activities of the professors they employ, but they might be expected to exercise a certain disdain when the professors include their university affiliations in a letter for which no such affiliations were required.Related:Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?When Climate Prophecy Failshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/When-Climate-Prophecy-Fails-FINAL.pdfFear and Loathing – The Alberta Oil Sands – From National Pride to International Pariah #TarSandsCampaignShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'climate change', 'oil and gas', 'oil sands', 'university professors']",2020/04/04

Canada’s provinces have taken broadly similar approaches to climate policy so far, but none so stringent as Quebec. If one examines Quebec’s policy, however, it reveals some striking inconsistencies.Quebec’s economy has extremely low GHG emissions intensity compared to other jurisdictions internationally. Yet, the province has embraced the most stringent approach to further emissions reduction of any Canadian province.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CONTRADICTIONS-IN-QUEBEC-CLIMATE-POLICY-Final-1.pdfCONTRADICTIONS-IN-QUEBEC-CLIMATE-POLICY-Final-1DownloadQuebecers and their provincial governments have demonstrated considerable hostility towards fossil fuels. Yet, the province remains heavily dependent on oil and natural gas for key economic activities.As Quebec’s GHG emissions are so low, it has fewer options available to achieve further emissions reductions. Yet, the sectors where emissions cuts must be made are those where reductions will be the most difficult and costly.Quebec chose emissions trading (i.e. “cap and trade”) as its preferred way of implementing carbon dioxide pricing. Yet, it then blunted the potential effectiveness of this approach by exempting many of the most emissions-intensive firms.Quebec chose emissions trading as a carbon dioxide pricing system in the belief that it offered a lower-cost option for its industry than the federally-applied carbon dioxide tax system. While this has been true sometimes since 2007, Quebec now faces a federal requirement that its trading system produce the same result as the carbon dioxide taxes.Quebec governments like to present themselves as socially “progressive”. Yet, of all the provinces, Quebec has adopted the most regressive approach to recycling of carbon dioxide pricing revenues.Emissions reduction in road passenger transportation is absolutely central to attaining Quebec’s emissions reduction target by 2030. Yet, the best that combined federal and Quebec measures taken to date are likely to achieve is a reduction of 5 Mt, far below the level needed to meet that target.The federal government’s projections of industrial GHG emissions show an increase, not a decrease, by 2030. While, within Quebec, provincial measures might produce some emission reductions through increased efficiency, these are unlikely to achieve the reductions large enough to meet Quebec’s target. Higher reductions in industrial emissions would require political choices that the Quebec government so far has shown itself unwilling to make.Note: Report reposted at 3:44 pm April 03, 2020 with correction to include the words ‘per capita’ emissions of Quebec on page 4.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['cap and trade', 'carbon tax', 'changement climatique', 'climate change', 'Quebec']",2020/04/03

Therefore, I am surprised to learn that your Poynter Institute is enacting a modern day form of the Spanish Inquisition, making biased pronouncements upon our international group of scientists, scholars and professionals at CLINTEL, just because our scientific view allegedly does not comply with climate dogmas.Since we question dubious ‘consensus’ claims, a handful of self-appointed Climate Feedback judges have decreed that we are ‘heretics’. I understand that your Poynter/International Fact Check Network/Climate Feedback group is deemed to be an expert body. Once your embarrassingly one-sided fact check has been issued, the press and social media consider it as an expert judgment and reject or disparage other studies like ours on climate science and energy policies as ‘fake news’. This is a condemnable censorship of Freedom of Scientific Inquiry and a breach of Freedom of the Press. The result also invokes the refusal of an open climate debate.When Climate Feedback originally published its critique of our position, I ignored it, believing that Freedom of Speech meant people could hold different views and debate them.Indeed, this is a fundamental principle we hold to: “audiatur et altera pars” – let both sides be heard. But your organization is letting only one side be heard. The media rely on you, as it turns out, and so does Facebook. This situation places additional moral responsibility on Poynter to encourage fair debate. We now get reports from our international ambassadors that news media will not carry our stories, or if they do, they make dismissive and denigrating remarks about our scholars, many of whom have achieved the highest honors in science in their fields. This is unacceptable, Mr. Brown. Bear in mind that your actions also seriously delay the progress in climate science. People should not discredit those who do not support the scientific consensus, but we should work together to discover the scientific truth.As many of our founding signatories are based in Europe, it is appalling that your Climate Feedback reviewers use the outrageous term ‘denier’, since that term is ascribed to Holocaust deniers. Many of us personally suffered in World War II, lost family, and many had family members swept away in the horrors of the Holocaust. It is an anathema that thinking scientists would use this term to describe other scientists who, after careful scientific review, hold dissenting views on climate and related energy policies. How could your organization sink that low to sanction such language?I could write you a detailed rebuttal of the biased Climate Feedback work, but instead, I recommend that you instruct Climate Feedback to post our climate science arguments with equal prominence, as is the norm for Freedom of the Press. I ask that you share this letter with your media network, so as to engage it in an open, civil, debate. If you are unwilling to do that, I ask that you retract the Climate Feedback critique and notify your international media network of the retraction.It is unacceptable that a handful of scientists, such as those making a one-sided pronouncement in the Climate Feedback commentary, pass denigrating judgment on a group of scientists, scholars and professionals like CLINTEL, where many of our people have made ground-breaking scientific discoveries, have won national and international awards for their scientific work, and who advocate for civil debate. Don’t attack the scientists, but rather argue the evidence; indeed, this should be the mandate of Poynter, to provide a platformfor scientific debate on this important topic.Bear in mind Mr. Brown, climate science is an extremely broad and complex knowledge field for which we have very little long-term precision data. The technical uncertainties are acknowledged on pages 114 and 115 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 WGI report. If that body can recognize these uncertainties, how can your tiny group of six Climate Feedback reviewers claim to have authoritative insight on this complex field of climate science?The CLINTEL members, who live in Europe, have seen the destructive outcomes of climate-related energy policies; widespread heat-or-eat poverty, systematic industrial ‘massacre’ as Antonio Tajani described it in 2013, unemployment and crippling ‘green’ subsidies. This is even truer today, due to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. What Green New Deal climate activists advocate for is economic suicide.In our latest open letter to world leaders, “Fight Virus Not Carbon”, we are warning you to avoid the false principles and skewed climate claims of the Green New Deal. Knowingly and willingly upsetting young minds with a constructed catastrophic climate future, based on dubious computer simulations/models, is that not a crime to the young generation? Many children now suffer from depression because of media fear mongering.I ask you, Mr. Brown, for your respectful attention to our arguments and I ask you to defend and promote Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Scientific Inquiry.I look forward to your response.Sincerely, Professor Guus Berkhout President of CLINTEL guus.berkhout (at) clintelgroup.orgClintel.org checks the Facts of the International Fact Checking Network of Poynter Institute and finds them wanting.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COVID19', 'Freedom of Speech', 'Freedom of the Press']",2020/04/02

Papineau, QuebecPrime Minister of CanadaLangevin BlockOttawa, OntarioK1A 0A2Prime Minister,RE: Letter from 265 Academics – COVID19 Recovery – Fight Virus Not CarbonOpen-Letter-to-Prime-Minister-Justin-Trudeau-Mar-30-2020DownloadOn Friday, March 27, 2020, the Dutch cabinet abandoned any further plans to pursue climate goals, despite the Urgenda court ruling, citing the overwhelming need to address the COVID19 crisis. Sir, it is time to focus on Canadians, not the planet; on the COVID19 crisis, not the climate.Some 265 academics demand that you abandon support for Canada’s oil and gas sector and not provide financial relief. We ask you, how is modern medicine possible without the energy and product stream, like sterile, single-use medical supplies, without petrochemicals?In 2018, Canadians were surveyed by Abacus Data for Ecofiscal Commission Canada. The number one priority of Canadians was improved health care. Instead, governments of the day chose to pursue climate change and carbon taxes. Climate change was the least priority of Canadians.Imagine, had we followed the advice of the 2006 pandemic report, which identified the historic recurrence of pandemics and the likely origin of the next one, had we invested in improved health care instead of climate change projects, we would not have been caught off guard by COVID19 and would have been much better prepared.In the intervening 2 years since the Abacus poll, some ~$100 billion in investment has been driven out of Canada, as explained by former public servant and diplomat, Robert Lyman, in “Prosperity Foregone”. These losses were driven by the foreign-funded and strategically managed, Tar Sands Campaign ideological supporters and poor government climate policy. Unrelenting ‘Blockadia’ of pipelines, along with foreign-funded agitation of indigenous people by climate activist groups, and international smear campaigns like “Rethink Alberta” have devastated the energy sector. Sir, this is a Green Trade War against Canada. We must fight back.Due to recent agitation by environmental law ‘charities’ (which are tax-subsidized by working Canadians) and with the help of foreign funding to them, federal approval processes that had worked well for Canada for 60 years were overturned. The uncertainty of new regulations like Bill C-69, Bill C-48, as well as the changes to the former National Energy Board process, which was once regarded as the most technically rigorous and fair process in the world have made investors lose confidence in Canada. As of 2018, Canada has been deemed by PPHB Energy Investment Bank to be a country ‘hostile’ to investment.The 265 academics claim to be climate researchers, but few hold credentials in the physical sciences and none appear to have credentials in engineering.In terms of climate change, they appear to be unaware that climate prophecies have failed; certainly wind and solar will not stop climate change. These are wasteful uses of precious fossil fuels for little energy return on energy invested. Rather like the popularized notion of the LEAP manifesto, that an east-west power grid in Canada could simplistically electrify and decarbonize the country, expert evaluation shows this is not technically feasible, would cost hundreds of billions of dollars (plus require vast quantities of fossil fuels for such construction), and would put Canada at risk of national black-outs. The “Shocking Reality” of NetZero2050 and decarbonization for Canada is that we do not have enough power generation, and to build it would require many decades and trillions of dollars. There appears to have been little due diligence done; we advise the government to “Look Before You Leap” any further into climate emergency claims. The academics claim that oil has been subsidized in Canada – in fact Chris Ragan of Ecofiscal Commission stated on TVO, in an interview with Steve Paikin, that he did not find evidence of such subsidies. January 15, 2019: “…in 2009 and 10, I somehow got assigned to be and labelled as Canada’s expert on the fossil fuel subsidy issue for the G20 discussions because the G20 countries had made a commitment to reduce fossil fuel subsidies. And one of the things that I learned at Finance Canada is that in fact we as a country do not have explicit fossil fuel subsidies.” (bold emphasis added)The 265 academics refer to Oil Change International as their source on information about alleged fossil fuel subsidies in Canada. Oil Change International is a group funded by foreign Tar Sands Campaign funders.According to the Oak Foundation grant database, in 2016, Oil Change International was granted $500,000 USD by the Swiss-based Oak Foundation:To enhance the ability of civil society to advocate for the reduction of public and private financial support for fossil fuel exploration. Oil Change International is a research, communications and advocacy organisation that investigates financial and power relationships among governments, markets and the fossil fuel industry to facilitate the transition to a clean energy economy.In 2016, Oil Change International was granted a further $1,000,000 USD by Oak:To advance international commitments for the phase-out of subsidies and public finance to fossil fuels. This will be done by focusing on the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other forums of public finance for fossil fuels. Together, the Global Subsidies Initiative, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Oil Change International and the Overseas Development Institute are coordinating an international campaign to bring global taxpayer-funded fossil fuel subsidies to an end.To “Keep Canada in the Black” we must abandon this foreign-funded, anti-oil, Tar Sands Campaign rhetoric and ideology and become “Grounded in Reality”.The 265 academics call for ‘investing in the future’ – but as Robert Lyman has pointed out in his report “Transition to Reality” – the world runs on fossil fuels; there is no simplistic overnight transition to a new energy system as proposed by these academics. This view is confirmed by numerous books and presentations by Canadian energy expert, Professor Emeritus, Vaclav Smil. Likewise, as pointed out by Robert Lyman, advocating for renewables jobs is really advocating for jobs in other countries, like China. The 265 academics claim that supporting Canada’s oil/gas/oil sands industry will not protect us from global oil price shifts is true – but not having our own energy independence and having all export routes blocked by foreign-funded protesters, will mean Canada will be at the mercy of supply and price of imported oil from despot nations. Though the cost of supporting the industry at this time appears to be large (said to be about $15 billion), Canadians should recognize that over the past 2 decades, taxpayers have subsidized foreign-funded and foreign-directed environmental federally registered ‘charities’ to the tune of $11 billion dollars, as outlined in “Money Matters”. These groups have drawn “Dark Green Money” from overseas. They have reveled in hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, in grants of “Big Green Money” from federal, provincial and municipal governments, mostly for make-work projects on ‘climate change’ for which there is no evidence of net public benefit, and much evidence of significant public and economic harm. Indeed, Canadian taxpayers now face a “Green Titanic” – our economic ship is sinking.Consequently, a $15 billion support package for the beleaguered oil/gas/oilsands industry can be seen as a fair and reasonable quid pro quo in response to two decades of unrelenting tax-subsidized Tar Sands Campaign. That campaign was also personal – an attack against the thousands of highly qualified Canadian scientists, Professional Geoscientists, Professional Engineers and skilled trades. Many of these Canadians have been driven out of the country to seek work or driven into despair as activists and social ‘scientists’ have drummed their careers out of existence and smeared their excellent academic qualifications.The Tar Sands Campaign must end now.For all the reasons above, we ask that you reject the letter from the 265 academics and support Canada’s energy sector for the good of our nation, for the benefit of our health care system and workers, and for the enrichment of our economy. In short, to save Canada, we must exit the Paris Agreement, build pipelines to Canadian ports, and return to our senses. We could not fight COVID19 and save lives without modern medicine, which would not exist without the power and products of oil, natural gas and coal.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/03/30/oil-price-war-revenge-of-technology-over-opec/,,Oil price war: revenge of technology over OPEC,"  Contributed by Samuele Furfari © Mar. 2020 Originally published as “Guerre du prix du pétrole : revanche de la technologie sur l’OPEP” Republished with permission of the author.I admit that I do not follow the price of oil every day. This is only important for traders and speculators who reap huge profits by playing on a few cents of gigantic volumes.If you want to understand the geopolitics of oil and therefore energy, you have to look at major trends, like that of last weekend. (This article was originally published in French on March 9, 2020).When I published in March 2014 a book entitled “Long live fossil fuels” which indicates that there is no objective or technological reason for the price of crude to exceed $ 100 per barrel, I was taken for a wacky one. Even though I was probably the only one who dared to say it openly in a French-speaking environment, many people in the world said it orally and in writing. The facts have proven us right.Oil demand in free fallFaced with the sudden drop in economic activity caused by the Coronavirus epidemic, demand for oil is in free fall. Chinese oil consumption has dropped by more than 3 million barrels a day.Obviously, this crisis will be much deeper for the world economy than that triggered by Subprimes in 2008. We expect a sharp decline in demand for primary energy and especially oil.It goes without saying: planes that do not fly, cars that stay in the garage, deserted restaurants, closed stadiums, canceled vacations cause the consumption of petroleum products to plummet, and therefore the entire economy. Something to cheer for deep environmentalists!As of Friday at the OPEC meeting in Vienna, as usual, Russia – a non-member – was invited to participate in the work. OPEC, which has been manipulating the price of crude since 1973, wanted to cut production to keep the price at the level before the devastating virus hit the scene. At the same time, Ryad is said to have put Iran even more on its knees for the little oil it manages to sell on the black market (Iran does not know where to store the pumped oil which it cannot sell).The origins of the fall in the price of crude oil It is true that for the past three years, OPEC and Russia have agreed to adjust their extractions to world demand. There has been an attempt to bring down the price so as to restrict the development of US shale oil/gas, but to no avail.This time Moscow did not want to follow OPEC leader Ryad and refused to join the production cut to support the price. Saudi Arabia, stung in the cold, reacted in the opposite way and declared its intention to increase its crude oil production to more than 10 million barrels per day in April, after the expiration of the current agreement between OPEC and Russia in late March – known as OPEC +.In addition, it reduced the price of all its crudes to all destinations from $ 6 to $ 8 a barrel. The consequence was immediate: the price of crude oil dropped to around $ 32 a barrel.Oil futures contracted their biggest daily loss since 1991 during the Gulf War. During the 1998 Asian crisis, the Financial Times of September 10, 1998 stated that the only thing that was lower than the price of oil was the morale of the economy. You could say the same thing today.The world is full of oil thanks to technology Some, still rejecting the evidence of the abundance of crude reserves, argue that the goal is to “kill US oil” shale “. No!, The oil from the shale will not be killed by this economic ups and downs. It is there in the basement of the country which masters production technology, it is cheap to produce and production can adapt instantly to demand. Some speculate on the “huge debts” of American companies in this sector.In a free and competitive market economy, bankruptcies are a part of life. If there are, the victims will be the small producers who have not yet been bought by the Majors. We will therefore witness a new wave of consolidation as it should be in a market economy.All of this shows, as I keep saying, that we have indeed turned the page on oil “quarantine”. OPEC held the OECD countries by the bridle between 1973 and 2014. It was our fault because, by blindly following the models of the Club of Rome, and by ignoring the crucial role of technology – source of progress – we had proclaimed on all rooftops that “there was no more oil”, thus giving ideas of domination to the OPEC countries.It is not wise to depend on policies as crucial as those of model-based energy. Many more in the EU deny the obvious: the world is full of oil – and even more natural gas – thanks to the development of technology. That is the driving force behind the energy world.It is neither OPEC, nor the models and even less the EU politicians who decree the complete abandonment of fossil fuels.What is happening on the oil price front will require even more subsidies to tax renewable energy. This reinforces my conviction that the energy transition will not take place.Note in passing that in a few years the politicians who promise to lower CO2 emissions thanks to their political determination will try to argue that it is their foresight that caused the fall in emissions in 2020, while it is the Coronavirus who is the main actor.I keep saying it: to reduce CO2 emissions you need either economic crises or the development of nuclear power.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/03/30/states-at-bay/,,States at Bay," Contributed by Drieu Godefridi © Mar 2020In Europe, the partial collapse of economic activity – of which the financial crisis is only a consequence, in a reverse sequence but clearly more devastating than the chronology of 2008 – will immediately lead to a collapse of tax revenues .We tend to forget it, but the tax, by which so many of our contemporaries live, supposes the creation of value. If no value is created, the tax is reduced to nothing.For example, VAT is a consumption tax; as consumption is reduced by 50%, VAT receipts will be reduced by the same amount.Another example, corporate tax, which is not a tax on the activity , but the earnings . In the foreseeable future, there will hardly be any profit to be taxed, only losses. Even when the profits are timidly low, the tax losses carried forward will erase them, probably for years.Our states will see their revenue collapse, while the structure of their spending has not changed an iota (when it has not worsened). Which solution ? in economic theory as in legal technique, there are only three: drastically reducing expenses, borrowing, launching programs of confiscation of private property. In reality, as we will see, the drastic reduction in spending will happen sooner or later.In fact, on the European continent, most of the states were already financially drained before the crisis, and their “credit” remaining on the international financial markets was weak.Consequently, the “external” headlong rush which would consist in contracting new loans to compensate for the collapse of tax revenue is, in Europe, a path not only dead end, but which does not exist.Indeed, States which, often for decades (Italy, Belgium, more recently France), have contracted loans to repay the only interest on their debt – never the capital – will struggle to convince the lenders in the while their tax revenues collapse.The alternative is the “internal” headlong rush, consisting in a State launching into massive confiscations on national territory, using different pretexts (necessity, crisis, solidarity) dressed in legal categories (nationalization, crisis tax) .Apart from the moral judgment that can be put on these processes, and the procession of arbitrary violence that their implementation involves everywhere and always, it must be emphasized that the path of confiscation – actively encouraged for years by neo-Marxist economists such that Thomas Piketty [1] – is not chimerical; examples taken from history (French Revolution [2] ) and current events (Venezuela) attest to this.The fact remains that this process is exhausted by its use: one confiscates only once. Behind, there is nothing more to confiscate.In the short or medium term, out of necessity and in the absence of a structural alternative, European states will drastically reduce their spending.Drieu Godefridi[1] Piketty, naive ideologue of egalitarianism – About “Capital and ideology”,https://www.levif.be/actualite/international/piketty-ideologue-naif-de-l-egalitarisme-a-propos -of-capital-and-ideology / article-opinion-1205601.html? cookie_check = 1584865738[2] F.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/03/30/shocking-school-bus-costs/,Andrew Roman ,Shocking School Bus Costs," Contributed by Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager, Friends of Science Society © Mar 2020In the March 19, 2020 CBC “What on Earth” newsletter [scroll down], it was breathlessly reported that: After a parents group called For Our Kids advocated for more environmentally responsible transit, British Columbia’s Education Ministry announced it is planning to spend $13 million to buy up to 15 electric school buses for 2020-2021. In a statement released March 9, Education Minister Rob Fleming said that “tackling climate change is critically important for all of us, and our school system can play a part in helping cut carbon pollution.”Matt Price, co-ordinator of For Our Kids, believes “during the climate crisis, no new diesel buses should be bought at all.” The article claimed that electric buses were much cheaper to maintain, did not need to buy gas, and thus would have lots of savings, despite being double or four times the cost and requiring a rather expensive charging installation.I ran the numbers by Robert Lyman to see what he had to say about the economics of the planet-saving plan.If you pay $13,000,000 for 15 buses, plus $100,000 for recharging stations, your total cost would be $13,100,000 or $873,333 per bus. If the diesel-powered buses can be purchased for $110,000 per bus, that means the additional cost of the electric bus would be $763,000. With a saving of $4,100 per year in fuel and maintenance costs, it would take 186 years to make payback, ignoring the interest costs.If you instead pay $400,000 per electric bus plus $100,000 for the recharging system, your cost will average to $466,000 per bus. The additional cost of an electric bus over a diesel one would be $366,000, and it would require 89 years to achieve payback, again ignoring interest charges.Finally, if you only had to pay $260,000 per electric bus plus the $100,000 for recharging systems, the average cost per bus would be $326,000. The difference between that and the cost of the diesel bus would be $216,000 and it would only take 52.6 years to achieve payback, ignoring interest costs.No investor or bus company manager in his right mind would ever pay so much.Image licensed from Shutterstock.No matter how well-intentioned, the real emissions reductions of the world are not found in school buses or in small individual acts, but must be addressed in the massive emissions of industry, primarily in the developing world.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/03/25/prosperity-foregone-what-are-the-benefits/,Russ Barss ,Prosperity Foregone – What Are the Benefits?,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here. In my recent commentary and PowerPoint presentation on the economic and financial costs that climate policy has imposed on Canadians, I showed that the tab already runs to hundreds of billions of dollars. See that report here:https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/03/20/prosperity-foregone-a-summary/The cost to date, of course, is just the beginning. The continuation of present policies and of others to reduce the production and consumption of fossil-fuel-based energy services may increase those costs into the trillions of dollars. The natural question to ask is what benefit Canadians can expect to derive from incurring the present and future costs of emissions reduction. There is no simple answer, but I will offer an abbreviated one, and encourage readers to find out more. Canada’s current climate policy target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030; in slightly more understandable terms, that means reducing emissions from 716 megatonnes (Mt) per year of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017 to 511 Mt in 2030. That is the voluntary target set by the federal government in 2015 and included in the plan that Canada submitted to the United Nations following the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Trudeau government, not waiting to see whether attaining the 2030 target is feasible, has already announced that it wishes to reduce emissions to “net zero” (largely unexplained) by 2050, thirty years from now.Let us examine what the benefits would be, in terms of global temperature reductions, if Canada were to achieve the 2030 target. Some Necessary ScienceAccording to generally accepted (but highly questioned) theory, the effect of carbon dioxide emissions on global climate is felt through the increases in global concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. To quote Professor Ross McKitrick:“The global carbon cycle is vast and slow, so a change in local emissions today will have only a small global effect, and only after a very long time lag. About 20 years after a pulse (release) of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, only about 40 per cent (plus or minus 15 per cent) of the emitted molecules will have been sequestered. After a thousand years about 75 per cent (plus or minus 10%) will have been sequestered, and the remainder will be removed over the ensuing tens of thousands of years. Likewise, emission reductions take decades or centuries to lead to a reduction in the global concentration.” McKitrick, Ross. A Practical Guide to the Economics of Carbon Pricing. University of Calgary School of Public Policy, September 2016 Economic ModelsTo measure the effect of emissions reductions on global temperatures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funded the development of the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) model. A key parameter of the model is the expected climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 concentrations, which ranges typically from 1.5 degrees Celsius to 4.5 degrees C. Using the MAGICC model, Bjorn Lomborg, Professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, estimated what the effect would be if all the countries party to the United Nations Paris Agreement honoured their commitments to emissions reduction in the period to 2030 and further continued those measures in place for an additional 70 years, to 2100. The result would be a temperature reduction from any of the IPCC’s scenarios of somewhere between 0.05 degrees C. and 0.17 degrees C. In other words, if all the countries complied, the resulting global temperature increase would be, at best, less than one fifth of a degree in the year 2100. Wait, there’s more. That does not mean temperatures would cease increasing. The temperature decline resulting from the measures taken would be made up in the following ten years, by 2110. So, the warming would be deferred, not avoided.According to estimates produced by the Stanford Energy Modelling Forum, the cost of the global measures would run to over one trillion U.S. dollars per year (i.e. at least $100 trillion by 2100). Almost all (98%) of the emissions reductions would come after 2030. The Benefits to CanadaThe Canadian government has not published estimates of the magnitude of emissions reductions it will achieve by 2100 or of the temperature-related effects. Ross McKitrick, however, estimated that a 30% reduction in base year emissions would, by 2100, eventually reduce the rate of increase in the global CO2 concentration by about 0.01 parts per million per year, orders of magnitude smaller than the monthly fluctuations in the global record.[ McKitrick, ibid, page 4 ] For all practical purposes, it would have no discernible global effect.Somewhat surprisingly, that is the best case. It assumes that all the other countries of the world will be “doing their part” to reduce emissions. In fact, as is well documented by the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy, global GHG emissions rose 12 per cent over the past decade, Further, only 17 of the 185 Parties to the Paris Agreement are on track even to meet their 2030 emission reduction commitments. Every few years, industrialized countries like those in western Europe and Canada announce ever-more-stringent political targets for emissions reduction. Just as regularly, they fail to meet them. Only a few countries have incurred the high economic costs that Canada has in its resource sector. There are many other complex factors to take into account if one wishes to understand the costs and benefits of emissions reductions in the period to 2100. Notably, recent empirical studies have indicated that the sensitivity of the global climate to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations may be far less than assumed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Also, the beneficial effects of increased carbon dioxide concentrations on the growth of global forests and crops may be far higher than the IPCC has recently estimated. However, we have a fairly clear estimate of the global emissions effects and temperature changes due to Canada’s environmental sacrifice – zero.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['NetZero2050'],2020/03/25

Today, the people of the world face a true emergency – a health crisis in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. People need an inspiring narrative that promises them a hopeful future. Today, for instance, it is totally inappropriate that the trillion-dollar Green New Deal focused on climate is still on the agenda of leaders such as Mr. Antonio Guterres of the UN and Mr. Frans Timmermans of the EU.Your Excellencies, compared to COVID-19 climate change is a non-problem! It is based on computer models and looks into the far future. In current health emergency, however, your attention to the peoples’ needs is today! Please, don’t continue pushing your zero carbon emission ambition in a time that the world is dealing with a deadly global crisis. Yes, there is an emergency, but it is NOT the climate.While courageous doctors and nurses are saving many lives, climate alarmists and climate critics should stop fighting, step over their own shadow and work together against this deadly virus. In this difficult time, humility suits us all. World leaders, please show us the way! As a very first step, designated Green New Deal money must be redirected and invested in a significantly better global health system. In such a renovation process, don’t exclude critical professionals. History tells us that a pandemic like COVID-19 will happen again. At least, we must be better prepared.ZERO CARBON EMISSION – IMPOSSIBLE AND UNDESIRABLEThe past 150 years show that affordable and reliable energy is key to public health, sanitation, education and prosperity. The past 150 years also show that more CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth and increasing the yields of crops. Why do world leaders ignore these hard facts? Why do world leaders do the opposite with their Green New Deal and lower the quality of life by forcing high-cost, dubious low-carbon energy technologies upon their citizens?COVID-19 COMBINED WITH ZERO CARBON – AN UNFORGIVABLE MISTAKEToday, billions of public monies need to be spent to avoid mass bankruptcies and to get the economy on its feet again after we have left the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. CLINTEL’s strong advice to the world leaders is: “To revive the global economy don’t further increase government debts. Instead, apply the money intended for your costly Green New Deal to the present needs of people and society. Call it the COVID-19 RECOVERY PLAN. Be aware that in today’s crisis the conjectural policy of CO2 reduction is highly counterproductive!”CLINTEL’S ADVICE FOR THE FUTURE – FIGHT VIRUS NOT CARBONThe world is moving to an open global economy of ten billion people. Top priority must be given to significant investments in a global health system that makes any pandemic less catastrophic. Considering COVID-19, climate alarmists and climate critics should admit that global warming is a non-problem. Therefore, stop fighting, step over your own shadow and work together against the deadly virus. In this tough battle we need each other!Your Excellencies, be responsible to the people and stop immediately with the Green New Deal plans. These plans would push the global economy into an even deeper recession. Please, don’t spend billions of dollars on subsidizing dubious low-carbon energy technologies and mass deforesting projects for biomass fuel while thousands are dying. Use these designated billions of dollars to improve the global health system on our planet. In CLINTEL’s COVID-19 RECOVERY PLAN we also suggest to issue bonds to invest in a top global monitoring system that informs experts about early changes in group-health all over the world.Yours sincerely, CLINTEL’s ambassadors,Nobel Laureate Professor Ivar Giaever, Norway/USAProfessor Guus Berkhout, The NetherlandsProfessor Reynald Du Berger, French speaking CanadaTerry Dunleavy, New ZealandViv Forbes, AustraliaProfessor Jeffrey Foss, English speaking CanadaJens Morton Hansen, DenmarkMorten Jødal, NorwayProfessor Demetris Koutsoyiannes, GreeceRob Lemeire, Dutch speaking BelgiumProfessor Richard Lindzen, USAProfessor Henri A.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/03/22/avi-lewis-in-the-dark-on-renewables/,Otto ,Avi Lewis – In the Dark on Renewables," Contributed by Michelle Stirling © March 2020Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society.An op-ed in the Globe and Mail written by Avi Lewis, spouse of Naomi Klein, caught my eye. Lewis, son of NDP scion Stephen Lewis and media maven, Michele Landsburg, makes the case that in light of the convergence of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis and the climate crisis, the answer is to implement the Green New Deal.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/In-the-Dark-on-Renewables-FINAL-Nov-18-2018.pdfFor climate activists the Green New Deal sounds fantastic. Basically, you stop using fossil fuels immediately and just use renewables, relying on massive government spending to ‘go green’ on every aspect of society, thus allegedly solving the climate crisis, economic needs of all people in a fair and equitable way, and presumably stopping COVID19 as you stop climate change.As you will see, this is magical thinking.Lewis has deep roots in the climate change story. In 1988, his father, Stephen Lewis, hosted Al Gore and James Hansen, June 27-30th, at the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere in Toronto. At the time, Hansen was fresh off his June 23, 1988, world-shaking appearance before the US Senate, wherein he claimed that he was 99% sure that man-made warming had begun. In the recent Globe and Mail op-ed, Lewis claims that since C.D. Howe created 28 crown corporations to manage every aspect of the World War II effort, then it should be easy-peasy to do the same today on climate. Lewis claims such moves would create a ‘climate-safe’world and more equal economy, going on to say that Canada could “borrow hundreds of billions of dollars…at the lowest interest rates in human history…which it can lock in [at low interest rates] for decades.”Basically, he is advocating for Canadians to become indentured servants in a socialist economy using other people’s money – for decades. Anyone who has ever run up a debt on a credit card can realize that this is a recipe for a disaster for a country. Even at the lowest interest rates, once you are talking hundreds of billions of dollars, you create the kind of challenges that Ontario and the near bankrupt/insolvent Newfoundland and Labrador are facing, where the interest rates on debts outstrip one’s ability to pay down the principal. Lewis envisions a solution to these converging crises – Coronavirus, climate, climate justice – simplistically as well. His idea is ‘painting Alberta in public-owned solar panels’ and he naively believes this would create thousands of jobs.Brooms for All!Image source unknown.Canada is a cold northern country, and while Alberta has some of the best locations for solar in the country, any solar installation north of the 35 latitude N is an ‘energy sink’ – meaning that the energy required to make the solar panel, will never be returned by the energy generated by the panel, because there is just not enough sunlight at the right solar insolation or azimuth, to pump out power. Solar panels can be a useful supplement for off-grid applications, but on-grid in Canada, they are more of an expensive nuisance than anything. Covered in snow half the winter when additional power would be welcome; over producing in summer. Green winter jobs in solar offer “brooms for all” to clear off the snow – no training required! I guess that’s a form of ‘climate justice’.Lewis is in the dark on renewables. Wind and solar cannot produce enough energy return on energy invested to support even basic society. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-energy-and-sustainability/article/lessons-from-technology-development-for-energy-and-sustainability/2D40F35844FEFEC37FDC62499DDBD4DC/core-readerThey cannot operate on the grid without 24/7 conventional back-up (typically natural gas, which has the ability to quickly ramp power generation up or down, as renewables fluctuate with natures whims of wind and cloud). Lewis apparently doesn’t know that solar panels are made from vast quantities of fossil fuels. Yes, to get wind and solar you need….OIL!  Lewis thinks solar panels are clean when they are toxic, almost impossible to recycle, and their lifespan is short, especially on the prairies where a good hailstorm or two could turn this effort of climate justice into a total waste of public cash. In fact, Alberta and Canada have been economically powered by the economic might of oil, gas and oil sands for decades – and disempowered by white elephant projects like the Medicine Hat solar farm, recently closed because it just didn’t perform; the $13 million solar farm unable to generate even one megawatt of power. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Ontario-Electricity-Legacy-FINAL.pdfCanada has been economically disemboweled by the Green Energy Act (GEA) of Ontario, detailed in Robert Lyman’s report “The Ontario Government’s Climate Legacy” of the McGuinty-Wynne years, that gutted the industrial heartland with high power prices. The GEA was avidly promoted by major foreign-funded environmental groups like David Suzuki Fund, WWF, Greenpeace and Pembina Institute. The GEA sees millions of tax dollars spilled south of the border when wind power over-produces. Under the GEA, either wind producers must be paid to curtail production, or the generated power is virtually given away to our neighbours in the US, but Ontarians pay for this power they don’t get to use. When the Ontario power system operator dumps the power to export markets south, it is at a cost to Ontario ratepayers that has averaged about $500 million per year. Green fat cat investors revel in the subsidies while taxpaying citizens struggle to make the rent, ever more of them facing heat-or-eat poverty. How is that climate justice?Like many climate activists, Lewis claims pipelines are ‘relics of the past’. I asked Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy analyst, about that. Lyman wrote me that, “According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019, global oil demand grew by 15% from 2008 to 2018, and global natural gas demand grew by 28%. As for the future, the US Energy Information Administration International Energy Outlook 2019 is probably the most authoritative and current source of data. The EIA projects global oil demand to grow from 2018 to 2050 by another 21%, and natural gas demand to grow over the same period by 28%. That looks more like a dawn than a sunset to me.”https://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Green-Jobs-Rhetoric_Lyman.pdfWhile Lewis claims the Green New Deal will create jobs, evidence shows that 2.2 jobs are lost for every ‘green’ job created. While Lewis claims this is ‘climate justice’ to impose sweeping measures on all citizens and destroy essential, affordable, reliable conventional energy provision, how is it ‘just’ to legislate massive tax subsidies to renewables. These are often the favored investment vehicles of tax-free union pension-funds and tax-free foreign sovereign wealth funds. So, you pay taxes and these financial behemoths don’t. Climate justice, eh?Ironically, Lewis invokes the name and legacy of C.D. Howe as the model for taking over the economy with sweeping changes, which Howe did, during the wartime effort. But post-war ‘the Minister of Everything’ devoted his efforts as “Minister of Reconstruction to oversee the transition to a peacetime free-enterprise economy, aiming to avoid widespread unemployment and inflation.” A free-enterprise economy. The very thing that has kept Canada strong and free for decades.Lewis takes a parting shot at Trans Mountain Pipeline, claiming it is a ‘white elephant’. Really? If the federal government’s purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, turns out to have been a white elephant, we will all know where to find the white paint – right in the hands of the British Columbia government and the foreign-funded environmental organizations that have used every tactic possible to block a legally-licensed piece of infrastructure and to hinder inter-provincial trade.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/07/environmental-charities-a-compilation-of-reports-on-their-finances-power-and-implications-for-canada/Perhaps no surprise that Lewis and his wife Naomi Klein are key parties in that “Regime of Obstruction” and planning a May conference at the University of Victoria. It’s too bad they are in the dark on renewables and misleading the public on the Green New Deal and energy. Too bad the media give the Klein-Lewis duo front and center stage while ignoring energy experts like Vaclav Smil, author of some 40 books on energy. He is Bill Gates’ go-to expert on energy. Or Robert Lyman, who cautions that “Energy Policy needs a Transition to Reality”. We’ve got a few plain language reports and videos on these topics.REPORT: Look Before You Leap into Climate Emergency and Green New Deal Video: Look Before You LeapREPORT: In the Dark on RenewablesVideo: In the Dark on RenewablesRobert Lyman assesses Canada’s “Prosperity Foregone” in this overview and power point:Prosperity Foregone – “Canada lost $100 billion of investment in energy projects in two years, according to the C.D.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/03/20/prosperity-foregone-a-summary/,Andrew Roman ,Prosperity Foregone – A Summary,"  Contributed by Robert Lyman 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here. In this PowerPoint presentation, I have tried to answer a question about climate policy that is too rarely asked in Canada. How much does it cost? Only those with a profound ignorance of economics, or a contempt for it, would say that the answer to this question is unimportant. The central economic fact of life is that there are always more things that we want and need than we can afford; when we fail to understand what our choices cost, we indirectly deprive ourselves of things that may be far more important to our overall wellbeing. The costs of current climate policy can be measured in many ways;• By the financial costs to the governments (i.e. taxpayers) of the programs, tax incentives and other measures that they implement;• By the financial costs imposed by these measures directly and indirectly on businesses and individuals;• By the direct economic costs of misallocated resources, foregone investment, losses in employment, losses in export earnings, or other measures; and• By the reduction in current and future income for the country as a whole or certain regions.We have limited information on most of this, so we have to proceed by citing anecdotes, or an examination of specific examples.In this presentation, I show that the effects of federal and provincial climate policies so far have fallen disproportionately in two areas – on the present income and future investment prospects for the Canadian hydrocarbons industries and the prices paid by electricity ratepayers due to above-market rates for wind and solar energy generation. In regional terms, the burden of increased costs has fallen disproportionately on Alberta and Saskatchewan. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Properity-Foregone-1-A.pdfProperity-Foregone-1-ADownloadThree major pipeline projects that had spent years undergoing regulatory review have been blocked or delayed by governmental decisions and inertia plus deliberate obstruction by well-funded environmental and indigenous groups and some provincial governments. The Northern Gateway Pipeline, the Energy East Pipeline and the Trans Mountain Expansion Project together would have offered $32.5 billion in capital investment, an additional $65.3 billion in national income and about 3,500 long-term jobs. Three major liquified natural gas projects in British Columbia have been so delayed that the sponsors gave up in frustration and decided to invest elsewhere – the Aurora LNG project, Prince Rupert LNG project and WCC LNG project. Together, these projects would have entailed $67 billion in investment. The Teck Resources Frontier oil sands mine was cancelled after eight years of regulatory review; it would have offered $20.6 billion in new investment, provided $70 billion in revenues to governments, and created 2,500 long-term jobs. Canada has the same pipeline capacity to deliver crude oil to export markets that it did in 2016. The absence of adequate “takeaway” capacity has depressed prices for Canadian heavy crude oil in US markets. Over the 2014 to 2018 period, Canadian producers’ revenues declined by $40.6 billion due to discounted heavy crude prices. During the same period, the United States has added thousands of miles of new oil pipeline capacity.Canada lost $100 billion of investment in energy projects in two years, according to the C.D. Howe Institute. New planned investments in the energy sector fell from $146 billion in 2015 to $35 billion in 2018; this represents 4.5% of Canada’s GDP.The federal and provincial governments, in the name of climate policy, have changed the regulatory systems to place climate considerations over economic considerations, as though what Canada does by itself can have any influence on global emissions trends. Global oil, gas and power demand grows every year, especially in Asia. Many countries compete to meet these demands. None of the major producers and exporters endures the burden of climate-inspired regulation, taxes and restrictions that Canadian companies do. In 2016 and 2018, the Trudeau government imposed and then expanded its moratoria on northern onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling, thus preventing the companies with 63 existing exploration and discovery licences from moving to develop the resource potential in the North. The Trudeau government also passed legislation to change Canada’s regulatory review systems governing environmental assessment and review and the licensing of new energy infrastructure. The changes worsened considerably the outlook for future approvals. Worse, they politicized a regulatory review process that was long respected for operating at arms’ length from partisan considerations. The former NDP government in Alberta imposed a statutory cap on GHG emissions from oil sands production that, if upheld, could result in cumulative production losses between 2027 and 2040 of over 2 billion barrels of oil, with a lost value of $153 billion.The imposition of carbon dioxide taxes has worsened the investment outlook, added an additional element of uncertainty (as companies do not know how high taxes will go after 2022), and signaled that the adverse effects now felt by the oil and gas industry will probably be extended to all the emissions-intensive industries across Canada – mining, petrochemicals, oil and metals refining, steel, cement, aluminum, pulp and paper, and others. The phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia and the efforts of provinces governments to force the use of wind and solar generation in their place is still proceeding. The cost so far in Ontario has been an 80% rise in electricity generation costs, an increase of consumers’ electricity bills over the life of the facilities totaling $9.2 billion and the loss of 75,000 industrial jobs. The estimated cost of new wind and solar projects in Alberta ranges from $4 billion to $8 billion, without taking into account the extra expenses that will be associated with integration of these sources and balancing the systems in future.Then there are the many, many unknown costs associated with the 237 existing federal, provincial and territorial emission reduction programs, the multiple subsidies to renewable energy projects and electric vehicles, and the measures that are yet to be added to meet the 2030 target. The cost in terms of national unity may be the worst of all, but who can put a price on it?Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change', 'energy', 'oil and gas', 'oil sands', 'renewables']",2020/03/20

Canada’s Energy and Emissions Outlook to 2030 About one month ago, to very little media notice, the Canadian government released its Eighth National Communication and Fourth Biennial Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is the most recent in a series of progress reports on how Canada is performing in terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The national policy framework for this is the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, agreed to by the federal, provincial and territorial governments in December 2016. The report can be seen here:https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/br4_final_en.pdfThe report describes both Canada’s progress in reducing GHG emissions in the past and the prospects for further reductions in the period to 2030. The present target is to reduce emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. As emissions were 730 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e, or MT for short) in 2005, the target for 2030 is now 511 MT. The following are points of interest in the report. In December, 2019, the Government of Canada announced that it will set a target to achieve “net-zero” emissions by 2050. No one has yet satisfactorily explained what “net-zero” means. However, “this will include legally-binding, five-year emission reduction milestones based on the advice of experts and consultations with Canadians.“ Although there have been no such consultations yet, the government has made a specific commitment to plant 2 billion trees “in the coming years”.Over the 2005 to 2017 period, annual emissions decreased by 15 MT, or 2%. So, emissions declined at the annual average rate of 1.25 MT per year. Emission decreases occurred in the electricity, heavy industry, and “waste and others” sectors, but increased in the oil and gas and transportation sectors. Projections of future emissions are done under two scenarios, “with measures” (WM) and “with additional measures” (WAM). The WM scenario includes actions taken by governments, consumers and businesses over the period up to September 2019, excluding those that are “still under development”. The WAM scenario accounts for the effects of the additional policies and measures that are under development but have not yet been fully implemented. The WAM scenario is the one in which the government intends to really, seriously, without question get tough on Canadians so we will reduce emissions. You won’t like getting WAMed.Note that despite over 600 different GHG emissions policies, regulations and reduction incentives, Canada’s emissions have remained almost stable for 30 years. https://www.thegwpf.org/canadas-carbon-taxation-its-worse-than-thought/ Imagine the cuts required to your daily life to meet the proposed targets.The WAM ScenarioUnder the WAM scenario, to my surprise ECCC foresees emissions in the oil and gas sector actually rising slightly, as do emissions in heavy industry and agriculture. Further, emissions in the “waste and others” sector stay the same. The hammer of forced emission reductions falls heaviest on electricity (where the government has decided to shut down every coal-fired power plant in the country), transportation and buildings. The scenario even takes into account the “credits” that Canada will receive when Quebec-based firms pay millions of dollars to firms in California to pay for emissions achieved there under the Quebec-California cap-and-trade system.After being WAMed, the oil and gas sector still will have higher emissions in 2030 than it does today? This is surprising, but it is not all good news for Canada’s petroleum industry. If one looks at the details as to how ECCC projects emissions to change, it becomes clear that emissions from conventional oil are projected to decline by 4 MT, with no new frontier oil emissions at all. One wonders whether Newfoundlanders, hopeful for the discovery and development of more offshore oilfields, will get the message. Oil sands-related emissions are actually projected to increase by 29 MT. The really bad news for the industry is that emissions from natural gas production are projected to decline by 24% from 50 MT to 38 MT. What should one read into that about the future for any new LNG projects?The projected emission declines in transportation (24 MT) would come almost entirely from cars, light trucks and motorcycles. There are several policies and programs that target this sector, notably the carbon dioxide tax, the much more stringent regulations governing light duty vehicle emissions, and the large subsidies being provided to electric vehicles and mass transit systems. The regulations will no doubt have an impact, but Canadians have to date shown a remarkable tendency to stick with their personal cars, SUVs and pickup trucks, so one should probably view such a projection with some skepticism.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/27/the-85-million-tonne-obsession/Emissions from buildings are projected to decline by 27% (from 85 MT to 62 MT) by 2030, even while the population continues to rise. It is possible that the cost of ever-rising carbon dioxide taxes may make home heating fuels far more expensive, but nothing in the WAM package of measures will make Canada’s weather change, so residences, industry and commercial buildings will still need to be heated and air-conditioned. The government plans to introduce new “net-zero” building codes that could increase the cost of a new house by $100,000 to $150,000 per unit, but that, if accepted by all the provinces, would not likely take place until 2030. So, one is left wondering how exactly homeowners and others will be WAMed into cutting energy use so much. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/08/forget-the-dream-house-how-net-zero-building-codes-may-place-house-ownership-beyond-reach/Under the WAM scenario, emissions in 2030 would decline to 588 Mt (including the “LULUCF”, or agriculture, forestry and land use, factor and the Western Climate Initiative allowances from California). This is 142 MT, or 19%, below 2005 levels. It also means that the annual average emissions reduction would be almost eight times higher than Canadians experienced from 2005 to 2017, during a period that included the worst recession since the Great Depression.This will leave only 77 MT in additional emissions to be attained by 2030 to meet the 511 MT target. The government has not yet stated which measures it will employ to close that “gap”.ProgramsPrevious reports to the U.N. have provided quite comprehensive lists of the many federal, provincial and territorial government regulations, subsidies, programs and tax measures that have been used to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation. The current report, in contrast, focuses only on the major regulations and program measures. Thus, it lists and gives brief descriptions of 66 federal government measures, 23 of which are cross-cutting in their impacts on sectors, and 43 of which are sector-specific. Similarly, the report lists and briefly describes 171 provincial and territorial government measures, most of which are sector-specific. It would be interesting to learn how many officials are employed and how many more will be needed to administer the future WAM programs.Payments to Developing CountriesThe report indicates that, over 2017 and 2018, Canada provided approximately $1.5 billion to developing countries for “climate action”. This support included: $704 million as part of Canada’s $2.65 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund; $246 million as part of its regular international financial assistance projects with a climate change component; $17 million from Canadian provincial and municipal support; $509 million from Export Development Canada (EDC) to “mobilize” private finance; and US $30 million by the newly established development finance institution, FinDev Canada, for climate-related investments.CommentaryThis report offers very useful insights into how the federal government, and especially ECCC, see its climate-related measures likely affecting emissions over the next decade. The reductions projected are quite uneven in their impacts both on sectors and on provinces. Certain provinces appear likely to be disproportionately affected, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec and Nova Scotia.The report does not address the question of costs. It is striking that so much time and effort has been spent seeking to assess the emissions reduction effects and so little to what achieving such effects will cost Canadians directly and indirectly. The cost issue has many dimensions. There is the financial cost to governments (i.e. taxpayers) of the 237 measures already in place plus those that will be added by 2030. There is the financial cost that must be borne by energy consumers and businesses to pay the energy taxes and the higher cost of new energy sources. There is the large economic cost of displaced industry previously reliant on Canada’s low cost energy supplies and the immense losses in investment, income and employment because of policies that directly and indirectly hinder energy industry expansion. There is the loss in export earnings because of denied access to foreign markets for Canadian hydrocarbons. Finally, there is the loss in revenues to the federal and provincial governments that would otherwise have come from hydrocarbon production and sale. These costs, one supposes, are of no interest to the United Nations, but they should be of great concern to Canadians. In fact, the really important questions for Canadians do not concern incomprehensible things called tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. These are just terms used to obscure the reality that Canadians are being told they must do without many things that have long underpinned their quality of life and standard of living – the high availability and security of supply of energy services; competitively-priced sources of energy for our businesses, homes and vehicles; and the investment, income and employment that resource development has provided. Wherever one reads about reduction of GHGs, one should also see the withdrawal of these services and the undermining of these values.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'GHG reduction targets']",2020/03/08
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/02/23/climatic-impacts-of-the-sw-indian-ocean-blob/,,Climatic impacts of the SW Indian Ocean Blob,"  Contributed by Prof. Wyss Yim. Patches of abnormally hot seawater beneath the ocean surface, referred to as Blobs, are naturally generated by submarine volcanic eruptions. A recent example is the North Pacific Blob which caused weird weather conditions accompanied by major ecological changes in the Pacific northeast including two years without winters in 2013 and 2014. This was featured as a ‘heat wave’ in the September 2016 issue of National Geographic and was used to support the anthropogenic global warming alarm. However, based on the study of available information including satellite and ARGO data buoy records, the release of geothermal heat from the Nishinoshima volcanic eruption 940 km south of Tokyo from March 2013 to August 2015 was identified by the present author instead to be the likely culprit.This study examines the climatic impacts of another Blob, created by a new submarine volcanic eruption on the floor of southwestIndian Ocean, off Mayotte in the Comoros.Download complete paper:ImpEng2019ADownloadIn conclusion, severe weather events including tropical cyclones, droughts and floods may be caused by blobs formed by the natural release of geothermal heat through submarine volcanic eruptions acting, in combination with the sun, to warm the surface waters of regional oceans. The warming in the west Indian Ocean was responsible for the development of an exceptionally strong positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. The warm sea-surface water was responsible for oceanic and atmospheric circulation changes regionally which cannot be accounted for by carbon dioxide variations.The release of geothermal heat into oceans is currently underestimated by the scientific community…Contributed by Prof. Wyss Yim.Professor Wyss Yim DSc PhD DIC FGS was at Imperial College, in the Department of Geology, from 1971-1974.

There are four ways in which actual global trends are diverging more and more from the predictions upon which climate activists base their claims of impending catastrophe and allegedly “inevitable decarbonization” of the world economy.After almost thirty years of measurement, the gentle rise in average global temperatures is near the bottom of the range projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If, as many now expect, the world enters a cooling trend over the next few decades, average temperatures will fall entirely outside that range, and demonstrate conclusively that the IPCC models do not provide a reliable foundation for climate policy.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/When-Climate-Prophecy-Fails-FINAL.pdfWhen-Climate-Prophecy-Fails-FINALDownloadFossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) now supply 84% of global energy needs, and consumption of oil and natural gas is rising at its fastest rate in history, with no current prospect of subsiding. If, as projected by all major authorities on global energy supply and demand, these trends continue through to 2030 and beyond, driven by economic growth in Asia, why would people in the OECD countries accept the claims of climate activists that they must reduce their use of fossil fuels?Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased, not decreased, by 12 per cent over the past decade, despite claims that the world must sharply reduce emissions. Even if global emissions were to stabilize, as some forecasters suggest, that will represent a major departure from the “pathways” to reduced emissions that climate alarmists say is essential. At which point will the claims of rapid decarbonization become untenable?Following the COP21 conference in Paris in 2015, many OECD countries submitted plans about how they would reduce GHG emissions by 2030. Many developing countries submitted similar plans conditional upon receiving financial assistance in the form of the Green Climate Fund (i.e. U.S. $100 billion per year). When countries report on their progress before the November 2020 COP, it will become clear that nine out the ten largest GHG emitters are not on track to meet the 2030 targets. The total contributions to the Green Climate Fund, as of mid-2018, were $10.2 billion. Despite the certain calls for more aggressive emission reductions, it will be clear by the end of this year that the entire U.N. artifice of supposed commitments to decarbonization is flawed.When reality fails to match prophesy, those who follow climate and energy policy developments closely will see the rationale for drastic transition crumble. The Canadian public, unfortunately, may not react until climate taxes and other measures impose intolerable costs on the average person. We do not have a crystal ball for that.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'climate models', 'economy']",2020/02/23

The federal government is considering the report of a joint Canada-Alberta environmental review panel that assessed the proposed Teck Resources Frontier Oil Sands project. The government will soon announce whether it will approve the project. According to press reports, the government is likely to reject it, although it may instead demand a “quid pro quo” from Alberta requiring Alberta to change its current climate policies to more closely align with federal policies.Teck-Project-FINALDownloadAccording to evidence gathered by the panel, the project will produce about 260,000 barrels per day of bitumen and operate for 41 years. Over that time, it will provide 278,000 person-years of employment across Canada and yield $70 billion in tax and royalty revenue to governments. It will also emit 4.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, which represents 5.4% of oil sands emissions based on 2016 data, or 0.5% 0f total Canadian emissions. Teck has committed to make all of its operations “carbon-neutral” by 2050.The Panel recommended approval of the project, subject to over 200 conditions. The Hon. Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, implied in his recent public statements that federal approval might depend on whether the Province of Alberta committed to more aggressive emissions mitigation policies, including tougher targets and dropping the legal opposition to federal carbon dioxide taxes. There have been press leaks suggesting that the federal Cabinet is preparing to deny the Frontier project but “compensate” Alberta in some way.The way the federal government has handled this case contravenes several principles of good public policy. It is single-mindedly adhering to a fundamentally flawed climate policy based on questionable science and ignoring the reality that Canada produces only 1.6% of greenhouse gas emissions in a world where emissions are growing steadily due to economic developments in Asia. It has made GHG mitigation the overriding goal of public policy, downplaying the many other economic, social, security and unity goals that we share as a country. It has adopted policies that place an inordinately adverse impact on one region, Alberta and Saskatchewan, penalizing them for taking advantage of their natural resource endowment. By apparently holding the Frontier project hostage to Alberta’s acceptance of changes in other policies, it has engaged in the long discredited practice of “policy linkage”. Good public policy is far more likely to result from objective analysis of the public interest in each issue, not a highly-politicized bargaining process involving unrelated issues.Turning down the Teck project would have absolutely zero impact on the trends in global GHG emissions. It would serve only as a symbolic, extremely costly, gesture of commitment to Green ideology.Excerpt of Futile Folly https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Futile-Folly-FINAL.pdf Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'climate change', 'oil sands']",2020/02/07

Federal, provincial and municipal governments in Canada are spending several billion dollars a year to expand public transit, increasingly focused on light rail systems. The public rationale for this frequently cites the need to promote modal shift from cars to transit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ‘save the planet’. In fact, while transit use is rising modestly and mainly in very large cities, almost four out of five Canadians continue to commute by personal vehicle. Squandered-Money-Transit-FINAL-RevADownloadThe costs of light rail transit systems are rising considerably. An increasing number cost over $200 million per kilometre to build, and operating subsidies for all transit systems are rising.The Canadian Urban Transit Association Vision 2040 calls for transit ridership to increase by 86% from 2012 to 2040. Yet, even doubling transit ridership would only reduce GHG emissions by 2.5 megatonnes per year, reducing transportation-related emissions by 1.5% and total emissions by 0.4%. Transit subsidies are the most expensive possible way to reduce emissions; the cost likely to exceed several hundred dollars per tonne, much higher than all other options available. Spending on transit as a climate policy will not “save the planet”. Instead, it is a sad case of squandered money.Squandered MoneyShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['cities', 'climate change', 'Light Rail Transit', 'municipalities', 'urban transit']",2020/02/03
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/02/03/u-s-government-continues-to-dump-funds-into-an-electrical-sinkhole/,,U.S. Government continues to dump funds into an electrical sinkhole," By Ronald Stein Founder and Ambassador for Energy & Infrastructure of PTS Advance, headquartered in Irvine, CaliforniaWhen I read the WSJ article “The Best-Laid Energy Plans” about the Government planning and subsidies that were supposedly intended to make America the world’s green-electricity superpower, create millions of jobs, and supercharge the economy, it brings to mind the most terrifying nine words in the English language: ” I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.”In pursuit of a way to store the daytime intermittent electricity from solar panels, for use when the sun is not shining, the reality is closer to the financial failure at Crescent Dunes, a Nevada solar-energy plant that went gone bust after receiving a $737 million federal loan guarantee. No worries. It’s only taxpayer money,Crescent Dunes was the first concentrated solar power system that generated solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a receiver plant with a central receiver tower and advanced molten salt energy storage technology.An inconvenient truth is that the sun sets each day, but the Obama Administration’s green planners had an app for that. They decided to invest in the Crescent Dunes facility that would use molten salt to store heat from the sun, produce steam, and generate electricity even at night. Government support would carry the project to sunny success.Here are all the things that electricity can do for civilization:• Provide electricity to run the motors of vehicles, heating, air conditioners.• Provide electricity for lighting• Provide electricity for electronics• Provide electricity for the medical infrastructureEnergy storage could revolutionize industries in the next 10 years, but despite the preaching’s about these renewable saviors, it’s becoming obvious that due to their intermittency and unreliability, and their inability to replace any of the chemicals from crude oil that account for the all the products in our daily lives, societies around the world may not be too thrilled about the needed social changes to live on just electricity. Basically, electricity can power the motors, lights and electronics, but it can’t make the motors, lights and electronics! Even electricity could not exist without fossil fuels as all the parts for wind and solar renewables are made with fossil fuels.We can be preached to forever about “clean electricity” messages, and bedazzle farmers with the prospects of on-going revenue from renewables, but the extensive mining worldwide for turbine and solar materials, and the decommissioning details, and the social changes that would be necessitated without the thousands of products from those deep earth minerals and fuels, remain the dark side of the unspoken realities of renewables. Lets’ be clear about what that means. First, it’s not renewable energy, it’s only renewable electricity, and more accurately its only intermittent electricity. Renewables have been the primary driver for residents of Germany, Australia, and California behind the high costs of electricity. Second and most important is, electricity alone is unable to support military work, aviation, and merchant ships, and all the transportation infrastructure that support commerce around the world.  Everyone knows that electricity is used extensively in residential, commercial, transportation, and the military, to power motors and lite the lights; but it’s the 6,000 products that get manufactured from crude oil that are used to make those motors, lights, and electronics. Noticeable by their absence, from turbines and solar panels, are those crude oil chemicals that renewables are currently incapable of providing.We’ve had almost 200 years to develop clones or generics to replace the products we get from crude oil such as: medications, electronics, communications, tires, asphalt, fertilizers, military and transportation equipment. The social needs of our materialistic societies are most likely going to remain for all those chemicals that get manufactured out of crude oil, that makes everything that’s part of our daily lifestyles, and for continuous, uninterruptible, and reliable electricity from coal or natural gas generation backup. Germany tried to step up as a leader on climate change, by phasing out nuclear and fossil fuels, and pioneered a system of subsidies for wind and solar that sparked a global boom in manufacturing those technologies. Today, Germany is failing to meet its climate goals of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions even after spending over $580 billion by 2025 to overhaul its energy systems. Germany’s emissions miss should be a “wake-up call” for governments everywhere. Power prices in Germany are among the highest in Europe. Today, German households pay almost 50% more for electricity than they did in 2006. Much of that increase in electricity cost is the Renewable Surcharge that has increased over the same period by 770%.America is taking giant steps toward following Germany’s failed climate goals which should be a wake-up all for governments everywhere, but it appears that America, from California to New York, wants to follow the German failure. Like Germany, America’s renewables are becoming an increasing share in electricity generation, but at a HIGH COST. The emission reduction goals have increased the costs of electricity and transportation fuels and may be very contributory to America’s growing homelessness and poverty populations.Hopefully, before committing to an all-electric world, we can achieve the technical challenges of discovering a green replacement for the thousands of products based on fossil fuels being provided to every known earth based infrastructure, and society will accept the consequences of altering their lifestyles that will result from less services and more personal input to accommodate losing the advances fossil fuels have afforded them. Hand the energy economy over to the government in the name of climate change, and there will be countless more Crescent Dunes fiascoes. Alas, brings back again those most terrifying nine words in the English language:” I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.”Ronald Stein, P.E.Founder and Ambassador for Energy & Infrastructure949-268-4023Ronald.Stein@PTSadvance.comPTSadvance.comShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2020/02/03

For example, poverty was never as low as today. And statistics tell us that – thanks to intelligent adaptation policies – the number of deaths from natural disasters has sharply decreased.There is no planetary emergency, climate or otherwise. The climate crisis only exists in computer models. Yes we can, and will, continue to strive to do better for all people, on multiple fronts — including understanding climate and knowing how to adapt to changes.One dire consequence of current model-induced panic is that we are abandoning key elements of our successful, low-cost and reliable energy systems. These are the basis for the quality and duration of human lives! The energy erosion will inevitably result in economic decline and increased poverty, particularly in non-OECD countries.Therefore, the so-called ‘climate mitigation’ is an irresponsible policy. The fundament of social and economic development is adaptation to the climate evolution.Despite heated political rhetoric, we urge all world leaders to accept the reality that there is no climate emergency. There is ample time to use scientific advances to continue improving our society. Meanwhile, we should go for adaptation; it works whatever the causes are.We also invite you to organize with us a constructive, open meeting between world-class scientists on both sides of the climate debate.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/01/25/the-canadian-climate-policy-numbers-game/,karabar ,The Canadian Climate Policy Numbers Game,"  New report contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here. Robert LymanThe “numbers game” is a form of illegal gambling played mostly in poor neighbourhoods in the United States, wherein a bettor tries to pick three digits to match those that will be drawn by lottery the next day. Millions of dollars are won and lost, and like most lotteries it is a game chosen by those who simply do not understand statistical probability.The Canadian government has, since 1990, played its own version of a numbers game as an integral part of its public communications about what it doing to respond to the alleged threat of catastrophic global warming. The government’s game involves setting a series of arbitrary targets for percentage reductions in Canadians’ use of the energy services upon which all citizens depend, casting these targets as solemn obligations, missing them consistently, and then reframing the targets so that the public and the media do not notice. It did this in 1990 when it set the target of a zero increase in emissions from energy use from 1990 levels in 2000, a target it missed by a country mile. It played the game again in 1998 (the Kyoto Accord) when it lowered the previous target by 6%, to be reached by 2010, with exactly the same result. Having failed with two relatively modest targets (at least in numerical terms), it boldly set a more stringent target of reducing emissions from energy use by 17% from 2005 levels (notice the change in baseline to confuse people) by 2020. Not waiting to find out by how far it had already exaggerated the effects of its measures, in 2015 the government launched a far more vigorous attack on Canadians’ energy use by declaring that emissions must reach 30 % below 2005 levels by 2030. Casting the targets in terms of percentage reductions in “greenhouse gases” by arbitrary amounts by arbitrary dates had the advantages of ensuring that the average person did not have a clue what these commitments meant in terms of their costs or standards of living. What it was really all about was setting goals for reducing the use of oil, natural gas, and coal to be used for heating, air conditioning, mobility and the thousand uses of electricity in one of the largest, coldest, most economically-advanced countries in the world, and one whose population growth the government was priming through unprecedented levels of immigration. No one said, “You will have to go colder” or “You will have your electricity bills doubled”, because that would have been too explicit. “These actions will have no effect whatsoever on global emissions trends”, would have been far too honest.In a new variation on the numbers game, the government has taken to publishing annual reports on its “progress” in depriving Canadians of their heritage of cheap, plentiful and secure energy supplies. In the reports, the government forecasts all the wonderful effects that its taxes, regulations and subsidies will have in reducing Canadians’ energy use by 2030, and compares this year’s forecast with last year’s forecast. As both are forecasts, there is no way for people to know for certain just how far wrong they are. In the most recent report, published just before Christmas, 2019, the government acknowledged that (surprise!), it will far miss the 2020 target. It also noted that, based on present policies, it will miss the 2030 target (We are shocked, absolutely shocked!), but not by as much as last year’s forecast said we would miss it. It is well past time that the government stopped the numbers game and told the truth. The targets are not made to serve as desirable or achievable changes in the Canadian economy or in Canadians’ lifestyles. They are unachievable political standards whose only function is to grant to the advocates of climate alarm the moral high ground. They help in responding to the critics of policies that harm Canadians for negligible environmental benefit. The ground, however, is shifting, and the days when the numbers game can be used to fool the public may be nearing an end.The Fight for Climate Realism Opens a New Front in Central CanadaShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'GHG reduction targets']",2020/01/25

As authors of this text, we do not necessarily agree on all issues surrounding these debates. We sometimes agree on two sad facts: on the one hand, the current hysteria is not appropriate and also not constructive. On the other hand, the proposed solutions to combat climate change are not suitable.Young scienceThe climate is changing, has always changed and will always change. It is a natural phenomenon, connected to the interaction between sun and earth. Human activities – mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) – also contribute to this change, according to greenhouse theory.Since the industrial revolution, made possible by the use of fossil fuels, the global temperature has increased by 1.24 ° C, of which almost one degree up to 2000. The IPCC has established a cause-effect relationship between this increase and the growth of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the extent and regional impact of global warming remains complex to determine.Panic seeding is out of placeClimate science, which incidentally brought one of us (André Berger) to Belgium, is a young science, and therefore it cannot be said that we know everything about this phenomenon and that we just have to intervene. That is why the reports of the IPCC are extremely careful and often – as is customary in science – they are based on a number of assumptions. The uncertainty margin is particularly large when estimating the effects of human activities on the climate, so one thing is certain: panic seeding is out of place.StupidityThis year, however, we have witnessed that all common sense boundaries have been broken. The most unlikely communications are promoted by the media and social networks. This has prompted European politicians to follow this trend.To prove that there is an exaggeration today, let us say that the regular phenomenon of the ‘acqua alta’ in Venice and the floods in flood areas would be solely due to our CO2 emissions and therefore to our aircraft flights or our consumption of red meat.This madness, which is at odds with science, drives the political world to make energy policy decisions that are just as brash as the prevailing alarmism.Economic absurditySince 2000, the EU and its Member States have spent an estimated one billion euros (one million times million!) To achieve a share of 1.9% wind energy and 0.5% photovoltaic energy in the EU’s primary energy balance. This is economically absurd. Why do we continue to spend government money with such disappointing results in the hope of doing better? It is high time that we acknowledged the failure of renewable energy policy.Isn’t it time to do what the EU has already done with biofuels? While the 2009 directive provided for a minimum of 10% biofuels for the transport sector, the EU was forced by the economic and environmental failure to impose in the 2018 directive no longer a minimum but a maximum of 1% above what that was achieved on the basis of the obligation from the original directive.China continues to invest massively in nuclear power stations and in ultramodern, clean coal-fired power stations This must be balanced against the spectacular increase in global CO2 emissions since COP-1: + 58%! We penalize our economy with new CO2 taxes in the pipeline, while the rest of the world continues to use fossil fuels more and more competitively. China continues to invest massively in nuclear power stations and in ultramodern, clean coal-fired power stations that will run for another 40 years. The flagrant failure of COP-22 up to and including the recent COP-25 is an unmistakable symptom of this. No, CO2 emissions will not decrease and Belgium – with its 0.4% of global emissions – is not setting the example for the world.Two solutionsGentlemen informers, there are only two solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. First, economic recession. But that must be fought, as you also want to do, to safeguard the prosperity of the Belgian population.The second solution is the use of nuclear energy. The correlation between the development of nuclear energy and the historical reduction of CO2 emissions has been amply demonstrated.It is undeniable that the irregular energy sources that are wind and photovoltaic must simultaneously use equivalent capacity to ensure supply and to meet demand (this is the subject of the capacity compensation mechanism law – CRM). Renewable energy sources are therefore automatically associated with non-renewable and CO2-emitting sources, while nuclear energy hardly emits.Sovereign, renewable form of energy productionPresident Macron also stated this at the recent European summit. The Council of 13 December acknowledges in its conclusion – finally! – the right of States to use nuclear energy. Yes, nuclear energy is still the most low-carbon and sovereign renewable form of energy production. Other world leaders have already announced this loud and clear.In your report to the King, we hope that you choose to use the language of truth. Don’t be politically correct, the future of the country is at stake!Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'energy']",2020/01/25
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/01/17/domestic-livestock-and-climate/,Duane Pendergast ,Domestic Livestock and Climate," New report contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYReports from international organizations have focused media attention on the role potentially played by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production and consumption of livestock. Anti-animal agriculture advocates have used this to argue that livestock production should be severely regulated and taxed and that humans should sharply reduce or eliminate meat from their diets. DOMESTIC-LIFESTOCK-AND-CLIMATE-FinalDownloadMuch of the confusion about the role of livestock-related emissions is the result of attributing to livestock the deforestation to create pastures. However, deforestation causes a unique one-time carbon dioxide release from the burning and decomposition of woody vegetation. When calculating emissions intensity, one should apportion the emissions out over the accumulated animal products during the entire period of pasture use. In the case of many countries, this may be hundreds or thousands of years, so the emissions per kilogram of carcass weight approach zero. Using a different methodology (i.e. one based on life cycle analysis) than the international organizations, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency quantified the impacts of livestock production in the U.S. as accounting for 4.2% of all GHG emissions, far below the 18% and up range often cited. In fact, in countries like the U.S. and Canada, the emissions properly attributable to beef cattle are only 2.2 % of the total, with another 1.4% to dairy cattle.The attack on livestock production and use has sometimes focused on the alleged adverse effects of methane emissions from ruminant animals (i.e. burping and flatulence) on the climate. However, high methane content in the atmosphere does not correlate with high livestock concentrations. Strong emitters seem to be wetlands in Siberia, humid tropical forests, and rice paddy fields in China. Livestock emissions are totally dwarfed by methane leaking from the massive clathrate deposits below the permafrost in Siberia, on continental shelves and in the deep ocean. The livestock industry is already subject to carbon dioxide taxes, which allegedly represent the environmental costs of carbon dioxide emissions. Accordingly, it is very difficult to see, from a climate policy perspective, what additional rationale there would be for taxing meat. Would regulating Canadian’s meat consumption or browbeating meat-eaters reduce emissions? Not in an open economy. The meat would still be grown and exported.People may individually choose a diet that they consider right for their nutritional, health and taste needs. Governments, however, have no justification in restricting or taxing the production or consumption of meat in Canada for climate reasons.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'livestock']",2020/01/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/01/17/solar-and-wind-power-cost-about-9-times-that-of-electricity-from-other-sources/,Andrew Roman ,SOLAR AND WIND POWER COST ABOUT 9 TIMES THAT OF ELECTRICITY FROM OTHER SOURCES," Contributed by Ken Gregory © 2019Europe provides an example of what happens to electricity prices with increasing levels of wind and solar installed capacity per person. The plot below shows the average 2017 residential price of electrical power against the average 2017 installed capacity of solar and wind power per capita in each country. Germany, with 1144 W/capita of installed solar plus wind capacity in 2017, generated only 25.8% of its electricity from solar and wind. The best-fit line implies that the effective average solar and wind electricity price in Europe are 9.2 times that of electricity from other sources, mainly fossil fuels. The solar and wind electrical power is highly variable, intermittent and unreliable. These sources of electricity requires near 100% backup from other sources of electricity that are able to immediately ramp up and down power generation to offset the variability of solar and wind power. This enormously increases the cost of the backup power compared to base load power and causes increased CO2 emissions per unit of electricity produced. In this article, “other sources of electricity” means sources of electricity other than from solar and wind power, and is mostly from fossil fuels but also includes electrical power from nuclear, biomass and geothermal sources. The cost of other sources of electricity that is not used for solar and wind backup is much less expensive than the electricity used for backup of solar and wind power. Backup power is usually provided by natural gas fired power plants. Combined cycle natural gas power plants can operate at about 55% efficiency when running near continuously. New “H class” gas turbines with a triple pressure heat recovery steam generators can run at 60% efficiency. However, if these plants are forced to provide backup power and are cycled off and on, the changing temperatures of the power equipment cause significantly increased maintenance costs. Instead, simple cycle (also called open cycle) natural gas plants are commonly used as backup, but their efficiency is only around 35% (a range of 32% to 38%). A 35% efficient single cycle gas plant uses 57% more fuel (and emits 57% more CO2) than a 55% efficient combined cycle gas plant producing the same electrical output, calculated as 55%/35% -1.The increased cost of electricity generated by fossil fuel powered plant used as backup for wind and solar power exists only due to existence of the variable wind and solar power, so all of this additional cost most by allocated to the cost of wind and solar power generation. The effective cost of solar and wind electricity includes the increased cost of other sources of electricity used as backup for solar and wind power.The vertical axis intercept of the above graph is the best estimate of what the electricity price would be with zero solar and wind capacity, which is 10.2 Euro cents per KWh. The price at the top end of the best fit line is at 31.8 Euro cents per KWh where Germany’s wind + solar capacity is 1144 W/capita. Germany’s fraction of electricity from wind and solar in 2017 was 25.8%. The average residential electricity price at the top end point of the line is the weighted average of the effective solar plus wind power costs and the electrical power price from other sources that would exist without wind and solar power.This average residential electricity price is:= effective solar+wind electricity price X fraction of solar+wind electricity generated + other sources of electricity price (without solar & wind) X fraction of other sources of electricity generated.= €0.937/kWh X 25.8% + €0.102/kWh X (100%-25.8%) = €0.318/kWh. So the effective solar+wind electricity price is 93.7 Euro cents per kWh, being 9.2 times the electricity price which would exist with no solar+wind capacity.The solar plus wind electrical power capacity for 2017 is assumed to be the average of the reported capacities at the beginning and end of 2017 for each country. The populations for each country is also calculated as the average of the populations at the beginning and end of 2017 for each country.The resulting high electricity costs in countries with high installed solar and wind capacity is severely harming the economies of those countries. Industries that require large amounts of electric power are moving to less efficient countries which reduces wealth and increases global CO2 emissions.”Dr. Gordon Hughes, a professor of economics at the University of Edinburgh, U.K., wrote an excellent paper titled “Why Is Wind Power so Expensive?”, which compares two scenarios of providing incremental electricity for the United Kingdom. He found that the UK renewable energy targets for 2020 will require wind turbines, transmission lines and gas-fired back-up at a cost of £120 billion. The same demand could be met from gas-fired plants alone at a cost of £13 billion. The cost of the wind turbines with backup is 9.2 times the cost of gas-fired plants alone (120/13 = 9.2), which is exactly the same as found in the above analysis.Electricity prices in Europe in 2017 is from EuroStat2018 as reported by Strom-Report shown below.Additional resources:FinAdvice “Lessons Learned” 201409-PoserH-etal-Finadvice_lessons_learned-finadvice-lessons-learnedDownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['energy', 'renewables']",2020/01/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/01/14/climate-policy-the-denial-of-who-and-what-we-are/,,Climate Policy – The Denial of Who and What We Are," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here.Over the last four years, I have written over 100 articles on energy and climate issues that the Friends of Science Society has been kind enough to post on its blog. My objective has been to offer sound factual and analytical information that would help readers to understand the implications of current climate policy trends in Canada and the world. More recently, many of my articles have tried to illustrate the adverse consequences of specific climate policies and measures that affect different sectors of the economy. Despite all the articles, people frequently say that they do not understand exactly what the cost of climate policy is for the average family or the average person. They complain that I have not boiled all my analysis down to one number that can be used on social media to confront alarmists. In a recent article, I tried to explain why it is virtually impossible to tally up the costs of existing government measures, let alone the costs of future measures. You can read it here:What is Climate Policy Costing Canadians? An Introductory OverviewThis seemed to satisfy no one, which has led me to think about the question in terms of fundamentals.Environment Canada extreme cold weather warning Jan 14, 2020. “A multi-day episode of very cold wind chills continues. The coldest wind chill values will be between minus 45 and minus 50. “What is Canada? It is the coldest country on earth. It is one of the largest countries on earth, with more than 7,000 km separating St. John’s Newfoundland from Victoria, British Columbia. There are long distances between our major urban centres and between our areas of high population density and the remote communities of the North. Canada is a country rich in resources of all kinds, including the resources needed to produce energy like oil, natural gas, coal, uranium and hydro-electric resources. Partly because of this, Canada is a relatively wealthy, industrialized country; it has been able to use its comparative advantages in low cost, plentiful and secure energy to build a modern economy with plenty of high income jobs.Earl map of Canada highlighting resource and agricultural riches.It has been like this for a long time. For well over a century, Canadians have developed their economy, settlement patterns and infrastructure based on plentiful and cheap energy. Our roads, railways, electricity generation and transmission facilities, mines, pipelines, city structures, industrial plants, commercial facilities, vehicles and homes have all been designed and built based on the use of a heritage of plenty. Much of that infrastructure has a long life. It cannot be replaced in a few decades.Along came an international organization, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that uses a computer model to predict climate changes over the next century. That organization told us and the other countries of the world that we must stop using the 84% of our energy needs now supplied for oil, natural gas and coal. More, it insists that we hasten the pace of this transformation using the central planning and taxation powers of government. Outside of Europe, most of the countries of the world have turned a blind eye and deaf ear to this claim.  Within or own country, however, every major political party has accepted the calls of alarm and set political goals that would utterly transform our country. The immense costs to be incurred will fall heavily on all regions, but almost half of them will fall on two provinces – Alberta and Saskatchewan. The governments and people of those provinces are unlikely to take this without grave response. The result of current climate policies, I seriously fear, will not only be the destruction of much of the Canadian economy but also a serious threat to Confederation. So how does one estimate the cost? How do we calculate the cost of turning one’s country on its head, of ignoring the central facts of our geography, climate, history and economic advantages? What is the cost of denial of who and what Canada is?There cannot be one single number for that. Investigative journalist Donna Laframboise exposed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as “The Delinquent Teenager” fraught with green activists, politics and conflicts of interests. Curious that the UN felt it appropriate to host another teenage, Greta Thunberg, to berate the world. Hundreds of scientists of CLINTEL dispute the claim of #ClimateEmergency.Donna Laframboise blogs at “The Big Picture News”Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'CLINTEL', 'IPCC']",2020/01/14

Please ask us for our rationale and supporting evidence before issuing Facebook ‘page quality’ limitations.Most recently, the issue of the Australian wildfires and two of our postings about the events were flagged as “false news” – claiming to have been fact checked by ONE scientist, Stephan Doerr, of Swansea University. On December 19, 2019, Neil Brown sent out a year end appeal for donations for Poynter Institute writing:A free press is essential to our democratic way of life. …Poynter equips local journalists with the skills they need to answer the questions you want to know: The “who.” The “what.” The “where.” The “when.” And most importantly, the “why.” Because questions of “why” are the ones that keep us up at night. They’re the most complicated. The ones that get brushed aside when the rest of the world moves on. The ones that require time, persistence and courage to answer.It is in this regard that the International Fact Check Network, Poynter Institute and Facebook have failed democracy by relying on a single scientist to denounce valid reporting on the many aspects of Australian wildfires. Facebook reaches 2.45 billion people or more, and facebook’s mission is: Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.Shouldn’t that community have the benefit of broad insight into complex issues?While your joint International Fact Check Network project is well intentioned, we believe that your participating/contributing scientists are presenting only a small slice of climate reality, and one that is imbued with an alleged ‘consensus’ view. The fact that a monolithic corporation like Facebook and a small contingent of group-think scientists and journalists can limit discussion on important topics like climate change, simply because they reject dissenting views, is contrary to the fundamental principles of the US First Amendment.While Facebook is a private company and therefore free to set policies as it pleases, if Facebook were a corner store or vanity press, it would be of little consequence. However in this case, by avoiding the factual discussions on the Australian wildfires and instead focussing on the irrelevant element of human-caused climate change – we believe that you are preventing thoughtful consideration of appropriate policies to deal with wildfires, and thereby contributing to the multi-trillion dollar waste of public funds thrown at ‘climate change’ for any disaster-flavour-of-the-week. This poses a threat to public safety in wildfire-risk areas worldwide.Furthermore, as Facebook is set to launch “Libra” and Mark Carney, new climate envoy at the UN has in the past publicly referenced this digital currency as a replacement for the US dollar as the reserve standard, it appears that Facebook policies may be slanted in favor of the climate catastrophe agenda for commercial purposes. This is not transparently stated anywhere.Our detailed argument deconstructing the Climate Feedback “Fact Check” follows. We hope that future Climate Feedback commentaries include a proper assessment of the ‘why’ of complex issues like wildfires and climate change, and not just hand-waving.We request of facebook that you immediately clear the Friends of Science Society’s Facebook page of any ‘page quality’ issues, as we have clearly provided evidence that refutes Climate Feedback’s ‘fact-check.’ We request of Climate Feedback that you first ask us for supporting evidence for our claims before issuing your journalistic condemnation of our work. As with the story of the “CLINTEL 500 Scientists say No Climate Emergency” story, which you – Poynter Institute and IFCN – effectively blocked from mainstream media while claiming to be a bastion of freedom of the press, you have done a great disservice to the millions of people around the world who are unnecessarily afraid of an apocalyptic end of the world. We deem your review of CLINTEL to have very low scientific credibility and it should be retracted.Thank you for your review of the following factual critique of Climate Feedback’s ‘Fact Check’ on our facebook postings of these Australian wildfire stories. We request that our rebuttal be posted on your Climate Feedback site to encourage freedom of the press and open, civil debate.Sincerely,Friends of Science SocietyFuel and Poor Forest Management is the Main Factor in Australian Wildfires, Not Human-caused Climate ChangeCompiled by Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, with files from Rob Scagel. © Jan. 13, 2020Climate Feedback claims that stories of Australian arsonists or poor forest management are not true – they claim that climate change is the culprit. To this end, Facebook has limited Friends of Science Society’s page and put up a page quality notice that the stories posted are ‘false news.’ We dispute Climate Feedback’s commentary and will show in this document that Facebook is wrongly preventing the ~2.45 billion facebook user community from learning about the real causes of wildfires. It’s fuel, not human-caused climate change.On Facebook, Chris Dynon of Australia does a bit of a ‘walk about’ in the brush near his residence to show people the fuel load (burnable material) that should have been burnt back in prescribed fires. “Prescribed fires” are controlled fires done by relevant authorities during cooler times when there is low wind, so as to reduce the dead wood or highly flammable shrubs which create the very tragic fuel load outcomes we are witnessing today in Australia. Chris Dynon video: https://www.facebook.com/chris.dynon/videos/10216306351231927/ We sent this video and Climate Feedback’s Prof. Doerr commentary to our wildfire and forestry expert here in Canada.Here is our Facebook post and our wildfire expert’s response: (we include some screenshots from the Chris Dynon video).We got a message from Facebook on a Climate Feedback factcheck, related to Australia wildfires. They claim a story we posted about Aussie fires started by arsonists and lightning – not climate change. Climate Feedback says that is misleading and that though authorities are investigating causes, that does not preclude climate change as a factor. Here’s the Climate Feedback story.  And here’s the Australian Bureau of Met explaining the past year.  As others have pointed out, even if the land is bone dry, if there is nothing to ignite, there won’t be any big wildfires. Here’s a fellow named Chris Dynon doing a ‘walkabout’ with his camera, showing the build up of dead fuel on the ground and light shrubs. This is catastrophic for wildfire risk. https://www.facebook.com/chris.dynon/videos/10216306351231927/ We sent this video to a Canadian forestry/wildfire specialist who responded with these comments: (screenshots from Chris Dynon’s video included here)“Yes indeed, exciting stand structure. Think California chaparral under a canopy.Heat is proportional to the fourth power of weight of fuel. Doubling even a sparse fuel loading has a huge consequence for fire intensity.Speed is inversely proportional to bulk density of surface fuel and fuel bed depth.Three things to note (in the video):Previous fire scorch height is only 2-3m. This is low intensity, fast moving fire from a completely different stand structure. Current stand condition would generate 5-6m scorch height and crowning. Chris Dynon 2. Lots of coarse debris on the ground. Stand is aging and trees are dying. Lots of cured standing dead. As the stand breaks up lots of ingress creating additional laddering above a cribbed surface fuel load. Broken stand structure generates chimneying.3. Surface fuels that were previously herbaceous and cured grass, now replaced by accumulating leaf and bark nested in woody perennial shrubs. It is worse than just the biomass increase. Fuel bed bulk density is very low, and the resinous vegetation and debris makes for extreme combustibility. Think gasoline-soaked vegetation.This isn’t ClimateChange but stand succession without fire disturbance. Nothing magic or special here except for romantic nutter bureaucracy.What makes this so dangerous is, like British Columbia, the worst stand structure is most likely closest to and in communities – like Paradise, CA. Proximity to communities also increases the probability of ignition. Paradise, CA from Google Maps images. How it looked prior to the catastrophic Camp Fire. Please read “Camp Fire the tragedy we were all warned about.” Adding to the danger is that fire suppression methods and community structure and building codes that were adequate for the previous fire regime completely fail with these stand replacing fires.It ain’t the global Climate – it is us and our neglected backyards. We either put up with a little bit of smoke every year or have these infrequent cataclysmic events. “ …. So Facebook and Climate Feedback, looks like our expert says it is NOT climate change. Since climate change is typically evaluated in cycles/patterns over periods of 30, 50, 100 and 1,000 years and up, a one-or-two-year drought is just part of natural variability and not a sign of climate change. It is worth noting that during the Medieval Warm Period, California had periods of 100-and-200-year droughts. Now THAT’s climate change. The Australian tragedy does not fit those kind of parameters. Will Facebook put a note on Climate Feedback’s page, telling them to stop distributing fake news? Graph shows megadroughts in California’s history. This is climate change. Climate Change Has Become the Great Diversion – Funds Diverted from Practical SolutionsFriends of Science Society is tired of seeing billions of dollars recklessly thrown at any ‘climate change’ cause, while a few million dollars, properly applied to forestry wildfire risk management would save lives and property in any forested region of the world. Climate change has become a diversion and now people are dead and much of a continent in flames, because proper fire risk management measures were not taken.We know wildfires very well in Canada, and we know that human-causation, whether intentional like arson, or accidental, like negligent campers or an ATV spark, or incidental, like human power lines sparking branches, are major factors. The following statistics are from Alberta Environment (2011). Note there is an increase in human causation in the 5-year trend as more people become active in the woods, or move to acreages, but fewer have any wilderness training or skills.Alberta Environment 2011Regarding Prof. Doerr’s Climate Feedback commentary on the stories in question, our wildfire expert explains why Doerr’s commentary is false news, beginning with the fact that Prof. Doerr couches his commentary (in the middle, not at the beginning) by saying: “While a precise attribution study will be needed to quantify the influence of climate change on this specific series of fires in Australia…”Thus, his commentary is imprecise and not based on evidence.As Neil Brown, President of Poynter Institute has written about the ‘who, what, when, where, and why’ of journalism:And most importantly, the “why.” Because questions of “why” are the ones that keep us up at night. They’re the most complicated. The ones that get brushed aside when the rest of the world moves on. The ones that require time, persistence and courage to answer.Let us first find the courage to ask the right questions and not leap to the ‘human-caused climate change’ assumption. Assumption can be deadly.Wildfire is a complex reality, but it is a reality that does not require the invocation of the magical thinking of ClimateChange™. Let us examine the ‘why’ of the Australian wildfires.1) Claim the fires are unprecedented or dry conditions are caused by human-caused climate change There is a lack of veracity about the historical claims being made in this commentary: unprecedented, etc. Australia is subject to the unpredictable swings of the warm El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and cool La Nina cycles, both of which can wreak havoc on Australia. These are natural phenomenon unrelated to human-caused climate change. In Brian Fagan’s book “The Great Warming” he notes that:“During the intense El Nino cycles of 1870-1900, New South Wales and Victoria in Australia turned into dustbowls, with huge forest fires and dust storms lasting for days. Millions of sheep perished; crops failed over a wide area.” (pp 203)The South Asian Monsoon has also set precedents: “The South Asian monsoon failed again in 1789, and the failure was followed by intense droughts that descended on Australia, Mexico, and southern Africa in 1790.” (pp 206)The cooler La Nina phase can be damaging as well.  “The less conspicuous, and often longer-lasting, La Nina can be just as destructive, especially in its ability to nurture drought over large tracts of land” …” the cool, dry sister of El Nino persisted for years.” (pp 232)Fagan notes that people living on marginal land ‘are at the mercy of ENSO droughts” (pp 238), so to state the present conditions are unprecedented is untrue.2) Wildfire factors not reviewed by IFCN/Climate Feedback or Professor DoerrThe International Fact Check Network, Climate Feedback, journalists and Prof. Doerr, need to start to define their terms:• magnitude – numbers of ignitions, spatial size,• frequency – numbers of fires (spatial), ignition events (temporal)• severity – speed, fuel consumption,• consequences – human habitation, other human values.• drought – drought is an extremely complex phenomena that must be defined. Drought is being used in the Climate Feedback “Fact Check” commentary in a generic, biblical matter, that does not permit comment in this analysis.These words and phrases above have been emphasized as they require clarification. They are not discussed in the commentary that claims to debunk the articles in question. Why not? Why are these essential wildfire factors not even addressed?3) Assume the climate is completely stable (which we know is false – see Brian Fagan notes above)Let us indulge in a thought experiment.Let us assume that the Climate is stable. Hyper stable. A climate in which every year the same weather occurs. Year in, year out.Even under such a regime, forest stands age and fuels accumulate.The fire risk increases.a) Rate of spread • Fine fuels are the principle source of ignition. The amount of fine fuel is not as important as the distribution of these fuels. • As stands age and fuels accumulate the distribution of these fuels increases over the landscape and the continuity of increase. • As the continuity of fuels increases the initial rate of fire spread increases. • No need to invoke ClimateChange™.b) Probability of ignition • Fuels ignite because of their moisture content. This is known as the equilibrium moisture content.  • Equilibrium moisture content is a function of temperature, humidity, and exposure. • Fuels in exposed sunlight and open conditions subject to wind equilibrate in less than an hour. • Once you get to a certain temperature: usually 30°C and 30% RH, the equilibrium moisture can decrease no further. • Doesn’t matter how much hotter or drier the air temperature or the soil moisture the fine fuel will not get drier. • This is the point at which the probability of ignition is 100%. • This is fundamentally what happened at Slave Lake and Fort McMurray. You do not need to have 50°C temperatures and dry soils to have catastrophic conflagrations.c) Ignition source Even without ClimateChange™ human population has increased, land use practices – industrial and recreational – change, and infrastructure has been continuously built into the accumulating fuels of the interface. This increases the number of ignition sources. Human infrastructure and stand structure can also increase the occurrences in lightening interception. You don’t even need to invoke the reprobate behavior arsonists to understand that even without ClimateChange™ the number of ignition sources has increased.d) Head fire intensity • Head fire intensity (HFI) describes the heat generated along the flaming front of wildfire. • HFI is directly proportional to the amount fuel. The heat generated at the flaming front is proportional to the 4th power of the amount of fuel (kg/m³) that is burning. • Stand succession without stand disturbance results in increasing amount of fuel that can be engaged in a conflagration and increases the heat. • As surface fuel HFI increases it eventually generates enough radiant energy that the stand canopy can be engaged in a proliferation – a pyroclastic pyre. • Eventually the combination of HFI, the area actively engaged in a conflagration, and crowning can release enough energy and debris that it generates its own weather systems that further proliferate the pyroclastic pyre. • One you get to about 8-10,000 kWhr/m of flaming front wildfire suppression direct suppression is no longer physically possible.4) Review statistical norms of the last 30 years Now let’s relax the artificial hyper stable conditions of the thought experiment and consider say the statistical normal for the last 30-years.Remember that head fire intensity is proportional to the 4th power of the fuel load? Basically, small changes in fuel load result in large increases in fire behaviour.Normal successional increases in fuel load quickly exceed anything that the statistical weather normals. Even under extreme weather conditions, say 95th percentile which is how we plan wildfire abatement here in Canada. 5) Review weather inputs for a century Finally, the weather. If one refines the weather inputs to deal with the 95th weather percentiles for century long period of records to represent the historical extremes, adding warmer temperatures, allegedly from human-causation, one can still not account for the effects of fuel load.6) Conclusion • Fuel rules.  • ClimateChange™ is not just irrelevant. Spending resources and intellectual capital on such considerations is as effective at mitigating wildfire as changing the colour of the paper used in reporting wildfires.As we have published on our Facebook page: Facebook factcheckers have been targeting stories claiming they are misleading because they question the anthropogenic contribution to fires. I wonder if they are flagging articles claiming they are because AGW. I doubt it. Stefan Doerr and Emmanuel Vincent the two fact-checkers may want to brush up on the science behind natural variability. Facebook is censoring science they do not agree with. ”Eight megadroughts are identified in eastern Australia including one 39-year drought (A.D. 1174–1212), which occurred during an unprecedented century of aridity (A.D. 1102–1212).” https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL062447Aside from the foregoing facts, we find it deeply concerning that Climate Feedback editor Emmanuel Vincent is working with a cognitive scientist to manipulate messaging to the public and that he is not an unbiased or nonpartisan individual, as IFCN and Climate Feedback claim him to be.Vincent is working with Professor Teenie Matlock, who started the Center for Climate Communications as part of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute. Matlock, a cognitive scientist who, in part, studies the semantics of politically charged language, plans to collaborate with Vincent to learn about how scientists’ comments affect readers’ perception of articles’ credibility.One challenge science journalists face is conveying highly technical information to audiences that have little or no scientific expertise. Scientists can also find it difficult to communicate their work on a level the general public can understand and relate to. Another challenge, Vincent and Matlock said, is that language about climate change naturally includes uncertainty, and even though uncertainty is part of everyday life, some people are uncomfortable with it.Vincent also employs the abhorrent epithet ‘denier’.“I don’t think we’re going to change the minds of hardcore believers or deniers,” Vincent said. “My goal is to speak to the people in the middle who might be confused by the amount of contradictory information coming at them and just say ‘I don’t really know.’”According to his CV, Vincent’s credentials* include: “…studying how the ocean controls hurricanes intensity and how hurricanes can in turn influence the climate via their interaction with the ocean.” It is difficult to see how this qualifies him to edit commentary on wildfires.In ConclusionWe have shown that fuel conditions in the Australian bush are the most relevant factors in the massive spread of recent, tragic wildfires, and that climatic conditions at present have been seen before and will be seen again due to the ENSO cycle.Comments may be posted below in the online post – please be civil and argue the evidence.Updated to capitalize Facebook.Updated to reflect the CV of the correct Emmanuel Vincent.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/01/11/turkey-and-libya-a-war-for-mediterranean-gas/,,Turkey and Libya: a war for Mediterranean gas?," With Samuel Furfari This is a Google translated version of the French original, of Jan. 8, 2020, republished with permission of the author. ©2020Samuel Furfari The start of the geopolitical year 2020 is worrying, and not only for the events in Iran / Iraq. The growing importance of Turkey’s role in the Near and Middle East should not leave one indifferent. What it is preparing in the Levant Sea is perhaps even more so, because this maritime region is rich in natural gas and already plays a major role in the geopolitics of energy. On December 31, gas from the Leviathan field off the coast of Israel began production. It will ramp up in the coming months and thus exceed the production of the other deposit – “Tamar” – which has produced since 2014. Israel, which was surrounded by oil-producing countries, suddenly saw its energy policy turned upside down; its coal-fired power plants will be replaced by gas-fired plants. In Egypt, since December 2017, the Zohr gas field has produced and brings enormous relief to the country’s energy supply. But this area is so rich in gas that it will obviously be necessary to export this sought-after energy because it does not pollute the atmosphere, gas being the future of energy and energy of the future.This is why in 2013, the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, Didier Reynders, wanted to approach the question in an academic way so that this abundance was not a further source of conflict. Egmond, the Royal Institute for International Relations of Belgium thus organized a series of meetings to which I had the privilege of making my contribution. The resulting report addresses the various challenges and opportunities of energy cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean and Levantine region, in order to examine how the management of new energy resources could act as a vehicle for cooperation rather than conflict between the countries concerned.This has produced positive results, since the countries most involved – Israel, Egypt, Greece, Cyprus and also the Palestinian territories – have created an Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum in order to strengthen cooperation and promote exploitation natural gas reserves in the region. The next ministerial meeting of this Forum is planned for Cairo during the second half of January 2020; however there is no doubt that it will take place in a disturbing atmosphere because of the attitude of Turkey.Indeed, it wants its share of the gas cake of the Levant Sea, from which it considers itself excluded by the application of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 (Convention known as “de Montego Bay” ). This Convention grants coastal states the possibility of declaring an exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This amounts in practice to shifting the borders of a country on the high seas. It has thus made it possible to create a multitude of new borders which have changed the game in geopolitics of energy, since often these maritime territories conceal hydrocarbons. This is the case of the Levant Sea, which has become in a few years “a new Norway” in the south-east of the EU, because from this area will flow new gas supplies for the EU, which has elsewhere much needed.But now, Turkey cannot tolerate not being part of this new gas group. This is the reason why in December 2019 it announced that it had signed a maritime space sharing agreement with Libya. It is not the place here to enter into the legal specificities of the Convention but anyone who looks at a map of the area can see that between Turkey and Libya there is the island of Crete, some other Greek islands but also Cyprus. Maritime continuity between Turkey and Libya is therefore impossible. Unlike Greece, the EU, the United States, Russia, Egypt, Israel and even the government of eastern Libya of General Haftar, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his sudden ally Fayez el-Sarraj, the head of the Tripoli national agreement government, seem to be the only ones to think that there is a maritime continuity, within the meaning of the Convention on the law of the sea, between Turkey and Libya. The only link between these two countries is historical and discontinuous, Libya having been part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912.The European Council of 12 December last, recalling its previous conclusions on Turkey, confirms that Turkish drilling activities in the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus are illegal and that “the memorandum of understanding between Turkey and Libya on the delimitation of maritime jurisdictions in the Mediterranean Sea violates the sovereign rights of third States, is contrary to the law of the sea and cannot have legal consequences for third States. The European Council unequivocally reaffirms its solidarity with Greece and Cyprus with regard to these actions by Turkey. ” This desire by Turkey to appropriate part of the natural gas from the Levant Sea explains its decision taken on January 2 to intervene militarily in Libya and the arrival on January 6 of the start of the deployment of its troops in Libya. This maneuver threatens to precipitate a broader crisis in the eastern Mediterranean which, in turn, could complicate Turkey’s relations with Moscow on the one hand, and with Washington and the main NATO allies on the other. The height is that Turkey has neither signed nor ratified the Convention it evokes to intervene militarily in Libya.Although we do not want to agree with Emmanuel Macron who declares that NATO, of which Turkey is a member, is moribund, there is something to understand. Samuele Furfari, engineer and Professor of the Geopolitics of Energy at the Free University of Brussels devoted all his professional life, still today, to energy and more precisely to energy policy. He recently retired as a senior European civil servant at the European Commission where he has worked in this field since 1982. He is an Advisor to the European Energy Forum (a body of Members of the European Parliament).A good teacher, he is regularly invited to speak in the media.He has published 7 books, some of which are translated into Spanish and Portuguese and English.https://www.amazon.fr/l/B004MOTXDA/259-7897251-7175552?_encoding=UTF8&redirectedFromKindleDbs=true&rfkd=1&shoppingPortalEnabled=trueThis is a comprehensive two part series on Energy and Geopolitics.https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B071NMZ9CL/ref=dp_st_1535432039https://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&obj=livre&no=64592Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change']",2020/01/11
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/01/11/exporting-our-emissions-a-conference-board-report/,,Exporting Our Emissions – A Conference Board Report," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here.In October, 2019, the Conference Board of Canada published a report entitled Tipping the Scales, an analysis of the effects of Canada’s current carbon dioxide taxation regime on the competitiveness of Canadian industries and of the potential for “carbon leakage” affecting emissions-intensive industries. Carbon leakage is the term used by analysts of climate change policies to describe the movement of firms’ investment and economic activity and the related greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) out of a country when climate policies make it less economic for them to continue operating in the country imposing the policies. When emissions “leak” or are displaced to other jurisdictions, the effect may actually be to increase global emissions. This is a summary of the report, the full text of which can be found here:https://www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library/abstract.aspx?did=10485The system of carbon dioxide pricing and taxation in place in Canada is a balkanized one in which the rates of the taxes, emissions trading permits and other charges and fees varies across the country. Under the federal government’s “backstop” system that applies in most provinces and territories, the carbon dioxide charge imposed is $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019 and this will rise to $50 per tonne in 2022. The rate is virtually certain to continue rising after that. The Conference Board study examined the effects of carbon dioxide pricing today.The alleged objective of the charges is to reduce GHG emissions by raising the cost to consumers and industry of using the energy services provided by the combustion of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal). The increased cost is intended to discourage use and, in theory, to provide an incentive to the suppliers of non-fossil fuel alternatives. However, the charges also have unintended and undesirable consequences.Key FindingsEmissions intensive industries include natural resources extraction industries in forestry/logging, mining, and oil and gas; electrical utilities; manufacturing industries producing pulp and paper, wood products, basic chemicals and agricultural chemicals, petroleum and coal products, mineral products and primary metals manufacturing. They account for 10 per cent of Canada’s economy. More important, they account for close to 40 per cent of total non-residential investment. They are especially important to the Prairies and Atlantic Canada regional economies. Using $30 per tonne as the average carbon dioxide tax over the 2018 to 2022 period, Conference Board analysts calculated that Canada’s emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries (i.e. those vulnerable to losses in sales due to foreign competition) could incur up to $10 billion in “compliance costs”, meaning the costs of either reducing emissions or paying the penalties for failing to do so. They assume, however, that half of these costs will be reduced due to “policy relief”, the granting by governments of exemptions to protect the more vulnerable firms and regions. Even the $5 billion in costs, however, has the potential to displace about $10 billion of Canada’s GDP and reduce employment by 48,000 jobs. The higher costs imposed by carbon dioxide taxation will have adverse effects on the competitiveness of Canadian firms in both domestic and export markets. The size of the impact will depend on several factors, including whether competitive conditions allow the firm to pass on the cost to customers in the form of higher prices. The top three emissions-intensive industries most exposed to competition in export markets are pulp and paper products, coal mining and primary metals manufacturing. Also important to the amount of leakage that may occur is the level of the carbon dioxide taxes or charges imposed by governments in the countries to which Canada exports. The Conference Board analysts quote an “average nominal carbon price” globally of U.S. $14 per tonne before policy relief and U.S. $8 per tonne after policy relief. (This is a perplexing figure given that Canada’s three largest trading partners (i.e. the USA, China and Mexico) have average carbon dioxide taxes of U.S. $2 per tonne or less, and 10 out of the countries identified as “peer jurisdictions” have no carbon dioxide pricing regimes at all.) The study did not examine the higher compliance costs or the higher losses due to foreign competition that would result from carbon dioxide taxes at $50 per tonne or at the much higher tax rates (up to $100 per tonne and higher) that may be imposed over the period to 2030. Even so, the potential for “carbon leakage” is quite large. This is especially the case for Canada’s non-ferrous metal manufacturing facilities, such as aluminum smelters and chemicals; natural gas production; some oil sands production; chemicals and petrochemicals; and electricity exports from provinces that rely largely on fossil fuel generation. In terms of emissions reduction, the Conference Board estimates that at the $30 per tonne rate, GHG emissions in Canada would drop by 19 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. However, the report states:“This is not the best way for emissions reductions in Canada to be achieved, as they come at a very high cost. It is worth noting that these reductions are estimated before considering any potential leakages. So, the net reduction in global GHG emissions is likely lower, and could result in an actual increase in some cases.”CommentThe Conference Board of Canada’s reports previously have consistently supported the use of carbon dioxide taxes and charges, and the Board has implicitly accepted the thesis that humans are responsible for causing catastrophic global warming. This paper does not depart from that position, but warns about the adverse trade effects and appears to argue for a change in the design of the present Canadian program.Even an emissions reduction of 19 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year would be far below the target for 2030 set by the federal government. Environment and Climate Change Canada, in its report on Canada’s emissions outlook in 2018, estimated that the current carbon dioxide taxation regime would reduce emissions by 80 million tonnes per year.It is notable that in this report the Conference Board ignores the effect of the many different programs and regulations in place in addition to carbon dioxide taxes. These also impose heavy costs on Canadian firms and may have large trade effects, including those associated with “carbon leakage”.

The CBC Radio-Canada respondent, Pierre Champoux, says that CLINTEL was contacted by the International Fact Checking Network which includes “Climate Feedback” for climate science stories. CLINTEL tells me that they have never been contacted by IFCN. We did an analysis of the Climate Feedback critique of CLINTEL and we find their scientific credibility to be very low.IFCN (Poynter) and facebook have a joint fact checking and journalism project in progress where IFCN’s network determines whether or not they think stories are factually correct. Based on what IFCN self-appointed experts (who hold the ‘consensus climate view’) state, then facebook and virtually all other mainstream media, block the story or in facebook’s case, they downgrade sites posting such stories for ‘page quality’ violations. We did an exposé on Climate Feedback and the CLINTEL story.But Canadians are likely more interested in what CBC Radio-Canada had to say. We believe this story to be in the public interest. Here it is:From: Radio-Canada Info plaintes-information@radio-canada.caDate: Thu., Dec. 19, 2019, 11:02 a.m.Subject: Stirling, Michelle / RC.ca / Clintel’s letter to the UNTo: contact@friendsofscience.orgCc: Ombudsman de Radio-Canada ombudsman@radio-canada.caDear Ms Stirling,First of all, thank you for taking the time to write to us. Comments like yours are important, and we make a point of reading them to inform our thinking and take the appropriate follow-up actions.Your complaint is in regard to Bouchra Ouatik’s story published on November 23rd, on Radio-Canada.ca. You wrote the following:« Instead of investigating and reporting on the views of the CLINTEL group of some 700 scientists, “Décrypteurs” seem intent on trying to delegitimize the signatories. Radio-Canada interviewed only one Montreal scientist who rejects the CLINTEL perspective, and none of the Canadian scientists who are signatory to the CLINTEL declaration. This appears to be contrary to CBC-Radio-Canada’s Journalistic Standards of “…reflecting a diversity of opinion…. On issues of controversy, we ensure that divergent views are reflected respectfully, taking into account their relevance to the debate and how widely held these views are. We also ensure that they are represented over a reasonable period of time. “We request that you review the scientific explanation of the CLINTEL group and that you properly interview signatory scientists who hold these dissenting views on climate and give them equal time and space to all the climate catastrophists like Greta Thunberg who are not scientists at all; or the headline coverage CBC/Radio Canada gave to the 11,000 scientists who turned out to include Prof. Micky Mouse and Dumbledore. (…) »You seem to see in our article an intention to delegitimize the signatories of the letter sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations, and you are blaming us for having let Professor Michel Jébrak react to Clintel’s conclusions, without allowing Canadian signatories to speak. Thus, in your opinion, this article lacks balance.With all due respect, Ms. Stirling, we do not share your point of view.As the title of our article indicates (translated it would read as follows : Who are the “500 scientists” who say there is “no climate emergency”?), journalist Bouchra Ouatik focused on the signatories of the letter sent on September 23, 2019. To do so, she worked with the International Fact-Checking Network, of which Radio-Canada’s Décrypteurs team is a member. The goal was to review the list of « scientists » who have endorsed Clintel’s position and to highlight, in addition to their expertise, any past or present links that could lead to bias or the appearance of bias.Contrary to what you may think, Bouchra Ouatik tried to reach all Canadian signatories, as did the other members of the IFCN in their respective countries. She was finally able to track down twelve of the seventeen Canadian signatories, but only eight of them responded. If their comments added to what was already in the Clintel letter, our reporter mentioned it in the article. Here is an example from her text:« William van Wijngaarden, Professor of Physics at York University, specializing in optics and lasers. To CBC, he conceded that the use of fossil fuels has had an influence on the increase in greenhouse gases, but he said that it has had a minimal influence on global warming. He worked with the Global Warming Policy Foundation. »Our article also summarizes the contents of the letter, which is tantamount to a speech by the signatories, with detailed arguments in support. Our concern for balance therefore led us to interview Professor Michel Jébrak, who brings a different point of view. Finally, you demand, for the signatories of the letter from Clintel and other climatosceptics, air time or space equivalent to that granted to Greta Thunberg or to this other open letter signed by 11,000 scientists in the journal Bioscience. With all due respect, we believe that to give similar attention to the dissenting thesis would violate our principle of balance, if not accuracy, as the scientific consensus on climate change enjoys great credibility by virtue of the overwhelming support of the scientific community.We believe, Ms. Stirling, that Bouchra Ouatik’s report, in addition to being in the public interest, was balanced and provided Canadians with an insight of great relevance.I hope that I have assured you of our good faith in this matter. If not, you can ask the Radio-Canada Ombudsman to review your complaint.The Ombudsman, who is independent and reports directly to the President and CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada, is tasked with ensuring that news and information content is compliant with the current Journalistic Standards and Practices.You can reach the Ombudsman as follows:By email:  ombudsman@radio-canada.caBy phone:  514-597-4757 (Greater Montreal) 1-877-846-4737 (toll-free)By mail: Ombudsman of Radio-Canada P.O.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/12/31/happy-new-year-happy-new-tax/,,Happy New Year! Happy New Tax!," Contributed by Robert Lyman 2019. Lyman’s bio can be read here.As Canadians celebrate the beginning of 2020, their happiness at starting a new year will be dulled somewhat by the realization that January 1 marks the date when carbon dioxide taxes increase yet again. The current system of carbon dioxide taxes, charges on industry, and carbon trading prices is complicated, contrary to the claims that it represents a nice simple regime to encourage reductions in our use of the energy services on which we all depend for heat, light and mobility.The people living in most Canadian provinces are subject to the federal government’s “backstop” regime. Under this regime, carbon dioxide taxes are applied on oil, natural gas and coal purchases according to their estimated effect on causing carbon dioxide emissions, as measured in tonnes. On January 1, 2020, the rate of the tax increases by a whopping 50 %, from $20 per tonne to $30 per tonne. Residents of British Columbia, always eager to be greener than thou, were already paying carbon dioxide taxes of $35 per tonne, the highest in the country, and that tax rate will increase on New Year’s Day to $40 per tonne. Quebecers are always treated a bit differently, or manage to negotiate a different deal. In Quebec, energy users are subject not to a carbon dioxide tax but rather the prices that result from an emissions trading system that the province shares with California. Under that system, the companies that consume and/or sell fossil fuels must either reduce their emissions to meet a regulatory limit or buy enough permits under a unified California-Quebec permit auction system. In the last auction, held on November 19, 2019, the reserve price was $20.64 per tonne and the median allowance price actually paid was $22.73 per tonne. So, in November 2019 Quebecers paid more per tonne for their carbon dioxide permits than residents of most other provinces paid in carbon dioxide tax. Surprisingly, for the next auction to be held on February 19, 2020, the reserve price will be only $16.34 per tonne. It remains to be seen what will actually be bid.Thirty dollars per tonne is equivalent to about seven cents per litre of gasoline. Next year, we will all get to celebrate another rise in the cost of our energy. I hope the Grinch did not steal your Christmas.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/12/21/the-global-assault-on-aviation-emissions/,fosadmin  (Post author),The Global Assault on Aviation Emissions," Contributed by Robert Lyman 2019. Lyman’s bio can be read here.There is no part of the Canadian and global economies that has escaped the attention of those who believe that humans are causing catastrophic global warming and that absolutely everything must by done to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An increasing aspect of their attention, so far little covered by the Canadian media, is the campaign to reduce emissions from aviation. That may change in the next few years.Globally, passenger and freight-related aviation accounts for about 2.5 % of GHG emissions. The percentage is higher in the wealthier, more industrialized countries. Aircraft are entirely dependent on oil-based fuels, and jet fuel consumed in 2018 totaled 12.8 quadrillion British Thermal Units (Btu) of energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA’s most recent International Energy Outlook projects that world jet fuel consumption will grow to 17.7 Btu in 2030 and 29.4 Btu in 2050, making it one of the fastest growing sources of GHG emissions. To place that in context, by 2050 aviation may have risen to 3.5 % of global GHG emissions. This prospect has gained great attention in the European Union. In Sweden, the outrage is so great that many people have adopted a new and interesting GHG mitigation technique. It is called “flight shaming”, the practice of naming and publicly shaming high profile individuals and companies that, from the perspective of climate alarm, have unduly and unnecessarily used aircraft to travel or to move freight. Flight shaming has become so widespread in Europe that it is adversely affecting the airlines and has increasingly shaped public policy. The German Aviation Association recently, and facetiously, examined a proposal to scrap all internal German flights if the national rail operator would facilitate an equally high speed service on the same routes. The European Union has, since 2012, adopted a more costly alternative to shaming. Under the European Emissions Trading System (ETS), all airlines operating in Europe are required to monitor, report and verify their carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and to obtain and surrender allowances against those emissions, covering a certain level of their emissions from their flights per year. In effect, by forcing airlines to buy emissions offsets, the EU has imposed a cost similar to a carbon dioxide tax. This forces airlines either to reduce emissions from flight operations (where possible) or to raise fares. The higher fares are thus expected to be the mechanism for driving down aircraft usage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in October 2016 agreed on a Resolution (supported by Canada) for a global market-based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation by 2021. The agreed Resolution sets out the objective and key design elements of the proposed global regime, as well as a roadmap for the completion of the work on implementation. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or CORSIA, aims to stabilize CO2 emissions at 2020 levels by requiring airlines to “offset” the growth of their emissions after 2020. The offsets would be achieved by having to purchase eligible emission units (i.e. similar to emission permits) in other sectors of the global economy. Although participation in the first phases of the scheme is voluntary for countries, the advocates claim that this will offset around 80% of the emissions above 2020 levels.Even the supporters of such schemes admit that offset programs are deeply flawed and likely to fail. Offset programs require an ample supply of emission reduction projects from which to buy the offset permits, a system of accounting and verification that will avoid rackets and scams (like those that have burdened the European ETS), and broad participation so as to avoid giving some airlines major competitive advantages over others. Even if they were to work, the consequences of placing hard caps on the permit-free portion of airlines emissions, in the face of fast-growing air transport demand, would be to drive passenger and freight airfares much, much higher. It is worthwhile contemplating what full implementation of CORSIA would mean in practice. Table 1 is drawn from data in the EIA International Energy Outlook showing current projection of passenger air travel for selected countries and regions.Table 1 Projected Passenger Air Travel (billion revenue-passenger-miles) Country/Region2018202020302040United States 9901,0321,234 1,473Canada 150 154 184 224Europe1,1031,1601,509 1,912Middle East 296 308 426 600China 650 7391,258 1,970Southeast Asia 379 435 823 1,426World4,7465,0767,18810,090From this table one can observe that air passenger travel is projected to rise, not fall, in all regions. In addition, from 2018 to 2040:• Passenger air travel in the U.S. and Canada is projected to grow in by 49%• Passenger air travel Europe is projected to grow by 73%• Passenger air travel in China is projected to grow by 205%• World passenger air travel is projected to grow by 113% To avoid a doubling of traffic (or tripling, in the case of China) would require offsets whose costs would easily increase airfares to several multiples of what they are today. The same would be true for air freight, which is especially important in serving the needs of countries and communities that are remote from the main centres of commerce.One has to wonder whether, in the face of these obstacles, governments in western countries will press ahead with the CORSIA scheme when the developing countries (where all the emissions growth is occurring) almost certainly will not do so. The alternative to a CORSIA-like offset system is to increase domestic taxes, such as carbon dioxide taxes and special aviation-only taxes. Finally, if all else fails, governments might place hard cap restrictions on the growth in flights. This would require an elaborate regulatory system, including the setting of priorities for the allocation of rights to fly or to move freight by air, with all of the uncertainties and discretionary judgments that are part of any regulatory regime.For Canadians used to travelling across the country for business or escaping to southern destinations for a mid-winter break, climate alarm may soon make them face the “shame”, the cost or the cap. One can only imagine how popular that will be.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['aviation', 'climate change']",2019/12/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/12/20/fear-and-loathing-history-context-and-observations/,,"FEAR AND LOATHING: HISTORY, CONTEXT AND OBSERVATIONS"," The Alberta Oil Sands – From National Pride to International Pariah In the neighbourhood of McMurray there are several tar-wells, so called, and there, if a hole is scraped in the bank, it slowly fills in with tar mingled with sand. This is separated by boiling, and is used, in its native state, for gumming canoes and boats. Farther up are immense towering banks, the tar oozing at every pore, and underlaid by great overlapping dykes of disintegrated limestone, alternating with lofty clay exposures, crowned with poplar, spruce and pine. On the 15th we were still following the right bank, and, anon, past giant clay escarpments along it, everywhere streaked with oozing tar, and smelling like an old ship.Athabasca River – the oil sands run through it, naturallyThe tar, whatever it may be otherwise, is a fuel, and burned in our camp-fires like coal. That this region is stored with a substance of great economic value is beyond all doubt, and, when the hour of development comes, it will, I believe, prove to be one of the wonders of Northern Canada. We were all deeply impressed by this scene of Nature’s chemistry, and realized what a vast storehouse of not only hidden but exposed resources we possess in this enormous country. What is unseen can only be conjectured; but what is seen would make any region famous. Through the Mackenzie Basin A Narrative of the Athabasca and Peace River Treaty Expedition of 1899 By Charles MairAs documented by William Stainsbury and author Elaine Dewar, from the early 1990s, a powerful ‘green’ movement developed in Canada that, on the surface appeared to be driven by public desire to see an improvement in forestry and other corporate environmental practises.The “War in the Woods” of the 1990’s, staged in British Columbia, changed Canada forever. Where once we had been a nation of loggers, miners, oil drillers and oil sands developers that went about the business of resource development, suddenly Canada was thrust onto the world stage in an ugly light as activists battled forestry companies through confrontational civil disobedience, sometimesviolence, and engaged in activities like the illegal spiking of trees (driving nails into trees in the hope that a forestry worker’s saw would hit the nail and hurt the worker) in order to stop logging of old forests (in that case). Ultimately these activists moved into stopping development or use of other natural resources like coal, oil, and oil sands.Both Stainsbury and Dewar observed the curious association of some major corporations to these ‘grassroots green groups’ and how, in some cases, certain governmental officials appeared to encourage (or refrain from limiting) these activities which ultimately put many people out of work and drove off investors.Where once the definition of a charity in Canada relied upon service and net benefit to the local community, primarily operated by volunteers engaged in tangible, practical tasks such as “…the Halifax food bank, providing X number of food hampers to X numbers of Haligonians per year”, Canada’s ENGO ‘charitable’ sector now engage in court-battles to block pipelines, the denigration ofpolitical figures, joint efforts by 30-50 ENGO organizations to push through ‘green’ budget demands through coordinated efforts and vigorous point-and-click email campaigns, and the denigration and blocking of Albertan and Canadian resource and infrastructure development, in particular, the Tar Sands Campaign.

Lyman’s bio can be read here. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe government of Canada’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions includes efforts to reduce emissions from 1,600 emissions-intensive facilities across Canada. Many are in small cities and towns in rural Canada. The purpose of this paper is to describe how current federal policies may affect those plants, with special focus on three eastern Canadian rural communities.Climate policy relentless ravages rural Canada, west to east.CLIMATE-POLICY-AND-RURAL-CANADA-Final-Dec-15-2019DownloadThis Canadian carbon dioxide pricing system operates differently across the country. Under the Canadian government’s “backstop” regime, which applies in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, there are two key elements:• A carbon dioxide tax, or levy, applied to emissions resulting from consumption of fossil fuels; and• An output-based pricing system for industrial facilities that emit above a certain threshold, with an opt-in capability for smaller facilities with emissions below the threshold. The output-based pricing regime imposes emissions restrictions on industrial facilities that emit 50 kilotonnes (kt) or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Large emitters only pay the levy on their emissions above a threshold. The government claims that this complex system will provide an important incentive to reduce emissions. In fact, the effect of the system will vary significantly among industries and among the facilities in a given sector. The marginal cost of the carbon charge imposed on a firm will be determined by the emissions-intensity of its facilities, by their performance compared to other firms in the same industry, and of course by the rate of the carbon tax. The firms with the highest marginal emissions will face the highest competitiveness risks. It is not possible to know in advance which firms will face the highest charges, as the emissions-intensity standards have not been set and data is not publicly available about the marginal emissions production or costs of the many covered firms. The Quebec emissions trading system will have similar effects.I selected three facilities that play a large role in the economies of the communities in which they operate and are in industries highly vulnerable to international competition. The three are the Iron Ore Company of Canada Carol Project in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador; the Graymont New Brunswick Inc. plant in Havelock, New Brunswick; and the Alouminerie Alouette aluminum plant at Sept-Iles, Quebec.Labrador City has a population of just under 10,000 people and neighbouring Wabush has another 2,000. The city is located in a fairly remote area on the Labrador/Quebec border. The iron ore plant is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the province, with annual emissions of 992,666 tonnes in 2017. It is by far the largest employer in the region. If the plant were to close, it would probably make the associated railway system uneconomic and thus force it to close as well. There are no other significant resource development or employment opportunities in the immediate region, so closing the plant would largely turn Labrador City and Wabush into ghost towns. Graymont Ltd. is the third largest lime-producing company in North America. It is the leading supplier of lime and limestone products throughout the Maritime provinces and the State of Maine. Havelock is a rural village in central New Brunswick, 45 km west of Moncton, with a population less than 50. The Graymont plant produced 76,403 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017. The closing of the Graymont plant would not have major direct employment effects, but it would have a large impact on the other firms in Atlantic Canada that rely upon the plant for limestone supplies, requiring them to seek alternative supplies at higher costs from more distance sources.Alouminerie Alouette is an aluminum manufacturing company based in Sept-Iles. It is the largest primary aluminum smelter in the Americas. The company generates about $440 million per year into the provincial economy. Sept-Iles is a city with a population of about 26,000.In 2017. Alouminerie Alouette was the third largest emitter of GHGs in Quebec, with total emissions of 1,156,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017. If this plant closed, it would deal a sharp blow to the income and employment of eastern Quebec, a region with few other large investment prospects. The three plants all sell their products in domestic and export markets in competition with others, mainly in the United States. The competing plants in the U.S. and other countries, for the most part, will not incur similar carbon dioxide taxation expenses, as the governments do not plan to impose regimes similar to the Canadian one. Consequently, for competitive reasons, the Canadian plants will not be able to raise their prices to recover the higher taxation costs In October 2019, the Conference Board of Canada published a report entitled Tipping the Scales, an analysis of the effects of Canada’s current carbon dioxide taxation regime on the competitiveness of Canadian industries and of the potential for “carbon leakage” affecting emissions-intensive industries. The Conference Board found that, even at the tax rates that will apply in the period to 2022, the incremental costs have the potential to displace about $10 billion of Canada’s GDP and reduce employment by 48,400 jobs among the emissions-intensive industries and their suppliers. This will have disproportionate impacts in the Prairies and Atlantic Canada.There is a bitter irony here. Much of the opposition to the globalization of trade in Canada and other western countries has been due to the adverse effects of increased imports on our industries and the people they employ. Yet, many of the same groups that most criticize the effects of economic globalization strongly support the consequences of Canada pursuing global climate objectives through policies that will place our remaining industries at risk. Economic destruction awaits.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/12/15/a-conversation-with-susan-j-crockford-for-association-des-climato-realistes/,,A conversation with Susan J. Crockford—for Association des climato-réalistes," Contributed by Grégoire Canlorbe @2019Dr. Crockford’s blog: https://polarbearscience.com/about-2/ Susan Janet Crockford is a Canadian zoologist, author, and blogger specializing in Holocene mammals. From 2004 to 2019 she was an adjunct professor in Anthropology at the University of Victoria. She is best known for her blog posts on polar bear biology, which oppose the scientific consensus that polar bears are threatened by ongoing climate change. In October 2019 she was interviewed by Grégoire Canlorbe—on behalf of the Association des climato-réalistes, the only climate-realist organization in France.Susan J. Crockford: I live in Victoria, British Columbia, and I specialize in animals from the late Pleistocene, so probably the last fifteen to twenty thousand years. I have a contract company called Pacific Identifications Inc. We identify animal bones from archaeological projects and also from biological research: stomach contents, fecal samples, that kind of thing. That’s primarily how I get my income. And then, I am also a former adjunct professor at the university—I had held that position since 2004 but in 2019, it was not renewed. My primary interest—my overall interest—is evolution. That, for me, really informs everything. It’s the big picture. Evolution is the big idea that drives all my interest. For example, the interesting thing is that a deer bone from 8000 years ago looks like one living today, and so, there is continuity. But there are also distinctions—when you get species differences, those are apparent. I became interested in polar bears when I was working on the topic leading up to my PhD dissertation. I was looking at the speciation process that turns a wolf into a dog (what we also call domestication). While trying to unravel what biological process drives that transformation, the wild species that I looked at to compare it to was the brown bear to polar bear transformation. So, I’ve been looking at the literature on polar bears (their life history, their ecology, and the geological history of sea ice) since the 1990s. I’ve been investigating polar bears for quite a while.Grégoire Canlorbe: Your most decisive feat of arms in evolutionary biology may be your claim that thyroid rhythms alone are responsible for all significant differences in life history traits. Could you remind us of the outlines of your approach?Susan J. Crockford: I don’t actually claim that thyroid rhythms alone drive evolution, although I suspect it may be the dominant driver in many cases. What really drives evolution is individual variation. So, within a species, animals are all different in some critical ways. And the primary hypothesis that most biologists go by is that those individual differences are primarily genetic: that genes are what controls those critical differences, and, therefore, genes, or genetic change, is what drives speciation change in evolution. But my concept looks at the idea that because thyroid hormone is so important for so many different but inter-related biological processes—like fetal development, brain development, growth, behavior—those individual differences within a species also include thyroid hormone metabolism. All hormones are produced in a rhythmic fashion: they are released in pulses that differ in strength and frequency over the course of a day. It’s similar to a song for a particular bird species. They sing virtually the same song within a species, but if you look at that species’ song closely you find that each individual bird sings slightly differently. So, the hypothesis is that an individual within a species has an individual thyroid hormone rhythm that’s unique to that individual but overall typical for its species, and that this unique thyroid hormone rhythm strongly affects its behavior, particularly in growth and response to stress. A speciation event (one species transforming into another) often involves the colonization of a new habitat, a new ecological niche. When that happens, I propose that only animals with a particular stress response (governed by its unique thyroid hormone rhythm) choose to occupy that niche. So, if we’re talking about a polar bear transforming from a brown bear ancestor, I suggest that a few brown bears decided at some point during a major glacial period that life would be better for them if they moved out onto the sea ice where seals lived and gave birth to pups. They learned how to hunt seals, but only the individual animals who were extraordinarily curious and not fearful of the new habitat moved onto the sea ice. And when they started to interbreed amongst themselves on the ice, they quickly created a new subpopulation that was physiologically different from the others that stayed on land. Over time, within just a few generations, that would have created a new set of physiological differences within those ice-living bears that made them different from the original population. It’s a bit complicated to explain, but one of the things that thyroid hormone does is affect how genes function. So, what I’m proposing is that rather than only genetic changes and genes themselves driving evolution, that you can also have changes in these hormone rhythms that control how genes function. And that provides a mechanism for how evolution can proceed quickly, especially in response to changing climatic conditions. My book on this topic is called Rhythms of Life: Thyroid Hormone and the Origin of Species.Susan J. Crockford with Grégoire Canlorbe — Paris, October 2019Grégoire Canlorbe: As a well-known debunker of the spread of disinformation on polar bears, what are the main objective facts of which you would like to remind us? How do you explain this religious cult surrounding the theory of an anthropogenic global warming with catastrophic consequences for the planet?Susan J. Crockford: Around the year 2000, it seemed that the polar bear was elevated to a position as icon of global warming because the Arctic amplification effect proposed that the Arctic and the Antarctic would actually warm much faster than the rest of the world. And as a consequence, it was proposed that polar bears would be affected first and more strongly than any other animal. And it was proposed that polar bears would then be the canary in the coalmine for global warming, and that the inevitable catastrophe that would affect polar bears would eventually happen to us. And a few years after that, the biologists who were working on polar bears sort of took up that idea and formally proposed that it was very likely the polar bear populations would decline dramatically if the sea ice in summer declined dramatically. And when the summer ice dropped suddenly in 2007, it became more and more of a hysterical response. It is true that we’ve fallen into a trap, looking at some of these things in a very confined way to the extent that it begins to look like religious thinking, rather than scientific thinking. I think what was disturbing and unscientific was a desire to have a statement about consensus. And I saw this myself in evolutionary thinking because what happened at the time was that there were creationists who were fighting very hard, especially in the US, against evolutionary biologists. And so, to counter that difficulty, their strategy was to create a consensus statement: something like ‘this is what we believe about how evolution works’. And I felt at the time that was very wrong but shortly afterwards, the same thing happened with global warming: rather than deal with the legitimate questions and concerns that some scientists were raising, what they did to protect themselves was issue a consensus statement. And so, the consensus statement is what makes this look like religion. Science should thrive on challenges such as these, not hide from them.Grégoire Canlorbe: It has been hypothesized that the alleged decrease in the extent of pack ice, far from being detrimental to polar bears, is actually allowing for a warmer ocean—and therefore a more hospitable ecosystem for polar bears. Did your researches lead you to endorse that view?Susan J. Crockford: Yes, to a degree that’s true, especially for summer ice. What was proposed around 2005-2006 was that when summer sea ice declined, polar bear numbers would decline. That the bears required ice in summer in order for them to find food. And they then proposed that if it got to be so there was no ice in summer, the bears would be nearly extinct. However, I was immediately suspicious of that prediction because we know that the bears survived at least two or three warm interglacial periods that were warmer than today and that had little to no ice in the summer. We don’t know exactly how the bears responded to those conditions—whether the population may have declined by half or not—but enough survived to be an abundant species in the Arctic 200 years ago. But what has happened is that the ice declined in 2007 to a level that the sea ice experts said would not happen until 2050. So, the ice declined several decades before it was expected and has stayed down at that level ever since (with some wide swings year to year). Biologists have continued to collect data in the field, studying bears, and what they’ve discovered is that, in some areas, the bears are in better shape with less ice in summer than they were with more ice in summer. And they’re finding that the seals which the bears eat—ringed and bearded seals—actually do much better with less ice in summer because that’s when they do most of their feeding. Also when they’ve been doing surveys to count the bears in areas that either have had no counts before, or have only one that was done long ago, they’ve discovered that instead of declining in number, they have either remained stable or increased in abundance. So, the long and short of it is that the prediction that the bear numbers would decline by two thirds failed. Not only did the bears not decline, but the global population number rose by at least 16 percent, perhaps more. What I have done is look at the literature, and summarized the data to draw this conclusion. It means that polar bears have flexible strategies for dealing with less summer ice, which is what you would expect from a species that has survived previous warm periods.Polar bear — Zoo de la Flèche Grégoire Canlorbe: It seems that the colder winters encountered in Europe and Asia (with respect to those existing in Africa) have led natural selection to play in favor of high intelligence—and high K strategy—in Europeans and a fortiori East-Asians. Is such hypothesis plausible also in the case of polar bears and other artic species?Susan J. Crockford: This K selection theory is one of the hypotheses that has gotten polar bear biologists into trouble because it’s a notion that was proposed in the 50s and 60s that most modern biologists have dismissed as not being helpful. What it says is that the Arctic environment should be stable all the time. But what we actually know from geological and recent history is that it’s not stable: ice extent and thickness goes up and down in cyclical fashion. In fact, both the bears and the seals they depend on for food are actually adapted to a very dynamic, ever-changing system rather than a stable system. I think that this is really the critical driving force for their evolution: they need to be adaptable and flexible in the short term and the long term. Flexibility is what allows them to survive in the Arctic. I don’t think that really answers your question, but I really do think that what goes on in the Arctic is the opposite of K selection theory. The Arctic isn’t stable, it’s dynamic.Grégoire Canlorbe: You have studied at length the domestication and speciation processes. How do you sum up the evolutionary pressures which led the polar bear to emerge as a wild species, while dogs were designed as domestic animals? Do you think that those lovely companions have a soul like humans allegedly do?Susan J. Crockford: The domestication and speciation processes, I think, are essentially one and the same. We’re encouraged to think of domestication as something that humans did actively, that they actively participated in creating a new species that’s a dog, or a pig, or whatever. But my theory proposes that, in fact, what humans did was create a new habitat. The first human villages were habitats that hadn’t existed before, and that attracted some wolves to it that, then, ended up becoming dogs. But actually, humans probably couldn’t have stopped this from happening, even if they’d wanted to. In other words, the transformation of some wolves to dogs was a natural response from the animal community to the humans creating this new habitat. And so, then, when you look at brown bears to polar bears, it becomes the same system: some individuals from the brown bear species invading a new habitat for them, which was the sea ice habitat. And then, they emerged as a new species. There are other parallels. For example, brown bears and polar bears can breed together, the same as dogs and wolves can. Genetically, they’re very close. And also, in terms of behavior between the two, polar bears are less dominant than brown bears. So, if brown bears and polar bears come together in the wild—there are a few places where this can happen, such as the north slope of Alaska at one of the piles of whale bones that have been left behind by hunters—when this happens you see that small grizzly bear (aka brown bear) females chase away big male polar bears. Her behavior is much more ferocious, and the big male is afraid of her. The same with a wolf and a dog. A wolf’s behavior is much more aggressive than a dog’s so a small female wolf easily intimidates a big male dog. Now, you wanted to know about dogs having a soul comparable to humans. And I think that’s something people have imagined because they would like it to be true. Dogs have had to adapt their social structure in order to fit in with human life and some of what we see is part of that adaptation. And that, over the last 200 years, that’s become increasingly the case. For example, urban dogs are much more dependent on people than they ever were, say, 100 years ago. Modern urban dogs are much more dependent on people than modern dogs that live on farms. In short, I don’t think that dogs have a soul. I don’t even think people have a soul.French TV show Bonne nuit les petits [Good night children]Dr. Crockford was special guest speaker at Friends of Science Society’s “Polar Bears and Solar Flares” event in 2017.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/12/05/the-next-waves/,,The Next Waves," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019. Lyman’s bio can be read here.The figures in this paper are drawn from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019, and relate to the emissions, in carbon dioxide equivalent, from the combustion of energy. These are about 80% of greenhouse gas emissions.The prevailing fiction about climate change in Canada and much of the world is that people must make major changes in their use of energy in order to join a global movement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One of the reasons why it is a fiction is that global greenhouse gas emissions are, in fact, increasing, just as they have been for most of the last 29 years since claims of human-caused global warming first gained public attention.The last decade, from 2008 to 2018, has witnessed a 12 per cent growth in global emissions, according to the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 2019. This occurred in spite of the worst and most prolonged economic recession since the Great Depression. During the last year, 2017-2018, emissions grew two per cent, twice their annual average rate over the previous decade. Wikipedia Somewhat obscured by these global averages is that the growth in emissions has been driven by a large wave of growth in China’s economy. That growth was so significant, and China’s reliance on fossil fuels for energy so important, that China’s emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent grew from 7.4 billion tonnes in 2008 to 9.4 billion tonnes in 2018, by far the highest in the world. China’s emissions growth alone accounted for almost 58% of the world’s emissions growth over the decade. That was the first wave of a large series of increases in emissions by the developing countries as they seek to increase their economic growth and living standards so as to move closer to the standards enjoyed by the wealthier countries. China’s wave is far from finished. In fact, by 2030 China’s emissions will probably be over three times those of the United States, the second largest emitter.Somewhat less obvious from the statistics, however, is that we are soon likely to see three more waves of emissions increases that will shape the future.The next wave will be the ever-increasing emissions growth in India. India is already the fourth largest emitter in the world. Its emissions grew from 1,467 million tonnes in 2008 to 2,479 million tonnes in 2018, an amazing 69 per cent. Despite government commitments to reduce its emissions intensity and to increase the share of renewable energy in its electricity generation, India’s fast-growing use of coal-fired power plants and its efforts to grow its economy in every way will continue the emissions growth. This is largely driven by population growth. By 2028, India’s population will reach 1.5 billion and exceed that of China.There are two more waves coming right behind India. The first wave is the growth of emissions from the countries of south and southeast Asia.Table 1 shows the present and projected growth of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from these countries, under the assumption that their emissions growth from 2018 to 2030 is at the same rate as their growth over the last decade.Table 1 Emissions from Selected Countries in South and Southeast Asia

The western public generally thinks of the Middle East as a desert area with high oil and natural gas production and low population. Instead, the population there is one of the fastest growing in the world. Table 2 shows the present and projected growth in emissions from the five largest emitters there, using the same assumptions as in Table 1.Table 2    Emissions from Selected Countries in the Middle East

In its International Energy Outlook, the EIA projected that in the period to 2050, world energy consumption will rise nearly 50% and carbon dioxide emissions will grow from 2018 levels to about 43 billion tonnes per year by 2050, with almost all the growth occurring in the non-OECD (i.e. developing) countries.In short, there is overwhelming evidence that global emissions are increasing and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This is the context in which Canadians should view calls for costly emissions reductions here.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'GHG reduction targets']",2019/12/05
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/12/05/gravity-creator-of-climates/,Dr. Derek McBride ,"Gravity, Creator of Climates"," Contributed by Albert Jacobs © 2019It is said that Gravity is the primal force of the universe and that the rest are only derivatives thereof. That is now becoming clear to many involved in the Climate issue. UNEP may have had its own reasons for engaging the atmospheric meteorological expertise of the WMO as a partner in the UNFCCC: such expertise is useful for the study of short term atmospheric processes, i.e. “weather”, but is inadequate for the study of ”climate” which depends heavily on influences from within the solar system, both in astronomical space and geologic time. Gravitational forces of planetary orbits and the varying radiative and particle emissions from the sun influence atmosphere and oceans and are not part of the computerised scenario simulations of the IPCC.  Its objective had nothing to do with “solving” a scientific problem, but to support a base for a social-economic world turn-around.Jose (1965) got the solar-system ball rolling with the identification of the periodic behavioural changes of the sun’s movements around the system’s barycentre. This was followed through by others, in recent times by Ivanka Charvatova and Nicola Scafetta. Charvatova mapped the whirling solar pattern in a number of articles, starting in the beginning of this century in which the strict periodicity of the “ordered” course of the such solar movements contrasts with its non-restrained revolutions. The “ordered” periods are related to the Jupiter / Saturn orbits (and possibly some of the other heavier outer planets) and the disordered ones are not. What is important is that the starting points of the orderly inertial solar movement phase (SIM) are 178.7 years apart and that the chaotic ones correspond to solar / terrestrial phenomena of 14C, 10B and 18O for the phases of the Little Ice Age and for thousands of years back.At the same time, Kees de Jager and Silvia Duhau published their papers on the solar radiation phase changes (aam / Rmax) that show the same 178.7 year pattern. The relationship seems obvious: The long-term orbits of the large planets influence the behaviour of the sun and that of the solar dynamo. This is reflected in the amount and type of radiation as well as particle emissions from the sun into our atmosphere, and – importantly – as the formation of condensation initiators and amount of cloud cover.

The 25th “Conference of the Parties” COP25, which will take place in Madrid in early December, offers a new opportunity to confirm this observation.The mushroom of the day has been written by the United Nations Environment Program. In the 2019 edition of their “Emission Gap” report, they look at the difference between actual emissions of satanic gases (CO2 and a few others) and emissions that were expected at some preceding circus, also comparing with the so-called virtuous trajectory that we should follow to “stay under the +2 °C limit”.This new report has a great merit: it provides a conclusive proof that energy transitions, carbon taxes, emission quotas and other fashionable constraints have no effect whatsoever, since global emissions are still on the rise. They increased by 1.5% per year on average over the last decade and show no sign of a downturn.Laurent Fabius’ cocardier triumphalism in the end of the glorious COP21 in 2015 in Paris, where humanity was to meet the path of redemption, is over.There is no getting away from these facts. We can feel ashamed, organize whingeing protests, give up our cars, convert to veganism, but nothing will do: developing countries want to have the same standard of living as ours. Go figure. That’s why they increase their energy consumption (especially China) and, therefore, their CO2 emissions. The pace is so fast that nothing will reverse the trend in the medium run, even if you keep up your good resolution to turn off the tap while brushing your teeth.In a world ruled by grownups, such crystal-clear facts would easily lead to a logical conclusion: since, despite all UN processions, we are not in a position to reduce global emissions, we must address the question differently.Obviously, the best would be to acknowledge that the climate we experience at now is not worse than the climate of past centuries; that the global warming is of a rather weak order of magnitude and provides at least as many advantages as disadvantages; that nothing indicates that the extreme events are more powerful or more numerous than those of the past (unlike the smartphones we have, that allow us to spread in real time more and more videos of these events on social networks); or that carbon dioxide is the primary food of plants and, as such, is a blessing for the biosphere. (According to NASA’s satellites, CO2 was the main driver of the 18 million square kilometers greening of the planet observed over the past 35 years.)Without going as far as to accept these obvious but politically incorrect facts, a sensible people could nevertheless consider that if we can’t act on a cause, then we must act on what might be the consequences. In short: opening the umbrella instead of dancing to stop the rain.Of course, this is not what is proposed in the 2019 report on emissions gap, by far. As if nothing had happened, this report echoes the most unrealistic recommendations to reverse the trend. In its carbo-centered fantasies, the rise in emissions suddenly stops next year, before the world commits to a resolute decline. The scenario is more or less equivalent to the idea that a car running at full speed on the highway can, “if its driver is trying hard,” take a right-angle turn without too much damage.We may wonder if the authors really believe what they say or if, in fact, the report has been written by an unconscious robot, unaware of the aberrations made up by its limited vision resulting of some narrow-minded algorithms implemented in it which force it to carry out its absurd and useless task.Anyway, no doubt that many right-thinking voices will use this report as an argument to ask for more self-flagellation to avoid punishment imposed by the climate bogeyman. May the few grownups who will pass by there try to reassure these voices of this small world. By the way, considering the huge costs of the measures they suggest, it is high time to think about blowing the whistle to end the game.Benoit Rittaud’s blog: https://mythesmanciesetmathematiques.wordpress.com/2019/11/27/climat-y-a-t-il-un-adulte-a-lonu/ Association des Climatos-Réalistes https://www.climato-realistes.fr/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['COP25'],2019/12/05

The list of speakers included people from across Canada, providing insights and opinions on confederation, Alberta’s WEXIT movement, and Canada’s economy.Our Communications Manager, Michelle Stirling, gave a presentation based on the work of Robert Lyman and highlights from his four reports on the economic, political and lobbying power of Canada’s ‘green’ environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs), most of which are federally registered charities, and many of which have been implicated in the Tar Sands Campaign.Michelle sees this as a Green Trade War against Canada, and alluded to The Art of War, in which Sun Tzu wrote: “To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence is breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting. Based on the research I will present, in my opinion, Canada’s resistance is being broken in the cruelest way – through the use and abuse of our good will and charitable hearts. A pivotal point is…the Tar Sands Campaign.“Foreign-Fingers-in-the-Pie-4a-FinalDownloadTo read all of the reports referred to in the presentation, go to this link.For more on the Tar Sands Campaign, visit this site.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Canadian charities', 'tanker ban', 'Tar Sands Campaign', 'TMX']",2019/11/23

His full bio is here.A common Canadian response when asked whether there is a global climate problem is to declare that “we should do our part” to solve it. While typically generous-spirited, the attitude is dangerously naïve and uninformed. This paper explains why. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Doing-Our-Share-4-A-FINAL.pdfThere is now ample and broadly published evidence that the scientific claims of those who say humans are causing catastrophic global warming are wrong.Doing-Our-Share-4-A-FINALDownload The sensitivity of the global climate to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide is far less than assumed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The actual movement of average global temperatures over centuries, but especially over the last twenty years, bears no relationship to what the IPCC models predicted.The most widely-publicized claims about future adverse climate effects are all being proved wrong (e.g. sea levels are rising at 8 inches per century; polar bear populations are thriving).There have been no increases in extreme weather events, (e.g. hurricanes, floods and droughts) over the last century. These points are well documented in thousands of peer-reviewed articles and in the publications of the Non-Governmental International Panel on Climate Change.If Canadians were to “do their share” in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, what would that be a share of? In other words, what is the rest of the world doing? In fact, over the last 25 years, global CO2 emissions from energy consumption grew by 40 per cent, and they continue to rise every year. Over the last decade, 165 of the 195 countries of the world increased their emissions. This is especially true in the developing countries of Asia and the Middle East. Nine of the ten largest country emitters are not on track to meet even the relatively modest emission reduction commitments they made at the United Nations COP21 conference in 2015. China and India alone are on a track to increase their emissions to perhaps 20 billion tonnes per year in 2030. The poorer countries of the world are determined to increase their economic development and standards of living. To do this they need to gain access to the secure and plentiful energy services provided by fossil fuels that we in the more developed countries take for granted. They will not be deprived of this right because of the concerns of some about carbon dioxide emissions.The costs to Canada of present policies and programs to reduce emissions are already high, especially in terms of increased electricity rates in provinces that are forcing the introduction of high cost wind and solar energy generation and in Alberta and Saskatchewan where radicals have successfully blocked the construction of additional oil pipelines needed to deliver Canadian oil to export markets. The costs in terms of lost revenues, unemployment, and foregone investment are in the tens of billions of dollars per year.These costs will only rise far higher if, as now planned, carbon dioxide taxes continue to rise, and governments continue to increase the over 600 programs and regulations already in place to reduce emissions and halt development. This will affect every sector of the economy, not just oil and gas, but also mining, steel, petrochemicals, metal fabrication, auto and parts manufacturing and other emissions-intensive industries, as well as transportation, residential housing, and agriculture. Yet, Canada’s emissions are just 1.6% of the world’s total.One has to ask why Canadians think they bear responsibility to solve the world’s problems, when we lack the means to do so and the world does not want our “help” anyway. Why do so many share this tragic delusion? Canada’s current emissions policies and targets will inevitably impose immense costs on Canada’s economy and business, with negligible, if any, benefits in terms of changing global emissions. In short, the costs of present and future climate policies are extremely high, and the benefits are virtually nil.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'changement climatique', 'climate change']",2019/11/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/11/23/bushfire-sense/,,Bushfire Sense," Contributed by Viv Forbes @ 2019Australia is a land of deserts, droughts, floods, bushfires, flammable forests and fire-prone grasslands – these conditions have developed since the start of the Holocene Warm Era about twelve thousand years ago.All previous Australian bushies, both black and white, have recognised the key principle of fire management in Australia – you can have many small managed “cool” fires in early spring or a few unplanned disastrous “hot” fires consuming a heavy fuel load in hot dry winds in late spring. (Arsonists have other priorities and light their fires at these most dangerous times.)Every generation of Australians sees its fire disasters and the worst ones get names – “Black Thursday” in 1851, “Black Friday” in 1939, “Ash Wednesday” in 1983, and the worst to date “Black Saturday” in 2009. Not even an armada of expensive water bombers will stop these bushfires – at that stage fire can only be prevented or contained by fire.Good fire management disappeared as rural voters were outvoted by the green leafy suburbs. Urban greens thought we could prevent all fires and encourage wildlife by locking up more parks and encouraging fire-loving, oil-containing eucalypts and flammable weeds close to towns and dwellings. (Many native plants require fire to burst open their rock-hard seed pods.) Graham Lloyd of the Australian notes that even the Hippies of Nimbin blame greens for “the incendiary state of the Australian bush”.If this image is missing it can be downloaded from: https://saltbushclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/green-fires.jpgEven more stupid are those who think politicians can control or abolish droughts and bushfires by banning the use of coal and oil in a futile attempt to lower global temperature. The sun, the oceans and recurring El Nino droughts will dwarf all efforts of puny politicians.We need good fire and forest management and prosecution of arsonists, not costly climate distractions.Viv Forbes Some Reading:Journalism’s Ashes: https://quadrant.org.au/journalism-amid-the-ashes/Fire and folly: https://quadrant.org.au/fire-and-folly/Bushfire policy:http://carbon-sense.com/index.php?s=bushfire&Submit=Gohttps://saltbushclub.com/category/bushfires/“We saw either smoke by day or fires by night.”James Cook as he sailed past eastern Australia in 1770.“In the whole country (Australia) I scarcely saw a place without the mark of a fire.”Charles Darwin 1836.California Wildfires: https://saltbushclub.com/2019/11/14/california-wildfires/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Australia', 'bushfire']",2019/11/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/11/18/climate-policys-next-industrial-targets/,parkergallantenergyperspectivesblog ,Climate Policy’s Next Industrial Targets," Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here. Introduction The purpose of this article is to explore the possible next steps in the efforts by governments to reduce emissions in the emissions-intensive sectors of the Canadian economy. Much of the media and public attention recently has focused on the oil and gas sector. In 2017, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from oil and gas production were 195 million tonnes, making this the largest single source, at 27 % of the total. Most of these occurred in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Oil and gas, however, is only one of the emissions-intensive industrial sectors, the rest of which are spread across Canada.  Canadian Climate Policy and Targets The present Canadian government climate policy target is to reduce emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. This would reduce them from 716 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2017 to 512 million tonnes in 2030, a reduction of 204 million tonnes. The New Democratic Party, the Green Party and many environmental groups are urging the Liberal government to adopt a more stringent emissions reduction target, such as a 45 per cent reduction (i.e. to 401 million tonnes) or even lower by 2030. So, in theory, one could completely eliminate all emissions from oil and gas production, and that alone would not attain the current 2030 target. It would go nowhere near meeting the proposed 45%-by-2030 target.What if the government were to augment its emissions reductions effort by also addressing the other energy intensive industries in Canada? What would that mean for the other provinces and especially for the central provinces of Ontario and Quebec? A Profile of Canada’s Energy-Intensive Industry We can gain insights into this by using the data collected by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in its GHG Reporting Program. Under this program, all large emitting facilities (i.e. those emitting more than 10,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year) in Canada must report annually. In 2017, 1,622 facilities reported to this program; these facilities accounted for 290 million tonnes, or 41%, of Canada’s emissions. I used the ECCC data to compile lists of the largest industrial facility emitters in Ontario and Quebec, the ones that could offer the largest contribution to the attainment of the government’s climate policy goals. The lists are set out in the annexes to this paper. Table 1 (Annex 1) indicates the company, facility location, and 2017 emissions of large emitters in Ontario, and Table 2 (Annex 2) does the same for Quebec.In 2017, mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction accounted for 36% of the emissions reported by emissions-intensive facilities; utilities 30%; and manufacturing, 29%. 187 Mt, or 64% of these emissions, originated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Forty-three Mt (15%) originated in Ontario and 23 Mt (8 %) originated in Quebec. A review of the list of facilities in Ontario indicates that, while the facilities are diverse in size and located in several different industries, there are five industries that dominate: steel making (Dofasco and Stelco in Hamilton), petroleum refining (Sarnia area and Nanticoke), petrochemicals (Sarnia area mainly), cement manufacturing (Bowmanville, Bath and Woodstock) and mines and metals processing (in many places). A review of the list of facilities in the province of Quebec indicates that, while the largest emitters are the oil refineries in Montreal and Levis, there are many other facilities spread across the province in the aluminum, mining, cement and other industries. It is also striking how many of these facilities are in relatively small centres in rural Quebec (e.g. Baie-Comeau, Saguenay, Jonquiere, Alma, Saint-Constant, etc.). The closing of these facilities due to loss of competitiveness would have large effects on jobs in the small communities, as often the plant is the largest employer. This, of course, is a phenomenon sadly well known in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The ”Opportunity” and the Risks If the federal and provincial governments are to take advantage of the “opportunity” to reduce emissions from these plants, they will face some difficult questions as to how to do so. Their most likely approach would be to continue to raise carbon dioxide taxes to and beyond the levels that are now planned (i.e. $50 per tonne in 2022). If the federal government is to reach its 2030 target, this seems inevitable. If it adopts even more demanding targets for reductions in energy use, the level of taxes must be high enough to force facilities to cut back emissions or to close. The Conference Board of Canada recently published a report entitled Tipping the Scales. The report examined the likely effects of Canada’s current carbon dioxide pricing system on emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries (EITEIs). In other words, EITEIs are a subset of the emissions-intensive facilities on which ECCC collects emissions data, but with a special focus on the trade effects from two perspectives: first, whether the added taxes would increase costs so as to disadvantage Canadian firms in domestic and export markets; and second, whether the results of firms’ moving their operations outside of Canada in response to these pressures would to increase emissions more than would have occurred had the firms continued their operations in Canada. The Conference Board report can be found here:https://www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library/abstract.aspx?did=10485In the terminology of climate policy, the Conference Board report raised the question of “carbon leakage”. As defined by the report, “Carbon leakage is what happens when an economy-wide pricing policy meets on-the-ground business competition. It occurs when firms faced with incremental compliance costs transfer some of their activities to jurisdictions with less stringent policies. And they take the associated GHG emissions with them.Emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries are the most exposed to carbon leakage risks. They rely on fossil fuels as production inputs and have limited room to pass on incremental costs to their end users.”Compliance costs vary considerably across Canada because of the balkanized nature of the Canadian carbon dioxide pricing regime. For a detailed description of the regime, see my report published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation.https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/06/Lyman-carbontax.pdfHowever, the difference in compliance costs across Canada pale in comparison with the differences between compliance costs in Canada and in our principal trading partners. Of our three most important trading partners, accounting for 56 % of Canadian trade, the United States has no federal carbon dioxide pricing regime, Mexico’s carbon dioxide tax is about $3.00 per tonne and China’s regional government carbon dioxide taxes are about $2.00 per tonne. That compares to the current carbon dioxide charge under the Canadian federal government “backstop” regime of $20 per tonne in 2019, which will rise to $50 per tonne in 2022. In addition, the Canadian regime covers about 80% of our total emissions and 86% of the emissions of the EITEI firms, while the carbon dioxide pricing regimes among Canada’s 18 largest trading partners cover only 16% of the peer companies’ emissions. The Conference Board concluded that:• “The competitive pressures from carbon pricing are significant for the majority of Canada’s EITEIs;• The magnitude of potential leakages is large; the risks of leakage are high;• The potential magnitude of carbon leakage from non-energy EITEs is greatest for non-ferrous metals manufacturing and chemicals; it is lower for non-energy mining, wood products manufacturing, and iron and steel manufacturing;• Across Canada’s oil and gas industry, the emissions intensity of producing different outputs – natural gas, conventional crude oil, or oil sands crudes, varies significantly; therefore, the potential magnitude of carbon leakage for Canada’s oil and gas industry varies considerably by product.”The Conference Board study did not attempt to analyze the effect on Canadian firms of the over 600 regulations, programs, special measures and taxes not related to the carbon dioxide pricing regime. It also did not assess the negative effects of government policies actively to discourage investment in the Canadian hydrocarbons industry. The review of the carbon dioxide pricing regime alone was sufficient for the Conference Board to conclude that Canadian emissions-intensive firms are at serious competitive risk. It left largely unanswered the more difficult question of how much that is likely to shift emissions outside of Canada rather than reducing them.  Conclusion If federal and provincial governments implement more stringent and intrusive measures to reduce emissions from the industrial sector, it is unlikely that any emissions-intensive industry or region will be exempt or will be able to escape the adverse effects on their profitability and competitiveness, and ultimately their viability. Those in Ontario and Quebec who observe dispassionately the economic stresses climate policies now impose on western Canada should take note.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/11/12/analysis-of-climate-feedback-response-to-500-scientists-declaration-to-un-there-is-no-climate-emergency/,Andy Stanforth ,Analysis of Climate Feedback Response to 500 Scientists’ Declaration to UN “There is No Climate Emergency”," The overall scientific credibility of the Climate Feedback critique is extremely low.  The CLINTEL European Climate Declaration – “There is No Climate Emergency” is a plain language statement of views for the UN and the general public to consider.  Climate Feedback attempts to offer a scientific critique of general points rather than simply asking the signatories to provide their evidence to back up the summarized statements. The Poynter Institute for journalists has ‘certified’ Climate Feedback, but most journalists do not even know the name of the complex differential equations integral to climate change. How can they certify who is or is not a climate scientist, an expert or accurate, in a field they know nothing about?  This absurdity is laid out in Prof. Christopher Essex’ memorable essay: “Cavemen, Computers and Climate.”That said, let us critique the Climate Feedback response. Climate Feedback states:Similar letters have sought to establish credibility with large numbers of co-signers in the past, but evidence is what counts in science. (bold added)The signatories agree that evidence is what counts in science.  This is why they have signed this EU Climate Declaration.The Climate Feedback respondents are clearly not up to date with the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scientific findings.  At that time, the IPCC, reported that there had been no statistically significant warming for the 15 years prior (dating back to before Kyoto was ratified) despite a very significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration. Excerpt of Sept. 2013 IPCC WGI AR5 ReportThe (above) graph showing the global temperature anomaly versus the atmospheric CO2 concentration, illustrates a clear divergence between the rising ratio of CO2 concentration and the near flatline trend of temperatures for almost 2 decades.  The temperature spikes indicate El Nino years (a naturally occurring phenomenon).A similar graph above, using 5 datasets, (produced in 2015), shows a similar phenomenon – wide divergence between CO2 concentration and temperature.  This is contrary to the radiative forcing theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming.  While this evidence does not suggest that humans or CO2 from human industry have no effect on earth’s climate, it does show no correlation as theorized, and therefore questionable causation in respect to CO2 driving warming – especially ‘catastrophic’ warming.  Correlation of warming and CO2 rise, as was the case during the 1970’s-mid 1990’s was assumed as evidence of causation; the divergence of temperature and CO2 means no correlation is evidence of lack of causation.  This is a fundamental scientific principle. Dr. Hans von Storch, Lead author of the IPCC WGI (Physical sciences) of AR3, and WGII (Impacts, Adaptation, Vulnerability) of AR5 made public statements about this anomaly, prior to the issuing of the 2013 IPCC report, noting that not a single model forecast this pause. An excerpt from his interview with Der Spiegel:SPIEGEL: Just since the turn of the millennium, humanity has emitted another 400 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, yet temperatures haven’t risen in nearly 15 years. What can explain this?Storch: So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break. We’re facing a puzzle. Recent CO2 emissions have actually risen even more steeply than we feared. As a result, according to most climate models, we should have seen temperatures rise by around 0.25 degrees Celsius (0.45 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 10 years. That hasn’t happened. In fact, the increase over the last 15 years was just 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.11 degrees Fahrenheit) — a value very close to zero. This is a serious scientific problem that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have to confront when it presents its next Assessment Report late next year. (bold and underline added)SPIEGEL: Do the computer models with which physicists simulate the future climate ever show the sort of long standstill in temperature change that we’re observing right now?Storch: Yes, but only extremely rarely. At my institute, we analyzed how often such a 15-year stagnation in global warming occurred in the simulations. The answer was: in under 2 percent of all the times we ran the simulation. In other words, over 98 percent of forecasts show CO2 emissions as high as we have had in recent years leading to more of a temperature increase.Contrary to statements in the Climate Feedback critique, Dr. von Storch states that the models were not suitably predictive, not even close.He goes on to acknowledge that science is a process, subject to new findings all the time.SPIEGEL: What could be wrong with the models?Storch: There are two conceivable explanations — and neither is very pleasant for us. The first possibility is that less global warming is occurring than expected because greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have less of an effect than we have assumed. This wouldn’t mean that there is no man-made greenhouse effect, but simply that our effect on climate events is not as great as we have believed. The other possibility is that, in our simulations, we have underestimated how much the climate fluctuates owing to natural causes. (bold added)SPIEGEL: That sounds quite embarrassing for your profession, if you have to go back and adjust your models to fit with reality…Storch: Why? That’s how the process of scientific discovery works. There is no last word in research, and that includes climate research. It’s never the truth that we offer, but only our best possible approximation of reality. But that often gets forgotten in the way the public perceives and describes our work. (bold added) Note that the interviewer refers to “which physicists simulate the future climate” – yet Climate Feedback critics suggest that anyone who is not a ‘climate scientist’ has nothing to say on the issue of climate.  Climate Feedback authors denigrate the signatories as not being ‘climate scientists’ because many signatories are geophysicists or geologists. Earth sciences is the original home of climate science, dating back three hundred years to James Hutton, father of modern geology. https://www.academicinvest.com/science-careers/environmental-science-careers/how-to-become-a-climatologistGoogle search records reveal that the term ‘climate science’ and ‘climate scientist’ only became unique terminology about 2005. Are we to believe Climate Feedback’s position on ‘who is a climate scientist’ that only scientists qualified in the past 15 years or self-identified as ‘climate scientist’ are the experts? All understanding of earth’s complex climate system rely on the works of hundreds of thousands of earth scientists, atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, volcanologists, astrophysicists, chemists, biologists, and physicists dating back hundreds of years; yes, we stand on the shoulders of giants and the Climate Feedback critics actually mock the work of many of these emeritus professors.Evidence Over IdeologyEU Climate Declaration signatory physicist and Professor Emeritus Francois Gervais has published a paper showing that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation 60-year cycle has more to do with climate change and temperature, than carbon dioxide. Gervais also did a presentation at the Porto Climate Conference in 2018 at the Porto University (Faculdade de Letras, Universidade do Porto)  showing that the ‘consensus’ view has now shifted dramatically – scientists see carbon dioxide as a nominal contributor to global warming and nothing catastrophic.  While the Climate Feedback critics may hold a different scientific view, the proper approach is to invite discussion and open debate.  Clearly there is a disparity between what Climate Feedback critics say, and what the evidence shows.https://youtu.be/wU1PKa0W8Gc English and French versions of this material, videos, transcripts and the peer-reviewed paper are posted for convenience on this blog Climate Feedback Critics Dismiss IPCC Stance on Human InfluenceOne Climate Feedback critic claims that the natural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800’s and human influence prevailed thereafter, while the IPCC states that human influence only stems from 1950, and everything prior was natural.  Likewise, the IPCC only claims that more than 50% of the warming after 1950 was human caused (but not 100%). A review of the graph of the Holocene (above) shows cyclical warming and cooling is the historical norm and that current warming is within the range of previous warm cycles.Timothy Osborn, Professor,University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit:The current period of warming is not because the Little Ice Age ended by 1850. Climate scientists study the causes of warming and cooling period and calculate their effects on our climate. These studies show that natural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800s. The warming from the late 1800s to the present is all due to human-caused climate change, because natural factors have changed little since then and even would have caused a slight cooling over the last 70 years rather than the warming we have observed. (italics added)Osborn confidently states that ‘natural factors have changed little since then’ without any evidence to support his claim.  In fact, natural factors are highly variable, most are not even documented or quantified and some, as noted in the APS document referred to below, are on very long-time scales for which we have no data.https://www.aps.org/policy/statements/upload/climate-seminar-transcript.pdf The foregoing shows that we are ‘far from understanding the climate system.’  Climate Feedback critics claim to be experts on the topic of climate, they claim that the greenhouse effect has been understood for well over a century, citing this about Svante Arrhenius:1896 – SvanteArrhenius publishes first calculation of global warming from human emissions ofCO2: doubling the CO2 in the atmosphere would raiseglobal temp some 5-6°C (9-11°F) In fact, in 1906, Arrhenius published a paper in German in which he drastically amended his view (based on additional scientific insights) and affirmed that warming would top out around 1.5 °C and would be beneficial.  This is effectively what we see today.  Indeed, temperatures have been drastically dropping for the past 3 years, despite a continuing rise in CO2 concentration.  Whether this trend continues or not, we will have to see.  In any event, due to the cyclical nature of climate change, earth’s populations should be prepared for either warming or cooling and implement relevant adaptations where possible.https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/While Climate Feedback critics and Poynter Institute journalists confidently state claims about earth’s temperatures, the experts at NASA GISS are much more circumspect.GISS Surface Temperature AnalysisThe Elusive Absolute Surface AirTemperature (SAT)The GISTEMP analysis concerns only temperature anomalies, not absolute temperature. Temperature anomalies are computed relative to the base period 1951-1980. The reason to work with anomalies, rather than absolute temperature is that absolute temperature varies markedly in short distances, while monthly or annual temperature anomalies are representative of a much larger region. Indeed, we have shown (Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987) that temperature anomalies are strongly correlated out to distances of the order of 1000 km.Q. What exactly do we mean by SAT? A. I doubt that there is a general agreement how to answer this question. Even at the same location, the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 ft above the ground and different again from 10 ft or 50 ft above the ground. Particularly in the presence of vegetation (say in a rain forest), the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation. A reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 ft of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation. To measure SAT we have to agree on what it is and, as far as I know, no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted. Even if the 50 ft standard were adopted, I cannot imagine that a weather station would build a 50 ft stack of thermometers to be able to find the true SAT at its location.Q. What do we mean by daily mean SAT? A. Again, there is no universally accepted correct answer. Should we note the temperature every 6 hours and report the mean, should we do it every 2 hours, hourly, have a machine record it every second, or simply take the average of the highest and lowest temperature of the day? On some days the various methods may lead to drastically different results.Q. What SAT do the local media report? A. The media report the reading of 1 particular thermometer of a nearby weather station. This temperature may be very different from the true SAT even at that location and has certainly nothing to do with the true regional SAT. To measure the true regional SAT, we would have to use many 50 ft stacks of thermometers distributed evenly over the whole region, an obvious practical impossibility. In light of these insights, clearly no one should be claiming absolute certainty about global warming or ‘hottest year ever.’  As well, many scientists and citizens were deeply disturbed by the revelations of the ClimateGate emails which showed that scientists holding dissenting views on the effect of CO2 or who ascribed other factors to climate change (i.e. solar or ocean cycles, subliminal geothermal activity in the ocean, etc.) were systematically blocked from publication by a clique of climate insiders.  Other serious issues of scientific integrity and breach of ethics were exposed, as was the fact that sea surface temperatures in a large part of the world had been ‘made up.’  Some emails revealed that ENGOs like WWF were apparently directing preferred ‘results’.  WWF has been extensively funded by the ClimateWorks green billionaires. One of the Climate Feedback critics is the director of the climate research unit at one of the facilities most implicated in the ClimateGate scandal (not to suggest this person bears any responsibility; simply pointing out that this facility’s overall scientific integrity was put in question).In addition, a grad student’s 2016 report found thousands of errors in the HadCRUT (Hadley Climate Research Unit) Temperature datasets.  Some of these included embarrassing, nonsensical items like temperatures of 80 °C for months for Caribbean Islands or apparent sea surface monitored temperatures actually taken from a site that is miles inland. As pointed out by science writer Joanne Nova, “…it begs the question of why a PhD student working from home can find mistakes that the £226 million institute with 2,100 employees could not.”Climate Feedback was critical of the fact that the EU Climate Declaration also includes business people, as if business people need a climate science degree to see such errors and breaches of integrity in climate science – yet still be required to pay millions in carbon taxes or to address GHG regulations that impose severe burdens on their business.  Obviously, business people understand math better than many climate scientists do, and they understand that such breaches of integrity and accuracy, in their world, would result in severe financial or even criminal penalties (if related to air/water quality monitoring/regulatory issues or related to securities fraud), loss of customers, and collapse of their business operations.  The climate science world gets a pass on all these real-world consequences. This must not be allowed to continue. Type Two Scientific Misconduct by Climate Feedback, Sanctioned by PoynterThe participants in Climate Feedback review engage in Type Two Scientific Misconduct “‘type two scientific misconduct’ is other-harming and leads to falsely negative conclusions about someone else’s work‘ by referring to scientists in a defamatory manner by stating that signatories who hold rational, dissenting views on the alleged ‘consensus’ are ‘well-known climate deniers‘ when not a single person on the EU Climate Declaration signatory list denies that climate changes, and they all agree that humans affect climate change, but that the effect is nominal and not catastrophic.  Name calling like this is contrary to responsible conduct in research, as set out in the NAS handbook “On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research.”“Science has progressed through a uniquely productive marriage of human creativity and hard-nosed skepticism, of openness to new scientific contributions and persistent questioning of those contributions and the existing scientific consensus.” (underline emphasis added)Those who question are engaging in responsible conduct in research. Those who close ranks are preventing scientific progress.On a personal note, it is particularly offensive to see scientists attempting to denigrate scientific colleagues through the use of the term ‘denier,’ especially when many of the scientists of the European Climate Declaration live in EU countries where the horrors of the Holocaust still reverberate.The term ‘denier’ seems to have emanated from a PR man and Al Gore acolyte, who set up DeSmogBlog, a site that is a fundee of members of the massive ClimateWorks Foundation green billionaire network which funds most academics, non-profit journals, and local environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) as proxies to push the ClimateWorks plan to establish global cap and trade, carbon pricing and to put trillions of their vested interest renewables on the grid worldwide. Curiously, neither DeSmogBlog founder James Hoggan nor Al Gore are ‘climate scientists’ either, but they feel free to hurl the epithet ‘denier’ about and it is even more curious that respectable scientists, like those engaged in Climate Feedback commentaries, bring dishonor to the realm of science with such Type Two Scientific Misconduct tactics.  Discounting Expertise of Working ProfessionalsClimate Feedback claim many of the signatories work or have worked in fossil fuel industries, as if this automatically discounts their expert professional insights.  Earth scientists who have worked in oil, gas or coal must provide accurate assessments of the risk, access to and value of these precious resources.  To this end, they have studied 4.5 billion years of earth’s climate change history in order to make reliable judgements, upon which billions of dollars of investment rest, and from which society benefits with modern conveniences, modern medicine, and our many freedoms – especially that of world travel.Expert geoscientists and Professional Engineers work with models all the time and their works require exacting outcomes – both for public safety, and to meet investor and securities regulations. They are rightly critical of the climate modelling community which pumps out projections that are far from reality. Millions of people are being frightened by faulty climate models and related media hype, billions of dollars in public funds are being wasted on unreliable infrastructure (like wind and solar/electric vehicles) yet the climate modelled outcomes and claims would never meet basic industry standards. A disturbing revelation from the American Physical Society (APS) workshop of 2014 revealed that climate modellers found a 30% scaling error which they corrected on ten year forecasts….but not on 100 year projections! DR. KOONIN: But if the model tells you that you got the response to the forcing wrong by 30 percent, you should use that same 30-percent factor when you project out a century. DR. COLLINS: Yes. And one of the reasons we are not doing that is that we are not using the models as statistical projection tool.DR. KOONIN: What are you using them as? DR. COLLINS: Well, we took exactly the same models that got the forcing wrong and which got sort of the projections wrong up to 2100. DR. KOONIN: So, why do we even show centennial-scale projections? DR. COLLINS: Well, I mean, it is part of the assessment process. And the uncertainty, I think there is a point not to get confused about what the driving uncertainties there are. By the year 2100, it’s not – DR. KOONIN: If you calibrated the model against historical data, discovered you needed .7 to be applied to the greenhouse gas, you should keep that same .7 when you run it forward, no? Climate and investment policies are being set based on these long-range model projections which apparently include a significant, known scaling error.  In the context of a geoscientist or Professional Engineer working in any industry, (but particularly fossil fuel industries where reserve assessments and project development work decades in advance) such improprieties and lack of scientific integrity would result in firing and professional misconduct penalties.  In the climate world, such improprieties are only discovered ‘by accident’ in an APS workshop and then passed off as ‘…it is part of the assessment process.’ What is being assessed if the model is rife with scaling errors?Philosophers in Climate ScienceClimate Feedback critics are fixed on the notion that only ‘climate scientists’ can know anything about climate change and as critics they appear to claim some superior knowledge themselves.  Climate Feedback critics are critical of the inclusion of philosophers, despite the fact that the IPCC itself has two ‘moral’ philosophers – and look what this one has to say: “To fight climate change, the IPCC finds it necessary to hold meetings in remote corners of the world.” The IPCC philosopher seems to think that buying offsets will mitigate impacts of fossil fuel use. We will let readers draw their own conclusions about this unscientific theory and whether public funds should finance travel junkets and make carbon traders rich on your tax dollars http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0060/pdf/Philosopher%20at%20the%20IPCC.pdf Institutionalizing Climate LysenkoismSadly, Climate Feedback and Poynter Institute (which has certified Climate Feedback as an ‘accurate’ fact checking organization) are institutionalizing Climate Lysenkoism through group think and denigration of this cadre of 500 excellent scholars and professionals, many of whom have been awarded their nations’ highest honors for science and public policy work. This type of bullying and harassment is contrary to Poynter’s own core values:FairnessWe strive to act justly, to respect people and their privacy, to present different points of view and to minimize harm. (emphasis added)Expected BehaviorFirst and foremost, treat everyone with respectUnacceptable BehaviorUnacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, intimidating, threatening, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, demeaning or disorderly conduct;  EU Climate Declaration French Ambassador, Benoit Rittaud, gave a presentation on the Lysenkoism theme at the Porto Conference. Earth is in the Meghalayan, Not the Anthropocene In July of 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences issued a statement concerning the latest stratigraphic designation – stating that we are in the Meghalayan stage of the Holocene.  Many had been expecting that the Anthropocene would be announced as confirmation that humans have greater influence on climate change than nature.The people most qualified to comment on earth’s climate are geologists, yet curiously they are left out of the IPCC list of scientists.  While one Climate Feedback critic decries the lack of biologists and women in the EU Climate Declaration, Roger Higgs has reviewed the IPCC AR6 list of experts and finds:IPCC’s next report, AR6, supposedly “will update our knowledge on climate change, its impacts and risks, and possible response options, and play an important role in implementing the Paris Agreement” said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. The selected “author teams, drawn from the hundreds of excellent nominations the IPCC was fortunate to receive, provide us with the necessary expertise across a range of disciplines to conduct the assessment” … but in truth …the author statistics (below) show that the “necessary expertise” is lacking, as geologists are again excluded, rendering the collective authorship incompetent for their stated mission of reviewing the literature to assess climate change. By this omission, IPCC ignores Earth’s history and the copious geological evidence, latterly backed by archaeology, that sea level (barometer of global temperature, via ocean-water expansion & polar ice melt) undergoes a rapid (100-500 year) & large (1-3 metres) oscillation every 500-2000 years, caused by volcanism and solar fluctuations, certainly not by industrial CO2.AR6 author statistics:Working Group I (WGI), ‘The Physical Science Basis’, 232 authors, including meteorologists, oceanographers, climate scientists, glaciologists, physicists, geographers and computer modellers, but no geologists.WGII, ‘Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, 323 authors, no geologists.WGIII, Mitigation of Climate Change, 229 authors, no geologists. Grand total 784authors, no geologists.Exemplifying IPCC’s chronic lack of impartiality (see my Technical Note 2018-2), one WGI author’s new (2018) book, ‘Sunburnt Country’, aims to convince the public that man is making Australia hotter; another’s frequent mainstream-media articles likewise aim to scare people into accepting that manmade warming is fact, not mere belief, and he criticizes Trump.IPCC’s Lee again, in true UN egalitarian style: “Of the selected experts, 44% come from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, 53% are new to the IPCC process and 33% are women.” How lovely: no geologists, but at least we have politically correct quotas of women, third worlders and youngsters! Worse: the 53% “new” people are doubtless nearly all younger than 50, i.e. indoctrinated through school and university with the ‘CO2 = pollutant’ fallacy.Be appalled that this biased, underskilled, political organization, having judged the imperceptible & geologically trivial 1°C of warming since 1900 (not a provably unprecedented rate) to be manmade, despite copious evidence of CO2’s innocence (Technical Note 2019-11), has unleashed multi-trillion-dollar expenditure, relentlessly raising your family’s taxes and energy bills, and destined to cripple the global economy and downgrade human living standards.In ClosingClimate Feedback and Poynter Institute do a disservice to open, civil debate on climate and energy policies and both appear to be agenda driven, while claiming to be fair, objective and fact-based.It is unfortunate that these flawed organizations are highly influential on media and social media outlets, with the behemoth Facebook relying on the Climate Feedback faulty claims as a rationale for blocking the distribution of the European Climate Declaration.This is contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and contrary to scientific principles.Science is about inquiry, not compliance.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/11/12

Buy offsets!COP 25 A MADRID, PROCHAINE ETAPE DU TOURISME CLIMATIQUEAfter its cancellation in Chile following the current turmoil in this country, COP 25, the annual high mass on climate, will be held in Madrid from 2 December. As every year, it will bring together tens of thousands of participants, most of whom are transported, housed and fed at taxpayers’ expense.The 25 th “United Nations Conference on Climate Change” is a further step towards the objective longstanding but increasingly affirmed UN: impose a world government term.A key instrument in this agenda, the climate debate has for a considerablenumber of years, left the scientific field for the ideological, political andfinancial fields. He has become the object of all excesses and amalgam,imposing a single point of view on the question, and muzzling all contestationor draft debate. It justifies a profound change in the industrial andeconomic policy of the so-called developed countries, in practice only Europeancountries, pending the return of the US from the outset of Trump. Some ofthe leaders of countries receiving compensation for so-called climatedisruptions – including China and India – are likely to be confirmed by agenerous distribution of funds supplied by taxpayers from so-called“rich” countries.All circles interested in climate issues will be present,First of all, part of the scientific world. Today it is necessaryto involve anthropogenic global warming, even anecdotally, in any study to seethe financial windfall of subsidies. In just a few years, the annualglobal budget for climate science has grown from $ 170 million to severalbillion dollars.The political world has found in the subject a good way to collectvotes, and today everyone wants to look greener than green. Theimplementation of such a policy also allows the creation of a growing multitudeof so-called “ecological” taxes and constraints, affirmed ordisguised, benefiting in addition to the unexpected approval of a part of thepopulation that we have persuaded that by this means, we will save the planet.The industrial world is engulfed in the juicy new market, by thepremature marketing of so-called “renewable” energies such as wind orphotovoltaic. This placing on the market was facilitated by incentives,bonuses, green certificates, network improvements and various tax refundssupported by all taxpayers, financial incentives also essential to impose theemergence of electric vehicles. This is the triumph of what is called“connivance capitalism”. The financial world also benefits greatly from the system put in place,through investments in companies, banks or so-called “ecological andresponsible” funds.Let us not forget also a constellation of NGOs engaged ineco-responsible citizen actions; and, of course, the powerful ideologicaland political lobbies who are obsessed with the unconditional support of allfor their own purposes.“Emerging” countries, meanwhile, are impatientto see the annual sum of $ 100 billion promised to them at the Copenhagenconference. A commitment that they intend to remind us imperiously on thisoccasion.This convergence of interests has taken on such a global dimension that anybacktracking has become extremely difficult, because it would put into play thevery credibility of the main pillars of our societies: the political, thehumanitarian and the industrialist.And recently, the religious world joined the movement bythe voice of the Pope. (3)As every year, I come out this ticket barely cleanedaccording to the new COP 25 …The aim each time affirmed is to impose imperative restrictive norms on(mainly European) states which would still doubt the existence of a climaticthermostat, with the help of which the man would regulate at will the globaltemperature. All this is supported by more and more apocalyptic mediainterventions as the opening date approaches. In fact, almost every day,we are bathed in catastrophic climatic or environmental events, immediatelycataloged as consequences of global warming. Currently, we have Californiafires, and any new disaster within days of the opening of the conference wouldbe welcome.Because it will be, no doubt, our new last chance to “save theplanet”. (1)All this beautiful world prefers to hide a fact now established: globalwarming has slowed considerably, if not capped for a long time since 1998,while human emissions of CO2 would cease, it is said, to increase, denying allclimate models who did not foresee this embarrassing phenomenon, among otherrealities just as disconcerting and just as unnoticed elsewhere.In the note below, Viv Forbes is concerned that Australia alone has sent ateam of 114 people – including his Prime Minister – to the CopenhagenConference. What about the Belgians, whose delegation in Copenhagen had120 people, in Cancun, 108 participants, the other conferences to match.A sumptuous “Magical Climatic Tour” !The Rio +20 conference in 2012 alone brought together 50,000 participants,including more than 100 heads of state. In Marrakech for COP 22 in 2016,30,000 participants were expected. At COP 23 in Bonn, there were plethoricAfrican delegations; Côte d’Ivoire alone had 492 participants. In Madrid,25,000 participants are expected, but we bet they will be more numerous …In recent years in the world, millions of people have died in armedconflicts, others in famines or lack of clean water, and even in our countriescitizens are dying of cold because they can not afford to heat or even shelter,while millions of people are parceled in refugee camps, or have taken thedangerous path of a Europe which counts the tenths of degrees which, it seems,threaten the existence even of its populations.Nobody died because of global warming. An overall warming of 0.4 to0.7 ° C depending on the sources -sept tenths of a degree- throughout thetwentieth century, remember.So, where are the priorities, and is it wise that taxpayers continue todirectly or indirectly fund the annual stays of our (ir) leaders in moretourist than scientific stays, so that they show their presence in cyclicalconclaves which also lead to so many failures? It would also be fun tocalculate the “ecological footprint” of these gigantic conventionsdesigned to reboost climate catastrophism.For what were the consequences on the climate of theprevious 24 climate conferences?But the vast majority of my readers are aware of what has just beensaid. And that’s the problem: we go around in circles in a smallcircle of convinced . And yet, each of us can extend the debateby intervening in the comments of the media, in social networks, within hisprivate or professional circle etc …Challenging the conclusions of climate conferences, combating“one-size-fits-all thinking” and restoring an exchange of ideas onthese issues that engage the future of our society is paramount and concernsall of us.Here are the significant parts of the ticket published by Viv Forbes in2014 in the WUWT site of Anthony Watts (2) (home translation)Jo Moreau.Twenty-two years ago, a group of green activists calling themselves“The Earth Summit” gathered in Rio and invented a way to visit theworld at the expense of taxpayers: to initiate endless conferences on alarmsthreatening the environment.(…) But they discovered the juiciest of the veins with their creationcalled “Global Warming”, and its sub-branches “ClimateChange” and “Extreme Weather Phenomena”.These “noble causes” have generated a profusion of steeringcommittees, reference committees, policy committees, scientific subgroups,working committees, evaluators and leading agencies, and have generatedmeetings with 20,000 participants. countries in places such as Rio, Berlin,Geneva, Kyoto, Buenos Aires, Bonn, The Hague, Marrakech, New Delhi, Milan,Montreal, Nairobi, Bali, Poznan, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Qatar, Doha,Warsaw, Stockholm , Lima, Abu Dhabi and New York.The Climate Conferences circuit has become a real boon for airlines, hotelsand fine restaurants, even more so than the Olympics or the G20.Taxpayers around the world have spent the last 21 years spendingunnecessary money, which would have been much better spent on flood controlinfrastructure, drinking water supply for drought-endemic populations, andpollution control. .Viv

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/11/12/just-one-small-issue-in-the-u-s-election-campaign/,,Just One Small Issue in The U.S. Election Campaign," Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here.A number of the candidates to lead the Democratic Party in the 2020 US election, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have stated that if elected they would immediately seek to shut down all exploration development and production of oil and natural gas on federal lands and all production based on hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”).As a result of increased fractionation andoil development, US crude oil production has more than doubled in a decade. Bymid-2019, US production was over 12 million barrels per day, surpassing Russianand Saudi Arabian output as the world’s largest. Academic and business modelssuggest that oil prices are up to $40 – $50 per barrel lower than they wouldhave been were it not for the US fracking revolution. The benefits of these lower prices haveprimarily flowed to China, India, Japan and South Korea, which constitute fourof the world’s five largest oil importers (the US itself being one of the topfive), largely at the cost of reduced oil revenues to OPEC and Russia. GivenAsia’s oil consumption of almost 36 million barrels per day in 2018, theregion’s consumers would have saved over $325 billion dollars annually if crudeoil prices were lower by just $25 per barrel due to the US production boom. If priceswere $50 per barrel lower, the Asian countries would have saved over $650billion per year.The benefits to all the world’s oilconsumers from higher U.S. production can be estimated based on the fact thatworld oil consumption in 2018 was about 100 million barrels per day. With aprice reduction of $25 per barrel, the daily savings to consumers would be $2.5billion, or an annual savings of $912.5 billion. If the price reduction was $50per barrel, the daily savings for the world’s consumers would be $5 billion, or$1.8 trillion per year. Loss of this savings could hasten the onset of a globalrecession.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/11/12
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/10/30/if-greta-had-her-way/,Andrew Roman ,If Greta Had Her Way," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019.Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here.Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg usually gets a pass from the media in terms of never challenging her claims about the effects of human activity on global warming. No one seems to confront her over the adverse effects of the “strikes” that organizers lead, with her as the symbolic Joan of Arc waging war against the capitalists. Maybe, however, they would take some advice about what would actually happen if the countries of the world were to heed her calls for an end to the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) within the next ten years, if not sooner.I have spent over 40 years studying, analyzing and advising on energy policy issues in Canada, so I think I can make a reasonable claim to knowing far more about the subject than a sixteen-year-old high school dropout. I acknowledge that I suffer from the bias of thinking that facts matter, and that hysteria about energy and environmental issues will ultimately not overcome common sense. So, let me present some facts that those listening to Greta might want to take into account.First, fossil fuels now supply 84 % of the world’s energy needs, with nuclear energy and hydroelectricity supplying most of the rest. Renewable energy, which Greta favours, supplies only 4%, despite several decades of massive subsidies by governments. The share of energy supplied by fossil fuels varies considerably by country. In the poorer countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, it typically supplies over 95% of people’s energy needs.The prominence of fossil fuels in the energy mix is not an accident or the work of evil energy companies. Coal, oil and natural gas are plentiful, reliable and relatively inexpensive. Because of this, consumers and industry have been increasing their use of fossil fuels for over 150 years, and the patterns of consumption are embedded in the infrastructure: the roads, buildings, bridges, transit systems and vehicles that we all use. Oil, in particular, has four major advantages that make people want to use it – high energy density (the amount of energy per unit of mass), ease of transport, low cost and safety of storage. Because of these advantages, oil provides 97 % of the energy needs of transportation. Natural gas, while less dense and more expensive to store and transport, is clean-burning and versatile. It is also an ideal fuel for power generation, residential and commercial heating, and crop drying. Coal is more expensive to transport and burn cleanly, but coal resources are present in large quantities in over 40 countries. Coal is also cheap to produce; it still dominates in the supply of fuel for power generation.It is, quite simply, impossible to end the use of these energy sources within ten years or even within 30 years. Nonetheless, let us for the sake of illustration examine what would happen if some world government were to decree that fossil fuel use must end immediately.Almost all motorized transport would stop. The cars, trucks, buses, trains, marine vessels and aircraft would stop moving. People would not be able to go from place to place without walking, cycling, or riding horses, and there would not be enough horses. It would take months, not hours, to move long distances. The movement of goods would decline dramatically. Consequently, companies would not be able to obtain the materials that they need to make things, and they would not be able to move the products they make to where people live. Most companies would have to close, putting millions of people out of work. Similarly, people would not be able to get to work if they lived more than a few miles away, so they would lose what jobs were left available.Farmers would not be able to obtain the supplies, fertilizers or pesticides they need to plant their crops and they would not have modern farm machinery and tractors to do the work. Food production would drop sharply in all parts of the world, as agricultural practices went back to what they were at the end of the 19th century. As those practices could only support about 1.5 billion people, six billion people would starve.Without natural gas and coal, there would be a shortage of electricity generation capacity and fuel for residential and commercial heating. Almost all parts of the world would experience blackouts and brownouts. This would make modern manufacturing impossible, so those industries would shut down. In the colder countries like Canada, the forest would be cut down to provide residential heating. But once the firewood supply is exhausted, millions of people would become sick and/or freeze in wintertime. There would no longer be any air-conditioning. The absence and/or unreliability of electricity would end the use of several modern conveniences like stoves, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, radios, televisions, computers and cellular telephones.The end of oil would also mean that the products made from oil would no longer be available, including petrochemical feedstocks. That would mean that no one could in future make things like rubber, plastic, roofing, paints, pens, synthetic clothing fibres, dyes, computers, CDs and DVDs, deodorants, eye glasses, telephones or detergents, to name only a few.Because of the shortages of so many things, prices would rise significantly, even as incomes fell. People would not be able to get most of the goods and services on which they now depend. Older people would be most vulnerable. Hospitals would not be able to get many of the medications that they need nor be able conduct operations with the anesthetics now available. Many people would die as a result.As these changes would take place overnight, or even within a year, they would pose enormous problems that governments would not be equipped to confront. The public in almost all countries would find these changes intolerable and would revolt against them. It is likely that in many areas there would be a breakdown of civil order, and chaos would result. If governments attempted to enforce the end of fossil fuels, they would have to do so by imposing dictatorships. It is unlikely that the countries of the world as now organized could survive such a transition. Fortunately, it is unlikely that I would live long enough tosee such a tragedy. Greta would, though.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'energy', 'Greta Thunberg', 'oil and gas']",2019/10/30
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/10/20/what-is-climate-policy-costing-canadians-an-introductory-overview/,Toby ,What is Climate Policy Costing Canadians? An Introductory Overview," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019.Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant, and diplomat. His full bio is here.After recently giving presentations on the economic effects of Canadian governmental policies on climate change, I have been asked to provide a single number that captures the cost for the average person or family. I understand, from a communications perspective, the advantage of offering a single, simple answer that will stick in the minds of an audience. However, there are important pitfalls in offering a simplistic and potentially misleading response. Indeed, the question itself reveals a lack of understanding of the magnitude and pervasiveness of the actions now being taken by the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, and a lack of information upon which to base such a calculation. Perhaps examining why such a calculation is so difficult will offer insights into the answer.The Range of CostsGovernmental measures to “mitigate” climate change by reducing present and future greenhouse gas emissions include the following.Taxes on energy consumption (e.g. carbon dioxide taxes).Tax exemptions for favoured industries (e.g. tax breaks for solar, wind, ethanol and electric vehicle producers and purchasers).Regulations that require companies to change what they produce (e.g. regulation of vehicle emissions and appliances).Regulations that restrict what companies and consumers can produce and purchase (e.g. regulations forcing utilities to cease using coal-fired power plants or to pay above-market rates to renewable energy producers).Regulations that shift costs from favoured industries to the general taxpayer or electricity ratepayer (e.g. rate changes caused by policy directives or legislated restrictions on local government’s ability to impose property taxes on industrial wind power).Subsidies to favoured producers (e.g. grants to renewable energy producers).Subsidies to favoured consumers (e.g. EV purchasers, aboriginal communities).Electricity policies that require utilities to build uneconomic transmission lines and “smart” transmission and distribution systems.Biased procurement policies that require government departments to exclusively buy “green” energy and to pay above-market prices to favoured producers.Research and development, technology demonstration, and assistance in commercialization that benefit only renewable energy producers.Funding for communications programs to promote climate hysteria.Funding to environmental non-governmental organizations to fund pro-mitigation policies and to disparage the fossil fuel industry.Zoning and other regulations to promote densification of urban areas.Others.Recall that there are at least 600 of these different measures so well known that the Government of Canada reports on them bi-annually to the United Nations.The federal government might be expected to publish a comprehensive list of its own programs and related expenditures on climate change, but it does not. An analyst seeking information on federal expenditures must hunt through a large number of search terms including “climate change”, “sustainable development”, “green initiatives”, “clean energy” and others, and the inventories are not complete.In a May, 2018 collaborative report by the federal and provincial governments’ Auditor Generals (AGs), the AGs observed that no one has a complete record of all the programs in place, that the number of programs at the municipal level appear to be growing quickly, and that there is very poor coordination among governments in administering these programs. The AGs also observed that there is no way to measure these programs’ total cost and cost-effectiveness, nor their extent of overlap and duplication. See the report here:http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_otp_201803_e_42883.htmlThis is not the whole of it. A major component of current climate change mitigation in Canada is the efforts of various interest groups and governments to block the construction of essential pipeline infrastructure. This infrastructure would allow Canadian oil and natural gas to reach export markets. Further, these groups seek to impair the access of Canadian oil producers to investment capital. These efforts, as assisted by the federal government’s changes in the regulation of energy infrastructure, have directly cost oil producers $20 billion in forgone income in 2018 alone. This dollar value is according to the Royal Bank of Canada and the Fraser Institute. There are no authoritative estimates of the loss of capital and the flight of Canadian oil industry capital to the United states; one rough estimate is $60 billion to date.The Difficulties in Measuring Costs to the EconomyWhen one measures costs, the first question is “to whom?” The present climate policy measures entail costs to taxpayers, electricity ratepayers, consumers, industries, firms, and the economy as a whole.Someone’s costs may be another’s revenues, so economists try to measure the changes in income at the national level. To do this, however, one must have available a general equilibrium model of the Canadian economy and be able to use the right assumptions and the right inputs to calculate the effects on Gross Domestic Product over time. Further, one must have a way to isolate the effects of climate policies from all other influences on the economy. No authoritative source has yet published such an analysis.General equilibrium analysis, moreover, is not without its faults and limitations. The underlying assumption is that economies always trend towards an equilibrium. It follows that a disruption (e.g. loss of an industry or firm) in one region will quickly and smoothly be accounted for, through the efficient adjustment of market forces, by increases in other parts of the economy. In reality, such adjustments are often long and painful.How Does One Value the Political Consequences?Approximately half of Canada’s GHG emissions occur in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The GHG emissions that are associated with emissions-intensive resource industries in the rural and small-town areas of the rest of Canada account for about one-sixth of Canada’s GHG emissions. Therefore about two-thirds of Canada’s regions are directly threatened by policies that seek to sharply increase the cost of fossil fuels and to “phase out” the industries that operate there. Canada’s resource industries just happen to be the sectors with the highest productivity and highest contributions to Canada’s balance of trade.The systematic undercutting of the Alberta and Saskatchewan economies will not be accepted by the people of these provinces. These provinces’ governments will use every available policy and legal instrument to oppose the “decarbonization” of the Canadian economy, which is the ultimate goal of federal climate policy. The threat of secession is now generally underestimated and discounted in central Canada. How would one estimate the value to Canada of losing two provinces along with their resource revenues that currently go to Ottawa?Averages MisleadThe costs of Canada’s climate policies are borne in very different ways by individuals, families and firms. These differences are based on many factors including location, energy consumption, available energy choices, and incomes. A small family that receives a substantial rebate on carbon dioxide taxes may not be much affected, unless the family is located in Alberta and the breadwinner loses his/her job as a result of climate policies. A company that sells insulation services may do well, while one that operates in an energy-intensive industry with low margins may be forced out of business. Generally, those who live in Alberta and Saskatchewan suffer very adverse effects, while those who live in Quebec may suffer less so, at least until the emissions reductions targets move high enough to affect them as well. A major manufacturer may be forced to raise its costs above those of its foreign competitors, and thus decide to relocate its operations and emissions to a different country.Bottom LineWhether we consider financial costs or economic costs, no one knows the total costs of current and future climate policies. These costs are pervasive, immense, and growing. One can cite individual anecdotes concerning very large figures, such as the fact that carbon dioxide taxes will impose on consumers an additional cost of at least $24 billion per year by 2020. This number may grow to $80 billion per year by 2030. However, any attempt to condense all costs of current and future climate policies into a single value is fraught with uncertainty and error. Any number that one might produce would lack an authoritative foundation and could be easily challenged, and thus lack credibility.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'changement climatique', 'climate change']",2019/10/20
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/10/07/actuaries-are-offside-with-climate-change-statement/,,Actuaries are Offside with Climate Change Statement," New Rebuttal Report – Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science(Calgary) “Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” is a new report by Friends of Science Society rebutting the Sept. 24, 2019, public statement by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) entitled “Time to Act: Facing the Risks of a Changing Climate“. The institute portrays actuaries as “…risk management experts who use data modelling and statistical methods to measure and manage the financial impacts of uncertain events and scenarios”. However, their climate change statement is studded with assumptions that rely on mathematical climate models that are known to forecast temperature increases in the atmosphere at three to six times the observed rates. Actuaries have a special responsibility in society, according to their professional code of conduct: “It is the professional responsibility of the member not to be associated with anything which the member knows or should know is false or misleading” and that actuaries shall hold “the duty of the profession to the public above the needs of the profession and its members“.The CIA statement claims that global warming is linked to human industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and proposes more data collection, more data collection on extreme weather events, and corporate carbon footprint reporting as a means of reaching Paris Targets. “Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” demonstrates that Paris greenhouse gas reduction targets are arbitrary and fraught with conflicts of interest. The report also shows that even if all signatory countries met the non-legally binding Paris targets, it would not make any difference to global warming.  In addition, an attempt by Canada meet the Paris targets would result in economic catastrophe.In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that despite a significant rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, there had been no statistically significant warming for some 15 years, since before the Kyoto Accord was ratified. The lack of warming over more than 15 years was not predicted by any climate model.Dr. Judith Curry testified to the US Senate on January 16, 2014, that “carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can fine tune climate“.  Since that time, dozens of peer-reviewed papers show that carbon dioxide (CO2) has a nominal effect on warming; hundreds of research papers indicate that human impacts on climate are small. [1] [2] The CIA statement “Time to Act…” conflates short-term, unique extreme weather events and related financial losses with climate change and warming. The IPCC’s Special Report on Extreme Weather specifically states there is little evidence that human effects on climate or greenhouse gas increases have any impact on extreme weather. [3] Extreme weather events are integral to climate. Furthermore, Roger Pielke, Jr., author of “The Rightful Place of Science: Disasters and Climate Change” has extensively assessed the impacts of disasters and climate change and has “found convincing evidence that climate change was not leading to higher rates of weather-related damages worldwide, once you correct for increasing population and wealth“. [4]“Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” details the inaccuracies of climate models, upon which public policy is based, and discusses flagrant conflicts of interest within the climate science and related investment communities.“Misguided Math: Misinterpreted Science” suggests carbon dioxide from human industrial emissions is not significantly driving climate change, so the three measures advocated by the CIA are unnecessary, null and void.  There should be no risk of stranded fossil fuel assets, no need to collect data on extreme weather events, and no necessity for corporations to account for climate related factors in investment decisions and corporate risk planning. Friends of Science Society says the greatest risk to the Canadian economy is making climate policy decisions based on misguided math and misinterpreted science by people who are not aware of the complexities of climate science nor the vast uncertainties and failings of climate models.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/25/stand-earths-misguided-report-on-the-trans-mountain-expansion-project/,,Stand.Earth’s Misguided Report on the Trans Mountain Expansion Project," Contributed by Robert Lyman©2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is here. Stand.earth recently published a report that allegedly offers the Canadian public information about what the construction of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project Will Look Like and its social and ecological impacts. Entitled, Seven Construction Hotspots: An Overview, the report claims to be the results of research into information “buried in the National Energy Board website”. While the report states that it will identify fundamental problems with the pipeline, it does nothing of the sort. Those who seek insights into the environmental aspects of the project will find no more insights than those who want to know more about the economic and social benefits of the projects, which are deliberately ignored. The report amounts to no more than a cherry-picking of a few environmental issues identified during the National Energy Board’s lengthy and exhaustive review of all aspects of the project in order to find a few that might be described as not fully resolved – that is, if one ignores the evidence or the process. Before examining the so-called hotspots, it would help to provide the background. What does this project entail? The project involves the expansion of an existing oil pipeline system that runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, at which point some of the crude oil would be loaded onto tankers at the Westridge Marine Terminal where it would be delivered to markets throughout the west coast of North America and the Pacific Rim. This pipeline system has operated for 65 years, since 1953. The project would result in the looping (or twinning) of the existing 1,147 km Trans Mountain Pipeline (TMPL) system with about 987 km of new buried pipeline. The older pipeline would be designated Line 1. The proposed new pipeline segments, along with two currently active segments, would become Line 2. The existing pipeline now transports both crude oil and refined petroleum products to British Columbia and export markets in the Puget Sound area as well as California. Today, British Columbia receives over half of its motor gasoline supplies from Alberta via TMPL; the dedication of Line 1 exclusively to refined oil products would increase the security and flexibility of refined oil product supply to British Columbia consumers. In total, the project would increase the capacity of the TMPL system from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined products. Currently, the Westridge Terminal loads about five oil tankers per month with crude oil delivered by TMPL; this has been occurring for decades. The proposed expanded system would increase the number of tanker loads to about 34 per month, or just over one per day. Which organizations reviewed the proposal? The project has been reviewed and approved by the National Energy Board (NEB) and the marine portion has been reviewed and approved by the Transport Canada-led TERMPOL Review Process. Based on the recommendation by the NEB, the federal Cabinet approved the project, and on May 19 2016 the NEB issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity, confirming the project is in Canada’s national interest and is authorized to proceed to construction. The NEB reasons for decision can be read here: https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p80061/114562E.pdf The British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office on January 11 2017 issued an Environmental Assessment Certificate for the project, subject to an additional 37 conditions. The B.C. announcement of this can be read here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2017ENV0001-000047 What did the National Energy Board do? The National Energy Board conducted an extensive review of every aspect of the project in accordance with its requirements under the National Energy Board Act, which requires it to conduct a review based on the Canadian public interest. These subjects included an evaluation of the potential benefits and burdens of the project throughout its entire life cycle, from pre-construction through construction and operation to eventual decommissioning. The topics covered included the need for the pipeline, the safety and engineering integrity of the facilities, the approach to be taken to land acquisition and construction, the economic and financial issues, the impacts on communities and on aboriginal people, and the effects of shipping, among others. The National Energy Board was also responsible to evaluate the project under the Canadian Environment Assessment Act and so it examined the effects of the pipeline on a host of environmental aspects, including air, land and water as well as wildlife; it also reviewed the TMPL plans to avoid accidents that might cause spills and to take rapid action to clean up and remediate any spills that do occur. In carrying out this almost four-and-a-half year review (three years longer that federal guidelines provide for), the NEB collected many thousands of pages of background documentation on all aspects of the project’s design, construction and operation, as well as on the efforts of the pipeline sponsor to consult with affected groups and communities. The NEB’s report alone runs to 553 pages and addresses hundreds of issues, almost all of which were pored over at length during hearings that involved many different intervenors representing dozens of different groups. The report provides an extremely high level of transparency, in that every issue raised by project opponents is addressed, and a reason given for the decision taken by the NEB panel in conducting the review. How was the public engaged in this process? Before applying to the National Energy Board, TMPL held many meetings with communities, landowners and aboriginal people who lived along the route and who might be affected by the project. After the application was filed, the NEB then took many steps to ensure that those who could be potentially affected by the project were aware of it and knew how they could get involved in the review. Over the course of its three and a half years of proceedings, the Board provided over $3 million in participant funding to eligible interveners; 79% of this funding was offered to Aboriginal groups. There were 400 interveners in the review process. In addition, over 1,600 people participated in hearings and 1,250 submitted comments. The Board held public hearing sessions in Edmonton, Calgary, Chilliwack, Kamloops and Victoria. From 2012 to the end of the review process, TMPL had tens of thousands of exchanges with stakeholders through face-to-face meetings, presentations, public forums, technical meetings, community meetings, social media and other means. It held 159 open houses along the pipeline and marine corridors, more than 1,700 meetings with stakeholder groups, and responded to 1,500 emails, 950 media inquiries and 430 media interviews. How many conditions did the NEB attach? The NEB approved the certificate subject to 157 conditions covering the environment, people and lands, engineering and safety, marine traffic, emergency preparedness and regulatory oversight. These conditions are intended to ensure that TMPL’s commitments, plans and programs discussed during the regulatory review are in place so that the Board can assure compliance in future. What Did Stand.earth Do? Stand-earth identified, from among the hundreds, if not thousands, of project details dealt with by the NEB and Transport Canada precisely ten issues that its “experts” felt were not adequately handled. These include: The risk of a tanker collision in Burrard InletThe potential effects of a fire at Burrard Tank FarmThe potential for “man-camps” to give rise to “sexual violence” against women in nearby communitiesThe need for study of geological fault lines near Burnaby Mountain TunnelThe risk of an oil spill at the Fraser River pipeline crossingThe use of floating roof tanks in an earthquake zoneThe alleged failure of the pipeline sponsor to consider “historical precedent”The adverse effects of an oil spill on human healthThe alleged failure of the pipeline sponsor to adequately consult with aboriginals. What Should We Make of This? When an environmental organization like Stand-earth raises technical issues about proposed pipeline projects, what is the Canadian public supposed to do? The issues involved are invariably ones that can only be well understood, debated and resolved by experts – engineers, biologists, geologists, hydrologists, and others, as well as by the lawyers, economists and many advisors to the project sponsor and the authorized government regulatory agencies whose job it is to get things right. The public, in other words, cannot properly judge whether Stand.earth’s complaints are justified. That is why, for sixty years, the Government of Canada has used the National Energy Board as the body to carry out such reviews on the public’s behalf. The NEB has operated as an independent, arms’-length, expert body that has a professional staff and uses quasi-judicial procedures to gather and test on the record all the evidence related to the application before it. The value of the NEB has resided not only in its independence and technical competence by in the fact that it is non-partisan, i.e. not influenced by the policies of the political party that happens to be in power at the time the case is heard. Organizations like Stand.earth have done everything they can to discredit the National Energy Board so that the public will not have an independent agency to decide where the public interest lies. They do not want independent, professional and non-partisan judgements about pipelines or other energy projects. Instead, they want to appeal to those who lack expertise and objectivity or are politically opposed to all energy development to substitute bias for professional judgement. People who want to know all about the Trans Mountain Expansion Project can read all about it and how the issues have been examined by reading the NEB’s decision. As for Stand.earth’s report, don’t waste your time. RELATED:Chatelaine Magazine Mar. 15, 2019How This B.C.

Who’s First?," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is here.  In 2017, there were 22.7 million light duty vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) registered in Canada. They represented 12 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions in that year. The current federal government target is to reduce GHG emissions by about 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. In practice, that means a reduction from 716 megatonnes (Mt) of emissions in 2017 to 512 Mt in 2030, or 28.5%. The Green Party and a number of municipalities have called for a reduction of 45% from 2015 levels by 2030, of about 43.5 %. Presenting these goals in terms of percentages of emissions means little to the average citizen. What if we used some simple assumptions and some simple mathematics to illustrate what it would mean in one sector of the economy if the government chose to seek comparable percentage emissions reductions in all economic sectors? Let’s ignore for the sake the argument the fact that Canadians buy about two million new light duty vehicles each year, and junk a similar but slightly smaller number of older vehicles, and just treat the number of vehicles as constant. Reducing light duty vehicles by 28.5% means a reduction of 6,470,000 vehicles, or almost 500,000 vehicles a year from the roads from 2017 to 2030. Reducing light duty vehicles by 43.5% means a reduction of 9,875,000 vehicles, or 760,000 vehicles per year from the roads from 2017 to 2030. So, the next time someone says that Canada can make these reductions without a problem, ask them how we would remove that many vehicles per year from the roads, and whether they will be the first to volunteer to give up their car.———–RELATED:The 85 Million Tonne Obsessionhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/27/the-85-million-tonne-obsession/You Can’t Get There from Herehttps://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/You_cant_get_there_from_here_Lyman.pdf Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['cars', 'climate change']",2019/09/25
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/19/canadians-bamboozled-by-meaningless-climate-models/,Dr Francis Manns ,Canadians Bamboozled by ‘Meaningless’ Climate Models," Sept. 19, 2019Canadians Bamboozled by ‘Meaningless’ Climate Models(CALGARY) Blacklock’s Reporter tweeted a report on Sept. 16, 2019 that Environment Canada ‘omits 100 years of records and uses simulated, not actual data to come up with frightening climate change graphs,’ referring to the new ClimateData.ca collaboration site. Sheila Gunn Reid of The Rebel Media did her own damning investigation as a follow-on to Blacklock’s report, showing that the hottest and coldest temperature data in Canada has been deleted from the new ‘modelled’ (simulated) representations.Models Completely Meaningless – Japanese Scientist On a global scale, climate models were denounced as inaccurate in a new book released this week on Kindle in “Confessions of a climate scientist: The global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis (Japanese Edition with English section)” by scientist Mototaka Nakamura.  In the ebook, he states: “… changes and variations in climate predicted by those models are completely meaningless even if they were tuned to reproduce the current climate very accurately. By the way, none of the climate simulation models used for predictions can reproduce the current climate accurately despite the heavy tuning and engineering efforts by climate researchers. The models are tuned to produce the “best compromise” and used for various experiments.” Unfortunately, Canadian greenhouse gas reduction targets to meet the mythical 1.5°Celsius temperature and related climate policies are all based on these ‘completely meaningless’ models.Critical Election Incident Public ProtocolIronically, Canada’s Green Party platform, released the same day as the Blacklock’s report, calls to “Mandate Elections Canada to develop a truth in advertising framework for election campaigns that empowers the Commissioner of Elections to investigate citizens’ complaints related to campaign advertising and impose sanctions if the complaints are found to be justified.”Statements that there is a climate emergency are based on projections of faulty climate models. Demands that fossil fuels must be phased out to ‘stop global warming’, that carbon taxes must be higher or GHG targets more stringent mean that environmental groups and climate emergency-crazed politicians should be investigated for false and misleading campaigns, fearmongering and abuse of the public trust.Certainly, based on the Blacklock’s revelations, Canadian media, politicians and foreign-funded environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) that are trumpeting a climate emergency and demanding a shut down of the existing fossil fuel-based economy likely violate the “Critical Election Incident Public Protocol”, of the recently enacted Digital Charter, outlined by Poynter Institute.The same may be true for media that are participating in the global “Covering Climate Now”. This exercise in media groupthink is inciting mass public delusion, contrary to the media’s mandate of Freedom of the Press, to report diverse and dissenting views in society and to investigate important issues, as Blacklock’s has done.Canadian Taxpayers Are Being Fleeced – Policies Turned Upside DownENGO ‘charities’ rely on these overheated, inaccurate models as the basis for fund-raising and millions in government ‘climate change’ grants as outlined in Friends of Science series of ‘green charity’ reports.  The Green Party is campaigning on the basis of a climate emergency and demanding a World War II-style managed economy based on climate model misinformation.  Pollsters like Abacus and Environics are having a field day conducting surveys on climate change that are unrelated to reality. ENGOs like Ecojustice are demanding that unattainable greenhouse gas reduction targets be fixed in law; other tax-subsidized charities like David Suzuki Foundation are terrifying children and demanding that 8 to18 year-olds be allowed to vote. Environmental Defence uses these frightening but fake climate forecasts to demand a shut down of the oil sands as part of the Tar Sands Campaign. Canadian law professors are planning to sue oil companies based on faulty climate models. Such climate and energy illiteracy must not be enshrined in law.“Mickey Mouse” Thinking – GHG Reduction to Stop Climate ChangeMototaka Nakamura points out that there is no reliable global temperature record beyond perhaps the past 50 years, thus temperature targets are elusive, as are claims of global warming.  Likewise, he states that claiming carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas reductions alone will alter climate or temperature is “Mickey Mouse” thinking.  According to Mototaka Nakamura, climate change entails such a complex dynamic interaction between the atmospheric and ocean variabilities alone, that no reliable forecasts can be made using computer models.  He points out that the elusive nature of water vapor, the most influential greenhouse gas, cannot be modelled.  Neither can cloud formations which are highly influential in climate.Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Temperature Signal Not EvidentA recent more technical paper by Paul Frank, published Sept. 6, 2019 on the topic of “Propagation of Error and the Reliability of Global Air Temperature Projections” concludes: “At the current level of theory an AGW signal, if any, will never emerge from climate noise no matter how long the observational record because the uncertainty width will necessarily increase much faster than any projected trend in air temperature. Any impact from GHGs will always be lost within the uncertainty interval. Even advanced climate models exhibit poor energy resolution and very large projection uncertainties….The unavoidable conclusion is that a temperature signal from anthropogenic CO2 emissions (if any) cannot have been, nor presently can be, evidenced in climate observables.”Provinces that are engaged in a court challenge over carbon taxes may be vindicated by these revelations.ContactMichelle StirlingCommunications Manager TOLL FREE 1-888-7899597 / media@friendsofscience.org AboutFriends of Science Society is an independent group of earth, atmospheric and solar scientists, engineers, and citizens who are celebrating its 17th year of offering climate science insights.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/18/pay-up-say-china-and-india/,Andrew Roman ,"“PAY UP”, Say China and India"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is here.In preparation for yet another United Nations “Climate Summit” to be held soon in New York, the representatives of various developing countries have been signaling their concerns and demands relating to what developed countries like Canada should do. In recent statements by China and India, the leaders have sent a simple message. “Pay up!” They are referring to the commitment that several OECD countries made in 2012 and then again at the 21st Conference of the Parties on Climate Change in Paris in 2015 (COP21) that they would contribute at least $100 billion per year by 2020 to help the developing countries pay for greenhouse gas reductions and for adaptation to climate change. So far, the Green Climate Fund has barely $20 billion ($2.3 billion from Canada, in one of Justin Trudeau’s first actions after being elected), and has actually allocated only a portion of that to projects. In separate statements on September 17, China and India reminded the developed countries of their commitment. China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. According to the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 2019, in 2018 China (including Hong Kong) emitted 9.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2e) , or over 28 per cent of the world total. China has made a number of commitments to “peak” its emissions by 2030, but by then its emissions will be somewhere between 14.4 billion and 16.6 billion tonnes of CO2e per year, two to two-and-a-half times those of the United States (source: Climate Action Tracker). China has the second largest economy in the world and one of the fastest growing ones. Yet, it qualifies to receive funds out of the Green Climate Fund, and it wants our money. India is now the fourth largest emitter in terms of CO2e, with 2.5 billion tonnes in 2018. India’s emissions are growing even faster that those of China in percentage terms, and by 2030 are projected to be 4.5 billion tonnes CO2e, according to Climate Action Tracker. The Indian Ministry of Finance just issued a report stating that India aims to be a U.S. $5 trillion economy by 2014 but that it demands that the developed countries pay more to cover the costs of its emissions reduction. The report quoted 2016 UN data saying that total “climate specific” finance flows from developed countries was US $38 billion, less than 40% of the US $100 billion per year Green Climate Fund target. The COP21 agreement  did not include any provisions as to the apportionment of payment responsibilities among the developed countries or the apportionment of payments to the developing countries. The declaration by the Trump Administration in the United States that it will withdraw from the COP21 Agreement in 2020 leaves another question as to whether the remaining developed countries are still willing to pay US $100 billion per year. If anyone from China or India arrives at my door asking for my contribution, I will just say that I gave at the office.

Some things won’t die…," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat.  His full bio is here.Perhaps it is because Canada is now in an election campaign during which many advocates are trying to move their favourite issue to the top of the public’s agenda. Perhaps, those who believe with almost religious fervor that humans are causing catastrophic global warming are just feeling the confidence that comes with having billion-dollar foundations as well as plenty of government money behind them. Whatever the reasons, every day we see another statement of a simple, short and incorrect logic. It is expressed as, “Climate change is real, so we must impose carbon dioxide taxes” or “I believe in global warming, so the government should impose legally binding targets so people who produce or use fossil fuels will be punished.”Some things don’t die… Pinterest https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/502362533413735452/?autologin=trueSuch leaps of logic, it seems to me, obscure the many implicit theses that underlie the alleged linkage between climate science and public policy. I count at least ten, and I am sure there are more. So, let us count the ten deadly theses that climate catastrophists believe:that despite millions of years of climate changes affected by solar, oceanic, and other natural cycles, the main influence on the global climate today is the four in every ten thousand parts in the atmosphere that represent human-caused carbon dioxide emissions;that by adjusting human-caused carbon dioxide emissions), people can “manage” the global climate as though human emissions were a thermostat;that the analysis of future climate trends carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and specifically its modelling of future temperature changes, can be relied upon as a basis for understanding climate a century hence (despite the failure of those models even to replicate actual global temperature changes over the past thirty years);that the various agreements of the United Nations to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets will actually result in those targets being met, notwithstanding that none of the targets set since 1990 have ever been met;that the growth in GHG emissions globally can be reduced by actions that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (i.e. the wealthier) countries take to reduce emissions – even though the non-OECD countries now constitute 63% of the emissions; all the emissions growth is occurring in the non-OECD countries; and the emissions growth is driven by the poorer countries’ justifiable and irresistible desire for higher living standards for their citizens;that a transition of all countries from one set of energy sources (i.e. fossil fuels) to another (i.e. wind and solar energy) can be achieved in 10 to 20 years even when, historically, such transitions have all taken 50 to 70 years;that sharply reducing GHG emissions in Canada will not cost very much or impair Canadian living standards very much, when the few steps that have been take so far have cost Ontario and Alberta alone tens of billions of dollars;that, even though federal and provincial governments already have over 600 programs, subsidies and regulations in place, adding a carbon dioxide tax is the additional ingredient that will sharply reduce emissions;that, even if one eliminated 100% of Canada’s emissions, or 1.6% of the global total, it would affect the future level of global emissions now growing every year due to developments in other countries (nine of the ten largest country emitters are not on track to meet their political commitments to reduce emissions by 2030); andthat making GHG emission reduction the pre-eminent goal of Canadian public policy and thereby sacrificing Canada’s economic, social and national unity goals will be feasible without dire effects for the country as a whole.Each of these theses stretches credibility. The whole package is so flawed as to be far beyond belief. Yet, so powerful and entrenched is the ideology behind them that doubters are portrayed as the “denier” of facts.Every one of these false claims seems to have a life of its own, but they are like Dracula – almost impossible to kill without a stake through the heart. Canadians, we’re going to need a lot of wood!Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon dioxide', 'climate change']",2019/09/16
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/13/whats-holding-back-the-oilsands-a-response-to-andrew-leach/,Clive Edwards ,What’s Holding Back the Oilsands? A Response to Andrew Leach," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is  here.On September 4,  2019, the CBC posted an online article written by Andrew Leach that claimed that “some politicians and industry representatives” are misrepresenting the real issues facing the oil sands sector. I have seen no public response from the real experts in the Canadian oil industry, leading me to wonder (for the thousandth time) why the industry  refuses publicly to defend itself against its detractors. Failing that, and acknowledging that my knowledge is that of an outsider (like Mr. Leach), I would like to provide some factual and contextual information that calls some of his conclusions into question. Andrew Leach argued that the Canadian oil sands are affected by four main “issues”: The sustained decline in global crude oil price outlooks since 2014Constrained market access and the related uncertaintyThe global reduction in oil investment and the shift toward short-cycle investmentsClimate change “pressures”; specifically, the alleged movement to global decarbonization Let us examine each one of these. Crude Oil OutlookLeach observes, correctly, that oil sands investment is based less on what oil prices are today than on what they are expected to be over the life of the project. He notes that international oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and that the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has reduced its long-term forecast of crude oil prices in 2040 from US $230 per barrel to US $165 per barrel. So far, so good, except that he forgot to mention a few things about crude oil markets. One is that global crude oil demand is rising. In fact, since 2012, global crude oil demand has risen at the annual average rate of over one million barrels per day per year. This is the fastest and most sustained period of growth in history. In 2019, global oil demand is over 100 million barrels per day, its highest level in history. According to the EIA and other major sources of oil market analysis, that growth will not end any time soon, although it may slow due to global economic trends. Second, no one knows or ever has known with any confidence where international crude oil prices are heading. This much must be obvious to anyone who has followed trends in prices since 1973.  Too much is unknown on both the supply and demand sides. Since 2015, there has been a decline in global investment in upstream oil and gas. According to the International Energy Agency[1], actual investment declined from about US $820 billion in 2014 to about US $450 billion in 2016, before slightly increasing to about US $480 billion in 2018. Even though upstream industry costs have also declined, the reduction in prices has very much affected investment in both conventional and unconventional oil and gas exploration and development, except for oil shale development, and that mainly in the United States. The reduced investment in conventional and unconventional supply development, however, carries a risk, also noted by the IEA. The risk (or opportunity, depending on one’s perspective) is that, with continuing rapid growth in oil and natural gas demand, the world may well enter a period in the 2020’s when demand exceeds the available supply, and the imbalance causes a sharp upward spike in oil prices. Prices will almost certainly rise from today’s levels, but no one knows how far or how fast. Volatility breeds volatility. Constrained Market AccessAndrew Leach acknowledges that lack of pipeline access has affected confidence in Canadian oil sands investments. He neglects to mention that it has also sharply reduced the returns to producers and to provincial governments. Both the Fraser Institute and the Royal Bank of Canada estimated that lack of pipeline access cost Canadian oil producers over $20 billion in 2018. He wrote that, “It’s an open question what industry or political leaders can do to get pipeline built.” Really? Does he forget that the Trudeau government, through its political and regulatory decisions, killed the Northern Gateway Pipeline Project and the Energy East Pipeline Project and has added years of delay to the review of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project? Has he not heard of Bill C-69, that ended the longstanding independent and professional review of pipeline proposals by the National Energy Board and instituted in its place a two-part review, the first element of which will be a “review in principle” based on partisan considerations? Did he miss the statement by the Commission that recommended the changes to the NEB Act that, during the first phase review, climate policy and aboriginal “reconciliation” considerations should be preeminent? Perhaps he forgot to read the recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, in Raincoast Conservation Foundation v. Canada (Attorney General). Faced with claims that, among other things, the federal government had failed to consult adequately, the Government of Canada took no position for or against the motions of the project opponents, and offered no evidence, leaving Justice Stratas with no option but to conclude that the legal analysis could proceed no further.[2] If Andrew Leach had been paying attention, he would know very well that there is much that the Trudeau government could have done to get pipelines built, and it has consistently failed to do so. In passing, Andrew Leach casts doubt on claims that carbon prices are “at fault” in the declining investment rates in oil sands. For this, he offers as evidence that Suncor had average costs of 20 cents per barrel from “carbon policies in Alberta”, and that under the Alberta regime an oil sands plant could potentially “see revenues, not costs” from the sale of carbon credits. There are a few points he neglected to mention, the most important of which is that, as he noted at the start, it is long-term costs as well as prices that determine investment intentions. The carbon tax rate in Alberta is now $30 per tonne, but it will rise to $50 per tonne by 2022 under the federal backstop regime, and (contrary to Minister McKenna’s statements) is almost certainly going to rise to over $100 per tonne by 2030, assuming a continuation of present policies. Oil producers in other countries will not face those costs. Further, the potential to earn carbon credits, under the federal output-based pricing system, depends on a plant having the ability to reduce emissions intensity to lower than the rate prescribed by Environment and Climate Chance Canada; there are no guarantees that oil sands firms will benefit from such credits. Global Investment TrendsAndrew Leach notes correctly that, as oil prices have declined, investment has shifted towards projects with shorter life cycles, and this is bad news for capital intensive and long-cycle oil sands projects. Unfortunately, he does not add much context. That context is provided by the previously-referenced IEA World Energy Investment 2019 report. Notably, it found: “Energy supply spending has shifted broadly towards projects with shorter lead times, partly reflecting investor preferences for better managing capital at risk amid uncertainties over the future direction of the energy system.”In 2018, “a 4% rise in upstream oil and gas spending was underpinned by a higher oil price, and a shift to shorter-cycle projects and shale. Spending plans for 2019 point to a potential new wave of conventional projects; for the moment, project approvals are below the level needed to match robust demand.”Capital costs in upstream oil and gas are about 19% below where they were in 2010, on an inflation-adjusted basis.The main upstream investment trend since 2014 has been a shift in spending towards shale (tight oil and shale gas) in the United States. The signs in 2019 are that the fastest growth in upstream investment will be in conventional projects rather than in shale.“The oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on assets that generate cash flow more quickly but also that deplete at a more rapid pace. This could increase the possibility of market volatility.”Since mid-2016, the majors have enhanced their financial conditions due to a combination of higher oil prices, improvements in operational efficiency and cost reductions. In 2018, free cash flow reached almost US $90 billion, a level not seen since 2008. Thus, while there has been a shift towards shorter-cycle investments, the oil industry is sitting on a very large cash balance available to invest once the “future direction of the energy system” becomes clearer. Climate Policy “Pressures” and DecarbonizationAndrew Leach quotes from Shell’s 2018 Sustainability Report as though it were indicative of the intentions of the international petroleum industry. He also cites the views of the Carbon Disclosure Project, an environmental group that seeks, in effect, to bully institutional investors and shareholders in fossil fuel companies to change their investment habits. There is no question that there is a well-funded international campaign, partly backed by influential financial institutions, to discourage investment in the oil and gas industry. Is it working? I recently wrote an article on this subject, which interested readers can see here: https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/03/bullying-institutional-investors-does-it-work/ The more fundamental and empirically-testable thesis is whether the world is “decarbonizing” at the rate advocated by those who claim that humans are causing catastrophic global warming. Using the data from the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 2019 and the United Nations, we know that: In 2018, fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) constituted 84% of global primary energy demand.The share held by fossil fuels has declined at the rate of 1% per decade since 1990.Despite trillions of dollars in government subsidies and mandated ratepayer costs, renewable energy constitutes only 4% of global primary energy demand.Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy use rose by 3.4 billion tonnes per year from 2008 to 2018. Emissions grew by 2% in 2018, double the annual average rate of the previous decade.The non-OECD (i.e. developing) countries produced all of the emissions growth. By 2018, they produced 63% of the global total.The ten largest emitters in the world, in order, are: China, the United States, the European Union, India, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. None of the largest emitters, except the EU, is on track to meet the emissions targets they set for themselves for 2030.  This makes it highly likely that global emissions in 2030 will be well above, not below, those today. In other words, based on current trends, the UN’s goals will not be met. There is no “global decarbonization transition” occurring, at least not in the timeframe that the advocates favour. ConclusionThe “uncertainties about the future direction of the global energy system’ that are impairing investment in Canada’s oil sands are not primarily driven by market trends. They are driven by the undue political influence of decarbonization advocates, who are prepared to sacrifice economic prosperity to suit their vision of how fast the world’s energy system should change. The facts show that the energy consumers of the world are not following that vision, but it does not prevent the advocates from doing great harm to one of Canada’s most important resource industries. It is unfortunate when Canadian journalists, and the national broadcaster, act as apologists for decarbonization advocates, rather than supporters of Canada’s economy.~~~~[1] World Energy Investment 2019, International Energy Agency, Paris.[2] Arend Hoekstra and Thomas Isaac, Was Canada’s Defence in Raincoast Conservation v.

The weaker the arguments, the higher the tone will be. And emotions get to control. You want to belong to the good side.The phenomenon of Greta has the greatest impact and inspires several of the aforementioned. It would be strange to me to bully  a child. Unlike many in Greta Thunberg’s surroundings, she is completely and totally honest in her intent. However, a legitimate question is how the circus around her is possible.Who believes that Arnold Schwarzenegger, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker or alarmist Al Gore is so greatly impressed by her knowledge when she teaches them to the TV cameras? Greta has become a phenomenon and it benefits their agenda to be seen together with her. It is not possible to claim anything other than that a child is totally exploited. No matter how voluntary she may be and with the support of her family. Hope she doesn’t hurt.It is difficult to reach out with a more sensible message in the media. A bunch of middle-aged white men with placards, who urge the public to wake up , does not raise any emotional storms. And probably no support from any entrepreneur like Ingmar Rentzhog either.Nevertheless, we should think about how we managed this long. The UN man Maurice Strong already said in 1972 that we have ten years to prevent the climate catastrophe. Now 2019, forty six years and a number of alarm reports later, we are told we have twelve years.Group pressure and group thinking are psychological concepts. In their extreme expressions, they can get usually wise and educated people to act idiotically. (Compare the Macchiarini scandal). Acting against peer pressure requires courage and integrity. It is difficult and costly to break. Both for researchers, politicians and media people.The UN is hardly known to succeed in its core missions. Every report from the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) has a politically negotiated Summary for Policy  Makers. It also includes an information strategy that covers everything from elementary school to universities, the media, the public and politics. This is precisely a task they have succeeded to the extent that there is now a concept such as climate anxiety. It affects children and youth most. The basis of the phenomenon of Greta’s enormous impact.Read the article in Teachers’ newspaper and be horrified. There are three teachers behind the debate article.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/12/no-right-to-know/,,No Right to Know," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and a former public servant and diplomat. His full bio is here. One of the foundational principles of democracy is that the public has a right to know. That right extends to what the government is doing and why. The practical application of this principle lies, in part, in the access that Parliament, the media and the general public have to information about the government’s policies, programs, revenues and expenditures. At the more detailed level, the “transparency” of government actions can be assured through the enforcement of the laws that govern public access to the information that the government has. Canada’s Access to Information Act is supposed to assure that access. Much of the time, the most valuable part of the information people seek is the analysis that underlies and justifies specific policies and actions. Governments are rightly expected to make decisions not just for political reasons to satisfy one group or constituency, but also based on evidence that the decisions taken will serve the broad public interest and are based on good advice. When a government refuses to provide such access, the public has good reason to be concerned. A Case in Point – Information about the Impact of Carbon Pricing on Canadians The implementation by the federal and provincial governments of various systems of carbon dioxide pricing is one of the central components of the current Canadian climate policy framework. Virtually all of the information issued by the federal government about the impact of carbon dioxide pricing, however, has been in the reports issued by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), all of which show that the pricing regimes will have generally low adverse impacts on the Canadian economy. I am a retired federal public servant who for several years worked on energy and environmental policy topics and for a brief period worked in Finance Canada. Based on this experience, I am well aware that the primary responsibility for assessing and analyzing the macroeconomic (i.e. all-economy) effects of major public policies lies with Finance Canada, not ECCC. On January 16, 2019, I wrote to Finance Canada seeking, under the Access to Information Act (ATIP), access to the documents containing analysis or comments by Finance Canada officials on the economic effects of carbon taxes on Canada. The period I requested correspondence from was January 1, 2017 to January 15, 2019. I received several notices stating that my request could not be answered within the timeframe normally required by the Act, which I protested. The Government’s Response In mid-September, 2019, eight months after my request, I received a response from Denise Brennan, Director of  the Access to Information and Privacy Division of Finance Canada enclosing a compact disk with some correspondence on it. I was astounded to find that, with one exception, the correspondence included bore little relationship to my request. The one document that was relevant was a memorandum from Sean Keenan of the Sales Tax Division to Andrew Marsland, Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, Tax Policy, concerning an attached report called the “Carbon Pricing Impact Write-Up”. This document was described as having been prepared jointly by officials of Finance Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada. In the event, almost every part of the document was blanked out except for the information that has already been published by the government. Notably, the entire section of analysis, including pages 191 to 238, were blanked out. The explanation given was that the information had been withheld in accordance with sections 14, 21(1) (a), and 21 (1) (b) of ATIP. Those sections relate to protection of information “injurious to the conduct by the government of federal-provincial relations”, “advice or recommendations developed by or for a government institution or minister of the Crown”, and “an account of consultations” in which officials participate. It is a travesty to suggest that the straight-forward analysis of economic impacts by itself fits under any of these exemptions. It is also simply unbelievable that Finance Canada at no time over the period January 1, 2017 to January 15, 2019 provided any analysis to the Minister of Finance Canada about the potential and actual macroeconomic effects of carbon taxation. In short, it seems highly likely that officials of Finance Canada deliberately denied my public access to information relating to the adverse effects of carbon dioxide pricing, in contravention of the  Act. One can only surmise that the delays in responding to the ATIP request, and the failure to reveal the contents of correspondence in accordance with the requirements of the Act, were motivated by political considerations; specifically, to avoid embarrassment to the government that would be caused if the true costs of the carbon taxing regime were revealed. As a former federal public servant, I am fully aware of the pressures that Ministers can place on officials to avoid the public release of information embarrassing to the government. I simply prefer that higher standards of integrity and non-partisanship prevail. I will write to the Office of the Information Commissioner to protest. Conclusion By denying my right, and by extension the public’s right, to fair disclosure of information about the impacts of carbon dioxide pricing, Finance Canada has helped the government to hide information that is of potentially great significance to an issue that will be prominent in the current federal election campaign. Carbon dioxide pricing will raise Canadians’ energy costs across the board, especially in the provinces and industries that rely heavily on oil, natural gas and coal. It will especially affect companies that bear the burden of additional taxes but will receive no rebates and will still have to compete with firms in countries with low or no carbon dioxide taxes, like the USA, Mexico and China, Canada’s three largest trading partners. Canadians should have the right to know what the government’s own economic experts warn about these impacts.  One can only conclude that the its intent is to hide bad news. By not allowing the information to be made public, the government has denied the public’s rights and undermined an important facet of our democracy. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['carbon tax'],2019/09/12

His full bio is here.Forget the Dream HouseSummaryAccording to a recent Abacus poll, the affordability of housing is the largest concern among young adults in Canada. Every quarter, RBC Economic Research publishes its survey of housing trends and affordability. In the report published in March 2019, RBC assessed the percentage of income needed by the average family to cover the costs of owning a home as 52%. So, on average, Canadians pay more than half their income on housing ownership costs.Cover Image licensed from Shutterstock. LINK TO FULL REPORT: Forget the Dream House FINAL Federal and provincial government policies under the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (PCF) will make matters considerably worse over the next decade. One PCF commitment is that federal, provincial and territorial governments will “work to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a ‘net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030.” The incremental costs of these changes will be high. Building an Energy Star home will cost an extra $8,000 to $10,000, an R2000 home costs $30,000-$40,000 and a net zero home $100,000-$150,000. Canadians build roughly 200,000 homes per year. In 2012, around 1400 of those homes were energy star certified. Less than 50 were R2000 certified and about 15 were considered net-zero. Assuming that the cost of household energy use is between $2,000 and $4,000 per year, an Energy Star home would take 10 to 20 years to payback. R2000 would take 15 to 30 years to payback, and net zero 25 to 50 years to payback. Further, most homeowners only plan to live in a house for around five years, and so they will not get to experience the energy savings benefits. Using the low end of the estimated additional cost of a net-zero house of $100,000 per unit and the estimate of 200,000 average new home sales per year, moving to mandate the use of net-zero homes in Canada by 2030 would impose an additional $20 billion per year cost on the Canadian economy. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'housing affordability', 'housing retrofits', 'net zero']",2019/09/08
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/03/bullying-institutional-investors-does-it-work/,,Bullying Institutional Investors – Does It Work?," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019   Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant and diplomat. Robert’s full bio can be read here. Financial markets constitute an increasingly prominent front in the war waged by those who believe that humans are causing catastrophic global warming against fossil fuel companies. One of their strategies has been to harness the power of institutional investors – such as mutual funds, pension funds and insurers – to lower the share prices of companies that do not “do enough” to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The mechanisms used include socially responsible investment funds (SRI or “green funds”) and initiatives such as the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) with its Investors Network on Climate Risk (INCR) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). These organizations have almost unlimited funds at their disposal to wage attacks on the energy industry and on large energy consumers; they can far outspend not only the few organizations skeptical about the climate catastrophe thesis but also many governments. They can influence investors with trillions of dollars at their disposal. Further, every year, their activities grow. Only a few academic studies have been done on the results of their efforts and even fewer empirical assessments of how much change they have achieved. However, I was recently made aware of a paper by Adam Harmes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that offered a thoughtful discussion of the theory behind the effort.[1] This article provides a simplified summary of the 20-page Harmes paper. Those who wish to learn more should refer to the longer paper. The Essence of the Theory Behind “Green Investment” Promotion The advocates of green investing with respect to climate change base their actions on a number of premises: That human-induced GHG emissions will cause higher global temperatures and other climate effects that will have adverse, potentially catastrophic, consequences;That the present and future damages associated with GHG emissions can be calculated in present value terms;That the global costs from climate change can cause genuine financial risks for firms and investors today;That once these risks are identified, institutional investors can promote emissions reduction through a two-stage process: first, using their power as shareholders to pressure firms to disclose their exposure to climate risks; and second, after disclosure, by pressuring companies into incorporating the climate risks into their investment decision-making. Specifically, the advocates of this approach want to promote “investment switching” (i.e. reduction of investment in high-emissions firms and activities and an increase of investment in so-called “green” or “clean” firms and activities often related to wind and solar energy and other favoured businesses). The mechanism by which this allegedly could work is by changing the price of the firm’s shares and thus bringing shareholder and Board of Governors pressure to bear on corporate management. Rarely do studies of this assess the actual incentives created by climate “risk” or the likely effects of the pressures applied to different types of institutional investors. The article aims to assess the two main assumptions that underpin investor environmentalism through carbon disclosure: the power of institutional investors and the “business case” for companies to invest in climate change mitigation. The Power of Institutional Investors There are different types of institutional investors; the incentives that drive investment decisions vary considerably among them. Mutual fund companies sell mutual funds to the public and/or manage institutional funds on behalf of pensions, insurers and foundations. A growing number of them (over 60%) delegate the management of their portfolios to external investment companies. Pension funds are composed of trustees who oversee the fund, as well as fund managers who conduct the actual asset selection. They have a legally-mandated “fiduciary duty” to minimize risk, maximize returns and preserve capital. They also tend to use both in-house and external fund managers. Insurers are publicly-listed companies that also have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize revenues for both shareholders and policy holders. The fourth category includes large hedge funds and private equity funds, as well as various foundations. Hedge funds and private equity funds operate in a more competitive environment than other investment companies. A significant finding is that, like corporate managers, fund managers operate in a “structural context” that severely limits their ability to take into account any non-market investment criteria when assessing investments. If the fund manager did so and the fund underperformed compared to others, even for only a year, the fund manager would be out of a job. Active fund managers simply are not able to take climate change into account for non-market or “ethical” reasons. After examining the institutional environments in which these different institutional investors operate and what specifically motives the people who make the investment decisions, Harmes observes: “Overall, the specific incentives and constraints faced by different institutional investors lead to two initial conclusions about the potential effectiveness of investor environmentalism. The first is that, with the exception of certain public defined benefit pension funds, SRI funds and foundations, most ‘mainstream’ institutional investors will not be able to promote climate change mitigation for non-market or ethical reasons, although some may do so in a ‘soft” manner for their own reputational reasons. While most proponents of investor environmentalism emphasize the business rather than the ethical case, this conclusion is relevant in terms of empirically assessing the actual practices of investor environmentalism. Specifically, if the investors who are most strongly promoting climate change mitigation are primarily the public defined-benefit pension funds, SRI funds and foundations, it provides an indication of the weakness of the business case, as they are likely doing so for ethical rather than business reasons, even though they may discursively frame their activities in business terms.” Even worse for the theory of environmental investing, if a number of ‘ethically-motivated” investors sold off the shares of a company that they considered to have poor environmental performance, causing the stock price to drop, other investors, through a process known as ‘arbitrage”, would view that company as under-valued in market terms and would quickly purchase its shares, causing the stock price to soon return to its original value. “Even if all institutional investors, with the exception of hedge funds, could be convinced to allocate their capital on an ethical or reputational basis, their investment-switching activities would still be rendered ineffective by hedge funds.” The Business Case for Companies to Invest in Climate Change Mitigation The business case for investor environmentalism argues that climate change already creates real financial costs for firms, in the form of six varieties of climate risk: regulatory risk, exposure to the physical effects of climate change, product risk, risk to reputation, energy costs and exposure to climate change litigation. (Those who take a skeptical view might note that most of these risks are the direct result, not of climate change, but of the political activities of the advocates of climate alarm.) The case further argues that disclosure of these costs will create market incentives for institutional shareholders. Harmes considers that the business case fails at the theoretical level. Exposure to Costs and Regulatory Risks The largest emitters do not bear the costs of the emissions they produce; they are borne by the world.Measuring a firm’s carbon dioxide emissions or broader “environmental footprint” is not the same as putting a price on them; someone has to calculate this value, but even if they do, externality costs are not real in accounting terms, because firms do not pay them unless governments try to impose the costs in other ways. If companies face the risk of being regulated or taxed by governments due to their emissions, why would these risks and costs not create an incentive for the firms to act even without investor environmentalism? In countries where governments already impose carbon taxes and stringent environmental regulations, why is investor environmentalism also needed? Exposure to the Physical effects of Climate Change Exposure to extreme weather events (assuming present emissions even cause extreme weather events) will only affect a firm’s costs in certain circumstances; even if the costs were generally felt, this would create an incentive to pay for adaptation that would specifically benefit the firm, not mitigation. Product Risk The product risk is the risk that a company will experience declining sales of its “climate-unfriendly” products (e.g. “I am going to stop riding in oil-powered vehicles to protest Shell’s production of gasoline!”). More likely, product risk is simply an extension of regulatory risk and therefore is dependent on government action. Again, If the government is already acting, why is investor activism needed? Risk to Reputation Most risks to reputation that lead to investment-switching result from specific environmental events – such as oil spills, chemical leaks or illegal dumping – rather than from a general lack of action on broadly-caused environmental issues like climate change. It is almost impossible for investors to assess an individual firm’s climate-related reputational risk. “Ethical consumerism” is limited to a small number of participating consumers; where it has been successful, it is generally the result of NGO campaigns. Energy Costs The risk of “energy cost” increase is generally related to the potential for new and higher energy taxes. Where it concerns increased energy market prices, the fossil fuel producers stand to gain, not lose. Litigation Risk The risk of litigation is primarily in the United States (although it is coming to Canada). Here the claims of liability are at best uncertain and often outside “the frontiers of existing legal doctrines”. Some Real-Life Evidence When the Carbon Disclosure Project sought to survey its signatory investors on the extent to which they made use of CDP data, only 80 of 385 even responded to the survey. In other words, simple participation in an investor environmentalism initiative should not be viewed as evidence that investors are incorporating climate change into their investment decision-making. A 2008 study on investor environmentalism among UK fund managers found that “virtually without exception, the interviewees cited the EU ETS (European Union Emission Trading System) as the critical – and, in many cases, the only – driver for them explicitly to consider climate change in their investment analysis.” In other words, fund managers are far more likely to respond to present financial costs than to prospective and poorly-defined future risks. Conclusion Harmes concludes that the potential of using institutional investors to create real financial incentives for climate change mitigation, through share price performance, has been considerably overestimated. There is not even a strong theoretical case for why “carbon disclosure” should work in this regard. “This suggests that, even if all firms disclosed carbon risks in a complete and usable way, mainstream investors are unlikely to incorporate them due to the inherent weakness of the business case, while the actions of ethically-motivated investors will be counteracted by arbitrage.” Harmes’ article, of course, has not persuaded the large number of well-funded SRIs, politically-motivated investment funds, and certain international finance organizations from continuing to “name and shame”, intimidate, harass, and lobby against investors in fossil fuel industries and other firms that fail to adhere to the catastrophe thesis. Even if such bullying tactics have only limited chances of success in altering investor behaviour, they seem intended to serve a broader political objective.~~~~[1] Adam Harmes. “The Limits of Carbon Disclosure: Theorizing the Business Case for Investor Environmentalism”.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/08/29/satirical-briefing-for-prime-minister-elizabeth-may/,Duane Pendergast ,Satirical Briefing for Prime Minister Elizabeth May," Contributed by Robert Lyman ©2019In a recent apocalyptic tweet, Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party, warned Canadians that we would face “unsafe levels” of heat and “climate catastrophe” if we do not transition off fossil fuels before the next election. It has charitably been interpreted that “by the next election” she meant four year from now (i.e. 2023). I thought that it might be interesting to imagine the briefing note that would be sent to Prime Minister May by the Clerk of the Privy Council in the (unlikely) event that she were to win the forthcoming federal election and ask for advice as to how to implement the transition.MemorandumTo: Prime Minister MayFrom: B.O. Crat, Clerk of the Privy CouncilSubject: Transition to a Non-Fossil Fuel EconomyThis note is In response to your request for a briefing on the measures that may be taken to honour your government’s commitment during the election campaign to transition the Canadian economy off of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) within four years. Here, I wish to give you a preliminary report based on internal consultations among the federal departments primarily involved. These included Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Finance Canada, Justice Canada and National Defence Canada.A full inventory of the measures required and a proposed plan of action will take considerably more time to develop. However, In view of the urgency, I thought you would wish to have an overview of our main conclusions.Planning to end the use of fossil fuels in Canada in four years is like the challenge given to various think tanks in the 1960’s of planning for the first year after a nuclear war. It takes one into the realm of the previously unthinkable.To state the basic facts, about 70% of the energy Canadians use is based on fossil fuels, the rest being supplied by hydro-electricity, nuclear energy, and some wind and solar energy.The combustion of coal, generally for electric power generation and in steel making, is the most carbon dioxide-intensive of the fossil fuel uses. Major efforts have already been made by the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia to phase out existing coal-fired power plants, but in some cases the currently planned phase out will not be completed before 2030. Shutting down all existing coal-fired power plants within four years would be feasible, but extremely costly, as many of them still have several years left on their economic lives. The Federal government could pass a regulation imposing this requirement under the Canadian Environmental Protect Act.  Unfortunately, this regulatory action would probably prompt legal challenges from Alberta and Saskatchewan. A federal-provincial dispute would result, which would require a considerable amount of the Government’s time and potentially delay implementation by months or years.As the power now produced by coal plants could not be replaced by natural gas-fired plants, the affected provinces would have to replace them by building solar and wind plants. Unfortunately, the power from such plants, in all the provinces, is intermittent and unreliable. Without backup natural gas plants or significant additional hydro and nuclear capacity, several provinces would henceforth face serious electricity reliability problems (i.e. frequent blackouts and brownouts in both summer and winter).Building more solar and wind plants, in the absence of proven and affordable bulk electricity storage systems, would only increase the risk of supply interruptions. To build additional hydro and nuclear power plants, in the face of existing regulatory and political constraints (notably from the Government’s core constituencies) would take at least ten years and probably much longer. In the meantime, residential and commercial electricity ratepayers would probably face sharply higher rates and be at permanent risk of supply loss, including during the heaviest power use periods (i.e. the coldest days of winter and hottest days of summer). There are several industries across Canada that depend on reliable electricity to operate. The most likely outcome of reduced reliability is that these firms would move their operations out of Canada. That would, of course, help to reduce emissions, but it would have quite noticeable impacts on employment and revenue generation for the Government.  It is possible, in other words, but rather problematic.Oil is used primarily for transportation and for petrochemical feedstocks. Passing legislation prohibiting the production, import and sale of oil and refined products is theoretically possible, although Justice Canada still has to evaluate the possible liabilities of the Government.  Enforcing such legislation would be an unprecedented compliance challenge. Not to put too fine a point on the matter, it would make enforcing the former anti-marijuana laws look like a cakewalk.Without oil, a small fraction of the population might be able to afford electric vehicles (and thereby be frustrated by the unreliable electricity supply), but the majority would be left with the choice of walking, riding bicycles or horses, or driving across the border to the U.S. to fill up their vehicles. There simply are not enough horses in Canada to provide the personal or freight transportation needed, and it would take at least 40 years if not more to breed that many horses. The public transit system, which now runs mostly on oil fuels, would also have to either shut down or begin a long, slow and costly electrification that would take several decades to complete. Getting around in winter would be a nightmare, especially in large cities. There would, of course, be no aircraft, so transporting goods to remote areas would take months, not hours, and moving people across the country  by steam locomotive (when they could be built and distributed) several days. Air travel for holidays and recreation, regrettably, must end. Electricity cannot be stored so as to power marine vessels, so all existing marine vessels must be converted to steam power and sail. As this will take much more than four years to effect, the shortage of timely freight transportation will have further significant adverse impacts on the economy.Oil and natural gas are the essential feedstocks for petrochemicals. Petrochemical products number in the thousands and include plastics, soaps, detergents, solvents (such as paint thinner), paints, drugs, fertilizer, pesticides, explosives, synthetic fibers and rubbers, and flooring and insulating materials. Eliminating their production would entail the shutting down of plants in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec.It would, of course, be possible to import these products from other countries, but it would be necessary to develop new horse-drawn tanks.Natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, as well as crop drying and electricity generation. The federal government could pass legislation to ban the production, sale and import of natural gas. As it would take several years, if not decades, to develop alternative heating systems, there is a substantial risk that thousands of people would experience adverse health effects and possibly die of cold in wintertime. The provinces, and no doubt some constituencies favoured by the Opposition, would object to this.Much of Canada’s oil and gas consumption occurs during the process of producing these energy sources. Shutting down all oil and gas production in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia. Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories would eliminate a major source of revenue for the federal treasury and create a rather large unemployment problem, especially in western Canada. It seems highly likely that this would result in legal challenges and possibly other retaliatory measures by the provincial governments. A well-designed communications strategy demonstrating how the Government is saving the planet will be one part of a concerted federal response.I noted previously that the federal government could pass legislation, but that depends on having majority support for this in Parliament and broad public support in the country at large. Based on recent polls, I regret to advise you that it is extremely unlikely that a majority of citizens would support these measures. Indeed, based on several formal and informal polls, it appears highly likely that many citizens would actually take hostile action against the Government.  This might make it necessary to invoke the War Measures Act and impose severe penalties on the recalcitrant citizens. Unfortunately, far more of them appear to have licenced firearms than do the citizens who form the Government’s core supporters.  In extremis, if a substantial portion of the public were to revolt, the Government could order the Canadian army to move tanks into the streets. The really bad news, Prime Minister, is that tanks run on diesel fuel.———Back in the realm of reality:Look Before You Leap into Climate Emergency Modehttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Look-Before-you-Leap-into-Emergency-Mode.pdfEnergy Policy Needs to Transition to Reality:https://www.thegwpf.org/energy-policy-needs-to-transition-to-reality/  Climate Change Policy – A Threat to CanadaShocking Realityhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shocking-Reality-FINAL.pdfEnergy Revolution?

Stéphane Perrault,Re: ENGO charity spending during the election period and reference to climate change;Thank you to Elections Canada for recognizing that climate change has become a political issue. Since environmental non-governmental organizations/charities have disproportionate financial resources, media power, and social influence, they significantly sway public opinion on a highly contentious and partisan issue. As outlined below, the environmental charities’ claims are proving to be highly controversial. Canadian scientists, and those from around the world, have very strong evidence that human industrial activity is not the primary cause of global warming. Equally troubling is the political efforts by these charities to create a “climate change emergency” where one does not exist. Scientists have recently called for the authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SR15 report to calm public fears as there is no ‘climate deadline.’[1] Plenty of evidence refutes the claims of the Canadian Climate Change Report (CCR2019).[2] “Climate emergency” is a theme dreamt up by a clinical psychologist to re-brand the issue, not a scientist.[3]  Global media are making coordinated efforts on this faulty theme through “Covering Climate Now.”[4] [5] This press-propaganda campaign is contrary to all principles of Freedom of the Press and democracy. The much vaunted 2°Celsius target (to allegedly keep earth’s temperature stable) was arbitrarily set by an economist, long before any adequate scientific or satellite assessments of global climate.[6] More importantly, there is no consensus that human industrial activity is mainly responsible for global warming or climate change. Faulty premises lead to poor public policy on climate as outlined in our report.[7] Here are some key points in this highly political topic. The Science on Climate is Complex and UncertainAs the IPCC itself stated in the 3rd Assessment report: “In climate modelling and research, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled, non-linear, chaotic system and that therefore long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” The IPCC reported in 2013 there had been 15 years of hiatus in global warming; despite a significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. This led Dr. Judith Curry and other scientists to affirm that: “Carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can fine tune climate.”[8] There is no consensus about the cause of climate change.[9] Environmental Charities have more money than political parties combinedFew Canadians realize that ENGO, tax-subsidized charities have more financial power than political parties combined. From 2000-2018, the top 40 ENGOs and EnviroLaw counterparts received almost $11.4 billion in revenues. Total revenues received by all four main federal political parties over the period was about $631 million. Revenues received by the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts over the period were over 18 times the revenues received by all federal political parties. [10] Our four reports on the ENGO industry show that their political, social and financial power is overwhelming.[11] Environmental Charities have been funded by foreign interests that also fund and influence academics and the media. These ENGOs have claimed that climate change is a “crisis” for over a decade now, and many of them have been funded by, or are party to, the foreign “Tar Sands Campaign”[12] [13] or the ClimateWorks “Design to Win”[14] program. This is a global plan by foreign green billionaires to create a global cap and trade system, carbon pricing and to put $12 trillion in their vested interest renewables (wind and solar) on the power grid, largely by demarketing the use of coal, natural gas and oil/oilsands.[15] [16]  Everything in the modern world, including wind turbines and solar panels, requires fossil fuels in order to exist. Renewables cannot support even the most basic energy needs of society.[17] As Ottawa energy policy consultant, Robert Lyman explains, we need to ‘transition to reality.’[18] Prof. Emeritus Dr. Vaclav Smil, a world-renown energy expert, says: “Energy Revolution? More like a crawl.”[19] The push for renewables relies almost entirely on the claim that the use of fossil fuels will lead to a climate catastrophe, even though the scientific evidence does not support this claim. The IPCC, in correspondence to us, confirm that they have no peer-reviewed studies supporting the claim that renewables are a suitable replacement for conventional energy supply.[20] As noted in Dr. Matthew Nisbet’s paper on the ClimateWorks partners, the green billionaires also fund most academics and most non-profit journals.[21] ENGOs lead Canadians down a path to danger. Can Canada survive climate change policy? Climate change policies have negatively affected Canada. [22] The undue influence of ENGOs and their financial power and associated vested interests have driven this agenda. Are other nations meeting their Paris Agreement targets? No. Most have no intention of doing so. Thus, Canada – a vast, resource-rich nation – puts it natural wealth and domestic sovereignty at risk for ‘green’ ideology alone.[23] Will Canada’s contribution make a difference to global climate? No.  It is a case of Futile Folly – “…extraordinarily expensive and dangerous political grandstanding…. Canadians deserve better.” [24] Will Canadians get hundreds of dollars in rebates annually from carbon taxes? Not compared to the hundreds of dollars they will lose. The Parliamentary Budget Office notes that the carbon price will have to rise from the 2022 price of $50/tonne to $102/t by 2030 in order for Canada to reach its self-imposed target of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.[25] Competitor nations like China have a $2/t carbon tax, the world average is $8/t, and the US, our largest trading partner has a $0/t carbon tax.  Presently, Canadian fuel taxes alone equal a $192/t carbon tax. Yet, the ENGO charity Ecojustice wants the unattainable Paris GHG targets enshrined in law.[26] You have received an open letter from a large group of scientists[27] in support of ENGO advertising on climate change; claiming it is not a political issue and not debatableThis, in fact, is the crux of the matter before you.  Climate science is not settled. As shown, climate change has become a highly politicized issue. No matter the number of signatories, as Dr. Nir Shaviv has said: “Science is not a democracy. Science is about evidence.” [28] Natural causes have always had a major role in climate change. It is clear that the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change, not you, not CO2.[29] Canadian ENGOs have far too much financial and media power and are rife with single-minded ideology that is not representative of the robust evidence of natural influence on climate being greater than that of humankind. Climate change science must be debated. Powerful, foreign-or-vested interest-funded ENGOs must not take the spotlight. Friends of Science Society is an apolitical organization that advocates for open, civil debate on climate science and related energy policies.  Thank you for the review of our submission. Sincerely,Friends of Science SocietyP.O.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/08/25/greenland-climate-catastrophe-melt-debunked/,karabar ,Greenland Climate Catastrophe Melt Debunked," © 2019Friends of Science Society has received a number of inquiries about a recent terrifying article in the Washington Post. To help calm people down, we are publishing a response to one of our readers.The statement “if Greenland’s Ice mass would melt ..” is as meaningless as “if the Moon crashed into the Earth …” or “if pigs could fly …”.The total volume of the Greenland ice sheet is approximately 2,900,000 km3. Its mass is 2,900,000 Giga tonnes (Gt). The IPCC estimates the ice sheet lost 215 Gt per year over the period 2002 – 2011, corresponding to 0.6 mm annual sea level rise.  At that rate it would take 2,900,000/215 = 13,488 years to melt.However, there are several ways to estimate the rate of ice melt and the IPCC only uses the method that gives the highest melt rate. This paper says “Luthcke and others (2006) also reported a mass gain of 54 Gt a–1 at elevations >2000 m and a loss of 155 Gt a–1 at elevations <2000 m, with an overall net mass loss of the GIS from 2003 to 2005 of 101 ± 16 Gt a–1.  Using this lower rate of ice loss, it would take 2,900,000/101 = 28,713 years to melt.This paper says “The net balance changed from a small loss of 7 ± 3 Gt a–1 in the 1990s to 171 ± 4 Gt a–1 for 2003–07, contributing 0.5 mm a–1 to recent global sea-level rise. This rate implies 16,959 years to melt.The FUND integrated assessment model calculates the social cost of sea level rise for the global total and 16 regions including Canada. The sea level impact for Canada of sea level rise according to FUND is US$-22 million. The impact of storms, agriculture, health and energy combined is US$8,735 million. [I applied a correction to the energy impact due to new research.] The positive impact of these sectors is 395 times greater than the negative impact of sea level rise.On a global basis, the positive impact of storms, agriculture, health and energy combined is 109 times greater than the negative impact of sea level rise.  As a fraction of GDP, the cost of sea level rise from 2018 to 2100 is 0.004% of global GDP in 2100.Therefore, there is no reason to fear sea level rise.Ken Gregory, P.Eng.Friends of ScienceSeventeen years of providing independent        climate science information ———-Related post by Ron Clutz of Science Matters:https://rclutz.wordpress.com/2019/08/25/greenland-glaciers-history-vs-hysteria/ Related post by Maria Assunção Araújo  – Porto 2018 Basic Climate Science ConferenceGreenland Maria_Assunção_Araújo Porto Conf 2018 If you like our work, we would love to have you join us as a member and donate to the cause of common sense on science and energy policies.

Stanford University physicist Elliott Bloom then comments.“The whole point of science is to question accepted dogmas. For that reason, I respect Willie Soon as a good scientist and a courageous citizen.” —Freeman J. Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics, Institute for Advanced Study; Templeton Prize Laureate“I am writing to express my deep admiration and respect for Dr. Willie Soon, a fine astrophysicist and human being…. As Willie has shown in many ways, observational facts do not fit the CO2 dogma, and an enormous amount of evidence points to the Sun as a much more important driver of climate…. Willie was right—whatever the cause of changing temperature, the main driver cannot be the concentration of atmospheric CO2.” —William Happer, Chairman, Presidential Committee on Climate Security; Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics Emeritus, Princeton University; Member, National Academy of SciencesWillie Soon is a geophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He received his Ph.D. (with distinction) in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California, and he has been Astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory; Senior Scientist at the George C. Marshall Institute; Senior Visiting Fellow at the State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science at Xiamen University; and Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Putra Malaysia. The author of 90 scientific papers, he has IEEE received the Nuclear & Plasma Sciences Society Award, Rockwell Dennis Hunt Award, Smithsonian Institution Award, Courage in Defense of Science Award, Petr Beckmann Award for Courage and Achievement in Defense of Scientific Truth and Freedom, and Frederick Seitz Memorial Award.Elliott D. Bloom is Professor Emeritus in the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) at Stanford University and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He was a member of the SLAC team with Jerome I. Friedman, Henry W. Kendall and Richard E. Taylor who received the Nobel Prize in Physics.

LINK TO FULL REBUTTAL: Case Dismissed Open Letter to Law Professors A1FINAL In this document – “Case Dismissed…”  we rebut these claims with evidence showing that:Climate, temperature and weather evidence does not support the law professors’ claimsOfficial scientific documents by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) do not support the climate claims as presented by these law professorsThe degree of human influence on climate change is uncertain and undeterminedThe global warming ‘hiatus’ of ~20 years began before the Kyoto Accord on greenhouse gas reductions was ever ratified.Consumers voluntarily use fossil fuels and related products to benefit their lives while governments reap huge financial benefitsThe proposed legislation might create risk of serious unintended consequences for cities and taxpaying citizensThere is no evidence that extreme weather events are related to human causation on climateFossil fuel companies pay exorbitant taxes and engage in substantial charitable donations to universitiesThe law professors engage in faulty logic on the law, the Paris Agreement and global emissionsThe case should be dismissed on grounds of nonsense, not pushed forward based on nuisanceThe alleged harm of Canada vs the world is not well understood by these law professorsDramatic findings about oil companies’ apparent foreknowledge of fossil fuel causation and climate change are divorced from historic contextSuing a reliable provider of essential services would benefit citizens and cities in what way?Human influence on climate is only evident in computer climate models (simulations) so there is no evidenceThe law professors claim their legislative proposal would stimulate ‘sensible climate policies’ but fail to tell us what those might be.In conclusion, Canadians must reject the 28 law professors’ proposal for climate accountability legislation as the proposal is not founded on evidence and may also result in distressing unintended consequences. Without reliable supply of fossil fuels, modern society would collapse into chaos and anarchy within days.As the saying goes, “Be careful what you wish for, you might get it.”—–Red Flags All Over the Climate MovementShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'litigation', 'oil and gas', 'oil sands']",2019/08/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/08/18/factsmatter-ask-elizabeth-may-these-questions/,karabar ,#FactsMatter – Ask Elizabeth May these Questions," Contributed by Michelle Stirling ©2019For the past few days, all major TV news stations in Canada have been tweeting a clip of Green Party leader, Elizabeth May, bloviating about not leaving fossil fuel workers behind in the Green Party’s proposed “Mission Possible” plan.I say ‘bloviating’ because she offers no evidence to support any of her claims – and worse, the media and journalists whose mandate is to make sure we are not being fed ‘fake news’ …just let her go on and on!Ask the woman a few hard questions.Here’s one for starters – since the world runs almost entirely on fossil fuels, with wind and solar providing a tiny percentage of energy generation, why does she think oil and gas and oil sands workers would not be employed – if pipelines to market were built?Ask Elizabeth May what wind turbines and solar panels are made from.  Ask her.  Ask her why oil and gas and coal workers…and oil sands workers…would not be employed when no renewables are possible without scads of oil, natural gas, coal and oil sands?These are not tough questions – and they are not meant to embarrass the Green Party leader. But if Elizabeth May is making claims that are based on unicorns and fairy dust – and planning to impose these on the Canadian taxpayer, shouldn’t we know if they are at all workable or not?And Ms. May claims the Green Party will not leave any one behind.Ask her about her days in the Sierra Club as Executive Director -from 1989 to 2006 – and the Sierra Club’s role in pushing for the Ontario Green Energy Act.https://www.pembina.org/reports/plugging-in-ontario-report.pdfIn Robert Lyman’s report on the Ontario Government’s Climate Legacy, he documents the almost absolute destruction of the industrial heartland through that plan.With the current push for public policy to adopt ‘green energy’ schemes, it is time to reflect on the Ontario experience. Ontario’s disastrous electricity policy has been publicized and commented on extensively by many sources, so this is not news. What is news is to lay the blame squarely at the door of its climate policy motivation, and, perhaps, to remind people of high the bill has been – $9 billion for poor contracting practices, $133 billion in global adjustment fees from 2015 to 2032 (at least 20 per cent of which relates to renewables), $3.6 billion to build the “smart grid and smart meters”, up to $55 billion in deferred costs that will hit future ratepayers, and 75,000 lost industrial jobs. That is quite the tally for zero global environmental benefit.Most Canadians think the #TarSandsCampaign is just about Alberta crying over collapsed international oil markets and coming up with conspiracy theories.  I ask you to look at the players funded by the tar sands campaign and realize that it has attacked every part of the Canadian economy – and look who the consistent players are.Seventy Five THOUSAND Ontarians were left behind by the Green Energy Act – promoted by Elizabeth May’s Sierra Club.That’s pretty close to the 100,000 Albertans left behind by the NDP and Liberal climate policies…and look who spoke at the Sierra Club sponsored 2010 Zombie Duck rally.Upon Elizabeth May leaving the Sierra Club to run for the Green Party, Board President Louise Comeau noted, “Elizabeth has led the Club at the national level from its infancy to the enormously effective entity it is today.”Sierra Club is so effective that it also helped put 7,000 coal workers out of a job in Alberta and is responsible for the devastation of 30 coal industry communities.The Sierra Club has been funded for millions of dollars by billionaires with vested interests in renewables to demarket coal, oil, gas and oil sands.  http://leftexposed.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2014-Senate-Billionaire-Club-Report.pdf Now Ms. May, in her new incarnation as Green Party leader, is promising more of the same in terms of unworkable green policies…yet claiming no worker will be left behind!Elizabeth May also claims that geothermal can become a big player in providing energy – but if you look at the global reality of geothermal, even in the US, the world’s largest geothermal generation market…..geothermal only provides 0.4% of the power generation.Geothermal for Canada – Questions and ChallengesAnd what of wind and solar in the US?  After 40 years and TRILLIONS of dollars spent on wind and solar in the US, wind generates only 6.6% of US energy and solar – thermal and PV combined? Just 1.6% – and that’s in a country with far better solar and wind resources than Canada.Not to mention, looks like Ms. May is leading Canadians down the garden path to a dead end. The CEO of Iberdrola says the renewables sector is heading for an Enron-style endgame. Enron was a huge energy company in the US that collapsed into ashes due to a combination of fake holdings and off-the-books accounting – fraudulent accounting.Enron was also one of the main advocates for various cap and trade, carbon pricing and renewables schemes that we see today.Back in the world of reality…Oil, gas, coal and oil sands grow in demand worldwide…but Canada just can’t get these resources to market like our competitors can – and none of our competitor nations are trying to be climate leaders….they are all trying to get more market share.One way to do that of course, is for any of our competitor to fund environmental groups like the > 100 international groups that participate in the tar sands campaign to drive off investors, shakedown banks and insurance companies…to block Canada from world markets….and to demoralize Canada’s industrial workforce.If you want to know what Canada will look like after the ‘go-green’ environmental groups are done with our country, just look at Ontario. Crippled. Nearly bankrupt.Maybe that debacle wouldn’t have happened if the media had been more critical, more questioning, more demanding of the facts instead of fawning over enviro-celebs.We have many reports with these facts – but the media have mostly locked us out because an influential PR guy who is an Al Gore acolyte has successfully labelled us as ‘deniers’.So, you read our reports. Make up your mind for yourself.  Instead of an eco-activist making up things, we rely on Robert Lyman, a former public servant of 27 years, 10 years a diplomat, who provided non-partisan advice to government at a time when experts were helping the government, not activists.Then demand that your local media report on the facts and ask the hardball questions of ALL politicians and environmental groups.  After all, it’s YOUR money, your jobs and your environment they are toying with – you will be left behind and hurting if you don’t speak up now.For Friends of Science Society, I’m Michelle Stirling.Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists, AAAS, and APS.Read our reports:Climate Change Your Mindhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/01/climate-change-your-mind-rebutting-canadian-governments-climate-report/The Stakes Are Too High to be Tricked by the Numbershttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/19/the-stakes-are-too-high-to-be-tricked-by-the-numbers/Futile Folly: Canada’s Climate Policy Goals in the Global Contexthttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/05/futile-folly-canadas-climate-policy-goals-in-the-global-context/Ontario Government Climate Legacyhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/the-ontario-government-climate-legacy/Look Before You Leap into Climate Emergency Modehttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/13/look-before-you-leap-into-climate-emergency-mode/Shocking Realityhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/19/shocking-reality-electrification-and-decarbonization-net-zero-pathway-to-economic-and-energy-catastrophe/Climate Science Basic Issueshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/29/climate-change-some-basic-issues/?highlight=Don%20MortonIn the Dark on Renewableshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/In-the-Dark-on-Renewables-FINAL-Nov-18-2018.pdfTransition to Realityhttps://www.thegwpf.org/energy-policy-needs-to-transition-to-reality/Related: Oak Foundation grant databases(s) (downloaded from their public site)grants-env oak pdf 75 pageoak-foundation-all-current-grants_latest-update-18.03.2019ClimateWorks  – ‘green’ billionaires and their influence on public policy via funding local ENGOsClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165Nisbet  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.524 Nisbet (Not paywalled)https://web.northeastern.edu/matthewnisbet/2018/05/21/summary-of-strategic-philanthropy-in-the-post-cap-and-trade-years-reviewing-u-s-foundation-climate-and-energy-funding-at-wires-climate-change/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Elizabeth May']",2019/08/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/08/18/holtzbrinck-bertelsmann-agents-of-german-climate-imperialism/,,Holtzbrinck & Bertelsmann: Agents of German Climate Imperialism," Op-ed contributed by William Walter Kay BA LL B ©2019 Climate Change dates to a 1970s Franco-German petroleum rationing initiative aimed at righting trade balances. In the 1980s it morphed into a petroleum and coal phase-out campaign ostensibly aimed at protecting Earth’s atmosphere from CO2 overload.European climate campaigners seek to level the playing field between their resource-poor homelands and the Anglosphere’s natural energy superpowers. German-led states use Climate Change to enhance renewable energy and electro-mobility exports. Success hinges on controlling cultural assets within the Anglosphere.Bertelsmann In 1835 Carl Bertelsmann’s began printing hymnals, prayer-books and a faith-based Westphalian newspaper. Carl sowed and reaped Evangelical revivalism. His son Heinrich added romantic novels to their traditionalist oeuvre. Heinrich’s only child, Fredericka, married loyal employee, Johannes Mohn, who took over operations upon Heinrich’s passing.Johannes’ son, Heinrich, was an early donor to the Nazis, as were his pastor and church. Heinrich joined the SS, as did his son Reinhard (1921-2009). Bertelsmann’s in-house theologian was pro-Nazi. Bertelsmann’s top-selling poet wrote the speech inaugurating the 1933 book-burnings.With wares freighted with Volkish and anti-Semitic content, Bertelsmann became the Third Reich’s largest publisher. In 1943 they ‘sold’ 19 million books. They supplied special editions to the Wehrmacht and boosted profits by exploiting slave labor in Eastern Europe and Holland.Post-WWII Bertelsmann stayed afloat partly by having hoarded paper but mainly by transferring control to Reinhard, whom Allied commanders found palatable. Reinhard spent much of WWII in a Kansas POW camp. Bertelsmann printed books commissioned by British intelligence.*Bertelsmann’s move into the Anglosphere began with the 1977-80 acquisition of Bantam Books. In 1986-7 they purchased Doubleday and opened a New York office. In 1998 they bought Random House. A 2013 merger hatched Penguin Random House; 75% owned by Bertelsmann, 25% by Pearson plc.Penguin Random House, the world’s largest commercial book publisher, churns-out 15,000 titles a year for English and Spanish-language markets. Annual sales of print, audio and e-books exceed 600 million units. A 10,000-strong workforce harvests yearly yields of $3.8 billion.The German market is supplied by Verlagsgruppe Random House, owner of 40 illustrious brands. Verlagsgruppe is Bertelsmann-owned, Penguin Random House-managed.Bertelsmann operates behind 315 brands or “imprints.” These imprints are the putative “publishers” named on books’ information pages. Imprints tally the venerable houses captured by Bertelsmann (Viking, Knopf, Ebury, Hamish, Putnam, Ballantine, Puffin, DK and Vintage etc.).Wholly-owned Bertelsmann subsidiary, Bertelsmann Printing Group, does all Bertelsmann’s printing; and prints catalogs and brochures for outside customers. In addition to German operations, Bertelsmann Printing owns one British, and five American, plants. Bertelsmann Printing has 8,200 employees and annual revenues of $1.8 billion.*Bertelsmann’s climate effort is multi-pronged. Regarding publishing, it has non-fiction and fiction fronts.The total number of non-fiction global warming alarmist books issued by Bertelsmann probably tops a thousand. Recent months witnessed the roll-out of: The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming (David Wallace-Wells); Climate Leviathan (Joel Wainwright); No Immediate Danger: Volume 1 of the Carbon Ideologies (William Vollmann); and the illustrated kids’ book: What is Climate Change? (Gail Herman). Releases come with book-tours and talk-show interviews; as were arranged for Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Sequel.Bertelsmann publishes alarmist supremo Bill McKibben’s works (End of Nature; Global Warming Reader etc.). They practically invented McKibben. They definitely invented Climate Central – a collective billed as: “the trusted source of information on all things climate-related” and generating collectibles like: Global Weirdness and Where is Climate Heading? Another Bertelsmann crew re-formatted US Global Change Research Program’s latest outpouring as: The Climate Report (2019).More insidious is Bertelsmann climate fiction. Christened “cli-fi” by academics circa 2007, this genre consists of fictitious literature set in apocalyptic futures wracked by human-induced global warming. Since 2007, some 400 cli-fi novels, countless cli-fi short-stories, and a dozen successful cli-fi screenplays have spilled forth. Notable Bertelsmann contributions: The Water Knife (Paola Bacigalupi); Year of the Flood (Margaret Atwood); Green Earth (Kim Stanley Robinson), The Gracekeepers (Kirsty Logan), Gold Fame Citrus (Clare Vaye Walkins), and Solar (Ian McEwan).Cli-fi was co-engineered with Holtzbrinck in whose catalogs one finds: The Dry (Jane Harper), The City in the Middle of the Night (Charlie Jane Anders), Odds Against Tomorrow (Nathaniel Rich), and Green Like Dying (Rouxi Chen) etc.Such pulp is bought in tonnage by librarians. Cli-fi potboilers are required reading in high school and university lit classes where they melt into millions of malleable minds.Bertelsmann knows education. Bertelsmann Education Group’s 2,030 staff sell: online training courses, digital teaching aids; and, school marketing and student recruitment services.*Bertelsmann SE’s 8 divisions collectively employ 117,000 workers and generate $20 billion in yearly sales.Wholly-owned, Arvato, provides e-commerce and IT services to banks and telecoms. As well, Arvato’s 36-language, 48,000-employee call-centre fields customer inquiries for hundreds of corporate clients.Bertelsmann’s RTL owns 60 television and 30 radio stations across Europe. RTL owns Germany’s largest private television network. RTL’s Radio Deutschland owns 17 stations. RTL’s 15,975 employees produce most RTL content. Annual revenues exceed $7 billion.Bertelsmann’s Gruner & Jahr showers 500 print and digital magazines across Europe but mainly upon Germany and France where half the population buys at least one G&J periodical. G&J wholly owns the weekly Stern (circulation: 750,000) and 25% of its rival, Der Spiegel (circulation: 840,000).G&J’s flagship daily, Dresden-based Sachsische Zeitung (circulation: 230,000), is co-owned with the Social Democratic Party.G&J and Holtzbrinck co-own Germany’s premier journalism college.RTL and G&J moil the online video market with 1,500 channels on YouTube and YouTube-wannabe platforms. Bertelsmann measures monthly views in the billions.Also mining the Internet is Bertelsmann’s music division, BMG, whose 840 employees work at 15 locations providing audiovisual, recording and steaming assistance to “indie” artists. They also offer marketing, licensing, royalty tracking and copyright administration services.Bertelsmann began hoarding pop music copyrights in 1984. BMG now owns 3 million songs including most vintage hits appearing in movie soundtracks and radio playlists.Bertelsmann Investments co-owns 185 Brazilian and Asian digital start-ups.Bertelsmann SE’s “corporate responsibility” webpage parades an array of carbon-cutting, paper-saving, tree-planting and obligatory employee “be green” initiatives.*Bertelsmann SE is owned 19.1% by the Mohns, 80.9% by three foundations: BVG, Reinhard Mohn Stiftung, and Bertelsmann Stiftung. BVG owns all voting shares.Christoph Mohn chairs Bertelsmann SE and Reinhard Mohn Stiftung; and is a BVG shareholder. Liz Mohn is: BVG’s Chair, Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Vice Chair, and a Bertelsmann SE director. Brigitte Mohn is an Executive Director of Bertelsmann Stiftung, a Bertelsmann SE director, and a BVG shareholder.Summoned by the Mohns to Bertelsmann SE’s board are four subsidiary managers and one rep each from: Daimler, Volkswagen, Nestle; German software giant, SAP; and French insurer, AXA (managers of a $1 trillion asset portfolio and a climate-obsessed website).*Liz followed her late husband Reinhard into the fanatically environmentalist Club of Rome. Bertelsmann Stiftung (BS) began collaborating with the Club in 1993.BS issues no grants. It is a self-financed think tank with annual expenditures of $100 million and 384 employees. BS hosts 200 confabs yearly to advance 70 projects – typically co-ventures with universities. BS spawns hundreds of reports and books (including a six-volume Reinhard Mohn compendium).BS’s annual 500-page Sustainable Development Report, co-written with UN Special Advisor Jeffrey Sachs, habitually bashes national governments for failing to combat climate change.Climate isn’t something BS bangs on about. Rather, it’s a bedrock assumption. “Enhancing international cooperation” translates into “promoting the Paris Accord.”BS scrutinises public opinion, especially voting behaviour. They decry populism’s threat to EU integration. BS’s Twelve Stars Initiative invites philosophers to dream about reversing Brexit and establishing a fully-operational EU Armed Forces.A former Bertelsmann SE government relations specialist runs BS’s American branch. She enlivens Washington DC with forums, exchanges and multi-media shows.HoltzbrinckGeorg von Holtzbrinck was born unto Westphalian landed nobility in 1909. His father sold their distressed estate after WWI then suffered hyperinflation. Unable to rely on the family fortune, Georg took up magazine distribution while a student.Georg joined the Nazi University Section in 1931; during the group’s proscription for assaulting Jewish students and professors. Uncle Erich was an SS Commander. Georg joined the Nazi Party in 1933.Georg parlayed personal commendations from Hitler’s lawyer, and aid from the Nazi Party newspaper, into acquiring distribution rights for German Labor Front magazines (annual circulation: 28 million). Georg personally designed a special edition celebrating Poland’s invasion.Georg was among a clique of businessmen who plundered Jewish-owned publishing. He became a prominent publisher; producing books for the Wehrmacht, specifically for Stormtroopers.Post-war prosecutors described Georg as a devoted Nazi who benefitted immensely from Party contacts. Georg got off with a fine and carried on. He also benefited immensely from hording paper at war’s end.In the late-1940s Georg took-over the German Book Association. Over the next 20 years he capitalised on his role as book middleman, and on close relationships with a clique of German publishers, to acquire minority stakes in newspaper and book publishing firms. In 1971 he pooled these holdings into Holtzbrinck Publishing Group. His son Georg-Dieter (b. 1941) assumed command in 1980. Georg died in 1983.Under Georg-Dieter (1980-2001) Holtzbrinck acquired German newspapers and English-language publishers; the latter specialising in science and education.Georg-Dieter transferred Holtzbrinck Publishing to his sister (Monika) and half-brother (Stefan) who now each own 50%. Georg-Dieter retained ownership of certain newspapers, and co-owns Die Zeit with his two siblings. All three are billionaires.*Stuttgart-headquartered Holtzbrinck Publishing Group is a multinational. Half its sales are in English-language markets.Springer Nature, is 57% owned by Holtzbrinck; 43% owned by BC Partners.The journal Nature was owned by the House of Macmillan from 1869 until its 1995 purchase by Holtzbrinck. Post-acquisition, several sister Nature publications emerged. The 2000s witnessed a proliferation of Nature-branded journals.Berlin-based Springer-Verlag dates to 1842. BC Partners bought Springer Science+Business Media in 2013 for $4 billion; merging it with Holtzbrinck’s Nature Group 18 months later.Springer Nature owns many of the world’s most-cited scientific journals. Key assets:Scientific American. Founded in 1845 and bought by Holtzbrinck in 1986, Scientific American comes out monthly in 14 languages. The magazine boasts 9.5 million print and tablet subscribers. Its website attracts over 10 million unique monthly visitors. Its social media reaches 7 million.Nature. The journal has 53,000 weekly subscribers and an 8.0 pass along rate (424,000 regular readers). Nature is the world’s second most influential science journal (behind AAAS’s Science).Scientific Reports. The world’s largest open access, scientific mega-journal, Scientific Reports’ extensive Earth Science and Enviro-science collections contain innumerable climate papers.Nature Communications publishes several dozen journals. Regarding climate, the most germane are: Nature Earth and Environmental Sciences, Nature Ecology and Evolution, Nature Sustainability, Nature Energy and Nature Climate Change. The latter might be the world’s highest impact climate publication.Nature Partner Journals are co-ventures between Springer Nature and various institutes. NPJ Climate and Atmospheric Sciences is co-published with King Abdullaziz University’s Center for Excellence in Climate Change Research (home to the world’s most powerful climate modelling computer).Holtzbrinck also owns Macmillan Learning, Macmillan Publishing and Palgrave Macmillan.Macmillan Learning sells educational materials, classroom kits, and interactive teaching tools. They: “maintain deep partnerships with the world’s best researchers, educators, administrators, and developers.”Macmillan Publishing targets English and German retail book markets. Among its dozen imprints are: St. Martin’s Press, Henry Holt and S. Fischer.Palgrave Macmillan targets academics and businesses with books and periodicals focussed on economics, history and political science.(Altogether Holtzbrinck owns hundreds of academic journals; scores of which run climate-related papers.)Holtzbrinck Digital and Holtzbrinck Science oversee 31 companies engaged in software development and marketing. These companies dovetail with 165 tech start-ups bankrolled by Holtzbrinck Ventures.*Family-owned newspapers include:Handelsblatt – a Dusseldorf-based business daily, circulation: 127,000.Tagesspiegel – a Berlin-based current affairs daily, circulation: 148,000.Die Zeit – a high-brow Hamburg-based weekly with 500,000 buyers and 2 million readers. For decades Die Zeit was co-published with former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt – a pioneering climate crusader.Die Zeit internet portals attract 12 million unique monthly visitors. (Europe’s German-speaking population: 97 million.)*CEO Stefan von Holtzbrinck directs several philanthropies and Chairs the Max Planck Foundation.Holtzbrinck’s board consists of: Klaus-Dieter Lehmann (Chair), Bernd Scheifele (Deputy Chair), Jurgen Mlynek, Monika Schoeller (and her daughter Christiane).Bernd Scheifele is Chair of Heidelberg Cement and Supervisory Chair of Phoenix Pharmaceuticals.Monika (b. 1939) was given reign over book publisher S. Fischer in 1974. She twice launched genres: one dealing with Germans’ processing of their Third Reich experiences; and one dealing with German women’s changing roles. Monika married literary scholar Bernd Schoeller.Monika manages multiple foundations, most importantly the S. Fischer Foundation which cooperates closely with Germany’s Foreign Office and the Goethe-Institut.Klaus-Dieter Lehmann ran West Germany’s national library before unification and the German National Library thereafter. A former Bertelsmann Stiftung Trustee, Lehmann now oversees 17 cultural foundations; and is a Deutsche Bank director. Since 2008 he has presided over the Goethe-Institut.(Pre-1945 the “German Academy” was a ‘worldview weapon’ and espionage center commanded by Rudolf Hess and later Joseph Goebbels. Renamed “Goethe-Institut,” it now deploys 1,000 staff and a $415 million stipend from Germany’s Foreign Office to: spread the German language; instil positive images of Germany; and facilitate cooperation with German institutions.)Theoretical physicist, Jurgen Mlynek, put 16 years in at the German Research Foundation (GSF); the last 4 as Vice President.(Despite its notorious past, GRF annually channels $4 billion in government funds to 100 university departments.)From 2005-15 Mlynek ran the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.(With a $5 billion budget the Helmholtz Association employs 40,000 science workers across 19 centres. Climate-oriented funding categories include: Polar and Marine, Environmental Health, Environmental Research, Geoscience, Coasts, and Oceans.)*Holtzbrinck subsidiaries and officials oversee some forty foundations most of which participate in the 22,000-member Association of German Foundations.Holtzbrinck communiques abound with references to: corporate responsibility, organic growth and sustainability. Subsidiaries agonise over their carbon footprints. Holtzbrinck donates to: Earth Day Network, Ocean Conservation, Goddard, Euroscience Open Forum, and Science Media Centres.ConclusionNot alone does Germany bear Climate’s cross. Germany is, however, uniquely burdened by an ecological industrial complex compelling kaiser-sized commitment to this crusade. German agriculture and industry require a climate-rationalised “energy transition.” Germany’s foreign policy establishment, Holtzbrinck and Bertelsmann included, press this request.Abandon all notions of impartial climate science. In publish-or-perish academia, publishers reign.

His full bio is in the brief.Energy Illiteracy Must Not be Enshrined in LawA Response To “An Open Letter on Climate Accountability Litigation in Canada”   LINK TO FULL BRIEF:  Energy Illiteracy Must Not Be Enshrined in Law Aug 17 2019 FINAL On June 24, 2019 a group of Canadian law professors published an ‘open letter’ in which they supported proposals asking federal, provincial and local governments to “take legal and other action to recover a share of the local climate costs from global fossil fuel companies, as a means of shielding taxpayers from the full range of current and future costs resulting from climate change”. This open letter is a response to that appeal.The law professors err on six specific points. I will show that:Carbon dioxide is not pollution.The purchase and sale of oil, natural gas and coal constitute free transactions made by sellers and buyers, who are well informed about the implications of their decisions.The products sold and purchased have major societal benefits that far exceed the alleged adverse effects.In fact, forcing fossil fuel producers to cease selling their goods and services would, given the lack of alternatives, have major adverse effects on society and the economy.Canadian environmental law does not support the actions they propose.Actions taken to harm Canadian fossil fuel companies would have at most a negligible effect on the global environment.Energy illiteracy must not be enshrined in law.Image licensed from Shutterstock.  Climate Change Policy – A Threat to CanadaShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate accountability law', 'climate change']",2019/08/17

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/08/13/geothermal-for-canada-questions-and-challenges/,Dave Hassan ,Geothermal for Canada – Questions and Challenges," Contributed by Michelle Stirling © 2019Friends of Science Society has re-issued our 2016 report: “Geothermal for Alberta? A Case for Caution” to help inform the debate on the potential benefits and pitfalls of this novel form of heating and power generation for Canada.  Though the document takes a specific look at Alberta, it includes a global overview of geothermal. This is a plain language document.LINK TO FULL REPORT: Geothermal Alberta A Case for Caution Aug 12 2019 REV2The Green Party “Mission Possible: The Green Climate Action Fund” platform advocates for the use of geothermal energy as a replacement for hydrocarbon/fossil fuel-based electricity and heat generation for Canada.  The Green Party platform assumes that we can ‘harness abandoned deep oil wells, wherever feasible, for geothermal energy, using workers who drilled the wells to manage the renewable energy generation.’  On the surface, this appears to be a sensible ‘repurposing’ of similar drilling skills, by simply transferring these workers into geothermal as energy generation experts.But things are not so simple when it comes to geothermal.Like many forms of power generation, geothermal is location specific.  To further confuse the public, geothermal is a term that is attached to two different forms of energy supply.  One form is that of direct heat, where bore holes into the earth at a relatively nominal depth, capitalize on extant heat as a means of providing stable heat source.  This heat source can be best used with a system of electrical pumps, where the earth becomes a storehouse of hot and cold air, cycled by electrical pumps to act as an HVAC system.  In some geographic locations, this set-up has benefits and, depending on the cost of electricity (to run the pumps that cycle the air) and depending on the stability and ambient temperature differential fluctuations, this can be a cost-efficient form of heating/cooling.At first glance, parts of Alberta have excellent geothermal heating potential.  However, a complicating factor is the often wildly fluctuating ambient temperatures due to Chinook winds, where temperatures can go from minus 20°C to plus 20°C in the space of a few hours.  The response time of geothermal heating systems can be slow to keep up with this instability; likewise, the electrical energy required to pump the geothermal heat can be very expensive.Another application for geothermal is that of electrical generation.  Here, the Green Party ‘makes hay’ by claiming that using existing deep wells for geothermal would be an easy way to put lots of unemployed oil and gas workers back to work.  The assumption is that these workers have similar skills used in drilling, that can easily be transferred to managing deep oil wells for geothermal electrical generation.  This is a questionable assumption because electrical generation is quite different than oil well drilling – and to date, there is no assurance that such deep oil geothermal electricity generation potential exists anywhere but a few places in Alberta, BC and NWT, and some possible spots in Quebec. (Smart Prosperity just posted a blog on the first such initiative in Saskatchewan. A pilot project is in development at Swan Hills)The Green Party’s “Mission Possible” also states in point 7 that it will ‘ban fracking’ with no exceptions.  However, deep well geothermal electrical generation relies on fracking in order to expose the ‘hot rocks’ to the cold water that is pumped down into the borehole. When the cold water hits the hot rocks, steam is produced, and this steam is pumped up to the surface to drive power generation turbines.There is a new, untested, alternative method proposed by geothermal proponents in Canada – but the problem is that this form is untested.  There is no large scale geothermal in operation in Canada at present and no pilot project of this alternative method. Therefore, it is not reasonable to set a nation’s energy generation and employment policy based on something that does not exist, and that requires a process that the Green Party election platform strictly forbids, that being fracking.Furthermore, as with many ‘nature-driven’ power generation proposals like wind and solar, proponents often say geothermal will tap into ‘free’ energy from the earth.  A study by Majorowicz and Grasby (2019) indicates that geothermal energy simply cannot compete with the power generation provided by conventional fossil fuels, and the costs are exorbitant, except in certain unique geographic situations.As with all forms of power and heat generation, there are potential applications for geothermal in Canada – but there are serious limitations as well.  It is extremely unlikely that the mass of ~100,000 unemployed oil workers could be put back to work in a geothermal industry, nor do their skills directly transfer to geothermal power generation.  Likewise, the temperature differentials in Canada make geothermal only a potential provider of supplementary power, not a main provider.I reached out to Dr. Majorowicz by email, a specialist in the field of geothermal, to ask for additional insights. He wrote that:“… the real potential for geothermal based power production is only in the western and northwestern deep part of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) basin where temperatures most suitable for that purpose can be found >150°C. [Temperatures of] >120°C can also be considered if very large flow rates secured.The difference [between geothermal and oil/gas] is in energy density and, in order to compare apples to apples, exergy (which is discussed it in our paper) is couple orders of magnitude and therefore it will take several doublet geothermal well systems to replace one average producing oil and gas energy in the WCSB.We also need to remember that pumping and reinjecting [to geothermal wells] all take large amounts of [electrical] power.Also, thermal efficiency of geothermal power plants is some 10% +/- 4% depending on temperature of running fluid used.It is at least 3 times that or more in coal power plants….”(Wikipedia reports: Typical thermal efficiency for utility-scale electrical generators is around 37% for coal and oil-fired plants, and 56 – 60% (LEV) for combined-cycle gas-fired plants.)Aside from these energy density and location issues, it is unclear how the Green Party can reconcile their absolute rejection of fracking with their demand for geothermal.To further the public understanding of geothermal power generation, we have reissued our 2016 report – “Geothermal for Alberta? A Case for Caution.” (Download link at the top of the page)Also, posted below is a plain language “Speakers’ Corner” debate between Thana Boonlert (now Green Party candidate for Calgary Centre @Thana4yyc ) and me, Michelle Stirling (Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society @stirlingmg @FriendsOScience), on the topic of geothermal as a replacement or complement to coal-fired power generation in Alberta. (Aug. 2016)Members of the media should consider engaging with geothermal experts like Dr. Jacek Majorowicz and Dr. Stephen E. Grasby to get expert insights on this complex topic. Their recent publication is: “Deep geothermal energy in Canadian sedimentary basins VS. Fossils based energy we try to replace – Exergy [KJ/KG] compared” Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists, AAAS, and APS.Comment from a reader, a former oil well completions engineer:After a well is drilled, the completions team designs and installs:1) the perforations that connect the formation to the well bore2) any stimulations – such as acidizing, fracking, etc3) the producing tubingI am commenting on this as it has relevance to the potential for geothermal energy.  Most existing wells which were “producers” would have existing perforations.  Those perforations are supposed to be “sealed” if the well is abandoned – but the abandonment process is not foolproof.  So for old wells to be considered as candidates for geothermal, the state of the old perforations would have to be determined.  As well, the long term impacts of corrosion on the integrity of the casing would have to be assessed.  To do those assessments is expensive.Puna, HawaiiEven in places that are ideal for geothermal, there are challenges:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puna_Geothermal_Venture Geothermal vs Coal-fired power for Alberta –Debate between Thana Boonlert and Michelle Stirling August 2016https://youtu.be/sNhz1t7qMicReality Check on Geothermal:  The US has the most installed geothermal capacity in the world, yet the contribution of geothermal to the US energy supply is just 0.4%.Source: http://www.earth-policy.org/mobile/releases/highlights48Source: https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'coal', 'geothermal']",2019/08/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/27/the-85-million-tonne-obsession/,skybaserob ,The 85 Million Tonne Obsession," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019About the AuthorRobert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, a diplomat for 10 years prior to that. His complete biography can be read here. Executive SummaryCover image licensed from Shutterstock. Much of the public and media attention concerning measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada focuses on reducing automotive emissions. Almost every governmental announcement concerning a new climate regulation or tax celebrates this in terms of the “number of passenger vehicles per year taken off the roads”. The public dialogue and policy debate that surrounds these issues, however, are not based on an informed view of the facts or of the decisions that governments have been making. This paper may help to support the public debate.LINK TO FULL REPORT: THE 85 MILLION TONNE OBSESSION FinalAs context, in 2016 15.6 million Canadians commuted back and forth from home to work. After five decades of governmental efforts to discourage commuting by personal vehicle, the percentage of working Canadians commuting by car has fallen from 80.7 to 79.5 per cent. In other words, regardless of what government planners, transit commissions and environmentalists may prefer, the average citizen is voting for personal vehicles. Of the many measures governments have taken, four stand out in terms of cost: vehicle fuel efficiency regulations on new light duty vehicle sales; subsidies for the purchase and refueling of hybrid and electric vehicles; transit subsidies; and taxes on motor fuels. Canada and the United States have harmonized their light duty vehicle fuel efficiency regulations since they were first introduced in the late 1970’s. In 2008 and 2012, both countries agreed to a schedule of increasingly stringent increases in fuel efficiency that would raise the standard for passenger cars from 39.1 miles per U.S. gallon in 2017 to 55.3 miles per U.S. gallon in 2025 and for light duty trucks (and SUVs) from 29.5 mpg in 2017 to 39.3 mpg in 2025. In August, 2018, the Trump Administration announced that it planned to freeze the fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through to 2026. California has said it will sue to oppose these changes. In the face of these developments, the Trudeau government signed a cooperation agreement with California which, while not explicit, appears to signal that it will depart from Canada’s historic policy of harmonization with the U.S. federal government. The consequences of such a move cannot be fully assessed without a detailed analysis, but it could mean that in future Canadian auto manufacturers might be required to adopt emissions and fuel efficiency technologies that are more expensive than those that are required of the U.S. auto industry in general, affecting Canadian firms’ ability to compete. In April 2019 the Trudeau government announced targets for increasing the share of zero-emissions vehicles in Canada, rising to 100 per cent of new vehicle sales in 2040. It also announced that it would provide subsidies for the purchase of hybrids and electric vehicles ranging from $2,500 to $5,000 per vehicle. When added to the subsidies offered by British Columbia and Quebec, this could raise the combined federal-provincial subsidy to a high of $10,500 to $13,000 per vehicle, which equates to $350 to $433 per tonne of emissions avoided, many times the current ($20 per tonne) value of carbon emissions permits. U.S. studies show that as much as 70 per cent of EV sales would take place without subsidies, and that EVs are bought primarily by people with above-average incomes. In 2016, the Trudeau government announced Canada’s Long-Term Infrastructure Plan, which promises $180 billion in spending on infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2028. This includes $28.5 billion for public transit. Unfortunately, there is no source that can inform the Canadian public about how much is being spent on transit in total by federal, provincial and municipal governments, what this means for ridership or what this means for the amount and cost of emissions reductions. U.S. studies indicate that fares pay only one third of transit systems’ operating costs, and that the total governmental subsidy of transit capital and operating costs is about $1.17 per passenger mile. Canadian studies indicate that, in the unlikely case that it could be achieved, a doubling of commuters using transit would reduce GHG emissions by about 2.5 million tonnes per year. According to the analysis of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the national average motor gasoline price in 2018 was $1.35 per litre, 47 cents of which was tax. This is equivalent to a carbon tax of $192 per tonne. If one adds the carbon taxes scheduled to apply by 2022, the carbon tax equivalent of all gasoline taxes will be $235 per tonne. In 2017, passenger vehicles, including all cars, SUVs and pickup trucks, produced 85 million tonnes of GHGs. This was 11.9 per cent of the Canadian total. If Canada somehow could eliminate these uses altogether, it would take us only 42 per cent of the way to the 2030 emissions reduction target. As unlikely as even that is, it seems we cannot shake our public obsession with vehicle emissions, regardless of cost. Image licensed from Shutterstock.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'GHG reduction targets', 'motor fuel']",2019/07/27
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/27/alvarezs-asteroid-did-a-climate-catastrophe-claim-the-dinosaurs/,,Alvarez’s Asteroid: Did a Climate Catastrophe claim the Dinosaurs?," Contributed by William Walter Kay BA LL B ©2019 100 million years ago (100 Ma) Earth’s surface temperature, already hotter than now, resumed an intermittent warming march. Humidity kept apace. By 70 Ma forests graced Antarctica and Greenland. By 60 Ma dense rainforests carpeted land masses pole to pole. By 66 Ma these forests hosted 30 species of flying bird, 34 species of mammal and scores of snake species.The present is the key to the past.Presently, a dozen snake species subsist exclusively via egg predation. Weasels, skunks and badgers also raid nests for their supper. Buzzards and crows do likewise.Owls are living fossils; having emerged pre-65 Ma. Presently, 200 species of owl scour habitats from the Arctic to the Congo. Famously silent and equipped with remarkable night vision, owls often prey not on eggs but on recent hatchlings thereof. Dinosaurs would have been helpless against owls who, along with their ancestors and cousins, perched atop the food-chain 60 Ma.Dinosaurs perished 66-64ish Ma. Thick dark woods flush with egg-cracking, hatchling-snatching critters proved inhospitable environs for these clumsy monsters.*The son of a Spanish royal family adjutant, Luis F Alvarez (1853-1937), migrated to California, acquired an MD from Stanford, then moved to Hawaii to supervise hospitals and conduct experiments. Luis’s son, Walter, a Mayo Clinic professor, penned a medical column syndicated to hundreds of newspapers. Walter’s son, Luis W Alvarez, attained his PhD (Physics) from the University of Chicago and received a Nobel Prize (1968) for mathematical analysis of particle physics experiments.A deep state denizen, Luis W Alvarez flew as a passenger in a B-29 alongside Enola Gay and Bockscar to watch the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. He investigated UFOs for the CIA. He secretly smeared Robert Oppenheimer as a Soviet spy. Chosen to refute a Congressional report on JFK’s assassination that indicated multiple shooters; Alvarez loyally upheld the Warren Commission’s lone shooter theory.While Luis lacked geological or paleontological credentials, his son Walter had a Geology PhD (Princeton) and dabbled in archeology. The duo embarked on their asteroid-dinosaur adventure in 1977. Walter embalmed his recollections in: T Rex and the Crater of Doom.*Paleontologists and Geologists, being historians, agonize over periodization i.e. over how to best divide Earth’s past into chronological episodes. History is continuous; without precise beginnings and endings. Descriptive stable blocks of time are arbitrary, problematic conveniences. Absent periodization, however, there is no system; just scattered events. Geological/paleontological boundaries undergo constant re-categorization; the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary being no exception.The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) is official keeper of the International Geological Time Scale. In 2008 ICS replaced “Tertiary” with “Paleogene.” K-T is now K-Pg. (K means Cretaceous.) This boundary divides a world blighted by conifers and dinosaurs from one blessed with flowers and mammals.While K-Pg is renowned for dinosaur extinction; it is actually demarcated with reference to lineages of marine invertebrates found in Euro-Mediterranean rock strata. Geological timescales are biased towards shoreline rock-beds which, not having suffered terrestrial erosion, are easier to analyse.Coastal rocks chronicle the rise and fall of oceanic protozoan species. Not to denigrate plankton, but other lifeforms are at least as interesting. Alongside the nanoplankton series now run alternative biostratigraphic series. Thirty mammalian bio-zones lay within the Paleogene Period (65.5 to 2.58 Ma). Advances in magnetic and isotropic analyses have engendered additional, parallel time columns.ICS’s Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) program began in 1977. “Golden spikes” are pounded in at accessible, well-preserved cites to serve as reference points for geological age boundaries. GSSPs are chosen paleontologically (from fossil evidence) but possess good secondary (isotropic, magnetic) markers. Sixty-four spikes have been pounded; 37 more are planned.K-Pg’s spike adorns a ravine outside El Kef, Tunisia. This site was chosen for its clear depiction of the first appearance date of the flagellate, Danea californica, which heralds the disappearance of signature Cretaceous plankton.*It was at another K-Pg boundary site (Gubbio, Italy) where Luis and Walter Alvarez made their fabled find. In a centimeter-thick clay layer separating Cretaceous from Paleogene limestone strata they discovered abnormally high iridium concentrations. Iridium is rare in Earth’s crust. It is more abundant in Earth’s mantle and far more abundant in meteorites. The duo surmised that Earth had been struck by a 10-kilometre wide asteroid circa 66 Ma. Fallout from said asteroid spread iridium around the globe whilst inflicting the mass extinction which claimed the dinosaurs.The alleged killing mechanism… Catastrophic Climate Change!Alvarez’s asteroid kicked-up sky-darkening dust that suppressed photosynthesis and wrought famine.“Global cooling” memes circulated in the 1970s. This theory, much like Alvarez’s “impact winter,” claims industrial pollution significantly blocks sunlight. A related horror-show, “nuclear winter,” envisions an ice age triggered by nuclear war. Circa 1980 two additional potential climate catastrophes gained notoriety – greenhouse warming and acid rain. Alvarez mongered all three scares.William Glen, scribe of dinosaur extinction controversies, notes:“Enhanced greenhouse warming has been suggested as a killing mechanism almost from the time the impact hypothesis was put forward.”A key concept here is “shock metamorphism.” Limestone, it is contended, when pulverized by meteorites generates heat-trapping CO2. In the late-1980s a Caltech team blasted cannonballs into limestone. They concluded Alvarez’s asteroid tripled atmospheric CO2, setting off global heat devastation.A famous September 1991 K-Pg paper speculated:“…shock-produced CO2 from the impact may have caused a severe greenhouse warming.”This paper came out in advance of the June 1992 Rio Summit; a milestone in CO2 diabolization.Immediately after the 1980 release of the original Alvarez paper, an MIT team began issuing papers detailing how heat from the asteroid’s ejecta plum, through shock metamorphism, fused atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen into nitric acid. The resultant acid rain not only killed dinosaurs, it dissolved their bones; thereby explaining the annoying dearth of dinosaur fossils immediately below the K-Pg boundary.Another impact-induced climate catastrophe scenario has the asteroid annihilating sulphur emitting microalgae. The resultant shortage of atmospheric sulphate particles thwarted cloud formation, kindling lethal warming.Debate was restricted to asteroid partisans versus vulcanists. The latter, also climate catastrophists, contended mass extinction resulted from either SO2 (acid rain) or CO2 (global warming) volcanic emissions.A compromise faction argued Alvarez’s asteroid rang Earth like a bell, waking dormant volcanos; hence an asteroid-volcano double-whammy dealt the dinos their deathblow.Paleontologists were denied a podium on the debate stage.*The K-Pg iridium anomaly became a battlefield. In 1981 geologists examining Alvarez’s Gubbio site found high iridium levels above and below the K-Pg boundary. They concluded the iridium enrichment was of local volcanogenic, not cosmogenic, origins. Alvarez bitterly disputed their findings.Charles B. Officer, leader of the opposition, received his PhD (Oceanography) from Columbia U before settling in as a Geophysics professor at Dartmouth College. Officer authored 10 science texts and countless papers.In 1988 Officer’s team analysed rock 2.85 metres above, and 219 metres below, the K-Pg boundary layer at Gubbio. They found four fluxes in iridium concentration above the boundary; consistent with 3 million years of intense volcanic activity.Officer’s allies also noted that the tiny spherical rocks, which Alvarez claimed were ejecta raining down from a single impact, could be found in several million years of rock strata.Others noted wide variations in iridium concentrations at K-Pg boundary sites around the world; again suggesting local volcanic origins.There is no consensus that K-Pg boundary layer iridium enrichment resulted from extraterrestrial impact. There is consensus regarding a 10,000-to-100,000 year intense volcanic episode in the late Cretaceous. This volcanic uprising explains the iridium anomaly.(A third iridium anomaly hypothesis, that Earth experienced an uptick in meteor showers over several thousand years, was useless to Alvarez as this couldn’t cause mass extinction.)By 1988 Alvarez’s asteroid appeared destined for the dustbin. Geophysicist R Jastrow confidently wrote:“It is now clear that a catastrophe of extraterrestrial origins had no discernable impact on the history of life as measured over a million years.”Then, in 1991, evidence of a huge crater was found under the Gulf of Mexico. Alvarez’s camp unleashed a salvo of papers aimed at proving “Chicxulub” to be their asteroid’s tomb.In two papers (1993 and 1994) Officer’s team intercepted and destroyed Alvarez’s evidence. As PEMEX had done much drilling in the area; there was grist for the geological mill.A 10-kilometre wide asteroid would have left unmistakable splatter around the immediate vicinity. The evidence shows a regional hiatus of impact-generated and/or tsunami-generated deposits at the K-Pg layer. Conversely, the Caribbean’s K-Pg boundary layer resides amidst 3 metres of volcanic deposits.Officer’s team showed that one of Alvarez’s prize K-Pg rocks contained fossils millions of years too old. Also, a Cuban boulder that Alvarez claimed to be impact ejecta was proven to be the product of local erosion. Alvarez’s trophies from northern Mexico and Haiti were not impact ejecta but river-bed deposits built-up slowly with telltale gravity drainage features.Signing off on Officer’s conclusions was the legendary A. A. Meyerhoff. As Project Geologist for PEMEX’s deep drilling program Meyerhoff inspected every sample. He saw scant evidence of spectacular asteroid impact. He saw ample evidence of six volcanic episodes.*Another Alvarez opponent, William Clemens, is currently Professor Emeritus at Berkeley. Clemens chaired Berkeley’s Paleontology Department and ran their museum. He won several awards.An authority on North American dinosaurs, Clemens believes these dinosaurs died out over a 500,000 year period. Flood plain dinosaurs disappeared quickly. River valley dinos clung on.Dinosaurs inhabited Alaska’s North Slope for millions of years. While it was much warmer then than now, these dinosaurs still endured many cool dark polar winters. It is unlikely a meteorite off southern Mexico wiped them out.Alvarez claimed his asteroid wreaked havoc uniquely upon larger animals. Clemens notes that during the K-Pg transition many small animals also disappeared.According to Clemens, a sudden extinction paroxysm is simply not where the evidence points. Countless studies of K-Pg era fossils chronical complex floral and faunal transitions lasting over 100,000 years and exhibiting a range of regional sequences and timelines. Paleontologists explains K-Pg with reference to continental drift, long-term climate change, and gradual terrestrial and oceanic re-configurations.Layers of rock, varying in thickness from 1 to 4.5 metres, separate the last dinosaur fossils from strata celebrating the triumph of modern plants. This is consistent with gradual, regional extinctions. The Alvarez hypothesis has all dinosaurs vanishing in a few years, if not months, circa 66.7 Ma. More troubling for the Alvarez hypothesis are dinosaur fossils radiometrically dated to 63.6 Ma.Asteroid impact cannot explain the selectivity of K-Pg extinctions. Many lifeforms survived K-Pg unscathed. Alligators, sharks and turtles thrived. A review of 31 sites showed some equatorial regions enjoying 50% increases in bio-diversity during the K-Pg transition; albeit higher latitudes suffered 70% declines.Extinctions occur continuously. These “turnovers” involve certain lifeforms displacing others. “Mass extinctions” are merely accelerated turnovers. 100,000 years is a jiffy to paleontologists.*Alvarez’s hypothesis debuted as a lead Science article (June, 1980) after a contrived roll-out. Starting in 1978 Science Digest, Science News and Time ran preparatory articles. In 1979 Astronomy published: Death of the Dinosaurs. (Astrophysicists embraced the impact-extinction hypothesis; using it to campaign for asteroid research funding. They claimed meteorites caused all mass extinctions.)By 1992 the Alvarez paper had been cited 2,000 times. 130 scientific journals ran 500 articles about it. Thirteen major periodicals printed 143 stories on the topic. Graphic accounts of a dino-killing asteroid appeared 25 times in Newsweek, Time, New Yorker and Scientific American; often as a cover story. Walter Alvarez’s lectures packed halls at science confabs.Despite the hype, many scientists, and most paleontologists, rejected Alvarez’s hypothesis. A 1985 survey found paleontologists complaining that the impact theory sought to solve a non-existent mystery. Seeking silver-bullet explanations for dinosaur extinction was likened to searching for the Missing Link.Papers from either side of the debate were published weekly throughout the decade. Rapid, coordinated responses by Alvarez supporters, from across several disciplines, betrayed conspiracy. Nature’s editor complained pre-prints of yet-to-be published articles circulated in Alvarez’s camp.Luis Alvarez stooped to nasty, dishonest personal attacks. Worse, according to journalist Bruce Fellman:“…critics of the asteroid-impact theory are firmly convinced that the late Nobel laureate was pulling strings behind the scenes – and the price of hewing to what they perceive to be the scientific truth was loss of access to news coverage, grant money, the leading journals, and even tenure.”A New York Times exposé of the dispute claimed:“Charges and recriminations have also flowed through the informal academic grapevine that can make or break a scientific career.”Professor Dewey McLean argued convincingly that the iridium anomaly was volcanogenic. Several scientists, who requested anonymity, claimed Alvarez agents tried to block Dewey’s promotion to full professor. Alvarez denied the charge but was quick to call Mclean a “weak sister” whose reputation had been destroyed, gloating: “nobody invites him to conferences anymore.”Alvarez added:“I don’t like to say bad things about paleontologists, but they’re really not very good scientists. They’re more like stamp collectors.”The struggle continues. A 2010 paper, signed by 41 scientists, declared the K-Pg asteroid-extinction event to be a fact. The paper elicited a counter-paper led by Clemens and signed by 29 scientists. The counter-paper, published in Science, noted the absence of vertebrate paleontologists among the 41 bombardiers. It went on to point out that no other known mass extinction event corresponds to a meteorite impact, and that no other known meteorite impact corresponds to any extinction.Catastrophists, controlling the commanding heights, continue dispensing ‘ground-breaking’ evidence for their theory. Many circumspect paleontologists now privately disparage Alvarez’s hypothesis but publically avoid the topic.*Farcically millenarian, environmentalists traffic in: tipping points, carrying capacities, ecological thresholds, population overshoots, feedback loops, rumours of doom and horrors to come. While eco-apocalyptic pseudoscience dates to the 1800s, an unprecedented resurgence swept the late-1960s after its affiliated political tendency re-marshalled their assault upon the state.“Millenarian” derives from millennium, 1,000 years. Numerologically 1,000 indicates completeness. 1,000 years translates to “epoch.” Bewildering calculations go into apocalyptic timetables but cabbalistic foreshortening invariably reels the final epoch into imminent proximity.Faith in an imminent cataclysm appears across history and around the globe. Hindus preach a cycle of cosmic disasters. Shiites await a riotous finale. Rastafarians, Mormons and Marxists brace for the ultimate transformation.Between 200 BC and 300 AD Jewish/Christian pamphleteers prophesied an apocalypse rife with infernos and deluges. End Times doctrine undergirds Christian soteriology and theodicy. Suppressed during the Middle Ages, millenarianism rebounded in Protestantism and remains fundamental to American Christianity. Europe’s most prescient modern theologian, Albert Schweitzer, stressed Christianity’s millenarian constitution; recommending its revival.Geology was born bearing millenarian defects.Until the late-1800s “catastrophism” was Geology’s consensus view. Catastrophists believed Earth’s crustal features resulted from exotic cataclysms. Disparate fossils unearthed in rock strata were explained as products of repeated Acts of God lacking any connection to profane scientific laws.Guided by Natural Theology, catastrophists reconciled scripture with Geology. They believed in a recent divine creation event. They rejected evolution, contending modern animals appeared as God made them. They sought geological evidence for the Garden of Eden and the Great Flood. They deemed Noah’s flood to be the most recent of a series of worldwide inundations.Catastrophism yielded to “uniformitarianism” and its linear geological column. Uniformitarians emphasised gradualism, sedimentation, erosion, evolution etc. They confined theorising to observable processes. The present was key to the past.Millenarianism, often a feature of populist uprisings, can be an instrument of oppression. Imperial-aristocratic millenarianism is nostalgic, traditionalist, conservationist and restorative. It brandishes a vision of theocratic global conquest.Ritual masks worn by today’s crafty practitioners exploit engrained religious symbology. This is evident in “sixth mass extinction” propaganda. Cabbalistic numerology fixates on the passage of six to seven. The sixth yom of Creation was followed by the Sabbath. The six millennia of tribulations are followed by the Jubilee. This sixth mass extinction will surely be our last.After an early 20th century nadir millenarianism filtered back into scientific discourse. This disguised attack on science manifests in astronomy, cosmology, ecology, climatology and math (catastrophe theory).In 1977 Alvarez hatched his asteroid caper amidst a zeitgeist saturated with eco-apocalyptic propaganda supplemented by mega-hyped screeds like The Late Great Planet Earth (25 million copies sold) and the syzygy scare, The Jupiter Effect (which also sold millions).*Sociology of Science professor Elisabeth Clemens (William Clemens’ daughter) enlivened the fray with poignant commentary about how politics corrupts science. She claims Alvarez’s hypothesis received lavish attention because it buttressed trending climate catastrophe narratives.Institutions of science popularization, especially science journalism, steer professional scientific research – it’s not the other way around. Dig into highfalutin, jargon-dense papers from august specialised science journals, and you shall unearth: agenda-driven pop science baubles.SourcesBrowne, Malcolm.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/24/markham-hislop-plays-softball-with-tides-canada/,,Markham Hislop Plays Softball with Tides Canada," Op-ed contributed by Michelle Stirling © July 2019On June 23, 2019, Markham Hislop did another deep dive interview on the Tar Sands Campaign, trying to demonstrate it is all a tin-foil hat conspiracy theory dreamt up by researcher Vivian Krause (@FairQuestions) .  He interviewed Joanna Kerr, new CEO of Tides Canada, who replaced Ross McMillan, who stepped down at the end of Dec. 2018.Hislop asked Kerr if Tides Canada ever participated in the Tar Sands Campaign.  Kerr answered: “For the record, Tides Canada was never a member of the Tar Sands Campaign…”  and claims “In much of the rhetoric of Vivian Krause and her supporters, there is a conflation between Tides Canada and Tides Foundation in the US. We believe this is intentional.”That answer does not jibe with the evidence.Hislop asked if Tides Canada ever participated in the Tar Sands Campaign.  Kerr responds that Tides Canada was never a member of the campaign.Kerr says that people confuse/conflate Tides Foundation in the US and Tides Canada.  However, reading this 2013 Counterpunch story (by a left-wing anti-oil, anti-capitalist fellow) entitled “How Tides Canada Controls the Secret North American Tar Sands Coalition”, one certainly gets the impression the author is speaking about Tides Canada, and not Tides Foundation in the US.If Hislop was doing his job as a journalist, why didn’t he read this Vivian Krause article from the Financial Post of Oct. 14, 2010 to Joanna Kerr and ask her to pick out where Vivian has erred or conflated?Surely the staff at Tides Canada could help with that. But he never presses Kerr on the claims of conflation, and never presents any of the following evidence to challenge her statements.Tides Canada is not some little upstart. The Canada Revenue Agency lists Tides Canada Initiatives Society as being founded in 1990, with the Tides Canada Foundation established in 1999.Hislop never challenges Kerr’s charming claim that Tides Canada was simply “inspired” by Tides Foundation in the USA, when the organizations also shared the same board and executive team for years, including listing US Tides founder Drummond Pike and board member Joel Solomon, even up to 2010.As this excerpt from Tides Foundation 2010 US IRS-990 filing shows, Drummond Pike was also a board member of the US Tides Foundation as was Joel Solomon. Based upon CRA T-3010 and IRS-990s, the principals, Joel Solomon and Drummond Pike, have been the principal executives of both organizations and populated as executives on board of directors in what is known as inter-corporate linkage, a practice frowned upon in most business circles.Source: https://www.canadiancharitylaw.ca/blog/tides_us_2010_form_990_-_an_example_of_transparency_in_actionIf one reviews this version of the Tides_US_2010_Form_990 w highlights one finds numerous grants for the Tar Sands Campaign listed (highlighted in yellow, added).  It seems quite disingenuous to suggest that key people would be on one board in the US, administering Tar Sands Campaign funding and activities, but on another board for Tides Canada and could claim to be non-participants in what is going on. Indeed, Tides Canada is even listed as a charity with the IRS.FORGN: “A foreign-addressed organization. These are generally organizations formed in the United States that conduct activities in foreign countries. Certain foreign organizations that receive charitable contributions deductible pursuant to treaty are also included, as are organizations created in U.S. possessions.”https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/displayAll.do?dispatchMethod=displayAllInfo&Id=12056861&ein=980404212&country=CA&deductibility=all&dispatchMethod=searchAll&isDescending=false&city=&ein1=&postDateFrom=&exemptTypeCode=al&submitName=Search&sortColumn=orgName&totalResults=1&names=Tides+Canada&resultsPerPage=25&indexOfFirstRow=0&postDateTo=&state=All+StatesIn 2010, the Oak Foundation granted Tides Canada Foundation a paltry $50,000 grant, with the objective of creating a $30 million-dollar fund ‘similar to the Energy Foundation, ‘to be sourced from high net worth Canadian and international donors.’  The US “Energy Foundation” was a forerunner to ClimateWorks. Energy Foundation was a funding a distribution house where foundations with interests in promoting cap and trade, carbon pricing and renewables, could deposit funds into the umbrella organization (redeveloped as ClimateWorks) for non-duplicated distribution to ENGO proxies who would then beat the drum for local policy change while appearing to be a grassroots movement. This is described in ClimateWorks “Design to Win” strategic plan, found online.  Interestingly, ClimateWorks global cap and trade plan includes an Energy Foundation that they set up in China…but I digress.Going back to Kerr’s claim that Tides Canada was never a member of the Tar Sands Campaign….or rather Hislop’s question if Tides Canada had ever participated in it, how would Kerr explain Tides Canada funding of author Andrew Nikiforuk – Mr. Anti-Tar Sands himself, or DeSmogBlog, or Tides Canada’s involvement in ForestEthics’ Blockadia of Northern Gateway? The following screenshots are from NEB filings on-line,( NEB File No.: OF‐Fac‐Oil‐N304‐2010‐01 01) a written request for information from Enbridge to ForestEthics, wherein ForestEthics is described as a Tides Canada Initiative, and Enbridge is seeking confirmation of ForestEthics role in the Tar Sands Campaign and funding.Source: ForestEthics Advocacy Response to Northern Gateway Information …https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/828724Now in some cases, it would be unfair to expect a new CEO to know any of this history off the top of their head.But Joanna Kerr is someone special. Kerr was the Executive Director of Greenpeace Canada for the past five years. Since 2007, when Greenpeace was funded by the Oak Foundation, it’s been clear what side of the fence they are on.“To initiate three distinct but interrelated efforts concerning tar sands in Alberta to enhance the ability of Greenpeace Canada to more effectively launch and deliver its ‘Phase Out Tar Sands Campaign’; secondly to leverage the growing interest of ranchers and landowners in limiting unbridled oil and gas exploration and production in southern Alberta; and thirdly to conduct specialised opinion research and media work to identify messaging for these and other efforts that will generate maximum information value among Albertans.”And to further connect the dots, Greenpeace contracted Andrew Nikiforuk in 2009 to write a report for them entitled: “Dirty Oil: How the Tar Sands are Fueling the Global Climate Crisis.”  That same year, through the auspices of Tides Canada fundee “RAVEN” (Respecting Aboriginal Values and Environmental Needs), Nikiforuk went on a cross-Canada tour of anti-oil sands speaking events.Source: https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/alberta-tar-sands-a-major-climate-and-economic-threat-greenpeace-report-538570241.html RAVEN has been funded by Tides Canada. Greenpeace featured the tar sands on the cover of their 2009 annual report.In 2011, numerous tar sands campaign fundees appeared in the CBC co-produced documentary “The Tipping Point: Age of the Oil Sands.” Indeed, the research papers contributed to PNAS by Schindler, coauthored with Kelly, that sparked the documentary were funded in part by Tides Foundation (US).https://www.pnas.org/content/106/52/22346 https://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16178However, some of the impact on changing a favorable investment climate for the oil sands to a negative one was done by the Toronto Star in this Tides Canada funded series.Source: https://tidescanada.org/climate-and-energy/tides-canada-partners-with-the-toronto-star-for-climate-and-economy-series/Since investment markets are run by human beings, they are subject to psychological tactics that work on people, too – like ostracization.In this article, “Dropping Oil and Investing in Green”, oil sands investment is made to sound like a failure.So much for ‘independent journalism.’ Of course, in the TO Star-Tides Canada funded article “Dropping Oil and Investing in Green,” there’s no mention of the global anti-oil sands Tar Sands Campaign, driven by >100 groups and Corporate Ethics strategy.Source: https://corpethics.org/about/ No mention that the UN Principles for Responsible Investment 2014 “Montreal Pledge,” encouraging its institutional investors (with some ~$100 trillion in Assets Under Management) to be activists with governments and corporations, to divest from fossil fuels, especially oil sands (on claim of being a ‘carbon risk’). No mention of UNPRI’s conflict of interest with ESG guru Al Gore as a public cheerleader against the oil sands and pipelines. No mention that World Resources Institute, a collaborator with Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management, also set three-quarters of the unattainable Paris Agreement targets. No mention of a decade of persistent Greenpeace attacks on investors, banks and governments, often operating behind the scenes with nasty attempts to intimidate corporate executives as ‘climate criminals.’https://www.ciel.org/news/executives-facing-climate-denial-related-claims-could-be-personally-liable-ngos/ Seems likely that Joanna Kerr, now of Tides Canada, was likely party to some of these efforts while Executive Director at Greenpeace.That drive-off from oil sands investing was made almost complete by the Rockefellers’ CDP Worldwide report of Nov. 2016, wherein all oil sands invested companies were rated at the bottom of the CDP’s subjective ‘preparing for the future’ scale. This CDP report resulted in many institutional investors and banks abandoning the oil sands, likely on threat by financial heavies that it presented a mythical ‘carbon risk.’ Robert Lyman’s present-day comparative analysis of oil sands emissions intensity, rebutting Keith Stewart of Greenpeace, shows these claims are distorted.Hislop writes:“At the very least, Kerr’s interview and the information provided by her organization demonstrate that a significant portion of Krause’s research is inaccurate, and her allegations are seriously flawed.”  I contend that since the information I present, which I found online with little effort, shows that Kerr and her staff don’t know their own history, which is out there in the public domain, or are reluctant to discuss these facts.  Hislop seem reluctant to press them, or do the little research I have done.This also raises the question, if Tides Canada wants to appear squeaky clean on the Tar Sands Campaign allegations, why would they hire someone like Kerr as CEO. She comes from Greenpeace, which has dedicated itself to destroying the Alberta oil sands, and it has largely succeeded in the objectives it described for this Oak Foundation grant of $424,373 provided in 2010 as described below.Certainly, this should have been the first question Hislop asked of Kerr.“To create awareness of the financial, regulatory and political uncertainty that surrounds investments in the tar sands so that prominent financial analysts, media, opinion leaders and Members of Parliament will publically express concern about the lack of government regulation of the tar sands industry. Greenpeace Canada aims to publicise the controversy around the tar sands both within and outside Canada. This will encourage the withdrawal of major institutional investors from the tar sands by 2012; the end of France’s tar sands subsidies; and the passage of a feed-in-tariff in Alberta utilised by farmers, ranchers, landowners and investors to develop the province’s huge wind power potential.”Interestingly, on Dec. 5, 2016, the Financial Post published a blistering commentary by Markham Hislop wherein he takes the Liberals to task for playing along with environmental groups in their denigration of the National Energy Board.  Hislop wrote:I would bet that not one Canadian in a hundred has an informed opinion of what the NEB does and how well it does that job — including many people who work in the oil and gas industry.The eco-activist strategy was to break the pipeline review process and demand a replacement. It worked.People formed their impressions of the NEB from news coverage of the Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain Expansion protests over the past five or six years.Eco-activists have systematically demonized the regulator, claiming the NEB is broken, in the pocket of industry, doesn’t include climate change in its assessment, etc.Hislop is referring to the ‘modernization’ of the NEB, which ended up with the ‘no more pipelines’ legislation Bill C-69. Hislop wraps up that article with these comments:[Minister] Carr has said it’s his government’s responsibility “to move our natural resources to market sustainably.”If so, why roll the dice and open up the Canadian environmental review process based not upon data or science but the political talking points of groups that for the most part oppose natural resources exports?Why risk having those very same groups try to hijack the NEB “modernization” the same way they did the Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain assessments?The Liberals are playing a very dangerous game. Given that the Canadian economy is still driven by natural resource extraction, let’s hope they play to win.Based on this, it is hard to understand Hislop’s present defence of Tides Canada when there is so much evidence of Tides Canada participation and funding of Tar Sands Campaign actors like Andrew Nikiforuk, RAVEN, and others. Even harder to understand when there is so much more evidence of Greenpeace Canada’s Tar Sands Campaign activity. With Greenpeace Canada being the environmental alma mater of Kerr, the new Tides Canada CEO, why wouldn’t Hislop ask some fair questions about that?  Hislop has made persistent efforts to delegitimize Vivian Krause as a conspiracy theorist when Krause references well-documented material (drawn from reliable public records and accounts like IRS and CRA filings).So, in my opinion, it is a fair question to ask why Markham Hislop is playing softball with Joanna Kerr of Tides Canada on the Tar Sands Campaign against Canada.  And in light of the economic and employment damage to Canada done by that largely foreign-funded campaign, everyone should be asking – “How is this charitable activity?”Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists, AAAS, and APS.~~~~Disclaimer: This is an opinion editorial independently researched by the author with no direction, funding or representation by or from any industry or party.  There was no communication with Vivian Krause about this article and the author and Friends of Science Society have no affiliation with Ms. Krause or any other body.  Tar Sands Campaign fundees use ‘climate crisis’ as the rationale for shutting down the oil sands – but this appears to be a manufactured crisis – as we discuss in this report.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'oil sands', 'Tar Sands Campaign']",2019/07/24
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/23/refuting-claims-that-canadian-oil-sands-crude-are-being-fairly-treated/,45clive ,Refuting Claims That Canadian Oil Sands Crude Are Being Fairly Treated," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is a former public servant of 27 years and was a diplomat for 10 years prior to that. His full biography is here. In a comment published in the Financial Post on July 17, 2019, Greenpeace Canada strategic Keith Stewart argued that Canada must “stop oil expansion”.  He rejected the view that oil sands are being unfairly singled out and claimed that crudes from the oil sands were “among some of the highest carbon oil in the planet”. He thus defended the environmental group campaigns to discourage investment, block pipeline infrastructure, and turn public opinion against the oil sands.  Statements like those made by Mr. Stewart depend for their credibility on a public that is generally uninformed about energy matters, and specifically uninformed about the science that underlies debates about climate change. They are aided by the extraordinary refusal of the Canadian petroleum industry publicly to defend itself against false claims. This blog post is thus intended to do a double service. It will provide the facts about the comparative carbon intensity of several crude oils and it will provide a free (i.e. no compensation received or expected) service to the sleepwalking Canadian oil firms. Because concerns about the alleged adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions has reached the status of a state religion in California, the state government, in the form of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), annually produces a report in which it calculates the “carbon intensity value” of the crude oils refined in the state. While these are only a small subset of the wide range of crude oils produced and refined in the world, the data provided offers a good source for assessing comparative carbon intensities of the crude oils refined in North America. The latest report can be found here: https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/crude-oil/2017_crude_average_ci_value_final.pdf For 2017, the most recent year reported, the average carbon intensity value of crude oil refined in California was 11.93 in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ). As 11.93 was the average, half the crude oils refined had carbon intensities above that level. Some crude oil from Canada, such as Mixed Sweet (8.27) and Canadian Conventional Heavy (9.27) were well below the average, but these were some crude oils produced by mining and in situ production that had higher carbon intensities, including these: Crude OilCarbon IntensityAlbion Heavy Synthetic19.90Cold Lake18.40Shell Synthetic21.39Suncor Synthetic23.71Surmont Heavy Blend18.26Source: CARB What about the carbon intensity of other crude oils that fall above the average in terms of carbon intensity? As might be expected, they include several sources and fall into a wide range. These examples, however, illustrate an interesting point. Crude OilSourceCarbon IntensityPlaceritaCalifornia31.20Arroyo GrandeCalifornia29.33Poso CreekCalifornia28.15CoalingaCalifornia27.85San Ardo California27.26Round MountainCalifornia25.99BurrelCalifornia25.23Kern FrontCalifornia25.10Montalvo WestCalifornia25.05McKitrickCalifornia24.64Wyoming SweetWyoming24.11MagdalenaColumbia21.01LompocCalifornia19.65CymricCalifornia19.23Antelope Hills NorthCalifornia19.14 Source: CARB If the CARB analysis had included crude oil supplies from all countries, there is no doubt that oil produced in Venezuela, Algeria and Nigeria would rank among those with very high carbon dioxide intensity, largely due to production practices that involve a large amount of gas flaring, As it is, the figures demonstrate that there are plenty of crude oil sources in North America with emissions intensities as high or higher than Canadian oil sands production.  Given this, why do you suppose that Greenpeace and other environmental organizations consistently only target Canadian oil in their opposition campaigns? How are we to react to his claims that they are being “fair”?  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'oil sands']",2019/07/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/13/tar-sands-campaign-dec-9-2010-ezra-levant/,,"Tar Sands Campaign – Dec. 9, 2010 – Ezra Levant"," Republished with permission of FCPP Original © Dec. 9, 2010LINK to original FCPP post: https://fcpp.org/2010/12/09/ezra-levant-lawyer-journalist-and-political-activist/As the Tar Sands Campaign has become newsworthy, a number of media commentators (Markham Hislop, Gary Mason, Rob Breckenridge) are suggesting that researcher Vivian Krause ( @FairQuestions ) is just a lone conspiracy theorist.  We just ran across this 2010 interview with Ezra Levant on the Tar Sands Campaign, originally published on the Frontier Centre for Public Policy blog. We appreciate their permission to reblog it here.Why do we care about these issues? Because the ‘climate change’ umbrella has been used to damage the Canadian economy, but the climate catastrophe claims are not supported by scientific evidence. However, ‘climate change’ is a convenient front for ‘any’ cause. Why not a Green Trade War against Canada?Ezra also talked with us about these Foreign Funded Lobbyists at our 2016 Annual Event – he says we should speak out against them. Listen – then read what he said in 2010.Ezra Levant: Speak out Against Paid LobbyistsInterview with Frontier Centre for Public PolicyFrontier Centre: What was the genesis of this book? [Ethical Oil] Was there an event or a point where suddenly it became clear that you had to write it?Ezra Levant: I was actually promoting my last book Shakedown which was about freedom of speech at the Ottawa Writers Festival last year and I was out there with some time to kill beforehand and they said there’s a fellow downstairs talking about the oil sands, you’re from Alberta that makes you as close to an expert as me go and make it a panel discussion. So I went downstairs and it was in this room that was adorned with all these big photos of the oil sands and open pit mines. I call it oil sands pornography. There were a hundred hostile people in the room and this anti-Alberta author and me. For the next 90 minutes I sort of got beat up about the oil sands and I didn’t really defend myself very well because frankly, I was arguing in a right-wing, conservative, property rights, climate skeptic way. After that experience I thought about it and those people in the room were not malicious or hostile they were actually the opposite. They were do-gooders. These were not Greenpeace fundraisers or lobbyists these were just concerned people.  (bold added)The problem was I wasn’t talking in a way that connected with them so I thought about and I decided I was going to write a liberal defense for the oil sands and that’s what I did.FC: What are the four liberal values you sought to appeal to in the book?EL: I think they’re genuine liberal values. They are not caricatures or straw men. They are environmental responsibility, peace, a fair wage for the working man and human rights. Those are four legitimate values that make up the liberal or progressive world view. Using those liberal yard sticks comparing the oil sands against every other oil exporter in the world I think you have to come to the conclusion that Canadian oil sands oil is the most ethical in the world.FC: Do you need to be a climate change skeptic to agree with this book?EL: Not at all. That’s what I mean about talking to Liberals on their own terms. I am a climate change skeptic, I’ve even written a whole book about it called Fight Kyoto, but you don’t need to be because oil sands oil has a lower carbon footprint per barrel than a lot of other oil that the U.S. imports from Venezuela and even American oil from California which is called California Heavy it’s so carbon intensive. The argument would be that we should replace higher carbon fuels in the states like Venezuela imports and California oil with lower carbon oil sands oil. So even a global warming worrier can agree with that.FC: Why do groups such as Greenpeace choose to target the oil sands in spite of the considerations you raise in your book?EL: I think there are three reasons that Greenpeace targets the oil sands. First of all, it’s safe. If you were to target the oil production in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, Sudan, Russia or Nigeria you would probably be killed. If you broke into a refinery there like they did in Canada you would be killed. That’s the first thing it’s safe and easy. The second is it makes a lot of money for them. Because the oil sands are open and transparent and you can look at them and people talk about them they are a great fundraising tool for Greenpeace. That leads to my third reason which is that they’re esthetically ugly. Those open pit mines, even though they’re only a fraction of the oil sands are developable using open pit mines, are ugly and so that is their chief political flaw is they’re not pretty to look at. I think the main reason is cowardice. Greenpeace won’t go after the badly behaved countries precisely because they’re badly behaved. They go after the world’s most gentle country precisely because we are gentle.FC: Can you see the taking of such an inconsistent position damaging Greenpeace in Canada or in the developing world?EL: Greenpeace doesn’t care about its reputation in the developing world. It’s really not active in the developing world. Measured by where they’re memberships and income comes from it is basically a European and North American company. I say company because it is a trans-national corporation based in Europe with annual revenues of about $250 million. If they don’t raise $1 million a day every weekday they are out of business. They are actively fundraising in China. That is the one third-world country where they are active in fundraising but in return they do not criticize the Chinese government. I don’t think Greenpeace cares about its reputation as much as it cares about its money.FC: What sort of reception have you had when taking the book on tour to universities over the past several months?EL: Professional activists will obviously never be persuaded no matter what the arguments are. I have debated no less than five different Greenpeace lobbyists and they refused to state obvious things such as the way we conduct our business in Canada is morally superior to Saudi Arabia. They won’t make that obvious concession even though they look ridiculous denying it because if they were to say Canadian oil is morally superior to Saudi oil certain things would flow from that like the fact that America should buy more oil sands oil and not Saudi oil and they don’t want to acknowledge that. With people who are not paid professionals I have had some luck. True Liberals if I appeal to their values honestly and hold them to their own standards a lot of them will come around. Even if they don’t become cheering champions of the oil sands they will at least moderate or modify their criticisms a bit.FC: How do you respond to the suggestion that you’re on the take from the oil industry?EL: I respond by telling them who actually is paying me for the book and it’s a literary publisher out of Toronto called McClelland and Stuart. They paid me a $40,000 advance for the book which was enough to keep me going as I wrote it and now I’m running royalties against that. I didn’t even talk to oil companies when I wrote the book. What would be the point? They haven’t been effective in making their own case. I did my own research for the book for example calculating the amount of blood per barrel in Sudanese oil. You’re not going to get that information out there you have to find it yourself. It’s funny because what I discovered along the way is that while I was working for my publisher and doing it as an independent journalist so many environmental journalists themselves are on the take. For example as I prove in the book Andrew Nikiforuk who is a journalist and an author himself actually took money from Greenpeace at the same time and didn’t disclose that when he presents himself as a journalist. I think I’m an anomaly in that I’m the only guy who wrote a book for its own sake. I’m not on the payroll of Greenpeace like Nikiforuk and others.FC: Why do you think the industry has been so ineffective at defending their own story?EL: I think for years they didn’t have to defend it because conventional oil and gas didn’t get a lot of protest. The oil sands are a fairly new phenomenon although they’ve been in experimental stages for decades it’s only been in the last five years that they’ve really been large and had large international attention. It’s a new thing being attacked and they are not used to it. I think that is hard for some oil companies to fight back hard because they have so many stakeholders and they have to moderate so they want to be the good cop but there is no bad cop in the industry. Buzz Hargrove was a champion for the auto sector and he’d take on anyone as tough as he could beat. There is no Buzz Hargrove in the oil industry you have a bunch of risk-averse CEOs with boards and risk management approach to things. Finally, the attacks on them are by extremely well-funded foreign lobbyists not just Greenpeace but groups like the U.S. Tides Foundation that have poured in $190 million in the last ten years of foreign money.FC: What’s their (The Tides Foundation) stake in this?EL: They are an ideologically driven group of people who are against capitalism, against energy development so they are driven by ideology. Groups like Greenpeace it’s one part ideology and one part fundraising.FC: Okay let’s switch over to another topic. What is the case for getting rid of Human Rights Commissions?EL: Human Rights Commissions serve no purpose. Real courts already handle wrongful dismissal matters, landlord and tenant matters. If you fire someone because they’re black, if you kick someone out of their apartment because they’re Aboriginal we already have real courts that will deal with that fairly and quickly so they’re redundant. What they do do is they go after fake crimes, hurt feelings, the counterfeit right not to be offended and they become this grievance industry that exists for its own sake. So not only do we not need them to do any good but they’re actually doing bad things that we should shut down.FC: Do you have any thoughts on the Saskatchewan government’s move to abolish the Human Rights Commission there?EL: I think it’s a good first step because it will get rid of that whole kangaroo court with all the bizarre processes. I’m still not happy that the laws exist even though they’re going to be implemented by real courts it’s an improvement but the Saskatchewan law contains a censorship provision. I don’t want even the finest judges in the land enforcing a censorship law. Yes it’s an improvement because some of the kangaroo court aspects are removed but I don’t want even the fairest court in the land empowered to be a censor. I don’t believe in censorship or the right not to be offended at all but it is a step forward and I congratulate Saskatchewan to be the first Canadian jurisdiction to take this stand.FC: Why is the Harper government going so slow on Human Rights Commission reform?EL: Because they’re afraid of being branded anti-human rights or anti-minority and that’s really the only strength the Human Rights Commissions has which is a lie they are not human rights commissions they’re actually human rights destroyers. They are destroying our freedom of speech which is a real human right. They’re destroying our freedom of religion and our property rights in the name of this counterfeit human right not to be offended. I think the conservative government with its minority position in Parliament is afraid that the opposition would brand them as anti-minority or anti-human rights. I think that’s a mistake. I think not only do the vast majority of minorities in Canada either don’t care about this law or oppose it but I think it would actually create a division in opposition benches. I think the Conservative party would be united for free speech and about half of Liberals would be united too, the true Liberals. It would create a problem for the opposition if anything. Where would Michael Ignatieff stand? Historically he’s been on the side of free speech so if anything I think it will be a great wedge issue for the Conservatives to use against the Liberals. It would also give the Conservatives bona fidance with groups that traditionally don’t support them like artistic groups, editorial boards, people who love free speech would congratulate the Conservatives which they don’t usually do.—-Related:Climate Catastrophe Leadership – Friends of Science Society 16th Annual Eventhttps://youtu.be/oOQ6s6uu3O4Please read our reports showing the incredible financial and political influence of ‘Big Green’ in Canada.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/07/environmental-charities-a-compilation-of-reports-on-their-finances-power-and-implications-for-canada/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'oil sands', 'Tar Sands Campaign']",2019/07/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/07/03/italian-scientists-reject-anthropogenic-global-warming/,Andrew Roman ,Italian Scientists Reject Anthropogenic Global Warming," LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS: 90 ITALIAN CLIMATE SCIENTISTS SIGN NEW PETITIONWe must ‘’listen to the scientists’’ the climate alarmists preach.Well in Italy, over 90 Scientists have recently signed a petition, titled; ‘’Climate, a counter-current petition’’.To the President of the RepublicTo the President of the SenateTo the President of the Chamber of DeputiesTo the President of the CouncilPETITION ON GLOBAL ANTHROPIC HEATING (Anthropogenic Global Warming, human-caused global warming)The undersigned, citizens and scientists, send a warm invitation to political leaders to adopt environmental protection policies consistent with scientific knowledge.In particular, it is urgent to combat pollution where it occurs, according to the indications of the best science. In this regard, the delay with which the wealth of knowledge made available by the world of research is used to reduce the anthropogenic pollutant emissions widely present in both continental and marine environmental systems is deplorable.But we must be aware that CARBON DIOXIDE IS ITSELF NOT A POLLUTANT. On the contrary, it is indispensable for life on our planet.In recent decades, a thesis has spread that the heating of the Earth’s surface of around 0.9°C observed from 1850 onwards would be anomalous and caused exclusively by human activities, in particular by the emission of CO2 from the use of fossil fuels in the atmosphere.This is the thesis of anthropic global warming [Anthropogenic Global Warming] promoted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations, whose consequences would be environmental changes so serious as to fear enormous damage in an imminent future, unless drastic and costly mitigation measures do not are immediately adopted.In this regard, many nations of the world have joined programs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and are pressed, even by a throbbing propaganda, to adopt increasingly demanding programs whose implementation, which involves heavy burdens on the economies of the individual member states, it would depend on climate control and, therefore, the “salvation” of the planet.However, the anthropic origin of global warming IS AN UNPROVEN HYPOTHESIS, deduced only from some climate models, that is complex computer programs, called General Circulation Models .On the contrary, the scientific literature has increasingly highlighted the existence of a natural climatic variability that the models are not able to reproduce.This natural variability explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850.The anthropic responsibility for climate change observed in the last century is therefore UNJUSTIFIABLY EXAGGERATED and catastrophic predictions ARE NOT REALISTIC.The climate is the most complex system on our planet, so it needs to be addressed with methods that are adequate and consistent with its level of complexity.Climate simulation models do not reproduce the observed natural variability of the climate and, in particular, do not reconstruct the warm periods of the last 10,000 years. These were repeated about every thousand years and include the well-known Medieval Warm Period , the Hot Roman Period, and generally warm periods during the Optimal Holocene period .These PERIODS OF THE PAST HAVE ALSO BEEN WARMER THAN THE PRESENT PERIOD, despite the CO2 concentration being lower than the current, while they are related to the millennial cycles of solar activity. These effects are not reproduced by the models.It should be remembered that the heating observed since 1900 has actually started in the 1700s, ie at the minimum of the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the last 10,000 years (corresponding to the millennial minimum of solar activity that astrophysicists call Maunder Minimal Solar ). Since then, solar activity, following its millennial cycle, has increased by heating the earth’s surface.Furthermore, the models fail to reproduce the known climatic oscillations of about 60 years.These were responsible, for example, for a warming period (1850-1880) followed by a cooling period (1880-1910), a heating (1910-40), a cooling (1940-70) and a a new warming period (1970-2000) similar to that observed 60 years earlier.The following years (2000-2019) saw the increase not predicted by the models of about 0.2 ° C  [two tenths of a degree] per decade, but a substantial climatic stability that was sporadically interrupted by the rapid natural oscillations of the equatorial Pacific ocean, known as the El Nino Southern Oscillations , like the one that led to temporary warming between 2015 and 2016.The media also claim that extreme events, such as hurricanes and cyclones, have increased alarmingly. Conversely, these events, like many climate systems, have been modulated since the aforementioned 60-year cycle.For example, if we consider the official data from 1880 on tropical Atlantic cyclones that hit North America, they appear to have a strong 60-year oscillation, correlated with the Atlantic Ocean’s thermal oscillation called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation .The peaks observed per decade are compatible with each other in the years 1880-90, 1940-50 and 1995-2005. From 2005 to 2015 the number of cyclones decreased precisely following the aforementioned cycle. Thus, in the period 1880-2015, between number of cyclones (which oscillates) and CO 2 (which increases monotonically) there is no correlation.The climate system is not yet sufficiently understood. Although it is true that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, according to the IPCC itself the climate sensitivity to its increase in the atmosphere is still extremely uncertain.It is estimated that a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2, from around 300 ppm pre-industrial to 600 ppm, can raise the average temperature of the planet from a minimum of 1 ° C to a maximum of 5 ° C.This uncertainty is enormous.In any case, many recent studies based on experimental data estimate that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is CONSIDERABLY LOWER than that estimated by the IPCC models.Then, it is scientifically unrealistic to attribute to humans the responsibility for warming observed from the past century to today. The advanced alarmist forecasts, therefore, are not credible, since they are based on models whose results contradict the experimental data.All the evidence suggests that these MODELS OVERESTIMATE the anthropic contribution and underestimate the natural climatic variability, especially that induced by the sun, the moon, and ocean oscillations.Finally, the media release the message according to which, with regard to the human causeof current climate change, there would be an almost unanimous consensus among scientists that the scientific debate would be closed.However, first of all we must be aware that the scientific method dictates that the facts, and not the number of adherents, make a conjecture a consolidated scientific theory .In any case, the same alleged consensus DOES NOT EXIST. In fact, there is a remarkable variability of opinions among specialists – climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, astrophysicists – many of whom recognize an important natural contribution to global warming observed from the pre-industrial period and even from the post-war period to today.There have also been petitions signed by thousands of scientists who have expressed dissent with the conjecture of anthropic global warming.These include the one promoted in 2007 by the physicist F. Seitz, former president of the American National Academy of Sciences, and the one promoted by the Non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), whose 2009 report concludes that “Nature does not the activity of Man governs the climate ”.In conclusion, given the CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE THAT FOSSIL FUELS have for the energy supply of humanity, we suggest that they do not adhere to policies of uncritical reduction of the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere with THE ILLUSORY PRETENSE OF GOVERNING THE CLIMATE.http://www.opinione.it/…/redazione_riscaldamento-globale-…/…PROMOTING COMMITTEE:Uberto Crescenti, Emeritus Professor of Applied Geology, University G.

A review of 10 temperature time series from US cities ranging from the hottest in Death Valley, CA, to possible the most isolated and remote at Key West, FL, show rebound from the Little Ice Age (which ended in the Alps by 1840) by 1870. The United States reached temperatures like modern temperatures (1950 – 2000) by about 1870, then declined precipitously principally caused by Krakatoa, and a series of other violent eruptions. Nine of these time series started when instrumental measurement was in its infancy and the world was cooled by volcanic dust and sulphate spewed into the atmosphere and distributed by the jet streams. These ten cities represent a sample of the millions of temperature measurements used in climate models. The average annual temperatures are useful because they account for seasonal fluctuations. In addition, time series from these cities are punctuated by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).As should be expected, temperature at each city reacted differently to differing events. Several cities measured the effects of Krakatoa in 1883 while only Death Valley, CA and Berkeley CA sensed the minor new volcano Paricutin in Michoacán, Mexico. The Key West time series shows rapid rebound from the Little Ice Age as do Albany, NY, Harrisburg, PA, and Chicago. IL long before the petroleum-industrial revolution got into full swing. Recording at most sites started during a volcanic induced temperature minimum thus giving an impression of global warming to which industrial carbon dioxide is persuasively held responsible. Carbon dioxide, however, cannot be proven responsible for these temperatures. These and likely subsequent temperatures could be the result of regression to the normal equilibrium temperatures of the earth (for now). If one were to remove the volcanic punctuation and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) input many would display very little alarming warming from 1815 to 2000. This review illustrates the weakness of linear regression as a measure of change. If there is a systemic reason for the global warming hypothesis, it is an anthropogenic error in both origin and termination. ENSO compliments and confirms the validity of NOAA temperature data. Temperatures since 2000 during the current hiatus are not available because NOAA has closed the public website.LINK TO FULL PAPER: Volcanoes ENSO and Carbon Dioxide (1)Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'volcanism']",2019/07/01
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/the-ontario-government-climate-legacy/,Bob graham ,The Ontario Government Climate Legacy," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant. He was a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior. His full biography is here. With the current push for public policy to adopt ‘green energy’ schemes, it is time to reflect on the Ontario experience. Ontario’s disastrous electricity policy has been publicized and commented on extensively by many sources, so this is not news. What is news is to lay the blame squarely at the door of its climate policy motivation, and, perhaps, to remind people of high the bill has been – $9 billion for poor contracting practices, $133 billion in global adjustment fees from 2015 to 2032 (at least 20 per cent of which relates to renewables), $3.6 billion to build the “smart grid and smart meters”, up to $55 billion in deferred costs that will hit future ratepayers, and 75,000 lost industrial jobs. That is quite the tally for zero global environmental benefit.Executive SummaryFrom 2003 to 2018, two Ontario Premiers, Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne, and their parties governed the province of Ontario and implemented a series of policies founded on the theory that humans are causing catastrophic global warming and that reducing greenhouse emissions in Ontario would make things better. The centerpiece of their climate policy was the transformation of Ontario’s electricity sector.LINK TO FULL REPORT: The Ontario Electricity Legacy FINALCover image licensed from Shutterstock.After winning the provincial election in 2003, the McGuinty government began closing coal plants, adding wind and solar power generation and expanding the nuclear and hydro generation in the province. It did not anticipate the effects of the global financial crisis or of the higher electricity prices that resulted from their actions. By 2008, it became clear that electricity demand had declined significantly, and that the by-then available nuclear, hydro and natural-gas fired generation was more than adequate to meet Ontario’s needs, even if the coal-fired plants were closed. Yet the Ontario government embarked on a major expenditure program, which it presented as a job creation initiative. In 2009, the Ontario government passed the Green Energy Act. The Act sought to stimulate investment in wind, solar, hydro, biomass and biogas projects and to increase energy conservation.  Notably, it: Created a Feed-in-Tariff that the Independent Electricity Systems Operator (IESO) must pay, guaranteeing specific above-market rates for energy generated from renewable energy sources under 20-year contracts;Gave renewables “first-to-the-grid” rights, meaning that IESO had to take their production in preference to all other sources of generation; andImplemented a “smart” grid to support the development of renewable energy projects. On December 2, 2015, Bonnie Lysyk, Auditor General of Ontario, released her 2015 annual report on the value for money received by Ontario residents from the operations of the Ontario provincial government. Chapter 3 of the report contained a blockbuster – an extraordinarily damning assessment of the actions of the government with respect to electricity power system planning over the period from 2003 to the end of 2014. The report found that, from 2004 to 2014, the portion of residential and small commercial customers’ bills covering electricity generation costs increased by 80%, from 5.02 cents per kWh to 9.06 cents per kWh. The overall cost of electricity to consumers increased by 56%, from $12.2 billion in 2004 to $18.9 billion in 2014. Electricity consumers had to pay $9.2 billion more for renewable energy (wind, solar and biomass generation sources) over the 20-year contract terms under the Ministry’s current guaranteed price (i.e. feed-in-tariff) program than they would have under the previous program under which renewable energy was purchased through competitive bidding. Because of the mismatch between when wind and solar generation provides power and when consumers want it, Ontario increasingly had to curtail generation from other sources (i.e. pay generators not to produce) and dump surplus generation on the export market. From 2009 to 2014, Ontario exported 95.1 million MWh of power; the total cost of producing this power was about $3.1 billion more than the revenue Ontario received for exporting it. This had adverse consequences for ratepayers. Between 2010 and 2016, monthly electricity bills (including tax) in major Canadian cities increased by an average of $37.68. During the same period, electricity bills in Toronto and Ottawa increased by $77.09 and $66.96, respectively. The annual average household cost of electricity in 2009 was $486.72; in 2016 it was $1,002.48. By 2016, Ontario’s electricity rates were among the highest in North America. The largest corporations in the province, especially those facing stiff competition from companies in other jurisdictions, successfully lobbied to have their rates reduced. So, in 2011 the Wynne government decided that residential and small commercial customers should be forced to cross-subsidize the large companies. From mid-2011 to 2017, $6.2 billion in costs were transferred from large industrial users to residential and commercial users. Despite having some of their costs allocated to other users, large industrial firms saw their rates rise above those of their competitors and downsized accordingly. Ontario lost almost 75,000 industrial jobs. To deal with the mounting political opposition to high electricity costs, the Wynne government belatedly introduced the “Fair Hydro Plan”. The plan involved a shifting of costs from some groups to others through a complicated system of refinancing. Basically, the province will borrow the money to pay some of the current costs that would normally be passed on to electricity users in their rates, to reduce rates below the levels they would otherwise be until 2027, then increase rates after that to recover both the deferred costs and the interest that it had to pay to borrow. It was initially estimated that electricity cost refinancing alone would reduce ratepayers’ bills by $18.4 billion from 2017 to 2027. The actual costs have been higher. As a result, after paying elevated electricity bills for the next ten years, future ratepayers could be on the hook for as much as $54.7 billion in deferred generation and interest costs. From 2005 to 2016, Ontario reduced greenhouse gas emissions from utilities by 27 megatonnes. Canada’s GHG emissions declined due to the economic recession and then gradually increased to 722 Mt. Global emissions, meanwhile, grew from 30.1 billion tonnes in 2007 to 32.8 billion tonnes in 2015 and 33.4 billion tonnes in 2017, almost entirely due to economic developments in the Asia-Pacific area. So, Ontario’s actions reduced Canada’s overall emissions in 2015 by 3.7% and had no effect whatsoever on global emissions. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'decarbonization', 'Ontario']",2019/06/28
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/emergency-what-emergency-an-open-letter-to-canadians/,Robert Francis Lyman ,Emergency? What Emergency? An Open Letter to Canadians," Contributed by Donald Lee © 2019In this op-ed submission, a citizen expresses their outrage over the declaration of a “Climate Emergency” in Canada.by Donald LeeRecent political news has continued to follow Pareto’s 80-20 rule: 20% sense and 80% nonsense. Our emperor in Ottawa and his Comic Courtiers have declared a Climate Emergency. Really? Perhaps I’m just a country bumpkin and my personal experience is merely “anecdotal” in the grand Sea of Scientific Seriousness in which I can only dip my toe. But my grandchildren are growing up in an Alberta climate today not observably different from the Alberta climate in which I grew up half a century ago. What emergency?Yet our emperor insists that something is rotten in the State of Climate and he’s going to fix it with – wait for it – taxes! Really? Setting all the scientific questions aside for the moment, as an economist, I can tell you there is absolutely no way you can change the climate of the entire planet with taxes. The earth’s climate does not respond to taxes. Taxes just don’t do that. That’s the truth. Taxes raise money for governments. They don’t do much of anything else except make life more difficult and expensive for all the rest of us. Politicians, and their economist lackeys, think they create whatever dystopic vision of society they want with tax incentives and disincentives. The truth is – it ain’t so. There is precious little real economic evidence to suggest that taxes do any of the other things they’re purported to do. Even high taxes only marginally affect human behaviour. High booze taxes have not reduced the inexorable rise in per capita alcohol consumption. High tobacco taxes did not reduce cigarette smoking. The gradual realization that smoking kills you did that. And millions of people blithely continue to slowly kill themselves anyway. Fuel taxes have not induced people to park their cars when they need to travel, to turn off their furnaces when they need to warm up, or to shut off their lights when they need to see in the dark. Perhaps our emperor has forgotten that Canada is cold and dark for half the year.To solve the fantasy Climate Emergency, our emperor has settled upon the one thing governments do well – tax and spend. A carbon tax. Really? Every living thing is made of carbon – every human, animal, fish, bird, every tree and every blade of grass. Are we taxing all these? No. Ninety percent of the earth’s carbon is tied up in sedimentary rocks. Are we taxing the rocks? No. So even though carbon is the sixth most abundant evil element in the universe, we’re not going to make any money by taxing it.  It’s not a tax on carbon. That’s just lying propaganda. It’s a tax on fuel, plain and simple. We’ve had fuel taxes for 100 years and they haven’t changed the climate yet. Neither will this one. That’s the truth. Any possible impact of higher fuel taxes in Canada on global CO2 production will be so infinitesimally small as to be indistinguishable from zero. Carbon taxes cannot possibly affect the climate.So it seems that our emperor and his Comic Courtier Economists, drunk on the wine of their own grandiose economic omnipotence, have taken a new and bold step in their Religion of Social Engineering. Not only do they believe they can change human society to suit themselves (hiding behind the curtain and pulling the levers of tax incentives like the Wizard of Oz), they believe they can change the physical universe! (And some people think I have strange beliefs.) Surely the climate will respond to tax incentives – in exactly the way we believe it will. The fact that it’s never been done before, or that there is no real scientific evidence to suggest it will work (lots of speculation, but no evidence), are mere incidentals that only a non-believer would quibble over.Nor does it matter that even the brightest among us don’t actually know how the climate works, since no one has yet come up with a general theory of climate. It’s of no import that no one can even explain the scientific climate evidence. What causes ice ages to start? Or end? No one knows. Or what about minor climate changes like the Little Ice Age. The earth spent about five centuries getting gradually colder (1200-1700) and has since spent about three centuries unraveling that change. Nobody knows why. But it doesn’t matter because, with confidence born of ignorance, our emperor is going to change the earth’s climate with taxes. And you’re going to pay them! If changing the earth’s climate is as easy as “putting a price on pollution”, then surely we could simply put a tax on water, thereby discouraging it and causing the sea level to fall.A Climate Emergency? The true evidence shows there is no increase in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events anywhere in the world. The true evidence shows no change in the rate of sea level rise over the past 150 when records have been kept. The geologic evidence suggests the rate hasn’t changed for the past 12,000 years. What emergency? Some of us are old enough to remember that the same apocalyptic disasters that are now supposed to happen by 2030 were supposed to have happened already. No apocalypse yet. What emergency?Once again, our emperor and his Comic Courtiers have instituted a solution that cannot possibly solve the imaginary problem it is purported to solve. Are they ignorant or deceitful? Those are the only two possibilities I can think of. Either they have no idea what they’re doing, or they know exactly what they’re doing and it’s not what they say they’re doing. (Did ya follow that?) Can any of this supposed environmental nonsense be of any benefit to sea turtles, or burrowing owls, or polar bears? Nope. How about the homeless? Nope. How about people who built homes in swamps or on eroding shorelines? Nope.The only possible beneficiary of carbon taxes is the government bureaucracy itself. Once again, hundreds of freshly minted Humanities majors and under-employed housewives will find gainful employment and a steady paycheque shuffling paper in Ministry of the War on the State of Climate. J.K. Rowling would approve the new fantasy ministry.Our Climate Barbie says she’s doing the right thing by taxing pollution. Really? Why then do municipalities in Liberal ridings continue to dump raw sewage into Federal waterways without consequence? Isn’t that pollution? It contains carbon. And we do know how to solve that problem. In fact, it’s easy. That’s the truth.It’s a famous tactic of failing politicians to pick fights with neighboring countries, to distract the public’s attention from their domestic policy failures. Since Canada has no readily-available neighbors we could beat up, our emperor has found some indefensible entities to attack – the vile State of Climate and the insidious Principality of Plastic Straws. Surely if we legalize hallucinogens, write the scripts for the town criers, and wage successful wars against imagined enemies, the people will love us. Now we can create a new Ministry for the War on Plastic Straws. Our Elites are incredibly out of touch, not only with ordinary people but with reality as well.I don’t think our emperor could recognize an emergency if it sat up in his cannabis-infused Cheerios and said, “Good morning.” There are certainly crises in our society, as always, but our Elites cannot distinguish the crucial from the trivial. While they pathetically battle Plastic Straws and Climate Change like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, they’re oblivious to the fact that half of Albertans would vote for secession today because we’re so disgusted with trying to be a part of this dysfunctional nation, and sick and tired of being squished under the heel of its idiotic rulers.The emperor has no clothes. That’s the naked truth. Donald Lee is an author and retired teacher. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/06/28
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/canadas-flawed-carbon-tax-system/,,Canada’s Flawed Carbon Tax System," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant. He was a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior. His full biography is here.The Trudeau government, supported by environmental groups and many in the Canadian business community, has implemented a carbon dioxide pricing system as one component of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. “Carbon pricing” is the term that includes carbon dioxide taxes, emissions trading, and fees on industrial emissions intensity, all intended to create a financial incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In a recent paper, I compared the design of the Canadian carbon pricing system to the theoretical model that has been used to justify it. I also examined the actual and expected effects of the system on pricing, consumers, industry and regions.LINK TO PDF OF ‘Carbon Taxation: The Canadian Experience”:  Lyman-carbontax-1 (1)The federal government’s national policy framework allows each province and territory to decide how it will implement carbon pricing, while at the same time setting certain minimum conditions that must be met. Jurisdictions may use either carbon taxes or emissions trading (‘cap and trade’) systems. For larger emitters, they may also employ output-based pricing systems (OBSP). An OBSP imposes fees on firms that do not meet prescribed levels of emissions intensity in their production processes. The framework requires steadily rising prices for the effective tax, levy or emissions trading permit price. Starting at $10 per tonne of CO2 equivalent in 2018, the rate must increase by $10 per tonne per year until it reaches $50 per tonne in 2022. The jurisdictions must return a portion of the revenues collected to the public, although there is considerable room for flexibility in how this is done. If, in the federal government’s judgment, a province or territory does not meet these conditions, the government will impose a ‘backstop’ system. The backstop system will apply in New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. While the carbon tax rates have not been set for the period after 2022, it is clear that $50 per tonne is not high enough to meet the government’s emissions reduction target for 2030 and the much more demanding reductions now being advocated by the New Democratic Party, Green Party and others. There are six key flaws in the present carbon pricing system. In theory, the price increase caused by carbon taxes should reflect the “social cost of carbon’, or the estimated present value of the impact that an emitted tonne of carbon dioxide today will have on humans in the future. In fact, no one really knows what this is. There are other alternatives, such as the current market price of internationally traded carbon credits. The Canadian rates, however,  bear no relationship to the social cost that, theoretically, they are supposed to represent. The rates are based on political, not economic, considerations. Carbon taxes are beneficial when they provide a market-based substitute for a host of intrusive government programs and regulations that seek to manage and direct consumer and industry behaviour. Canada’s system merely adds to a large and growing number of government regulations, subsidies and other program measures. There are over 600 of these. The taxes will have severe adverse effects on the emissions-intensive sectors and firms in Canada. By far the largest adverse impacts will occur in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where almost half of all Canadian emissions occur. This is not just a western Canadian problem, though. The energy-intensive resource and manufacturing industries in other provinces and territories must inevitably be affected by the impact of the taxes on their competitiveness. This includes primarily firms in the emissions-intensive industries like mining, petrochemicals, iron, steel, cement, metal fabrication and vehicle and parts manufacturing. The United States, our main trading partner, has no federal carbon tax and China has regional taxes of about $2 per tonne. The system will vary considerably across Canada in terms of coverage, rates, exemptions and revenue recycling. Rates will be highest in provinces and territories subject to the federal “backstop” regime, and lowest in Atlantic Canada and, for the time being, in Quebec. Quebec’s carbon prices will be set by the price of permits in the Western Climate Initiative with the State of California; Quebec firms pay millions of dollars to California permit holders, but the cost will be less than the residents of other provinces pay to governments. Revenue recycling, in theory, should be done in ways that would minimize the adverse macroeconomic effects of the tax, ideally through reductions in the rates of other generally -applied taxes like corporate income taxes. The Canadian system, to the extent that it provides for recycling, is instead an income redistribution system. It is not yet clear how much, if at all, businesses will benefit from rebates. The rebates thus serve essentially to deflect the criticism that carbon taxes are a “revenue grab”, while failing to compensate households for the full economic costs of imposing the tax. Three provinces – Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick – have filed appeals to the courts seeking judgments that the federal legislation authorizing implementation of the carbon pricing regime is unconstitutional. Alberta may follow suit. In the single court decision rendered so far, the federal jurisdiction was upheld. With provinces representing over half the Canadian population opposed on political and legal grounds to the tax, this raises obvious problems for the future viability of the system. Finally, the public should be aware of the exaggerated estimates of carbon tax effectiveness. By 2022, the carbon tax rates will be the equivalent of about eleven cents per litre of gasoline. Canadian Taxpayers Federation surveys show that the national average pump price of gasoline in 2018 was $1.35 per litre, so the tax would add 8 per cent to that. Yet, in its latest report to the United Nations, Environment and Climate Change Canada estimated that present climate policies will reduce 2022 emissions by 80 to 90 million tonnes per year. That is more than the emissions of all light duty passenger vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) in 2017. As with respect to other aspects of carbon pricing, the government should think again.Additional Carbon Tax resources:“Just the Facts on Carbon Tax”Debunking Ecofiscal Canada on Carbon TaxCarbon KleptomaniaLet Them Eat Carbon Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change']",2019/06/28
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/environmentalism-as-totalitarianism/,,Environmentalism as Totalitarianism," Contributed by Drieu Godefridi © 2019I see three motives that make it necessary to classify environmentalism among totalitarian ideologies in the strict sense.The first is that environmentalism does not make any secret of its will to control the entirety of human action. Indeed, the environmentalism claims to control each of the human activities emitting CO2. However, there is no human gesture, as tiny as it is – the simple act of breathing – which is not emitting CO2. Therefore, environmentalism claims to control the entirety of human action.The academic literature leaves no more doubt on this subject than the innumerable media variations. So man must give up the plane because it emits CO2. The car is one of the misdeeds of the past, because the automobile emits CO2, directly in the case of “ICE -Internal Combustion Engine” vehicles, indirectly when it comes to electric vehicles. Man must give up tourism, pleasure travel, traveling without rhyme or motive – or even with just cause. We must of course give up meat consumption because cattle farming emits CO2. “Veganism”, formerly the privilege of a tiny minority, is now a “scientific” obligation. Even the fact of having children should be hindered: because a child is the worst source of CO2 that can be conceived.Not only do environmentalists claim total control of human action, but they are proud of this claim.By way of comparison, it is interesting to note that while the great totalitarian ideologies of the past – National Socialism, Communism – claimed to be involved in all aspects of individual life, none have ever claimed or even conceptualized control as complete as the one environmentalists claim. Traveling in the USSR was narrowly limited by the poor availability of transport, but it never occurred to any communist ideologue to make problematical the very fact of moving. Holidays were limited in the communist countries, because the material means were limited, but never were the leave, the beach, the meat, even less the fact of having children, considered as an anti-social act, crime or problem in itself .From this point of view, the totalitarian purity of environmentalism is unprecedented.Two, a totalitarian ideology is defined by the objectification of an enemy; an element within the social body that must be confined, or even eradicated, to allow the advent of the final stage of human society, when the class barriers that had stratified nations for thousands of years would dissolve, or the racially pure socialist society. As early as 1920 in his speech Warum sind wir Antisemiten, pronounced in Munich, Adolf Hitler theorized socialism as being able to triumph only within a nation, Germany, by the purification of its race – thus the expulsion of the element that he presents as his negation: the Jew. Marx, who was exonerated of the crimes of communism by generation of intellectuals, is their direct author in the realm of ideas, with for example the concept of Volksrache, ie the recommendation by Marx of the legal lynching of enemies of the regime – the bourgeois and other “revisionists” – after the revolution has prevailed.Neither Jew nor bourgeois in ecological theology, and yet a properly “agonistic” logic, as it was said in ancient Athens. All contemporary ecological theory is defined by its rejection, its detestation, its execration of the human CO2, thus in the last analysis of man. The enemy of environmentalism is in all of us; it resides in this substance which transcends any consideration of class, race or culture: our very humanity. The enemy of the environmentalist is the man and the imagined “Garden of Eden-Earth” of the environmentalist would have been peeled of the human crust.Having worked for a long time on the subject of socialism, in its German and communist nationalist slopes, I was struck by the great sincerity, the candor of their authors, who never made a mystery of the atrocities they intended to commit. In this almost naive contemplation of to the abomination, thrown to the cantonnade, trumpeted, announced with rage and eagerness to act, resides, in my opinion, the third characteristic of totalitarianism. All the debate on the theme “we did not know” the genocide of the Jews by the National Socialists takes a surrealist turn when we measure that it is the whole of the national-socialist theoretical corpus which, since the first writings, the first harangues, point jauntily towards the massacre of the Jew perceived as possessing, animated of a spirit of lucre which would be the antithesis of German socialism. Marx, as we have seen, theorised about violence and civil war as a means of gaining access to power, but especially as a technique of government. National Socialists and Marxists did what they had announced, and massacred millions as soon as they had the opportunity.It would obviously be foolish to blame the environmentalists for the slightest crime; they have reached power nowhere. Green parties are around 10 per cent in the countries where they do best, and in the European Parliament.But their project and objectives are undoubtedly clear: it is about reducing humanity to a tiny fraction of what it is. Such was the recommendation of Hans Jonas, probably the most influential ecologist theorist of the twentieth century, such is today the recommendation of most intellectuals and environmental activists, consistent with their theoretical axioms. Get rid of nine-tenths of humanity ... How? This is an aspect of the program on which the ideologues remain the most discreet. Not all. Paul Ehrlich, probably the most read American ecologist since the sixties, author of “The Population Bomb ”  – the environmentalists did not talk about CO2 then, only overpopulation – advocated the sterilisation of the people who reproduce “like rabbits” (sic), a racist and contemptuous expression that targeted Indians and Pakistanis. If massive vasectomy is not enough, Dr. Ehrlich continued, then sterilizing substances must be poured into the drinking water. That would be the “final solution” – the expression is Hans Jonas, in an interview with “Der Spiegel” in 1992 – to the “ecological problem”.Environmentalism is a totalitarian ideology in the strict sense, more radical in its homicidal claims than any of its predecessors.—–Drieu’s new book is available on Amazonhttps://www.amazon.fr/L%C3%A9cologisme-nouveau-totalitarisme-Drieu-Godefridi/dp/2930650222 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'environmentalism']",2019/06/28

Why is every proposal to develop an outback mine, dam, irrigation scheme or a real power station now labelled “controversial” by the ABC and opposed by the ALP/Greens?This coastal-city focus and the hostility to new outback industry (except for wind/solar toys) has surely reached its zenith with the recent state budget for Queensland.The population of coastal and metropolitan Queensland is surging with baby-boom retirees, welfare recipients, grey nomads, tourists, overseas students, migrants and winter refugees. But the outback is dying with lagging industry and many aging farmers retiring to the coast. We are creating a country with no heart.The growing urban and seaside population needs power, water and food.However two critical power-water-food infrastructure projects that have been on the drawing boards for decades did not even rate a mention in the state budget – an expansion of coal-fired power at Kogan Creek and a water supply dam at Nathan Gorge.The current policy of all major parties is cluttering the countryside with piddling subsidised intermittent power producers like solar panels and wind turbines plus their expensive network of roads and transmission lines. This is inflating electricity prices, and future generations will see this bi-partisan energy policy as a disastrous blunder. It is also a mistake to encourage or subsidise private electricity cartels and put politicians, not engineers, in charge of power generation.The Kogan Creek power station with its adjacent coal mine was opened in 2007. It is connected to the National Grid and integrated with local gas-fired and solar supplies. It was always planned to add another generating unit at Kogan Creek, but twelve long years have passed with no action.Kogan Creek is crucial to maintaining a stable power supply to eastern Australia. This was demonstrated recently when a fault temporarily shut down Kogan Creek. The National Grid was barely maintained for about 30 minutes by the battery in SA until other base load generators could be started. With the likely 7 month closure of one damaged generating unit at Loy Yang power station, East Australian electricity supplies are now even more precarious.Moreover, with the complete failure of the $105M Kogan solar booster and delays to other solar plants in this area which were to be connected to the grid, the duplication of Kogan Creek is urgently needed.(Here is a telling quote from one of the backers of the failed Kogan solar project:“Solar works extremely well when the sun’s out.”)Coal produces reliable low-cost electricity from a concentrated area with less real environmental damage than gas, wind or solar. These low density energy sources need much more land to collect equivalent continuous energy from a wide area of bores, pipelines, turbines and solar collectors plus their backup generators, connecting roads and transmission lines. Most CSG wells also need to pump salt water from each bore before the gas will flow. Even if costly processes are used to extract fresh water from this salt water, brines are left behind and must be stored safely. This evil-genie of salt should be left in its underground lair and disturbed as little as possible.It is becoming clear that that CO2 does NOT drive global warming. Even if it did, when careful life-of-project studies are done for all of Qld energy sources, coal and hydro look likely to have the lowest carbon footprint with the least environmental harm (and they do not slice, dice or fry birds and bats).The surface disruption from an open cut coal mine is 100% and it shocks the senses. However, it recovers 100% of concentrated energy from a small area of land – far less than is permanently sterilised by roads and schools, and there is no intention of restoring them. Even if the open cut was abandoned at the end of mine life, slow but relentless natural healing would immediately start. However, instead of treating the final void as an expensive liability to be refilled with overburden, it should be seen as an asset to be contoured as a pleasant lake or used for burial of the growing mountains of urban waste.The need for reliable economical electricity is urgent. However, if Kogan Coal Power is too-close-for-comfort for Jacki Trad, her Environment Minister and the greens of South Brisbane, the next real power station option is Collinsville.The need to conserve more water is also urgent. Nathan Gorge has been known as an ideal dam site for 50 years, but still nothing is done. The site and catchment make it likely to be a high-yielding, cost-efficient dam. It is vital to the continuing development of the Surat and southern Bowen Basins and its water could be used for irrigation, power generation or fed into the Condamine/Darling River in droughts.Kogan and Nathan are decentralising projects that could provide community insurance for blackouts, floods and droughts.It is the outback that produces most of Australia’s food, minerals, energy, water, exports and jobs. And it produces serious income for state governments addicted to ever-rising taxes and royalties.Anti-development policies, land-use sterilisation, climate alarmism and green law-fare are destroying the future for our kids and grandkids. Current policies will stack-and-pack the coasts and major cities leaving a depopulated outback to uncontrolled floods and droughts, lantana and woody-weeds, wild cats and dogs, wild fires, feral pigs and the occasional park ranger or tourist bus.(895 words)Viv ForbesWashpool   Qld       4306        AustraliaPhone 0409 2777 94forbes@saltbushclub.comSome reading:How they wasted millions on solar energy at Kogan:https://www.smh.com.au/business/fastmoving-clouds-how-cs-energys-kogan-creek-solar-boost-project-failed-20170516-gw5p2u.htmlSeven month outage at Loy Yang:https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/agl-energy-flags-seven-month-outage-at-victoria-s-loy-yang-power-plant-20190607-p51vq0.htmlViv Forbes is not a member of any political party, and has no vested interests in mining, energy or bio-fuels, except as a consumer.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/vrt-and-climatic-propaganda-belgian-insights-on-media-lock-out-of-dissenting-views-on-climate/,,VRT AND CLIMATIC PROPAGANDA – Belgian insights on media lock-out of dissenting views on climate," The following is a Google translated version of this original post in French – published with permission of the author:LA VRT ET LA PROPAGANDE CLIMATIQUE Recently I relayed on my Facebook page the response of RTBF (French-speaking Belgian TV) to a listener who questioned him on the opportunity to reserve a space for so-called “climate-skeptical” theses:“At the risk of disappointing you, we do not consider that exposing climate-skeptical theses is evidence of courage or daring. We do not feel that we should dare to speak on this subject. There are enough scientific studies going in the direction of global warming so that we can consider, without being accused of partiality, that global warming is a fact. Have a nice week end “.That the RTBF drastically reduces the climate debate to the mere existence or not of a global warming, any “climate-skeptic” can only be a retrograde fossil that denies this obviousness and must therefore be ignored if not fought, is an example striking of the submission of the whole of the world press, and more particularly of the Belgian audio-visual media, to the only thesis of the human origin of the climatic fluctuations. They tolerate virtually one speaker on the subject: the catastrophist Jean-Pascal Van Ypersele of Strihou, ex-vice president of the IPCC. (1)But all this is not new, and on several occasions already I have treated the subject of a press reduced to the rank of mere propagandist (2), and more particularly of the editorial line of the RTBF and the VRT, which remember that public service organizations.The imperious instructions and invitations given to journalists are scrupulously respected. Among many others, note:– “Not only do journalists not have to report what skeptical scientists say, they have a responsibility not to report on it” . GELBSPAN ROSS- publisher of the Boston Globe – 07/2000.– “We have the duty not to be impartial. It is our duty to take the scientists’ point of view and not waste time wondering if they are right or not . ” Alan Rusbridger – Director of the Oxford LMH College – Member of The Scott Trust, owner of the Guardian and the Observer – former editor of the Guardian. (3)– The instructions given to BBC journalists. (4)The Dutch site “climategate.nl” (5) relays the complaint lodged in Belgium before the Council of Journalism, after the remarks concerning the partiality which the VRT (Dutch-speaking Belgian television) shows in its relation of the climatic problematic, were rejected by the mediator of that body. A position that will not surprise anyone! Below are some of the arguments presented following the responses received from the mediator.One of them particularly appealed to me: the actual existence of a cordon sanitaire around so-called “climate-skeptical” personalities, much more rigorous than the one supposed to preserve us from extremist ideas. In the Middle Ages, heretics were burned. Today, we must preserve the population from the pernicious contagion of “climate-skeptical” scientists!Jo Moreau Complaint to the Belgian Council of Journalism regarding climate information (VRT)In response to my recent correspondence with the VRT mediator, he clearly acknowledges that there is only one credible source for VRT’s climate information service, the IPCC.The Ombudsman also said that journalists can not replace scientists because they do not have the knowledge to judge whether scientific opinions are correct or not? And yet, that’s what they do by promoting only one (political) vision.Moreover, to our knowledge, in its TV programs of the past six months, VRT has not invited any climate-skeptical scientist to defend its point of view. And if there had been, it would have been an exception drowned in the almost daily broadcast of the IPCC’s alarming news on the climate.The VRT attaches great importance to the code of ethics and claims to be seeking the truth, but not with regard to global warming . For example, it pays no attention to the many sources criticizing IPCC positions.This selective blindness of the VRT editorial team has consequences.– The unilateral nature of VRT’s broadcasts is a form of deception that does not respect ethical rules.– This contributes to a bias without a scientific basis.– This puts pressure on politicians with the obvious consequence that some political parties are thus favored. In this case, it is the Flemish party GROEN and its Walloon equivalent ECOLO. Their unilateral views confirm the suspicion that VRT publishers follow a left-wing ideology directed against anyone who departs from it.– The great attention paid without any criticism to young schoolchildren also contributes to the manipulation of the population. After all, if children are not scientists, they are very interesting and easy to manipulate media players.Regardless of these ethical concerns , it remains of course to be determined whether VRT has the right to lay a cordon sanitaire around scientists who have not manifested themselves as right-wing activists. We note that party chairman Vlaams Belang (6) is invited, but not climate-skeptics.It is not acceptable that during debates, the TRV authorizes the guests to denigrate unfettered climate-skeptics unrepresented.Today, everything is different: everything is now a question of consensus. If there is consensus, no need for discussion or research. Consensus is the new magic word. Not surprisingly, postmodern philosophy has elevated consensus to the rank of supreme arbiter of truth and falsehood, good and evil.Our VRT apparently thinks so too. From the answer to our question, ” Why does the TRV provide exclusive coverage representing the position of the IPCC, ” we extract the following sentence: “The editors can only declare that the UN panel on climate benefits always of a consensus for the academic debate. It is therefore not illogical that the publishers pay the greatest attention to the work of the panel  “.“They say it all and it’s true,” CQFD ! I must admit that it is much simpler to apply than previously accepted methods of proof. If we want to know if something is true or false, we must focus today on the existence of a consensus.I address this complaint to VRT editors at the Council for Journalism because recent correspondence with the ombudsman shows that VRT writers are clearly not ready to change their unilateral information on climate change. (1) https://belgotopia.com/2019/01/28/jean-pascal-van-ypersele-climatologist-exclusive-of-our-medias/(2) https://belgotopia.com/2017/03/13/journalism-information-or-propaganda/(3) https://belgotopia.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/the-journalist-and-the-climate-change-information-and-activism/(4) https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/07/bbc-we-get-climate-change-coverage-wrong-too-often(5) https://www.climategate.nl/2019/05/brief-aan-de-belgische-raad-voor-de-journalistiek/ ?(6)

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/28/a-conversation-with-john-christy-for-association-des-climato-realistes/,,"A conversation with John Christy, for Association des climato-réalistes"," John Raymond Christy is a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) whose chief interests are satellite remote sensing of global climate and global climate change. In February 2019 he was named as a member of the EPA Science Advisory Board. An interview with Grégoire Canlorbe. Grégoire Canlorbe: You have been at pains to show that climate models are over-predicting warming by roughly a factor of two. Could you come back to this alleged falsification? John Christy: We should be applying the scientific method to claims scientists (and others) are making about the climate. In this case I downloaded the output from 102 climate model simulations used by the IPCC and compared the tropospheric temperature since 1979 between the models and several observational datasets, including the satellite dataset we generate. The models on average were warming the atmosphere at a rate significantly greater than the observations. This is a test result from which we can say the models failed, and thus one shouldn’t depend on model output to characterize the future climate. Grégoire Canlorbe: You are notably known for your involvement—along with Roy Spencer—in devising the first successful satellite temperature record. It turns out that beforehand you had already built your “first climate datasets” at the age of twelve, “using a mechanical pencil, graph paper, and long-division (no calculators back then.)” Could you tell us more about this life of invention? John Christy: I was fascinated with the weather conditions around my home in the San Joaquin Valley of California (a desert basically) and the contrast with the climate of the Sierra Nevada Mountains immediately to the East. I was curious as to why some years were wet, others dry… why the Sierras had more precipitation and why the snow levels varied so much.  I was the first high school student in California to write a simple program to predict the weather and to calculate the snow level in the mountains. These were very crude, statistical models in 1968, written for computers that were far less sophisticated than today’s cell phone. But, they introduced me to computer coding and to the power that was required to study. That was over 50 years ago.John Christy (on the left) in the company of Grégoire Canlorbe – Paris, May 2019   Grégoire Canlorbe: It is sometimes alleged that given the impossibility to obtain—from the study of averaged weather patterns over a given period—reliable predictions on the forthcoming atmospheric conditions, climatology is not a full-fledged science. At best, it would be an art mobilizing various scientific fields (such as physical geography, oceanography, and metrology); at worst, it would be a propaganda tool. Do you recognize some relevance to such criticisms? John Christy: One of the fundamental characteristics of the scientific method is that if we understand a system, then we can predict the behavior of that system. Our work in which we compare “predictions” from climate models against the actual changes of the real world indicate the current understanding of climate change is rather poor. This understanding is certainly not mature enough for regulatory policy. That certain experts and elites refuse to see the level of immaturity of understanding regarding climate, is astonishing. However, it is understandable since climate is such a complex system, it is easier and more comforting for these elites to simply ignore the complexity and declare they believe CO2 is dangerous and we should believe them because of some status of authority they have garnered for themselves. They claim the “Science is Settled” only because they have not performed the necessary scientific tests which I believe would lead them to the opposite conclusion. Grégoire Canlorbe: Concerning the climate-realist argument that CO2 is the food for plants, it is commonly answered that any good thing in excess—including CO2—becomes a poison; and that CO2 levels continuing to rise would only be beneficial to those of plants sheltered in highly controlled greenhouses.While the increase in temperature (following the increase in CO2) engenders an increase in the size of deserts, the larger growth—as well as the greater moisture evaporation—of CO2 enhanced plants heightens their need for water; as a general rule, too high a supply in CO2 leads to a reduced availability of other nutrients—and, in the case of certain plants, can also trigger a reduction of photosynthesis or a greater vulnerability to insects. How do you assess this analysis? John Christy: The evidence from satellite observations is very clear that the Earth has experienced considerable “greening” over the past 20 years, so this indicates that the extra CO2 we have put back into the atmosphere is having a very positive impact on the biosphere.  It should be noted that most of the living things around us developed in an atmosphere millions of years ago that contained four to ten times more CO2 than we have at the present. So, deserts are not increasing, but contracting. This is where the scientific method is so important—when someone makes a claim about a change in the climate or Earth system, others should test that claim with real observations. Unfortunately today, the media often would rather announce the dramatic claim of a terrible change without checking the facts.   Grégoire Canlorbe: In response to showing that climate is barely sensitive to CO2, it is not uncommon to assert that it remains impossible for fossil fuel industry, mechanized agriculture, and mass urbanization not to have disturbed the natural course of climate in one way or another. To what extent do you reject this claim? John Christy: I think the natural course of the climate has been changed, especially in urban areas where the natural surroundings have been drastically altered. Temperatures are warmer (especially at night) in these urban areas. Globally, the climate impact of the extra CO2, I believe, is actually smaller than the urban warming signal in our big cities. It should be noted that the people of the world are moving toward modernization and that is accomplished by affordable energy—which today comes from the burning of carbon-based fuels. In the future, other sources of energy that are affordable will be deployed and this alleged problem of “climate change” will fade away. It is important to note that we did not leave the Stone Age because we ran out of stones. We left the Stone Age because something better was discovered by human ingenuity. We will leave the Carbon Age not because we run out of carbon, but because a different and more affordable source of energy will be developed. As of now, the traditional renewables aren’t the answer because they supply such little energy relative to the area they cover, and they are unable to supply energy “on-demand” as is required for a modern economy.   Grégoire Canlorbe: The recent Notre-Dame de Paris fire has been occasionally qualified as a consequence of global warming. In other existing interpretations, the burning is thought to be God’s punishment against the Roman Catholic Church—by reason of its alleged crypto-Paganism which would be culminating into the ecologism of Pope Francis and his endorsing the belief in anthropogenic warming. As a former missionary, how do you react to this demonization of the Catholic Church? John Christy: I do not think such interpretations are useful. I would only say that, in general, the Christian faith upholds the value of human life so that actions that enhance the length and quality of human life is the moral imperative. At this point in time, the use of carbon-based energy provides exactly what is needed here—the energy needed to lengthen and enhance the quality of human life. Without energy, life is brutal and short as I learned while serving as a teacher/missionary in Africa. Grégoire Canlorbe: The purported neoconservative turn of Donald Trump’s foreign policy does not fail to arouse controversy. When it comes to assessing retrospectively the neoconservative movement, its positive deeds and its mistakes, do you think figures like George W. Bush, Paul Wolfowitz, William Kristol, or John Bolton have been fighting against eco-fanaticism as vehemently as they have been combating the threat of Marxism or that of Islam? John Christy: I do not think about this issue too much. I would say that one should look at the final piece of data—the world is increasing its carbon emissions as it works to eradicate poverty. So, while the world has been scolded for 25 years by elites from scientific, academic and liberal government entities, nothing has really changed. People will pursue what is in their own best interest—long, healthy and fulfilling lives—and affordable energy makes that happen.   Grégoire Canlorbe: It has been hypothesized that changes in incoming solar radiation—over several decades—are the main factor causing or, at least, modulating climatic variations. Could you share your thoughts on this alleged connection between the Sun and climate? John Christy: I’ve looked at this issue and we do see the impact of solar variability on our stratospheric temperature data. However, in the troposphere (where we live) the evidence is very difficult to draw out because our dataset is only 40 years long and other major perturbations have confused the ability to detect an 11-year cycle (i.e. volcanic eruptions, El Niños etc.) There certainly must be a relationship between solar variability and climate, and I am watching with interest the work of those who study the cosmic-ray connection which is directly related to solar variations. Perhaps even greater evidence will be coming soon in this area.   Grégoire Canlorbe: It is not uncommon—in some Christian circles—to conceive of the Darwinian theory of evolution as a state-sponsored hoax comparable to man-caused global warming. Both would be pseudo-scientific perspectives denying the divine character of man and the presence of Providence in the universe—and leading to idolize the state. As a Protestant scientist, how do you assess this opinion? John Christy: This is an interesting question. Please note that a scientist using the scientific method should generate a reproduceable result whether he/she is a Baptist (like me), a Buddhist or a Baha’i. The scientific issues about climate are based on measurements we make to test claims, not on an opinion one might have. When it comes to policy that directly affects people, especially the poor, we now must consider non-scientific issues such as: is it proper to inflict hardship on those who can least afford it by following policies that demonstrably will not impact the climate? It is not in our best interest to appeal to religious feelings when dealing with issues that are available for scientific testing. As the average person knows, there are a multitude of religious opinions today, but a scientific test should have results to which all rational people, religious or not, should be able to acknowledge. I also think the average person has considerable experience regarding the claims about a dangerous future from so-called experts which the average person knows are simply exaggerations. And, the average person knows that these experts want to pass rules that take away a part of life that the average person wants and needs. Recent elections around the world demonstrate that the average person recognizes these false claims of calamity and wants to get on with their lives without the burden of higher taxes and fees which, in fact, will not impact the climate anyway (as we have shown with scientific tests). The average person is smarter than the experts and elites suspect. Grégoire Canlorbe: Thank you for your time. Is there something you would like to add? John Christy: No. Thank you for interviewing me.——Confronter au réel les affirmations sur le climat (en) (the opening is in French; Dr. Christy’s presentation is in English) Dr. Christy was Friends of Science Society’s guest speaker on May 17, 2010 at our Seventh Annual Luncheon in Calgary.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/21/a-target-made-to-be-missed/,karabar ,A Target Made to Be Missed," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat. His full biography is here. This commentary responds to the recent comments by Trudeau, Scheer and prominent journalists about how and whether we will attain the 2030 target, all of whom treat it as if it were cast in stone.  The Paris Agreement targets are not legally binding, not sacrosanct and not realistic.Elizabeth May – whose party claims to have a “Mission Possible” plan, demanded even more stringent targets: One of the topical political debates in Canada today is whether Canada will meet its “target” of reducing greenhouse gas emissions set prior to the December 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The target is to reduce emissions by 2030 to 30 per cent below national emissions in 2005; in other words, to reduce them from 716 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017 to 512 Mt in 2030. Confusion abounds about what this target means. First, it is not a legal requirement. The Paris Agreement placed no legal requirement on any country to actually reduce emissions, only to submit plans about how they would reduce emissions according to nationally-determined priorities. There is no penalty for non-compliance. The total emissions reductions that would result from the plans countries submitted in 2015 would not reduce global emissions enough to attain the United Nations aspirational goal of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In fact, if one accepts the UN’s analysis, the commitments in the existing plans from take the world about one one-thousandth of the way to that objective. The prospect of missing the target is not unusual. Canada previously set emissions reduction targets in 1992 and 1997 (the Kyoto Accord) and missed them by a wide margin. In 2012, Canada committed to reduce emissions by 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020; there is no way that target can now be met. We are in good company in this regard. Only a handful of European countries have ever met past emission reduction targets. Of the top ten largest emitters in the world today, none of them are on track to meet their 2030 emissions reduction targets. If truth be known, no one really ever expects the targets to be met. In management terms, a company may set targets as a way of providing a standard against which to measure progress towards its long-term business objectives. Business targets must be realistic and achievable. No one expects emission reduction targets to be achieved. They serve political, not operational, objectives. For the governments that set them, they serve as ways to rally their supporters to a cause and, more often, to cope with the incessant pressure they get from environmental activists to “set an example”. For the activists, they serve as the measuring sticks by which they can hold politicians’ feet to the fire, bitterly criticizing them when they (inevitably) fail to meet the objectives. It gives the environmentalists’ objectives the moral high ground in any internal country debates about the tradeoffs between economic and environmental objectives. So, let’s stop treating Canada’s 2030 target as though it were sacrosanct, and start talking realistically about whether it can and should be met. In fact, it won’t, for three reasons. First, as acknowledged by the Parliamentary Budget Office in its recent report on this subject, the Canadian economy and population are likely to grow between now and 2030. The PBO’s assumption, drawn from external analysis, is that Canada’s GDP will grow by 26 per cent and its population by 16 per cent between 2016 and 2030. Under normal conditions, GHG emissions would also grow significantly, as energy use and emissions historically have been closely tied to national income. There are two possible reasons why emissions might not grow in our case. One is that we might achieve a remarkable improvement in energy efficiency and emissions intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) as a result of technology, policies and programs. The other is through a deep and prolonged recession.See Robert Lyman’s latest on the PBO report:  “The Stakes Are Too High To Be Tricked By The Numbers” Second, because we would have to make great efforts just to avoid emissions increasing in a growing economy, we are unlikely to make the kinds of emissions reductions required to go from 715 Mt to 512 Mt in 13 years. Contrary to the perceptions of many, emissions reductions of this magnitude cannot be achieved by installing more efficient light bulbs, driving less with more fuel-efficient cars, or turning down the thermostat in winter. It would take severe cuts to our economy. Eliminating every single car, SUV and pickup truck would only reduce emissions by 85 Mt; it would not take us even half-way to the 2030 target. We would also have to cut a substantial portion of our heavy industry both in resources and manufacturing, spend hundreds of billions of dollars on public transit and new electricity generation and transmission (with corresponding increases in consumer costs), and accept restrictions on personal choices unparalleled except in wartime. Almost half of Canada’s emissions arise from activities in Alberta and Saskatchewan; large emissions reduction would significantly punish those provinces by curtailing their most important industries. Third, because the economic costs are so high, the political costs would be unacceptable. According to recent polls, more than half the people in Alberta and Saskatchewan already favour secession from Canada because of federal government-imposed policies. Even if the average Canadian consumer accepted without complaint thousands of dollars per year in higher fuel costs for vehicle use, home heating and electricity usage, there would be an inevitable backlash when severe restrictions are placed on a wide range of energy uses, especially when it becomes every year more obvious that global emissions are growing regardless of anything Canadians do. Canada’s political system and constitutional makeup, with the provinces owning and controlling resources within their boundaries, empowers the regions to strongly defend their interests, and they would certainly do so. The 2030 target was set without due regard for what attaining it would cost Canadians. It deserves to be missed. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/06/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/06/19/shocking-reality-electrification-and-decarbonization-net-zero-pathway-to-economic-and-energy-catastrophe/,,Shocking Reality: Electrification and Decarbonization – Net Zero = Pathway to Economic and Energy Catastrophe," Copyright © 2019The David Suzuki Foundation’s report “Zeroing in on Emissions: Canada’s clean power pathways – A Review” presents a review of a set of theoretical possibilities for reducing emissions from fossil fuels based primarily on the notion that everything powered by fossil fuels today can be electrified using a connected power grid of hydro, wind, solar, tidal, batteries, and geothermal. It is concerning that much of the content of Canada’s Expert Panel on Sustainable Finance echoes many of the unrealistic proposals of the Suzuki report.  There is a deeply concerning disconnect between concept, cost-benefit analysis and implementation of proposed technologies. Practically speaking, the world runs on oil, natural gas and coal – all ‘renewable’ forms of energy require these to exist and to function on the power grid. There is no magic replacement.LINK TO FULL REPORT  ‘SHOCKING REALITY: ELECTRIFICATION AND DECARBONIZATION’ Shocking Reality FINALThe scenarios set out in the Suzuki paper are just that – imagined possibilities crafted by people who would like to see technological and economic developments that have not happened to date. The report offers a list of ten simple slogans of three to five words, wrapping up with ‘bring everyone along’ – claiming “Together, these strategies are a litmus test for a credible climate plan.”  The technologies promoted like wind and solar can complement a conventional power grid, but not replace it.  They have long been dismissed as unable to address climate change, and in terms of energy return on energy invested, wind and solar are unable to support basic society. Due to their weather-dependent nature, wind and solar are especially unsuited to a cold, vast, snowy, often overcast country like Canada. Furthermore, the energy generation options that do show promise, such as Small Modular Reactors, are not yet market ready. Based on historical trends in energy transition, their introduction will take decades. Innovation is certainly worth pursuing, but that is not a sound basis for public policy or a major shift in investment. What is problematic is that all of the changes in Canada’s energy supply and demand system that the Suzuki report envisages and advocates for depend not upon the free choices of producers and consumers but upon massive intervention, subsidization and regulation by governments. Government central planning never has worked as well as free, competitive markets, and there is no reason to believe that will happen soon. Making dramatic changes to the electrical grid often has extremely dire, unexpected consequences.  Germany and the UK have experienced a huge rise in heat-or-eat poverty and premature deaths due to the introduction of expensive wind and solar and related transmission line/natural gas back-up costs. The Suzuki “Zeroing…” report excludes mention of the additional physical infrastructure costs and socio-economic implications.  Poverty is not a way to ‘bring everyone along.’ This report, “Shocking Reality: Electrification and Decarbonization” shows that “Net Zero” is a pathway to economic and energy catastrophe.  We provide some cautionary real-world examples to inform the public and policymakers.  The greatest risk is that, based on an incomplete assessment, certain parties may begin some of these major transitions, only to then find ourselves ‘stuck’ as the costs of additional, unaccounted for infrastructure bloom while the economy staggers under the burden; that grid reliability may be put at risk – or that industry, faced by rising costs and regulation, may abandon Canada for greener, free market pastures. “Do you guys on Wall Street have something in your desks that makes steel? Where is fertilizer, cement, plastic going to come from? Do planes fly through the sky because of some number you put in a spreadsheet?… The idea that we have the current tools and it’s just because these utility people are evil people and if we could just beat on them and put (solar panels) on our rooftop—that is more of a block than climate denial,” Gates said. “The ‘climate is easy to solve’ group is our biggest problem.” – Bill Gates https://youtu.be/d1EB1zsxW0k (11:42) Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/06/19

Eng. © 2019Various proponents are touting the perception that the greening of society, by which they mean replacing all processes producing carbon dioxide, with electrically driven processes, is both simple, easy, and cost effective. All we need, according to them, is the will.This paper examines what such a transition means overall, and provides some conservative assessments of the ease of that transition.All aspects considered in some detail will follow the same methods and explanations for each step are provided.All starting numbers are taken from the NEB 2016 published reports.LINK TO POWER POINT: IMPACTS OF GREENING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE  To summarize:A wise man once said; “Given time, money, and steel, nothing is impossible.”The existing Canadian electrical system required about 100 years to construct.To capture the greening opportunity in the next 20 years, or 30, or 40, requires us to construct more than twice as much capacity as we currently have. Base load capacity, not wind, not solar.We have neither the time, the money, or the steel to meet this challenge. Therefore greening as proposed is impossible.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'decarbonization', 'energy']",2019/06/19
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/29/analyzing-the-future-the-tug-of-war-between-politics-and-economics/,karabar ,‘Analyzing’ The Future – The Tug of War Between Politics and Economics," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019“He who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass.” Edgar FiedlerPredicting the future has always been a perilous and uncertain activity. For centuries, soothsayers foretold events by cutting up chickens and examining their entrails. Today, scientists, economists and others use sophisticated computer models to do the same thing, often with similar results. In perhaps no other field has the practice, and malpractice, of attempting to project future events become more controversial than in the field of energy. Once, the challenge of the analyst was mainly to understanding past trends and how current events might alter them.  Today, however, he or she must be mindful of how projections will align with claims of Anthropomorphic Global Warming  (AGW) (i.e. that humans are the major influence on the global climate) and that governments must manage the energy economy to produce their preferred environmental outcomes. To some extent, projecting the energy future has become a tug of war between economic and political considerations.This point is illustrated in the most recent report by British Petroleum, the BP Energy Outlook 2019 edition. British Petroleum is one of the most highly-regarded commentators on global energy markets. This is partly because of its authoritative reporting of energy supply and demand statistics, which it provides free to the public in the annual BP Statistical Review of World Energy.  It is also because of its occasional special reports, including its energy outlook documents. The 2019 edition, just published, sets out BP’s analysis of the possible global energy supply, demand and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions trends to 2040.BP has come under increasing pressure from believers in AGW and their supporters in the financial services industry to support climate change activism. This has been increasingly evident in its last few outlook documents. The 2019 edition succumbs by not presenting two or even three alternative scenarios of the future, but four. The “More Energy” (ME) scenario assumes that the future energy outlook will be very much like the past; that is, driven by the desire of people, especially in the developing countries, for increasing access to improved lifestyles and the energy services that support them, with only modest improvements in technology. The “Evolving Transition”(ET) scenario sees the consumer-driven pressures being partially offset by more rapid technological change and a politically-driven shift towards a lower-carbon dioxide fuel mix. The “Less Globalization” (LG) scenario is much like the Evolving Transition one, but it reflects the potentially adverse economic effects of prolonged trade disputes and increasing protectionism. Finally, the “Rapid Transition” (RT) scenario is one in which all governments adopt policies that will reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45% by 2040; this might be considered the “lite” version of the policies recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the Summary for Policy Makers based on its Special Report 15 of September 2018. Most of the commentary and graphic illustrations in the report are based on the Evolving Transition scenario.The outlook is a quite long document, filled with interesting graphs and tables. One can find it here:https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2019.pdfIn this commentary, I will not attempt to summarize the outlook, but rather to draw attention to its projections that are of most interest from the perspective of those who take a skeptical view of the AGW thesis and its related policy prescriptions.Global Primary Energy Consumption and Fuel Shares Using 2017 as a base, the BP scenarios all project that the world’s primary energy consumption will grow in the period to 2040. Consumption rises from about 14 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (Btoe) in 2017 to 15 Btoe under the Rapid Transition scenario, 17 Btoe in the Evolving Transition scenario, and 23 Btoe in the More Energy scenario.All of the growth in energy demand comes from fast-growing developing economies, led by India and China.The shares held by different fuels vary considerably among the scenarios. In the ET scenario, the shares of consumption held by coal and oil decline, that held by natural gas rises considerably, nuclear and hydro stay roughly constant and renewable energy use rises considerably. In the RT scenario, each of these trends is slightly increased, except that renewables account for all the growth in energy demand.In the ET scenario, energy consumption grows at an annual average rate of 1.2 per cent, down from over 2 per cent in the previous 20 years. Despite significant growth in prosperity in many countries, a substantial portion of the world’s population still consumes relatively low levels of energy (annual consumption of less than 100 GJ per head) in 2040. They are the ones left behind.https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2019-presentation-slides.pdf Pg. 2The Dual Challenge BP states that the global energy system faces a dual challenge: the need for much more energy to serve the needs of a growing population and the need for far fewer carbon dioxide emissions. In its graphs, BP presents these goals as essentially irreconcilable. Certainly, the ET scenario is not consistent with achieving either of these challenges. The RT scenario is also described as a “half-way stop” in reducing carbon emissions.Transport Demand In the ET scenario, the demand for energy in transport services almost doubles by 2040. All of the growth is outside the OECD.The energy efficiency of the average car increases by 50 per cent, and truck fuel efficiency increases sharply as well.However, as the scope for further efficiency gains in aviation and marine modes is small, nearly half the increase in energy use from 2030 to 2040 is in these two modes.Transport continues to be dominated by oil. In the ET scenario, the share of oil in transport declines from 94 per cent currently to 85 per cent by 2040. Electricity accounts for only 5 per cent of transport demand by 2040.In the ET scenario, the number of electric vehicles reaches around 350 million by 2040, of which around 300 million are passenger cars. This is equivalent to around 15 per cent of all cars and 12 per cent of all light duty vehicles. As there are only about 5 million electric light duty vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) on the world’s roads today, this represents a large leap of faith.A counter-trend to rising fuel efficiency in passenger vehicles is that the rise in global incomes may affect commuter behaviour in Asia. Many people there may no long choose to ride in high occupancy public transport and shift to private vehicles, a fact BP describes as a “key challenge”.Natural Gas Demand In the ET scenario, the importance of natural gas as an energy source greatly increases, supported by broadly-based demand, plentiful low-cost supplies, and the increasing availability of gas globally, due to increasing trade in liquified natural gas (LNG).Natural gas grows at an average rate of 1.7 per cent per annum – increasing nearly 50 per cent by 2040.The growth in gas demand is led by the industry and the power sectors, largely driven by developments in the developing countries.The speed and pattern of gas demand growth in the non-OECD, however, depends on the pace at which the required supporting infrastructure (i.e. transmission and distribution systems) is built, which BP describes as an area of major uncertainty.The Global Fuel Mix The following graphs illustrate the projected changes in fuel mix under the ET scenario, along with the resulting changes in the shares of primary energy.Page 7, BP Energy OutlookIt is notable that:In 2040, fossil fuels, (oil, natural gas and coal) still constitute 78 per cent of primary energy consumption globally.Coal consumption, which is condemned by supporters of the AGW hypothesis, remains essentially flat over the period, but still exceeds the role played by renewables in 2040.While use of renewable energy grows at the rate of 7 per cent per annum, its share of global energy consumption only increases from 4 to 15 per cent. (Recall that the ET scenario is a moderately optimistic case from the perspective of AGW believers.)BP’s projections thus show the share of global energy demand served by fossil fuels, which has been declining at the rate of 1 per cent per decade since 1990, declining at the faster rate of 3 per cent per decade in the period to 2040. At this rate of change, fossil fuels’ share of consumption would decline to zero in 26 decades, or somewhere around the year 2500.Carbon Dioxide Emissions In the ET scenario, carbon dioxide emissions from energy use increase, not decrease, in the period to 2040.  They are higher by 7 per cent in 2040.Net emissions would rise from 33.4 billion tonnes in 2017 to 36 billion tonnes in 2040.Most of the emissions growth is in the power and buildings sectors, and all of it is in the developing countries.These trends would mean that the goals enunciated in the COP21 Climate Agreement would not be met.Comments As stated at the outset, forecasting the future is difficult at the best of times.British Petroleum undoubtedly finds itself in a quandary. As one of the premier compilers and analysts of past energy market developments, it might be tempted to base future projections largely on an extrapolation of current trends. Presenting such an outlook, however, would have exposed the company to great abuse by the adherents to the AGW hypothesis and their supporters. Faced with that threat, BP has included the extrapolation of present trends as an “outlier” scenario, and focused most of its analysis and commentary on the Evolving Transition scenario. To protect itself even further, it has added two scenarios that anticipate higher emissions reductions, including one (i.e. the Rapid Transition scenario) that comes close to, but does not quite match, the future envisaged by those who demand a “Green New Deal”.BP thus may have realistically accommodated the political pressures on it, but at some cost to its credibility. After all, if none of one’s scenarios respond adequately to what one states are the compelling dual challenges faced by the global energy system, they are all reduced to products of political compromise, not detached and objective economic analysis.Other prestigious forecasters include the International Energy Agency, the United States Energy Information Administration and EXXON. As each updates its energy outlook report in the coming months, we will see how well they accommodate or resist the politicization of energy supply and demand analysis.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'energy']",2019/05/29

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/29/chatelaine-dupes-millions-of-women-on-climate-and-energy-policies/,,Chatelaine Dupes Millions of Women on Climate and Energy Policies," Op-ed by Michelle Stirling © 2019Chatelaine’s Apr/May 2019  “Green” edition is filled with tips, like “How to Convert a Climate Skeptic.”  That’s an article by the edition’s guest editor/curator Dr. Katharine Hayhoe.  She’s married to an evangelical pastor, so conversion therapy appears to be her scientific method of choice for talking climate. That, and feelings.  Dr. Hayhoe was in Calgary on March 6, 2018 as part of last year’s IPCC Cities Conference.  She tried to scare us all with the thought of a warmer winter.  She told the assembled crowd at Telus SPARK that we should rely on feelings about climate change, not facts and evidence. In her Chatelaine article, Dr. Hayhoe claims weather extremes are more frequent, but this claim is not supported by the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) Special Report on Extreme Weather.  In that report, as confirmed by climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry in her 2014  US Senate testimony, extreme weather is not ascribed to human-causation, and such events are not increasing.Though Dr. Hayhoe claims ‘the reality is that climate change is affecting us today’ – that’s a silly comment. Climate changes all the time.  Climate change is measured in 30, 50, 100 and millennial timescales, so most of us don’t live long enough to experience climate change. As Dr. John Harper FGSA,FGAC, PGeol., former director of the Geological Survey of Canada, explains in this video clip, most politicians can’t define climate change; they certainly can’t stop it. Neither can you.https://youtu.be/e6UHTa5hzq0Dr. Hayhoe’s curated magazine gives a page to Tzeporah Berman, who spouts off about stopping pipelines to save the planet, but meanwhile her bio says she lives in Vancouver and likes to take trips to Cortes Island to kayak. How green!However, the only way you can get there is by fossil fueled transport. BC Ferries runs one of the largest ferry systems in the world – all on fossil fuels.But the real prize is Chris Turner’s article about Bornholm, a tiny Danish island with some ~40,000 residents and 600,000 annual visitors.  Based on his 2013 experience visiting this island, Turner tells us “The Future is Greener than you Think.”   He talks about his visit to Bornholm, an island dotted with wind farms, solar panels and EVs, saying: “Imagine an enviable quality of life, all without a single molecule of carbon dioxide sent skyward to compound the global catastrophe of climate change.”A closer look at Bornholm shows that it has the world’s longest submarine (underwater) 60 kV cable of ~ 46 kilometers, connecting the island to Swedish nuclear and hydro power.  That can supply all the power for the island. Laying such a cable involves fossil fuels, and cash. Lots of it.I could not find the original cost of the undersea cable but estimates of the present cost of such lines are about £100 Sterling per metre or about $6,000,000 USD for 46 000 metres. The cost of installation can be between £2-£5 million per kilometer (46 km), or $156,896,646.82 to $392,241,617.05 Cdn.[1] Typically, the cost of such a line is borne by the consumer on top of the cost of the electricity, though since the island is being used as a kind of renewables laboratory, the cable was funded 50% by the EU and 50% by corporations involved in testing related renewables energy systems. Imagine that tab if spread over the ~40,000 residents alone!There is even a LEGO video clip of life on Bornholm in the new Utopia.https://youtu.be/60fRJAaMpLcIn 2010, Bornholm was still powered largely by diesel generators, coal, incineration, and biomass. [2]  Wind turbines were added between 1992 and up until 2008.  They provide about 30% of their nameplate capacity.However, more recently additional wind turbines were voted down as residents felt it was infringing on the quaint, historic nature of the island.Temps can get to minus 17C there in winter, and no surprise that this 2007 report shows there is a spike in power demand in winter, the authors suspecting this is due to electric space heaters.[3]No matter what, Bornholm is an interesting experiment, but not representative of the real world.Chris Turner writes: “Imagine driving to work, plugging the car’s battery pack back into the grid and brokering the sale of any power you don’t need at a profit, as demand rises during the day.”This is highly unlikely.  Most electric vehicles have severely limited range because of battery power limitations, something that is exacerbated by extremely cold temperatures such as those in Canada.  Far more likely you would have to plug in to recharge or to ‘precondition’ your car before leaving work (i.e. warm up the passenger cabin).[4]  Furthermore, Canada does not have enough hydro power to support the goal of a Zero Emissions transportation sector.  We’d need to build many more power dams, as Kent Zehr, P. Eng. points out in this power point. Such projects take about 20 years from inception to completion (barring activists blocking development), cost billions of dollars each, and we have no such plans on the table in Canada. [5] (Does not include cost of transmission and distribution upgrades).Yes, going further down this EV path might leave us broke and in the dark.Aside from Turner exaggerating the likelihood of living a Bornholm Utopian life any time soon, he also continues the climate catastrophe refrain of many activists.  He states that “Millions will lose their homes and livelihoods and even lives before anything like a stable climate re-emerges.” What ‘stable climate’ is he talking about?During the Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 AD) civilization flourished in Europe, but there were still extreme weather events.Anno 1134: Extreme drought in the North of France. In June, a hot wind dries Normandy. Everywhere thirsty people flow into streams and rivers and many drown. In September in Normandy and elsewhere, many towns and villages were completely destroyed by fire, like Le Mans, Chartres, Alençon, Nogent and Verneuil. The Sambre dries up in Namur. Tsunami on the coasts of the North Sea in September or October. One night, the sea invades the land to a depth of 7 miles, stunning villages and homes. The disaster affects Flanders and neighboring countries. In December, major floods in Normandy. Floods reach the roofs of houses. Anno 1135: Great heat and widespread drought in France and England. “It was so great that the land was burning hot at various locations in France.” Pastures and fields are grilled and there followed a great famine. Rivers and lakes are dry. Heather in the mountains and forests spontaneously ignited by sunlight. In Germany, the Rhine is almost entirely dry and can be crossed on foot. The forests are on fire. December 1st – England was swept away by a hurricane. Originally sourced from Belgotopia “Evenments” https://belgotopia.com/2015/02/27/sur-les-evenements-climatiques-extremes-1/  Here you can see a live webcam of the Rhine River. Things look fine and stable today.https://www.bafg.de/EN/06_Info_Service/03_Webcam_en/webcam_en.htmlAt the same time that Europe basked in mostly stable, balmy warmth of the Medieval Warm Period (which was about as warm or warmer than today’s temperatures), the south western United States of today, in the region of California, experienced 100- and 200-year droughts!In fact, regarding the Current Warm Period, according to climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry, climate and weather conditions have been pretty stable since the Great Depression, with some more extreme periods in the ‘50s and ‘70s, but people suffer from ‘weather amnesia’ and they forget.Following the Medieval Warm Period, there was a plunge into the erratic climate of the Little Ice Age, when women were accused of ‘weather cooking with the help of Satan’ and burned at the stake.  Astrophysicist Dr. Sallie Baliunas was Friends of Science Society’s first scientific adviser and speaker at our Second Annual Event in 2002.[6]  She recounts what happened to heretics then in this video.https://youtu.be/wcAy4sOcS5MChillingly, a similar thing happened to her career in contemporary times because she holds the view that the sun drives climate change.[7] Being a female scientist and having a mind of your own (and evidence) on climate science is verboten.How do Chatelaine feminists feel about that?Robert Lyman takes a look at the “Climate Hysteria – The Elusive Search for a Simple Response” – of the kind Turner is serving up. But when it comes to energy issues, there is no easy solution, no matter how much people may try to scare taxpayers into opening their wallets.[8]One of those solutions Turner mentions is the ‘simple, unsexy climate-saving tools’ claiming Canada could achieve a third of its emissions targets by simply implementing efficiency measures.[9]  One element of that is housing retrofits, but as Robert Lyman points out, that’s not so cheap or simple either, not to mention all this work requires new materials and lots of energy to implement. [10]It may be that as a Roger’s Media outlet, Chatelaine is just trying to please NEI Investments which, in 2015, directed the corporation to toe the party line on Paris Agreement and climate.“We met with Rogers in June 2015 to follow-up on our climate change dialogue. In light of theupcoming Paris Climate Conference and negotiations on global climate policy, we encouragedRogers to take a leadership position by expressing public support for climate policy and carbonpricing in Canada. We highlighted several initiatives, including the work of the EcofiscalCommission and CDP’s Road to Paris commitments, and the company indicated it would considersuch opportunities. We discussed the progress industry and provincial governments are making onadvancing climate policy.”– NEI Investments [bold emphasis added]NEI Investments has also “engaged” with the major banks of Canada. And it may be that, as one of the people involved in writing Smart Prosperity’s pitch for ‘green’ that Turner is just continuing a train of thought, as Smart Prosperity is keen to push climate bonds, and these rely on climate catastrophe for their viability.[11]But the female demographic who are the largest readers of Chatelaine, are being led astray by this ‘green’ edition, in my opinion, for all the reasons stated above.Feel free to disagree with me.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/29/robert-lyman-background-and-experience/,James Strachan ,Robert Lyman – Background and Experience," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert LymanAs a frequent contributor to Friends of Science Society reports and blog posts and as a guest speaker at the 2017 annual event, I have usually presented my biography in simple terms, that I worked in the public service for 27 years and was a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.  However, people have requested more information about my experience and with what authority do I write on the energy and environmental policy issues.  I prepared this overview. In a nutshell, I have spent over forty years as an economist, manager and consultant working on a broad range of energy and environment public policy issues, mainly for the Canadian federal government. The following is a point form summary of my experience.  After graduation with an Honours degree in International Relations (Economics, Political Science and History), I joined the former federal Department of External Affairs. I served as a Canadian diplomat for ten years, with postings in Caracas, Venezuela and Washington, D.C.My assignment in Washington occurred during a period when both Canada and the U.S. were heavily regulating oil and natural gas markets and prices, and there were several outstanding issues to be resolved concerning cross-border oil and gas trade and pipelines, including whether the MacKenzie Valley Pipeline should be built. This gave me an opportunity to learn a great deal about energy and trade regulation and pricing issues.After leaving the foreign service, I worked as an economist in the Energy Policy Branch of the Energy, Mines and Resources department during the acrimonious negotiations over oil and gas policy before and after the publication of the National Energy Program.I worked for two years in Finance Canada analyzing and advising on energy expenditure issues related to the federal Budget.After that, I led a group of economists responsible for analysis of international oil prices and market conditions.For two years, I worked on Executive Interchange as the Ottawa representative of the Canadian Gas Association at the time of natural gas deregulation.In the late 1980s, I was the Senior Director of Energy Policy when climate change issues first arose; I was heavily engaged at that time in implementation of the Offshore Accords with Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and with the negotiation of the resource aspects of aboriginal land claims.I was the first federal co-chair of the Federal-Provincial Committee on Climate Change.I was the Senior Director of Oil Policy from 1995 to 2002 when the fiscal regime governing oil sands development was being expanded, and I worked closely with Finance Canada on the key issues. At that time, I led the first federal work assessing the public policy that should govern carbon dioxide capture and geological storage.I managed the group providing expert advice on the potential for emissions reduction in the oil industry during the Climate Change Table Process prior to the Kyoto Accord.I was the Director General, Environmental Affairs, in Transport Canada from 2002 to 2006, leading the analysis and policy development with respect to emissions reduction in the transport sector, development and implementation of climate programs, and promotion of technology development to reduce emissions in the transport sector.As a consultant from 2006 on, I performed major studies for Transport Canada on the implementation of the new Navigable Waters Protection Act, on the governance of the offshore oil shipping regime and on the development of a seamless regulatory regime to govern the prevention of and response to ship-source oil spills.I have written extensively on energy and climate-related issues, including several articles for the FOSS and a major paper on the factors affecting energy transitions for the U.K. Global Warming Policy Foundation.Throughout my public service career, I worked for eight Prime Ministers: Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark, John Turner, Brian Mulroney, Kim Campbell, Jean Chretien, Paul Martin and Stephen Harper. I was proud to perform my public service duties in a non-partisan way.~~~~Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy? Text of address:Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'energy', 'Paris Agreement']",2019/05/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/26/electric-vehicles-and-global-oil-demand-mid-2019-update/,45clive ,Electric Vehicles and Global Oil Demand – Mid-2019 Update," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who spent 27 years as a public servant in senior policy advisory roles related to Kyoto and GHG reductions; prior to that, he was a diplomat for 10 years.  This article is one of a continuing series in which I report on and analyse trends in global personal light duty vehicles sales, with a special focus on the role that plug-in electric vehicles play in total sales and vehicle stock and the potential consequences for global oil demand. In previous reports, I have described the International Energy Agency’s projections, as part of its Energy Technology Perspectives reports, that the global electric light duty vehicle (i.e. cars and SUVs) stock would increase from two million in 2017 to 56 million in 2030. In its recent World Energy Outlook 2019 report, British Petroleum projected (under its “Evolving Transition” scenario) that all-electric light duty passenger vehicle on the roads might increase to 300 million by 2040 and constitute 15 per cent of the global passenger vehicle stock. I previously proposed a scorecard by which one might assess whether plug-in electric vehicles are on track to meet the expectations of their proponents. I suggested that if, by 2020, the global inventory of EVs is three million or less, this would demonstrate conclusively that the technology is facing serious market barriers that might limit its growth for decades. A 2020 EV population of 20 million would align with the more optimistic claims. A stock in the range of 7.4 million to 13 million is consistent with growth trends seen to mid-2018, and while impressive, would not substantiate promoters’ more optimistic claims. What Has Happened? In keeping with past reports, I have used the best online sources of data available concerning plug-in electric light duty vehicle sales. These include InsideEVs, which provides data on monthly and annual sales for the United States and the world, and the International Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) for national and global sales of all light duty vehicles. I also use the reports of the U.S. Energy Information administration to document current and projected global oil demand trends. The following table shows EV sales since the beginning of 2014.Table 1Sales of Electric Plug-In Light Duty VehiclesYear     U.S.World2014122,938320,7132015116,099550,2972016158,614777,4972017199,8261,227,1172018361,3072,018,247201982,500*495,344** Source: InsideEVs*January-April, 2019**January-March, 2019 Both U.S. and global sales showed strong growth in from 2017 to 2018, rising 80 per cent and 64 per cent respectively. This has been supported by continuation of substantial subsidy programs in most countries. The sales data for the early months of 2019 are somewhat less robust. For the first four months of 2019, U.S. sales are only 10 per cent higher than in 2018. Global sales during the first three months of 2019 are 63 per cent higher than the comparable period of 2018, showing perhaps that the global trends are stronger. The highest vehicle sales usually occur later in the year. What Does This Mean for the Global Vehicle Fleet? The following table provides some context by comparing plug-in vehicle sales to the sales of all light duty vehicles.Table 2Sales of All Light Duty Vehicles (million)YearU.S.World20147.765.720157.566.320166.969.520176.170.82018n/an/a Source: OICA As you will note, light duty vehicle sales in the United States have declined for the past four years, while global sales have increased. In 2018, there were almost 71 million light duty vehicle sales globally. The following graph, also from OICA, shows how global personal vehicle sales have increased since 2005.Table 3 compares EV sales to total personal vehicle sales globally and in the U.S.Table 3Plug-In EV Sales as a Share of Total Sales (%)YearU.S.World20141.60.4920151.50.8320162.31.1220173.31.7320185.52.84 So EVs are increasing their percentage share of light duty vehicle sales, with one out of every 20 cars sold in the U.S being a plug-in and but only 3 out of every 100 cars sold worldwide. . The picture is even more striking if one views it in terms of the total vehicle stock (i.e. all the light duty vehicles now on the roads). There are no authoritative estimates of this, but a 2014 study by Navigant Research estimated the total to be almost 1.2 billion then, and more recent vehicle industry reports project that this total will reach 1.3 billion by 2020. OICA’s published figures only go to 2015, and indicate a stock of 947 million personal vehicles then. Inside EV’s estimates of the total stock of plug-in vehicles is shown in Table 4.Table 4Global Stock of EVs 2014 – 2017Year     Vehicles (thousand)2014703.620151,239.420161,982.020173,109.020185,600.0 If we assume that the total personal vehicle stock is now at least 1.2 billion vehicles, then EVs constitute five one-thousandths of the present stock. At present rates of growth, a total EV stock in the range of 7.4 to 13 million EVs in the world by 2020 is probable, but the high end of the range looks like a stretch. If EVs attained that milestone, they would constitute just over one per cent of the total personal vehicle fleet. World Oil Demand According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the world’s consumers used 98.2 million barrels of crude oil in 2017. While the number varies depending upon the characteristic of the crude oil, on average somewhere between 50% and 55% of a barrel is used to produce gasoline and diesel fuel for light duty vehicles and trucks. Road vehicles are more than 97% dependent on oil for motive power. Global oil demand has been rising at the rate of over one million barrels per day per year since 2012. This is the fastest rate of demand growth in history. Over the past decade of 2009 to 2018, global crude oil demand has risen from 84.3 million barrels per day to 99.3 million barrels per day, an average of 1.5 million barrels per day per year. https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/ According to the most recent short-term energy outlook report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, global oil demand will rise by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2019 and by another 1.5 million barrels per day in 2020, to reach a total of over 103 million barrels per day, a level many forecasters had thought would not be reached until 2030 at the earliest.Conclusion In summary, EV sales continue to grow at a fast pace from a low starting point and have carved out a niche, especially in markets where governments can afford the large subsidies that underpin sales. The pace of future sales growth remains uncertain but the growth that has occurred so far shows that plug-in vehicles have passed the first hurdle in terms of being a viable alternative to internal combustion engines in some markets. Unless present trends accelerate, however, it seems unlikely that the size of the total EV stock will reach the 13 million figure globally by 2020. Where sales go after that is anyone’s guess. While impressive, EVs are still a small part of the total vehicle stock, and even rapid growth in EV sales seems likely to have little impact on the growth of oil demand, or global carbon emissions, for some years to come.  ~~~~Related:Electric Vehicle Considerations for CanadaShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'electric vehicles']",2019/05/26
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/26/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-andrew-nikiforuk/,45clive ,Down the Rabbit Hole with Andrew Nikiforuk," Op-ed contributed by Michelle Stirling © 2019On May 21, 2019, Andrew Nikiforuk wrote an article in The Tyee mocking Albertans and presenting his perspective on what he calls ‘false claims’ by Albertans about the situation we find ourselves in. Alberta has faced a decade long coordinated effort by anti-oil activists who have successfully enacted pipeline “Blockadia” in all directions.  Investors have fled the province. The Bank of Canada Governor Steve Poloz is afraid of a ‘fire sale’ of ‘stranded carbon assets.’Who stranded them?  The Tar Sands Campaign and the powers behind it and similar climate change hysteria movements.I say ‘hysteria’ because anyone who has been to Alberta has heard of Big Rock beer – and many have been to the Big Rock – Okotoks – one of the largest known glacial erratic in the world that was pushed by glacial movement 400 km south all the way from the mountain region where Jasper is today, to where it sits near the town of Okotoks, some 54 km south of Calgary.By Coaxial at English Wikipedia, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7753012The power of natural climate change is self-evident to Albertans, and especially the cadre of ~70,000 Professional Geologists and Geophysicists and Professional Engineers of APEGA who have made Western Canada a global SuperCluster in oil and oil sands.Thousands of people work in the extended oil, gas and oil sands R&D, operations and supply chain-related industry in Canada.So, maybe that’s why newly elected Premier Jason Kenney is vowing to call out a foreign-funded Tar Sands Campaign against the Alberta oil sands, and Alberta in general.Kenney cites the findings of researcher Vivian Krause.NIkiforuk mocks Vivian Krause for reporting on the land-locking of the Alberta oil sands (which he calls ‘tar sands’) by foreign-funded activists.  At the outset of his article, he calls the notion of such a campaign against Alberta a “wild and silly conspiracy theory.”And that’s rich. Let’s go down that rabbit hole with Nikiforuk and see where it leads.The Tar Sands Campaign is well-documented in public records, specifically the Corporate Ethics International (CEI, now called CorpEthics) website where it has its own page.[1]  In the bio of team member Michael Marx, Senior Strategic Advisor, he notes that “Michael advised the International Tar Sands Oil Campaign, which included over 100 groups working in the U.S., Europe and Canada….” [2]As noted in the Tar Sands Campaign document,[3] the objective was to:a) raise the negatives;b) raise the costs of doing business;c) slow-down infrastructure expansion;d) enroll key decision-makers while isolating opponents.If there was any question about the ultimate goal:“The long-term goal of this campaign is to accelerate the shift in Canada and the U.S. towards clean energy and lower energy consumption. We believe this can be achieved through a combination of cap and trade legislation to internalize carbon costs, carbon taxes, large government investments in clean energy technology development, incentives for energy conservation, and rapid deceleration of deforestation. With regards to tar sands specifically, our long-term goal is to stop the production of this fuel. “http://www.offsettingresistance.ca/TarSandsCoalition-StrategyPaper2008.pdf  pg 6According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the American use of the term ‘conspiracy’ refers to:“a secret plan made by two or more people to do something bad, illegal, or against someone’s wishes.”Indeed, until the work of researcher Vivian Krause and others like those reported on by Counterpunch (where the leaked Tar Sands Campaign document is posted), the project was a secret.[1]  It’s not clear what legalities might be involved, if any, but the #TarSandsCampaign was certainly against the wishes of Alberta’s workers and the Canadian supply chain to the oil sands, to the government of Alberta, to the oil sands developers, and to investors who have lost share value.  And, it was bad.  Bad because lots of people lost their jobs, some lost their investment, some lost their lives in despair.  Bad because it didn’t stop global emissions anyway and despite trying to paint Canada as some kind of Boy Scout leader on climate change, we have no followers, just lots of competitors making hay while we stupidly trip ourselves up and slap ourselves in the face.What makes Andrew Nikiforuk’s claim that this is a “wild and silly conspiracy theory” so curious is that there is so much evidence.  It seems pretty clear that both the party behind the Tar Sands Campaign, the strategy document, many confirming pieces of evidence, and the outcomes show that the Tar Sands Campaign was originally secret, it was funded by foreign parties, it was enacted pretty much according to plan and by the parties referred to in the Tar Sands Campaign document, the funding and many of the specific activities are found in public records, and the Tar Sands Campaign has been largely successful!This graph from the Alberta Economic Dashboard shows investment in Alberta has completely dived since 2014.And look who came to the party!Source: Raven 2010 annual report. Both Raven and Sierra Club have been funded by TIDES. Greystone books and Andrew Nikiforuk have been funded by TIDES.

New Paper on SSRN Earth Sciences," Alain Préat, Université Libre de Bruxelles (Professor Emeritus),Albert Jacobs, Independent, P.GeoAuthor NoteIn case of quotation, please mention A. Préat and A. Jacobs “Hyperthermal events of the Tertiary:precursors of the current situation » French original in “Science, Climat, Energie” (SCE),http://www.science-climat-energie.be/2019/04/27/evenements-hyperthermiques-du-tertiaireprecurseurs-de-la-situation-actuelle/AbstractThe focus of this study is based on a detailed analysis of the hyperthermal events of thePaleocene / Eocene limit of 56 Ma and the lower Eocene (for the 54-52 Ma interval, Figure 1).This example will show that the Earth has experienced many times much higher temperaturesthan today, with warmer, sometimes more acidic oceans and an atmosphere much richer in CO2(or CH4) than the current one. Are these past events precursors of the current situation?IntroductionThe purpose of this article is to show the complexity of climatology (current and past)and that ‘science is far from settled’. As for the current climatology, there are many articles,some of them on SCE. For the climatology of the past the geological examples are not lacking(including some general articles on SCE, here). The focus is based on a detailed analysis of thehyperthermal events of the Paleocene / Eocene limit of 56 Ma and the lower Eocene (for the 54-52 Ma interval, Figure 1). This example will show that the Earth has experienced many timesmuch higher temperatures than today, with warmer, sometimes more acidic oceans and anatmosphere much richer in CO2 (or CH4) than the current one. This never prevented life fromdeveloping, and during one of these Tertiary hyperthermal events (or PETM, see below), whichwas one of the hottest that the Earth has known, it is an ’irony of fate’ that mammals havepursued an unprecedented evolutionary radiation (= diversification of species), begun after theextinction of dinosaurs at the Cretaceous / Tertiary boundary [1, 2].LINK TO PAPER:https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3389926LINK TO SCE:HomeShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change']",2019/05/25
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/25/justifying-foreign-funding-of-canadian-environmental-politics-a-response/,,Justifying Foreign Funding of Canadian Environmental Politics: A Response," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who spent 27 years as a public servant in senior policy advisory roles related to Kyoto and GHG reductions; prior to that, he was a diplomat for 10 years. The Narwhal piece discussed below was linked within a David Suzuki Foundation blog post of May 23, 2019 entitled “True leaders work for us, not the fossil fuel industry.”In a March 29, 2018 opinion piece recycled in The Narwhal, Emma Gilchrist took great umbrage at the research findings of Vivian Krause. Vivian Krause and others have documented the extremely large funding provided by foreign private foundations to support the efforts of Canadian environmental groups to halt the further development of Canada’s oil and natural gas industries. In a somewhat rambling fashion, Ms. Gilchrist made the following arguments (I paraphrase):The funding provided by foreign foundations was not clandestine.“Science” justifies harming Canada’s oil and gas industry because (somehow, unexplained) doing so will save the planet (The implied proposition is that reducing the growth in Canada’s oil and gas supply will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, although that is never clearly articulated, merely stated as a code that everyone believes).The British Columbia government does not adequately regulate foreign contributions to political parties’ election campaigns.As a result, 48 “fossil fuel companies” (undefined and unlisted) donated $5.2 million to B.C. political parties between 2008 and 2015.The company that proposed to build the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion was foreign-owned, as are many of the companies that own and operate oil sands and LNG projects.The federal government formerly welcomed a $40 million contribution from U.S. foundations to the Great Bear Rainforest.How environmental organizations are funded is not a worthy topic of political debate in Canada.The oil industry is not an underdog in this discourse.Before I address these contentions, let me, as someone who has written previously in support of Vivian Krause’s thesis,  establish what is not at issue. No one disagrees (I believe) that U.S. private foundations have spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding Canadian environmental groups and their frequent collaborators in the indigenous communities. The numbers are well documented in the filings of annual reports by the private foundations to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and, to a lesser extent, in the filings by the receiving Canadian organizations to the Canada Revenue Agency. The total amount of foreign funding over the last 20 years may not be known, but two examples may serve to illustrate the magnitude. First, consider the Tides Canada Foundation Payments on one campaign, as listed in Table 1:Table 1Tides Canada Foundation Payments under the “Tar Sands Campaign” 2012 to 2016RecipientPayments ($)Canadian Climate Action Network168,000Council of Canadians71,300Dogwood Institute721,200Ecojustice768,100Environmental Defence Canada, Inc.1,342,000Equiterre540,700Great Bear Rainforest Initiative260,900Greenpeace Canada689,900Living Oceans Society172,400Pembina Institute682,400Sierra Club of British Columbia253,800Sierra Club of Canada Foundation101,100Sisu Society1,761,100Tseil-Waututh First Nation191,000West Coast Environmental Law Association227,100350.org451,100Earthjustice350,000Earthworks388,000Friends of the Earth61,300Indigenous Environmental Network291,000New Venture Fund380,000Sierra Club Foundation736,000Sourced from public records.The Tides Foundation is not the only U.S. Foundation actively involved in trying to shape the global warming debate in Canada. Krause’s research has found that the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is the largest funder of environmental activism in British Columbia, and has granted more than $190 million to First Nations, environmental and other organizations working in B.C. By far the largest recipient of funds from the Moore Foundation is Tides Canada, which has been granted at least $70 million, and then regrants it to other groups.There is no doubt that, of all the foreign presences, Tides and the Tides Canada Foundation historically have had the most far reaching effects on the Canadian economy. Tides Canada Foundation is a registered Canadian charity and is equivalent in law to a 501 c 3 charity in the United States. A significant share of the revenue of Tides Canada is from the U.S. In 2015, for example, 70 % of the total revenue of Tides Canada Foundation was from outside Canada, most of it from the United States. Over the past decade, the total assets of Tides Canada have soared to $58 million and it has made expenditures of more than $250 million. With over 200 employees, Tides Canada is a hub of activism and has funded major campaigns against all of Canada’s main resource-based industries: forestry, mining, oil and gas, and salmon farming.Other “givens”, I believe, are that:The funding itself is a matter of public record, at least to the extent that someone is willing to doing extensive research to find it.The practices of government in regulating financial contributions to political parties varies considerably across Canada, with British Columbia having perhaps the least restrictive regime. The Canadian federal government, in contrast, has very restrictive regimes governing both the amounts of donations that different parties might make and the registration and reporting of lobbying activity.No one regulates the much more pervasive political activities involved in advertising and propagandizing for contending views on public policy, the organization of demonstrations, blockades and legal opposition to lawfully authorized energy infrastructure, and other actions intended to influence public opinion and to pressure politicians in periods between elections. Such allegedly “non-partisan” political activities operate essentially without any government control and are the primary domaine of the environmental organizations and their legal counterparts.There is no doubt that foreign private investors (and some foreign public investors in the case of China) play a large role in the Canadian economy, as do Canadian investors who own shares in companies abroad.Much of the funding of Canadian environmental organizations, including at least some of the foreign funding, goes to support legitimate environmental protection.What remains very much at issue is the question of whether the large foreign funding of Canadian groups, and especially those engaged in the “Tar Sands Campaign” is an unwarranted and harmful intrusion into Canadian domestic energy policy, unjustified by the alleged environmental threat.The Issue of Principle If a group of Nazis resident in Argentina spent millions of dollars to influence Canadian policy on race relations, would that be unobjectionable? If a group of influential Russians or Communist Chinese paid millions of dollars to influence a local or provincial election or to lobby the electorate between elections, would that pose no problem? In the United States, the allegation of Russian meddling in the 2015 Presidential election has absorbed the attention of millions of people and many politicians ever since. In most countries, the intrusion of foreign influences whose objectives are contrary to the domestic national interest is properly regarded as inappropriate, regardless of whether or not the intrusions are by governments.This has been recognized here, too. The Trudeau government in January 2019 issued an announcement on the need for Canada’s political systems to combat a growing foreign threat to Canada’s political systems, because “new technologies and advances in how we consume information may potentially allow adversaries to use cyber-enable means to influence Canada’s democratic processes.”Foreign governments are not the only threat. The globalization that Emma Gilchrist celebrates means that very large and well-funded organizations of all kinds can use their spending power to shape political conditions in Canada, especially views about particular issues. By funding one set of viewpoints over others, they can upset the political balance that otherwise exists, and fundamentally alter our democracy. We would be naïve and foolish to ignore this threat. The foreign private foundations deserve far more scrutiny and regulation in their activities, not least of all because most of them are registered charities. This enables them to benefit from tax-free status and to present themselves as providers of a public service, even they are heavily involved in political activities that have little or nothing to do with their allegedly charitable objectives.Ms. Gilchrist seems to say that large-scale foreign funding of environmental causes in Canada is okay because the causes being funded by the foreign influences is a good one. Let’s deal with that.The Non-Link between Alleged Catastrophic Global Warming and Canadian Hydrocarbons Production There are many scientists and others who believe the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming. There are also a large number of scientists and others who consider that this thesis is flawed, as is the modelling that projects the results of likely emissions growth a century hence. In fact, many excellent papers demonstrate the flaws of the science and the highly politicized nature of the work by international organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).If readers with an objective mindset wish to read a single document that presents the problems with the science in a very balanced way, it might be Michael Hart’s 2015 book entitled, Hubris – The Troubling Science, Economics, and Politics of Climate Change. While excellent, it is a long read. Those preferring shorter, but still expert, overviews might read the presentation given by Dr. Judith Curry to the U.S. Congress on the differences in views among scientists. You can find it here:https://judithcurry.com/2018/06/12/the-debate-mann-titley-moore-curry/For those more given to examining data and the metrics by which climate might be measured, but still want a readable text, I suggest John Christy’s The Tropic Skies: Falsifying Climate Alarm. It can be read here:https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/05/JohnChristy-Parliament.pdfIn this short article, I do not plan to revisit the scientific debate. That is not my area of expertise. Rather, I would like to offer some factual data that shows that the emissions reductions that the United Nations is calling for are simply not going to happen, not because of what we do in Canada, but what is occurring around the world.Let’s start at the beginning. Carbon dioxide emissions are the natural by-product of the production, transportation and use of fossil fuels used to produce energy services. The energy services are heat, light, air-conditioning, mobility and all the various uses of electricity when generated from the burning of fossil fuels.It is the human demand/need for energy services that has given rise to and continues to support the growth in use of fossil fuels. Those energy services are central to the modern way of life and the standard of living that we enjoy in modern society.There are six broad categories of energy services that must be supplied, corresponding to the sectors of the economy: transportation, industrial production, electricity generation, commercial activity, residences and others. The proportions represented by each of these sectors varies by geographic region.Twenty years ago, two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world occurred in the developed countries, the more industrialized members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and one-third occurred in the developing, or non-OECD, countries. Today, the roles are almost reversed. See the following table:Table 2Grouping2007 Mt2016 Mt2017  MtGrowth Rate2006-2016 (%)OECD136301239912448-0.8Non-OECD1644920619209962.9World3007933018334441.3Source: BP Statistical Review of World EnergyAs you can see from the table, global emissions of GHGs were about 33 billion tonnes in 2017, an increase of 57% since governments first began claiming that they would reduce emissions in 1990. The non-OECD region alone accounts for 21 billion tonnes annually, almost two-thirds of the total, and steadily rising. Canada’s entire emissions represent 1.6%.Despite all the alarm and expensive emissions reductions activity, not a single one of the emissions reductions goals set by international organizations has ever been met. Why? Because the developing countries want the same energy services that we enjoy in the developed countries, and fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) are the most affordable way to have that. After 28 years of international target setting and trillions of dollars in expenditures by governments on renewable energy sources, other energy alternatives and energy efficiency, fossil fuels still provide 84% of the world’s energy supply.Here’s the kicker. The IPCC, in its Special Report 15, issued in September 2018, claimed that its previous goals were not stringent enough, so the world had to accelerate its (non-existent) emissions reduction so that global emissions will be down to 17 billion tonnes in 2030 and zero in 2050. By 2030, based on current trends, the emissions of China and India combined will be much higher than 17 billion tonnes. So, all the 195 other countries in the world would have to completely eliminate their GHG emissions by 2030, a little over eleven years.Is the impossibility of these goals becoming clear yet?I will add one more set of facts to the consideration. About 80% of the GHG emissions from either oil or natural gas fuel cycles (i.e. from production to final use) occur at the final combustion stage. So, reducing emissions would logically focus there, on consumers. Actions to curtail Canada’s oil and gas production do nothing to reduce global consumption. The countries that would otherwise be served by Canadian oil will simply buy it from elsewhere.Global oil demand has been rising at the rate of more than one million barrels per day every year since 2012. Today, it is at its highest level in history, at over 100 million barrels per day, and shows no sign of deceasing in the foreseeable future.Attacking the Canadian oil industry and harming its access to markets and investment therefore will contribute nothing to reducing global emissions. If one wants to harm economic development in western Canada, reduce the revenues to oil companies and the governments that tax them, injure one’s fellow Canadians, politicize all discussions of energy, and harm national unity, it is a good tactic, but one should not pretend it is being done for a global cause.The Oil Industry’s Interests are Not the Issue Emma Gilchrist commented that the oil industry is not the underdog in the controversy over foreign funding of the Tar Sands Campaign and other attacks on the Canadian energy economy. On this, she is right, but it totally misses the point.The Canadian oil and gas industry, for all its billions of dollars in annual revenues, focuses on investing and operating in a policy and regulatory environment that offers certainty, but it plays no funding role at all in challenging the climate catastrophe thesis.Those who seek to inject balance into the discussions of energy policy goals, so that economic development and the widespread dissemination of economic benefits from energy production and use will take at least equal place with environmental considerations – those are the ones who are the underdogs. The few private organizations that seek to demonstrate to Canadians the importance of energy in the economy and the pointlessness of trying to solve a global problem by attacking our own industry – those are the ones being disadvantaged, as are the large number of Canadians affected.Unlike the environmental groups with hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal, the few organizations who contest the political claims of the climate lobby have funds measured in the few hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, and none of it is from the oil and gas industry.Canada’s interests are the issue. Fair play in our democracy is the issue.The Results of Climate Change Policies  Finally, what have been the effects of emission reduction measures to date? Actually, we know that they have had seriously adverse consequences. As Matt Ridley puts it, ‘Building wind turbines, growing biofuels and substituting wood for coal in power stations — all policies designed explicitly to fight climate change — have had negligible effects on carbon dioxide emissions. But they have driven people into fuel poverty, made industries uncompetitive, driven up food prices, accelerated the destruction of forests, killed rare birds of prey, and divided communities… globally nearly 200,000 people are dying every year, because we are turning 5 per cent of the world’s grain crop into motor fuel instead of food: that pushes people into malnutrition and death’. In Canada, largely due to the influence of partly foreign-funded environmental groups, we have gone further and blocked or significantly delayed the construction of pipeline infrastructure badly needed to provide market access, depriving Canadians of the current economic benefits of infrastructure construction and western Canada of the long-term income, employment and revenue benefits of increased oil and gas production and sale. We have been implementing climate policies that have probably been net-harmful to humans and the environment on the questionable premise that emissions might become net-harmful many decades in the future. ~~~~Related:No Pipeline is a Problem – A Challenge to DemocracyClimate Change Policy – A Threat to CanadaCan Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/20/climate-hysteria-the-elusive-search-for-a-simple-response/,,Climate Hysteria – The Elusive Search for A Simple Response," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, holding senior policy advisory positions on Kyoto and GHG management issues. He was a diplomat for 10 years prior to that service.Every day, it seems, the media reports another example of a government or well-known group that has declared a “climate emergency”. Such declarations are based on the thesis that humans are causing potentially catastrophic changes in the global climate and that extremely large reductions in the more advanced countries’ emissions must be made within the next decade or two to “solve” this problem.The basis for such claims lies in the repeated statements of international organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and especially its Special Report 15 of October 2018.Unfortunately, climate change is a very complex issue. To understand it well, one must read a great deal about science, modelling, economics, and public policy. Few people have the time or patience to do that. For those who challenge the catastrophe thesis, the challenge is to tell a complex story in simple terms that people will understand. To that end, I here offer a set of counterpoints to the climate hysteria thesis.The Global SituationThe global climate is affected by both natural and human factors. On average, temperatures have been rising, but not at rates that demonstrate the likelihood of serious environmental damage.*There is no remotely compelling scientific evidence that extreme weather events have increased in frequency or intensity in post-industrial times.There is no remotely compelling scientific evidence that climate change has resulted in widespread species extinction.Sea levels are rising at the rate of 7-8 inches per century, a rate that has remained constant in spite of rising greenhouse gas emissions.From 1990 to 2016, carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from fuel combustion rose from 20.5 gigatonnes (Gt) to 32.3 Gt, a rise of 57 per cent.Today, emissions are not declining. In fact, carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 were 33.4 Gt compared to 30.0 Gt in 2007. So, emissions increased 11.3% over that period.Eighty-four per cent of the world’s primary energy needs are today provided by fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas).Important Emissions TrendsGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) declined at the rate of 123 megatonnes (Mt) per year over the period 2007 to 2016, or 0.8% per year. Meanwhile, the non-OECD countries increased their emissions during the same period at the rate of 417 Mt per year, or 2.9% annually. In other words, emissions growth in the developing countries is more than four times emissions reductions in the developed countries.In 2017, the non-OECD countries constituted 63% of global emissions, and the OECD countries constituted 37%. With every passing year, the non-OECD countries hold a larger share of the total.The Results of the Paris Conference (COP21) in 2015The COP21 Agreement imposed no legal obligation on the participating countries to reduce emissions and there are no penalties for failing to do so. The “commitments” countries made there were entirely political.If all countries honoured their commitments, global temperatures would be reduced in 2010 by 0.17 degrees C., compared to the notional target of avoiding a 2-degree C. increase.The United States has indicated that it will leave the agreement and few, if any, of the developing countries are adhering to their commitments.Neither China nor India committed to reduce emissions, only to eventually cap emissions intensity. By 2030, these two countries alone may have combined emissions of 23 Gt.IPCC Special Report 15This report stated that global greenhouse gas emissions must decline by 45 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and to zero by 2050, or else terrible things would happen.**A 45 per cent drop from current emission levels would take global emissions down to about 17 Gt. As China and India’s combined emissions by 2030 will exceed that total, the rest of the world (i.e. 195 countries) could reduce their emissions to zero and the IPCC goal still would not be met (i.e. this is impossible).Special Report 15 called for a global carbon tax of at least $880 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions; that exceeds the per capita annual average income of much of the developing world (i.e. such a tax is impossible).The report said that $2.4 trillion must be invested in non-fossil fuel energy every year from 2015 through 2035, an investment seven times current levels. The interest alone on that amount would be $200 billion per month – more than the whole world now spends on childhood education and environmental protection combined.The emissions reductions would be so disruptive of current lifestyles and so contrary to the choices people would make in free markets that they could be achieved only through massive government intervention and the widescale suspension of individual liberties.—–*Temperatures have risen since ~1860, but not at rates or range outside of previous warming cycles.**In fact the scientific report does not make catastrophic claims. The Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) and Headline summaries sound scary.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/19/debunking-markham-hislop-on-tar-sands-campaign/,Richard Milne ,Debunking Markham Hislop on Tar Sands Campaign," By Michelle Stirling © 2019These are my personal opinions.Markham Hislop recently wrote an article which appears to claim that Vivian Krause has come up with a conspiracy theory about foreign funding and pipeline/oil sands development in Canada – when in fact it is a matter of public record that foreign-funded environmental groups, most of them charities, have made a coordinated attack on the oil sands and other natural resource developments, with the help of millions of dollars from foreign sources. Let me present my argument.  I have been following this story since 2005.Key points:Foreign funding to ENGOs to stop economic activity is very different than foreign funding to develop legal and approved economic activity that pays taxes, creates jobs and product streams, which creates more jobs and pays more taxes.Geopolitical games by transnational corporations and foundations operate at a level that is unelected and unaccountable, and through working directly or indirectly, or funding directly or indirectly certain ENGOs, favorable climate and energy policies can be established which appear to be from the ‘grassroots’ when they may not be.ENGOs are unelected, unaccountable and mostly unregulated; they are able to willingly make over-the-top statements or make misleading claims about various resource industries, laws, or policies – but industry is not able to fight back in the same way because essential service industries are highly regulated by governments and closely watched by shareholders, investors and regulatory agencies.“Non-profits” and “charities” play on the perceived moral virtue of not being a commercial enterprise, but they live off the subsidies of hard-working taxpayers while immorally putting thousands of people out of work and driving off the good will of investors who do want to make money, but who also share their profits with all via taxes, buying goods and services, making donations to the arts and social charities, and employing people in well-paying jobs.Following the implementation of the Alberta Climate Leadership plan, Hislop writes that this ‘collapsed’ the tar sands campaign, in fact it blossomed! The Prime Minister, aligning with ENGOs on Northern Gateway, cancelled the pipeline and established Bill C-48 (tanker ban), then ‘Tar Sands Campaign’ ENGOs went after the National Energy Board (NEB), turning it upside down and into Bill C-69. That has left most major projects in Canada and potential investors in limbo for 4 years, as reported by lawyer Terri-Lee Oleniuk of Blakes, during a University of Calgary law forum on Bill C-69.[1][2]  Many former ‘Tar Sands Campaigners’ were hired in-house in government, making it even easier to block progress.[3] According to Counterpunch, that was the plan.[4]Excerpts of “Money Matters” report: The revenues received by the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts over the period 200-2018 was over 18 times the revenues received by all federal political parties, and over 27 times the revenues received by the market oriented institutes.“Money Matters” The revenue received by the Tides organization alone is more than the combined revenues of Canada’s two largest federal political parties, the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada over the period.“Money Matters” The David Suzuki Foundation’s average annual revenues exceed the annual revenues of the federal New Democratic Party.“Money Matters” Eight ENGOs have annual revenues that exceed those of the governing Liberal Party of Canada.As Bank of Canada Governor Steve Poloz warned last week, investors have lost confidence in Canada, Canadian fossil fuel assets, particularly the oil sands, are ripe for vulture investors and market mayhem.[5] Who is behind that? Was that the original plan? To dupe Canadians into locking in and giving up the third largest oil reserves in the world, that we own, on the premise that using our oil would kill the planet, while oil producing competitor nations laugh all the way to market and then to the bank.Markham Hislop wrote a 9,000-word article, published May 14, 2019,[6] in which he claims to debunk the work of Vivian Krause, the researcher who spent about a decade tracking the foreign-funding of the various Canadian environmental groups via IRS and CRA filings. Most of these environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) are federally registered charities, meaning that you and I subsidize them.Hislop takes aim at what he calls Krause’s ‘conspiracy’ theories on the Tar Sands Campaign, as if she wears a tin-foil hat and got her numbers from playing with an Ouija board instead of painstakingly tracking records of the IRS, CRA and related annual filings.Conspiracies normally take place in secret.  So…what if it was all out in the open…but so open and vast it would be almost impossible to connect the dots. Not a ‘conspiracy’ but… a global plan.Matthew Nisbet is a very accomplished, very prolific Professor of Communications at Northeastern University.  He has contributed to dozens of journals and books on climate change communications.  And he has been tracking this group of billionaires who have been running the “Design to Win” campaign for many years. Their plan is on-line, too.In his 2011 ClimateShift report, climateshift_report_americanuniversity-updated nisbet 2011 he documents how a group of billionaire philanthropists combined forces in 2005 to create the “Design to Win” plan to fund local ENGOs worldwide, to push for global cap and trade systems, carbon pricing and renewables.  In 2018, he published an update[7] showing that hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent by these ‘green billionaires’ – most of whom have vested interests in renewables, on denigrating fossil fuels, millions on demarketing coal and phasing-out fossil fuels, millions on ‘social justice’ and pushing electric vehicles, cap and trade, carbon pricing and renewables.Source: Excerpt of Nisbet (2018)We find that the ClimateWorks partners are reported funders of the environmental groups that Vivian Krause has researched.  Her reports on funding and activities match up with many aspects of the reports of Dr. Nisbet, though the Tar Sands Campaign (likely part of “OilTrain” in ClimateWorks docs) is just a small subset of the much larger ClimateWorks global plan.  ClimateWorks partners want to set up global cap and trade systems, carbon pricing and put their vested interest renewables on the grid. So, they have been demarketing coal, oil, oil sands and to some extent, natural gas, and pushing electric vehicles as ‘the answer’ for over a decade. To do this, they have funded local ENGOs to create the aura of a ‘grassroots’ demand for climate and energy policies that favour their goals.  They have done this worldwide, and as far as I can see, have no permission from any sovereign government to interfere in this way.  It is not clear to what extent any Tar Sands Campaign partner might know of this plan.The much larger plan was exposed in the ClimateWorks Podesta Wikileaks files where a full case study of the Design to Win plan was revealed. In this document it was revealed that McKinsey & Co., the world’s most influential management firm, was a key consultant to the project.ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165To cross reference the funding information, one can download the on-line Oak Foundations grant database like we did and see the many grants to Canadian ENGOs…and to international ENGOs – many of which are engaged in things like the UK Tar Sands Network or the efforts to denigrate Canadian oil sands product via the European fuel quality directive.The facts are a matter of public record both online, open‐source vanity presses – such as Oak Foundation – as well as publicly available IRS‐990 filings.   These are the facts repeated by many. They are not contestable.  What Vivian Krause and Ron Arnold, and others have done is to “harvest” and aggregate them for analysis and interpretation. This information is readily available to any interested person.   Why well‐paid and capable talented research journalists – like Markham Hislop – have been unwilling to check the source information is perhaps the biggest mystery.The Tar Sands Campaign is a project of Corporate Ethics International, formerly CEI, now known as CorpEthics. Indeed, on CorpEthics website, in Michael Marx’ bio he claims to have managed 100 ENGOs in Canada, the US and Europe.Who knew that the Tar Sands Campaign was in fact so international?Here are a few selected grants to establish the case I present, but there are dozens more.In Canada, we see that in this 2007 grant from the foreign Oak foundation, Greenpeace Canada (a non-profit, but not a charity) planned to enact its Phase-out Tar Sands by driving off investors and in its 2010 grant, by raising the risks of the oil sands in the minds of Members of Parliament.Source: Close up excerpt of Oak Foundation grant to Greenpeace.Original source of close up above.In this grant (below) for the foreign Oak Foundation, we find TIDES Foundation (we assume in Canada) was given $700,000 in 2009 to fund research on the Athabasca river quality downstream from the oil sands.Source: Oak grant databaseThis appears to have been the funding for one of the well-known Schindler/Kelly studies linking the oil sands to cancer. At the time of the release more than 20 ENGOs in Canada, all related to the Tar Sands Campaign, publicized the Schindler/Kelly findings across all media, causing a tremendous outcry across the country and indeed, around the world.Source: https://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16178.shortThe CBC co-produced a documentary based on the uproar from that PNAS ‘contributed’ study. “The Tipping Point: Age of the Oil Sands”  starred many key players from the Tar Sands Campaign-funded organizations.  Only two oil sands defenders appeared on camera for a few minutes out of a ~2-hour documentary (Rob Renner, then Alberta Environment Minister and Don Thompson, then President of the Oil Sands Developers Group. Thompson had 35 years experience in the oil sands,[1] compared to little-to-none for the activists) CBC told me other oil sands executives declined to appear, likely sensing a “drive-by shooting” in the offing.The most important aspects of the documentary are the facts that were left out.  I put many of them in my compilation of letters of complaint to the CBC. [2]Here are some more examples of foreign funding and economic damage to Canada and to investors.We see that West Coast Environmental Law was granted money to create a legislated tanker ban and it is noted in the grant description that this would cause the cancellation of Northern Gateway. It’s a small amount of money, but contrary to what Hislop reports, these ENGOs collaborate to amplify their powers.Source: Oak Foundation databaseRead: “Manufacturing a Climate Crisis” – a case study about West Coast Environmental Law’s activities. We find the online document of the International Funders of Indigenous People where American Michael Marx of Corporate Ethics, lead organization of the Tar Sands Campaign, reports on how ENGOs in the US and Canada were going to collaborate on the Rethink Alberta Campaign – intended to smear and destroy Alberta’s tourism sector and drive off industry.  He explains that ENGOs on both sides of the border and First Nations groups were working together to block Keystone XL in order to shut down the oil sands.Source: International Funders for Indigenous Peoples 9th Annual Conference Report page 47Climate Action Network (CAN), in an undated “Tar Sands Report” claimed Canada was not only exporting ‘dirty oil’ but also ‘dirty policies.’[1]  For a bunch of folks that say they don’t collaborate, sure seems like they do.[2] My count of the members of CAN who are literally ‘all on the same page’ comes up with 117 parties in the network, including major unions like CUPE and UNIFOR and major faith groups.On the face of all this evidence, it is hard to see how Markham Hislop can claim there is no coordinated campaign – there obviously is.  And billions of dollars in economic losses to Canadians and investors.People might wonder why blocking pipelines could benefit these foreign billionaire groups who actually want cap and trade, to sell more of their vested interest renewables and to push carbon pricing.Well, here’s a proposal as to why – by making Canadians believe we are a global pariah, we are willing to give up control of the oil sands – seeing it as a detriment to our reputation and a potential threat to the world. Vulture investors love that!By talking us into locking in the Boreal Forest or Great Bear Rainforest, they are setting up the basis for using the forests as carbon sinks for carbon trading. In fact, two such large carbon trading projects exist right now – perhaps more. Remember the Great Bear Rainforest?[3] Remember how Canadians threw in money to protect that rare Kermode Bear?  Well, it’s a carbon trading property now.Now about Darkwoods – Nature Conservancy of Canada has guaranteed it as a carbon sink for a hundred years,[4] kind of a risky thing in a wildfire region.  Who will pay the tab if it all goes up in smoke?So, we are carbon dupes, Canada, and totally naïve to geopolitics.The land locking of Canadian oil is certainly of benefit to other oil exporting nations; certainly, US producers benefit from our competition being pushed off the market as Vivian Krause has pointed out in the past; though they benefit, to me, it doesn’t seem like US oil producers are behind this campaign. It seems more likely that Canada and our economy are being squeezed to force us into carbon trading….in fact, shortly after Minister McKenna returned from the COP-21 Paris Agreement, this op-ed appeared…. “Trading for Tidewater.”Source: https://youtu.be/Uv60bC11qqcIn some circles, this kind of arrangement might be known as a …shakedown.While Hislop makes the case with all of his interviewees about Vivian Krause’s work that the ENGOs have only received nominal funding from foreign entities, here we see that Oak funded Tides in Canada to set up a $30 million fund (2010) – presumably drawn from Canadian philanthropies and corporations. (The other grants shown were in 2006 for media campaign and 2005 for Kyoto Protocol plan).Source: Oak Foundation grant database.Millions of dollars were poured into Quebec early on. Global Climate Change Action group – or tcktcktck.org – was funded to enlist unions and faith groups – both of which had existing large constituencies that could be easily converted to support climate catastrophe ideology by claims of profitable pension fund investment in renewables, or religious and moral mantras about virtuous acts of saving the planet. [1]And…who is funding BankTrack – a group of some 40 ENGOs that regularly attack and harass banks who finance oil, oil sands, natural gas and coal projects? (Answer – I don’t know but would like to know)Who funded the Global Climate Change Action group in Montreal for millions of dollars – a group that now claims to have 470 partner ENGOs in 70 countries worldwide, all opposed to fossil fuels? No collaboration? Come on, Markham!It is hard to believe that a journalist with the credentials of Markham Hislop was unable to find this information, because I found most of it by using google and…following the money.In fact, the ‘conspiracy’ has elevated itself to transnational levels with the development of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment group – whose guru on ESG is Al Gore.  And the Rockefeller Philanthropic Advisors’ charity called the CDP Worldwide – or Carbon Disclosure Project.  This innocent sounding charity invites cities and corporations to voluntarily report their carbon footprint and any local ‘climate change events’ – this information is aggregated into a report by a firm like PwC or Accenture – and then UNPRI investors decide to invest according to the report’s “Black” or “White” list ratings on who is producing ‘clean’ energy or who is ‘dirty’.  Thus, as a corporation, reporting your climate risk footprint in good faith makes you a target to green fanatics and activist investors.That’s what happened to the oil sands in 2016 when CDP issued this report.[2]It is a matter of public record that many banks, institutional investors (who are signatory to the UNPRI) and major transnational corporations have funded ENGOs to buy them ‘social license’ or to push for things that benefit their vested interests, directly or indirectly.Case in point?David Suzuki Foundation.  Funded by Power Corporation since 2007.Source: Power Corporation CDP ReportDavid Suzuki Foundation pushed for coal phase-out in Alberta…pushed the Alberta NDP government climate plan with a submission for the implementation of renewables, especially wind.Source: Cover of David Suzuki Fund submission to Alberta Climate Panel. Power Corporation has a renewables subsidiary. Now, Power Corporation’s subsidiary is building a wind farm in Jenner, Alberta!What a happy coincidence!We can confirm that Vivian Krause is certainly on the right track with her research.  We have issued four reports that Robert Lyman produced independently.  Robert Lyman is a former public servant and diplomat who spent decades in government in senior policy positions advising on things like the Kyoto Accord, GHG reductions in the Transport Division of Environment Canada – and Robert expands the scope of Vivian’s work and shows us the impacts on the Canadian economy.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/05/07/environmental-charities-a-compilation-of-reports-on-their-finances-power-and-implications-for-canada/   Other than the evidence shown, we cannot ascribe intent or motivation to any of the individuals or groups involved, but – we can see the outcome.Bill C-48, the tanker ban, killed a major pipeline project that had been approved by the NEB. Some ENGOs were overjoyed.Source: https://www.ecojustice.ca/enbridges-northern-gateway-pipeline-bites-the-dust/  Perhaps to ensure Northern Gateway could not be revived and that Trans Mountain would be held up forever, ENGOs then went after the NEB to turn its 60 year track record of excellence, it’s fair and thorough, highly technical process upside down.Source: Ecojustice.caThat became the contentious BillC-69.We know the outcome of all this activity by ENGOs is that US energy investment banker, PPHB, has stated in its newsletter “Musings” that Canada has become “hostile” to investment.Source: PPHB “Musings” April 27, 2018 pg. 27 http://www.pphb.com/pdfs/musings/Musings041718.pdf  How did that happen?Over a decade of international smearing of the oil sands reputation, harassing of bankers, insurers and investors, over a decade of driving up regulatory and operational costs by The Tar Sands Campaign and all its actors. And this came on the heels of decades of attacks on the forestry industry in the “War of the Woods” using similar tactics.And no one fighting back for the oil sands – until now.Until Premier Jason Kenney.Citing the research of Vivian Krause. So, of course the ‘greens’ must delegitimize her!Underlying the Tar Sands Campaign has always been the claim that our ‘dirty oil’ was more destructive to the world than anything else – because it had higher carbon dioxide emissions.In fact, two leaders of foreign-funded ENGOs, Marlo Raynolds of Pembina Institute and Steven Gilbeault of Equiterre were the first to call oil sands production ‘dirty oil’ – back in 2008.  How patriotic of them! [1] [2] (Both are now in federal government advisory capacities.)Contrary to Hislop’s reported claims by Simon Dyer of Pembina that there was no climate change legislation or environmental management of the oil sands a decade ago, the Alberta government had implemented the Climate Change and Environment legislation in 2002 – 16 years ago! The first legislation of its kind in North America.http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/C16P7.pdfI personally know there was careful attention to the oil sands on the environmental and climate issues because I worked at Alberta Environment in 2005. I had to interview many of the field experts on environmental issues in Alberta – they were all scientifically qualified and very balanced in their comments.The ClimateWorks campaign is all about the alleged human causation of climate change – because without climate hysteria you have no reason for cap and trade or carbon pricing or renewables. With climate hysteria, you also have a means to constantly create make-work industries at the expense of taxpayers.For instance, you build a wind farm telling the public it is ‘free’ or ‘cheaper than coal’ – only later do they find out they need to add a $1.4 billion natural gas plant or risk blackouts, plus they have to pay for billions in transmission lines and IT upgrades to manage fluctuating wind power. But that’s good business for whoever invested in it – and the wind farms typically guarantee your rate of income for 20-40 years, even if output of energy is tiny by comparison to investment.  The climate change claim is that wind and solar farms are renewables – but nope. They all have to be backed up with a natural gas plant (or large hydro facilities). Source: https://energypost.eu/wind-solars-achilles-heel-methane-meltdown-porter-ranch-means-energy-transition/ Google engineers found that wind and solar do not stop climate change, after years of research and an unlimited budget. Bill Gates says “…let’s quit jerking around with wind and solar…”  But wind and solar do generate trade-able Renewable Energy Certificates and subsidies by the boat load.  And everyone of the Tar Sands Campaign ENGOs pushes for….carbon price, renewable energy, phase-out coal and phase-out oil sands.Now here’s the problem.Since 2002, the science community has found that carbon dioxide is not the main driver of climate change.  By 2013 the IPCC reported there had been no statistically significant warming since 2012.Source: IPCC AR5 Working Group I reportAnd today we have dozens of studies showing that the effect of carbon dioxide on global warming is nominal.  Scientists miscalculated the effect of carbon dioxide, but climate campaigners and the ‘clean-growth’ industry paid no attention as scientists began to turn the ‘carbon Titanic’ around – if anything, the ‘green billionaires’ and ENGOs ramped up the hysteria, rather like Festinger reports on the Failed Prophecies of Cults.  Now it has accelerated to the level of ‘climate emergency’ and a 16 year old girl is on the cover of TIME, dressed in green. She is telling the adults what to do, while others tell her what to do.So, all the efforts to impose carbon taxes, cap and trade – to lock in Alberta oil until we gave in to the CO2 coercion, and to kill the oil sands…that was all for naught.  It was foreign interference in domestic climate and energy policies, enacted in a subversive manner that perhaps even key players did not understand. (See Lenin: useful idiots)Now environmental groups in Canada have amassed hundreds of millions, billions of dollars in revenues and physical assets. It is the cumulative nature of funding; the draw-down from the tax pool for all their special projects (as per our “Green” ENGO series of reports above). Many ENGOs have more far more money than political parties. And now, the federal government has given them free rein to use that power politically (where once they were limited to only employing 10% of their funds for politics).But their power has its roots in those millions of dollars of seed funding from foreign sources with an agenda. And Canadians have unwittingly, for the most part, also tax-subsidized the federally registered ENGO charities that have played such a key role in destroying our resource economy and blocking access to world markets.In my personal opinion, any policies driven by these foreign-funded ENGOs should be circumspect and rescinded, overturned, and a full inquiry made into the damage caused to the Canadian economy.Please read our reports and understand what we’re up against.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/04/30/green-titanic-how-big-green-moneys-political-power-was-unleashed/,Robby McHenry ,Green Titanic: How Big Green Money’s Political Power was Unleashed," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who worked as a public servant for 27 years and as a diplomat for ten years prior to that service. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThis is the third and final in a series of articles on the funding and activities of large environmental organizations in Canada, many of which play major political roles in opposing resource industry development and pipeline construction based on the thesis that this will address global warming.LINK to report: Green Titanic FINAL RevA April 29 2019This article describes how recent changes in the Income Tax Act and regulations governing charities and a recent court decision have freed activist environmental organizations with charity status from previous constraints on their ability to conduct and fund political activities.Federal and provincial governments in Canada now provide $170 billion per year in grants and contributions to registered charities.Charities then raise an additional $80 billion per year based on private contributions, some of which are stimulated by their registered charity status; the cost to the federal treasury alone of this is $5 billion per year; the cost to provincial government treasuries is unknown.Until recently, the Income Tax Act barred registered charities from spending more than 10 per cent of their revenues on political activities, which were defined narrowly to include only partisan support for candidates or political parties seeking election. They allowed charities to spend more on other political activities such as lobbying of politicians, publishing information, launching public advertising campaigns to oppose energy developments, mobilizing supporters to oppose certain laws, or organizing public demonstrations and blockades. Today, only about 5,000 charities, or 5 per cent of those in Canada, report being involved in political activities.The Trudeau government passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Budget bill in 2018 authorizing charities to carry on unlimited “public policy dialogue and development activities” to influence laws and policies. In July 2018 Justice Edward Morgan of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the Income Tax Act’s 10 per cent limitation on partisan political activity was unconstitutional. The Trudeau government decided to not appeal the ruling.As a result of this legislative change and court decision, registered charity status now gives an organization, including activist environmental organizations, the freedom to spend up to 100% of its revenues on political activities, so long as these are consistent with its “charity” objectives.The Trudeau government has directed CRA to stop requiring charities to report on how they spend on political activities, so it is unclear how anyone will be able to judge in future whether the activities carried out are consistent with charity status.These developments open the door wide to potential abuses of political spending by radical ENGOs and other organizations that want to get heavily into political funding and can afford to do so.The impact on the alignment of forces supporting and opposing resource development in Canada could be profound. The environmental organizations opposing development have enormous and probably permanent funding advantages, far greater than any political party could match. The long-term economic effects of this funding advantage could be especially damaging for provinces and regions whose prosperity depends on resource-based development.Previous Reports in this series:Dark Green Moneyhttps://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Dark-Green-Money-Foundation-Funding-Jan-11-2019.pdf  Big Green Moneyhttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-1.pdf Money Matters – The ENGO Political Advantage Money Matters: The ENGO Political Advantage Related:Manufacturing a Climate Crisis  https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manufacturing-A-Climate-Crisis-2A-FINAL.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Canadian charities', 'environmentalism', 'Green New Deal']",2019/04/30

Theselected “author teams, drawn from the hundreds of excellent nominations the IPCC was fortunate to receive, provide us withthe necessary expertise across a range of disciplines to conduct the assessment” … but in truth …… the author statistics (below) show that the “necessary expertise” is lacking, as geologists are again excluded, rendering thecollective authorship incompetent for their stated mission of reviewing the literature to assess climate change. By thisomission, IPCC ignores Earth’s history and the copious geological evidence, latterly backed by archaeology, that sea level(barometer of global temperature, via ocean-water expansion & polar ice melt) undergoes a rapid (100-500 year) & large (1-3metres) oscillation every 500-2000 years, caused by volcanism and solar fluctuations, certainly not by industrial CO2.AR6 author statistics:Working Group I (WGI), ‘The Physical Science Basis’, 232 authors, including meteorologists,oceanographers, climate scientists, glaciologists, physicists, geographers and computer modellers, but no geologists.WGII, ‘Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, 323 authors, no geologists.WGIII, Mitigation of Climate Change, 229 authors, no geologists. Grand total 784 authors, no geologists.Exemplifying IPCC’s chronic lack of impartiality (see my Technical Note 2018-2), one WGI author’s new (2018) book,‘Sunburnt Country’, aims to convince the public that man is making Australia hotter; another’s frequent mainstream-mediaarticles likewise aim to scare people into accepting that manmade warming is fact, not mere belief, and he criticizes Trump.IPCC’s Lee again, in true UN egalitarian style: “Of the selected experts, 44% come from developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition, 53% are new to the IPCC process and 33% are women.” How lovely: no geologists, but at leastwe have politically correct quotas of women, third worlders and youngsters! Worse: the 53% “new” people are doubtlessnearly all younger than 50, i.e. indoctrinated through school and university with the ‘CO2 = pollutant’ fallacy.Be appalled that this biased, underskilled, political organization, having judged the imperceptible & geologicallytrivial 1°C of warming since 1900 (not a provably unprecedented rate) to be manmade, despite copious evidence ofCO2’s innocence (Technical Note 2019-11), has unleashed multi-trillion-dollar expenditure, relentlessly raising yourfamily’s taxes and energy bills, and destined to cripple the global economy and downgrade human living standards.Previous post n this topic:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331928229Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/04/27

That idea is completely absurd.”https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/this-15-year-old-girl-breaks-swedish-law-for-the-climate-d1a48ab97e3a  Uppsala native Malena Ernman (b. 1970) received formal education from Stockholm’s Royal Music Academy; Orleans’ Musical Conservatory; and the Royal Swedish Opera. While opera is her mainstay Malena also sings jazz and pop. She’s cut 10 albums and two hit singles. While already a celebrity, representing Sweden in the 2009 Eurovision Contest made Malena a household name. In 2010 King Carl anointed her a “court singer.”Malena’s fame may be seconded by her father-in-law, Olaf Thunberg – a fixture in Swedish film and television. Olaf graced 39 films and 26 television programs. He also directed two television series.Olaf’s son (Malena’s husband), Svante, followed Olaf’s thespian footsteps but landed few significant gigs. He manages Malena’s singing career. Both are outspoken environmentalists.Malena co-authored a climate alarmist article for Sweden’s most-read newspaper in June 2017. At this time she forsook air travel for the sake of the climate. In October 2017 WWF-Sweden awarded Malena their Environmental Hero award. In December 2017 Greenpeace Sweden centered out Malena for praise.On May 4, 2018 Malena attended an exclusive climate confab in Stockholm whereat the Stockholm Resilience Centre presented: “Welcome to the Power of Capital.” The gathering allowed Malena to connect with Ingmar Rentzhog.Rentzhog rose to prominence after founding Laika Consulting AB, Sweden’s first crowdfunding site. In early 2018 Laika was purchased by the financial communications agency, FundByMe AB. Rentzhog joined FundByMe’s board; concentrating his skills on the affiliated firm: We Don’t Have Time (WDHT).WDHT is half climate campaigner, half tech start-up. Launched on Earth Day, 2018, WDHT soon attracted 435 investors who now own 75% of its stock. WDHT currently claims 718,000 member/followers.Rentzhog’s forte is utilizing all manner of social media to spread messages. Interviewed in a business zine he declared: “our goal is to be the biggest player on the internet.” WDHT sells carbon offsets; provides internet advertising services for sustainable development firms; and prepares climate ratings on businesses and politicians. WDHT’s board includes directors connected to Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.One WDHT director doubles as COO of Global Utmaning (GU, aka Global Challenge) – an environmentalist think tank with 90 advisers drawn from the highest echelons of Swedish civil society, government and business (including a Wallenberg family rep). GU was founded in 2005 by the uber-wealthy heiress, Kristina Persson. In May 2018 Rentzhog became GU President. Another GU official adorns WDHT’s Advisory Board.Also sitting on WDHT’s Advisory Board is Daniela Rogosic: Global Press Officer for IKEA Group. Rounding out WDHT’s boards are two prestigious behavioural scientists and three veterans of Al Gore’s Climate Reality leadership program. Rentzhog, another Climate Reality vet, confers regularly with Gore.GU advances the interests of Sweden’s climate industrial complex. Arguably more than any other country, Sweden is vested in the climate crusade. Sweden is a world leader in green R&D expenditures and clean tech capital investments.Swedish electricity is CO2 emissions-free. Swedes rely mainly on 2,057 small hydro-electric plants with the balance of their power coming from nuclear and from 3,600 wind turbines. They are also avid bio-fuel burners.Sweden’s economy is based on export-oriented manufacturing. In 2018 over 40% of Swedish exports ($166 billion) consisted of machinery, vehicles and electrical equipment. Examples abound of Swedish manufacturers moiling the climate-rescuing energy transition. Electrolux (55,000 employees) is gaming climate-based fuel efficiency regulations to capture larger shares of Europe’s kitchen and laundry appliance market. Volvo (90,000 employees), as of 2019, builds only fully electric or hybrid cars. Capitalizing on their hydropower experience four Swedish companies export turbines.More generally, carbon-free electricity makes Sweden an attractive venue for transnational manufacturers seeking entry into Europe’s climate puritanical market. A 2019 release from the Sweden Trade and Investment Council pitches:“As the EU sets binding targets for reducing emissions, businesses need to plan ahead for regulatory compliance. By locating in Sweden, energy intensive companies can go the extra mile to boost their green competitive advantage and save costs.”Sweden’s mammoth public pension funds are legendarily sunk into renewables. Pension fund managers inhabit the core of the compact network of ministries, businesses, philanthropies and NGOs (SIDA, IKEA Foundations, Wallenberg Foundations, Stockholm Environmental Institute, Tallberg Foundation, CSR Sweden etc.) propelling Sweden toward hyper-ambitious climate goals.Sweden’s vehicle fleet will be fossil fuel free by 2030. Sweden should hit net zero emissions by 2045. This transformation presumes climate alarmists will maintain hegemony over Sweden. It further requires compelling Europe, in deed the world, to accept climate crisis diktat. While not alone in this racket, Swedes play an outsized role in disseminating climate alarmism. Greta is their most recent offering.The Greta Project foreshadowed itself on April 21, 2018 with the release of promotional excerpts from Scenes from the Heart written by Malena Ernman and Svante Thunberg. The book revisits problems the couple faced raising their two daughters amidst surging familial resolve to protect Earth’s climate.On May 30 (three weeks after Rentzhog’s and Malena’s co-attendance at the climate confab) a Swedish newspaper awarded a laureate to Malena’s 15-year-old daughter, Greta, for her climate crisis essay. In June, Twitter and Instagram accounts were set up for Greta.On August 20 Greta held her homemade “Student Strike for Climate” sign on the sidewalk outside Sweden’s parliament. WDHT’s marketing director took the now ubiquitous “lonely Swedish girl” photos. On August 20, WDHT tweeted their best shot above a text pining: “…imagine how lonely she feels.”The first tweet tagged several accounts including: This Is Zero Hour (a US-based youth climate org); Gore’s Climate Reality Project; and a 350.org front group. Within 24 hours the “lonely Swedish girl” tweet attracted 20,000 likes, shares and comments.On August 23 a Swedish daily printed an article under the “lonely girl” photo. By then 20 students had joined Greta’s strike. On August 24 Scenes from the Heart appeared in seven languages. By August 27 six Swedish newspapers, and Swedish and Danish national television, had interviewed Greta. Leaders from Sweden’s two largest political parties paid respects.On September 1 Sweden’s top newspaper ran the op-ed: The Acute Climate Crisis Requires a Broad Political Gathering – thetakeaway message:“Although much of the change required is both possible and profitable, vigorous political campaigns are essential to adjust prices, taxes and regulations so that the transition to a sustainable society becomes attractive, profitable and fast.”The op-ed was co-signed by: Malena Ernman, Ingmar Rentzhog, Kristina Persson, Mats Andersson (former pension fund supremo, current Vice Chair of GU Foundation) and Anders Wijkman (President of the Tallberg Foundation, co-President of the Club of Rome).By mid-September WDHT reached 18 million social media accounts. They had seven times more followers than all the world’s climate organizations combined; and were adding 10,000 per day.In December Greta attended COP 24 in Katowice, Poland where she met the UN Secretary General, took in a UNFCCC meeting, and was guest panelist at the World Bank’s “Youth Unstoppable” forum. She did photo-shoots and interviews for Time and Teen Vogue. At Katowice, Greta gave her famous accusatory speech (albeit to an empty hall).On December 30 Greta finally met Gore, whom she graciously praised. Then it was off to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos where Greta gilded a panel alongside: Bono, will.i.am, Jane Goodard, Gary Cohn, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.At Davos, Greta gave her: “I want you to panic… and act as if the house is on fire” speech. Excerpts were immediately tweeted by WEF, WWF-UK and Greenpeace International. The Guardian printed the entire speech. CNN and France-24 broadcast long selections. (The ‘house on fire’ meme has been systematically circulated by behavioural scientists within the climate complex since 2016.)While much was made of Greta’s speech being impromptu, she gave the same monologue for the e-commercial “Whatever it takes” two days earlier. (Responding to “haters” Greta recently admitted to having “help” with speech-writing.)On the 32-hour train ride back to Sweden from Davos (like her mom, Greta doesn’t fly) Greta was accompanied by her coach/chaperone, Jennifer Morgan. Jennifer has been a climate commissar for decades. She studied Political Science and German before getting her MA from American U’s School of International Studies. She ran climate programs for WWF and World Resources Institute. She advised Chancellor Merkel and PM Blair. She co-founded Global Call for Climate Action (which churned-out many youth activists). Jennifer is currently Greenpeace International’s Executive Director.In February 2019, Rentzhog decided Greta’s presence on WDHT’s board made for bad optics. She was discretely dropped. Jamie Margolin, Greta’s American equivalent, is WDHT’s “youth adviser.”Greta opened an EC session on February 21. With President Juncker beaming down Greta implored the assembled to: “stop sweeping your mess under the carpet for our generation to clean up.”In March Greta was nominated for a Nobel Prize. In April she toured Rome, addressed the Italian Senate, and met the Pope (who blessed her climate strike). In the UK she addressed parliamentarians and was fawned over by politicians of all stripes. She then walked outside and endorsed Extinction Rebellion’s call for a general strike.Greta’s student strike’s most impressive manifestation (March 15) saw 1.5 million students from 2,000 locales skip class to protest government inaction on the “climate catastrophe.”(While mobilizing youth is hardly new to environmentalism, or to the climate campaign specifically, there is ample evidence of a re-doubled effort on this front dating back several years. A plethora of puppet groups have popped up: Sunrise Movement, Fridays 4 Future, This is Zero Hour, Rise Up, Power Shift, US Youth Climate Movement, and Fossil Free Europe etc.)An authoritarian theme runs beneath innocent little Greta’s blunt statements:“…change is coming whether you like it or not.”“…start focussing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible.”The public politely puts up with such pronouncements from an angelic child in a way they never would from the likes of Gore.When asked how she dealt with “climate deniers.” Greta responded: “I don’t.”Greta’s naivety and “Asperger Syndrome” are spun into virtuous inclinations toward frank truth-telling. Asperger’s patients – high-functioning/low-functioning kids with a tendency to act up – sound a bit like indirect sufferers of “Monster Mom Syndrome.” Greta’s naivety, however, seems real. Here’s Greta:“I have not met one single climate activist who is fighting for the climate for the money. That idea is completely absurd.”SourcesA third of the facts found in this article were first discovered from a single source – Cory Morningstar’s 6-part, 30,000 words (75 page) series which also contains over 100 photos, videos and screen shots, and 36 endnotes.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/04/23/facts-on-tankers-show-no-need-for-ban-because-its-2019/,,Facts on Tankers Show No Need for Ban. Because it’s 2019.," By Michelle Stirling © 2019In an April 18, 2019, op-ed in the Globe and Mail, David Anderson invites us to enter his time machine and return to the 1970 and 80s.  Is he still driving a Mercury Cougar? Pontiac Firebird? Chevy Suburban? No?  Curiously his column suggests that tanker traffic is stuck in this era. Regarding the West Coast tanker ban legislation (Bill C-48), the only thing people keep coming up with as a reason to ban tankers is the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989.Things change.  Thirty years ago, the Exxon Valdez was a single-hulled tanker with an inexperienced, exhausted hand at the wheel, the captain below deck, and a broken collision avoidance radar system. The rest is a tragic and messy history.But it is history.Now thirty years later, we have double-hulled tankers, so that if the outside hull is punctured, the inside hull remains intact. Tug boats guide tankers in and out of harbor.  We have GPS and much better mapping of ocean floors and far more accurate weather prediction.And we have excellent spill response materials, teams, and more in-depth scientific knowledge of how to address ocean oil spills than we had 30 years ago. Globally, oil spills have been reduced to a minimum, as reported by the non-profit International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF). Sadly, the facts don’t get the same play as the anti-oil hype in Canada.Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior to that, has written several useful reports filled with facts.  And you know, Facts Matter!Here are some relevant excerpts from his work:Oil transported as cargo in Canadian waters annually totals 192 million tonnes (MT) to the Atlantic coast, 67 MT to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 24 MT to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway and 6MT to the Pacific coast. So, only 2% of the oil shipped as cargo in Canadian waters goes to the Pacific coast. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/29/two-coasts-two-solitudes/The largest oil spill off Canada’s coast was in 1970. The M/V Arrow spilled over 10,000 tonnes off the coast of Nova Scotia, before the era when tankers were required to be double-hulled. The west coast’s largest spill was 240 tonnes caused by the sinking of the M/V The Queen of the North in 2006; that was a fuel oil spill. The largest west coast spill was thus 2.4% of the largest east coast spill. Over the last decade, marine oil spills in Canada have been so small that they are measured not in tonnes or in barrels, but in litres.The standard for response capability related to a potential marine oil spill is 10,000 tonnes across Canada. Why 10,000 tonnes? Because that is equivalent to the largest oil spill in Canadian history, which occurred about 50 years ago. No spill in the last 40 years comes anywhere close to that total, and the Canadian and international requirement of double-hulled tankers makes it extremely unlikely that it will ever happen again. Yet, the environmentalists on the west coast whine constantly that the response standard is not high enough.In its submission to the Tanker Safety Expert Panel (TSEP) in 2013, the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation provided information on several topics, including the present capacity of its equipment to deal with west coast spills. It stated that, even though the standard is 10,000 tonnes, it has a present capacity (i.e. in 2013) of about 26,000 tonnes and is continuing to grow! This is an extremely important counterpoint to the claims of the B.C government, only discovered if one trolls the depths of technical detail. So, the present private sector capacity for dealing with an oil spill off the west coast is two and a half times higher than anywhere else in Canada, and that does not even count the resources of the Canadian Coast Guard, which is the main federal government response organization. No one ever raises this in response to the B.C. government’s claims because it is never publicized. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/18/spilling-best-kept-secrets-on-the-west-coast/With so much evidence publicly available as outlined in Lyman’s reports, why is Mr. Anderson still promoting a ban? It would seem technology and legislation has made tanker traffic very safe from spills, world-wide.Friends of Science Society’s report “Manufacturing a Climate Crisis” documents how environmental law charity, West Coast Environmental Law (WCEL), was funded by a foreign partner of the Tar Sands Campaign to push for the tanker ban legislation.Anderson’s commentary claims that the 2014 drop in investment was solely due to oil price decline. This is untrue. There was a concerted effort by major foreign-funded ENGOs, including Greenpeace, to drive investors out of the Canadian oil sands, as documented in our report.  In 2014, Greenpeace sent an intimidation letter to global  corporate executives of various oil, gas and coal companies, threatening CEOs and board directors with jail for alleged climate crimes. We wrote a rebuttal and sent it to those same corporations and individuals and issued this press release.  BankTrack, a group of some 40 ENGOs out of The Netherlands, has been harassing banks and investors for about a decade to drive them off investing or financing oil, natural gas or coal projects. They particularly hate the Alberta oil sands.Contrary to Anderson’s claim that only the oil price drop has driven the exodus of investors from Canadian oil, WCEL reportedly (from their own documents) went to Kinder Morgan’s AGM in Texas and scared the pants off them over Trans Mountain pipeline expansion with threats of law suits.  What exactly they said is not clear, but it certainly created reluctance.And as Houston energy investment banker noted in its April 2018 “Musings,” just weeks before Kinder Morgan shut down work on Trans Mountain, Canada became seen as a territory that is ‘hostile’ to investment. This is certainly reflected in recent Alberta government statistics.Source: https://economicdashboard.alberta.ca/InvestmentContrary to Anderson’s assertions, both Bill C-48 tanker ban, and the hopelessly subjective Bill C-69, are the products of endlessly lobbying by a hoard of ENGO lobbyists in Ottawa.Robert Lyman explains the problematic issues of NEB reform, the result of which is Bill C-69.Clearly this tanker ban, the on-going foreign-funded pipeline “Blockadia” and foreign-funded international smear campaign against the Alberta oil sands are not based on facts or logic at all.Facts matter and so does living in the present. Because it’s 2019.Canada’s economy and our attractiveness to investment is being destroyed by foreign-funded activists.  Canada is a competitor in the OILympics. We just need market access to win. Stop Bill C-48 and Bill C-69.Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/04/22/how-much-is-enough-the-tax-attack-on-canadian-drivers/,,How Much Is Enough? The Tax Attack on Canadian Drivers," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019We were remiss in not reporting previously on the Canadian Taxpayer Federation (CTF) 20th Annual Gas Tax Honesty Report published on May 17, 2018. The federation’s analysis of the taxes on motor gasoline and diesel fuel is directly relevant to the current controversies about carbon taxes and their economic effects today.Here we will present only some of the main points from the CTF report. Those who are interested in the details can view the entire report here:https://www.taxpayer.com/media/2018-GTHD-EN.pdfIn 2018, the national average gasoline price was $1.35 per litre, including 54 cents in taxes.Gas Price RankingThe pump price of gasoline in any one location is the total of the pre-tax price (based largely on the costs of crude oil, refining and marketing) and the tax bill. Table 1 shows the 2018 average pump prices for selected cities in Canada.Table 1Gas Price Ranking (Dollars per litre)Province/CityPump PricePre-Tax PriceTax billVancouver$1.55$1.05$0.51Montreal$1.38$0.83$0.55Ontario$1.33$0.88$0.44Nova Scotia$1.25$0.83$0.42Alberta$1.24$0.88$0.36Notice that Vancouver has the highest pre-tax price and pump price, but Montreal has the highest tax bill.Tax Pile-OnIt seems more taxes are added to gasoline every decade. Depending on where they live in Canada, motorists who use gasoline or diesel fuel can be subject to federal and provincial excise taxes, sales taxes, transit taxes (Vancouver and Victoria), carbon taxes, and the strange “tax-on-the-tax” because the HST is applied to other taxes.Carbon TaxesThe fastest growing tax on motor fuels is the carbon tax. Because of the different tax regimes among the provinces, carbon taxes in 2018 ranged from the minimum required federal carbon tax of $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent to $18 per tonne in Ontario and Quebec, to $30 per tonne in Alberta and $35 per tonne in British Columbia.Under the federally imposed regime, the minimum carbon taxes will rise from $10 per tonne in 2018 by $10 per tonne per year until they reach $50 per tonne in 2022. Depending on which political party is in power, they will go on rising significantly after that. Table 2 shows what this means to the motorist.Table 2Federal Government Minimum Carbon TaxYearCarbon Taxtonne)Gasoline Equivalent(litre)Annual Total   2018$10$0.02$402019$20$0.05$802020$30$0.07$1202021$40$0.09$1602022$50$0.11$200The True Carbon TaxIf the purpose of carbon taxes is to discourage use by raising the cost, that objective is being served by all the taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, taxes that are not borne by other fuels. The true “carbon tax” is thus the per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent of all the taxes imposed on motor fuels, and especially gasoline. Table 3 shows what this meant for gasoline consumers in different cities in 2018.Table 3The True Carbon TaxProvince/CityTax Bill($/L)    Tax per TonneMontreal0.55$231Vancouver0.51$228Ontario0.44$188Nova Scotia0.42$180Alberta0.36$158The Canadian average for this carbon tax equivalent is $192 per tonne.RevenueThe taxes already on gasoline and diesel fuel yield enormous revenues. As the federal excise tax revenues are returned to the provinces to pay for transit expenditures, by far the majority of these funds go to the provincial governments. Table 4 indicates CTF’s estimates of the total revenues from taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel in 2018.Table 4 Gas and Diesel Tax 2018 Revenue EstimatesTaxRevenues ($million)Provincial Per-litre Taxes11,987Provincial Sales Tax3,803Federal Excise Tax4,733Federal Sales Tax3,528Tax-on-tax1,764Total24,051In other words, even without counting the carbon taxes, Canadian governments took in over $24 billion in revenue from taxes of motor fuel in 2018.As the Canadian Taxpayers Federation says in its report, it’s time for some tax honesty.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'fuel tax', 'GHG reduction targets']",2019/04/22
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/04/01/just-the-facts-on-carbon-tax/,Michael Gaudet ,Just the Facts on Carbon Tax," Just the Facts on Carbon Tax: Twelve Facts to Rebut Ecofiscal Canada’s Ten MythsLINK TO OUR REPORT:  Just the Facts FINALSummaryEcofiscal Canada has just issued a report on “10 Myths About Carbon Pricing in Canada.” We respond with 12 facts.Climate change is the last on the list of priorities for Canadians according to Ecofiscal’s own poll conducted by Abacus Data (Feb. 2018)There is no open debate on carbon taxes and climate policy. Canadian media does not support Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press on climate change.Extreme weather is unrelated to human influence on climate or carbon dioxide concentrations.Carbon tax is not effective in reducing carbon dioxide/GHG emissions.Carbon taxes hurt jobs and drive commerce and industry out-of-business or offshore. In 2013, the EU industry minister said such energy policies were causing an ‘industrial massacre’.Suggesting that a rebate (carbon dividend) is ‘larger than carbon cost to families’ is impossible math, deceptive and dishonest; the rebate does not incorporate the incremental rise in cost of living as carbon taxes are applied to everything. “Tax ‘em and bribe ‘em with their own money.”Canada one of the largest emitters? Faulty logic. Where is the climate justice for the world’s second largest, cold, vast, resource exporting nation?Elites versus the People – tax-free/tax-exempt/tax-avoiding pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and union funds see you as their ATM for unfunded pension liabilities.Fair and Equal? Green billionaires have funded the climate ‘crisis’ campaign for their own vested interests.A tax grab and more – watch for the ‘personal carbon ration’A cash grab by government – with an alarming scope of income that could be larger than even income taxes!Not science-based – Carbon dioxide is not a control knob that can fine tune climate. Therefore a carbon tax is unnecessary and irrelevant.Now you may wonder why there is such a disparity of views. How can a group of highly qualified economists come to the Ecofiscal conclusion that supports carbon pricing – while another group of economists, scientists and Professional Engineers like Friends of Science Society reach a different conclusion?The answer lies in the disconnect between the carbon tax ‘as a market mechanism’ and the grim reality of the scope of intended greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets.  To many people, these are simply numbers to be reached – they are unaware of how deeply embedded the use of energy is in every aspect of modern life, or they falsely believe ‘clean-tech’ will solve the problem [the Apollo Fallacy[i]]. They don’t realize that ‘success’ – in this case – would mean catastrophe for Canada.Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant and diplomat, outlines the crux of the matter in this summary:Economists love carbon taxation because it is a market-based policy instrument, and thus, in their minds, more “economically efficient” than regulations and subsidy programs. They forget that such taxes are rarely, if ever, used as alternatives to regulations and subsidies – they just become redundant, costly add-ons.  But there is a far more important point. Taxes are just a policy instrument, and the instrument is nowhere near as important as the policy goal. The policy goal in the case of Canadian climate change policy is to reduce emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 and by at least 50% from 2005 levels by 2050. Canadian emissions were 704 megatonnes in 2016. To reach the 2030 target, they would have to decline by 192 megatonnes, and to reach the 2050 target they would have to decline by 338 megatonnes.  The entire emissions from transportation in 2016 were 173 megatonnes. So you could eliminate every car, SUV, truck, bus, aircraft, train and marine vessel in the country, and you still would not achieve the 2030 target. The 2050 target could not be attained if you eliminated all the transportation sources (173 Mt), all the heavy industry (81 Mt), and almost half the oil and gas operations (80 Mt out of 183 Mt). This is assuming zero growth in emissions due to economic or population growth.  How exactly, would you accomplish this by raising energy prices? You could only do so by raising them so high that you drove millions of people into bankruptcy and forced thousands of firms to cease operations and leave Canada. You won’t hear any carbon tax advocate talking about that. That’s what it means for the nation. And what does this mean for the working person or pensioner? Belgian philosopher Drieu Godefridi explains the reasons behind the persistent Gilets Jaunes/Yellow Vests anti-carbon tax movement in France: This tax oppression mechanically condemns millions of formerly middle-class and working poor French people to a head-first plunge into poverty where they will no longer know how to pay for the necessities of life: heating, fuel, medical care, food. It seems doubtful that the revolt of people is diminishing when the state progressively and aggressively confiscates the means of their subsistence, and finally their dignity.[ii] RELATED;Robert Lyman – Climate Change Policy: A Threat to CanadaCan Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?  [i] https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=cob_papers[ii] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/11/28/3-reasons-to-think-that-the-movement-of-yellow-vests-has-only-just-begun/Just the Facts On Carbon TaxDownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change']",2019/04/01
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/04/01/debunking-ecofiscals-carbon-pricing-myths/,,Debunking Ecofiscal’s “Carbon Pricing Myths”," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.   Read his recent publication: “Transition to Reality: The Propsects for Rapid Global Decarbonization.”A group of economists known as the Ecofiscal Commission has recently published a report that claims to debunk 10 myths about carbon pricing in Canada.  Robert Lyman reviews their claims in this post, stating their ‘myths’ first, then his rebuttal.Myth #1: Carbon Pricing is a new, untested idea.Fact:Carbon pricing is another version of an old, frequently-failed idea. Economists have been advocating the use of market-based mechanisms as theoretically more efficient ways to achieve public policy objectives since the early part of the twentieth century. The basic idea is that governments should attempt to calculate the difference between the social and private costs of people’s buying decisions, and impose a “social premium” in the form of an extra cost, on consumers not otherwise reflected in competitive market prices. The idea has rarely been successful in practice because of difficulties in calculating accurately the value of the “social premium”, and because the public has long been deeply skeptical that governments were not going to use the taxes as a way to scoop funds for other political purposes. Carbon taxes were analyzed and rejected by Natural Resources Canada in the early 1990’s. Actual experience in jurisdictions around the world with the use of revenues raised by carbon taxes justifies the public’s skepticism. Myth #2: Only very high carbon taxes are effectiveFACT:The effectiveness of any tax used as a price premium depends on the price elasticity of demand for the product being taxed. In the case of carbon taxes, the primary targets are oil products, natural gas and coal. Oil products used in transportation are notoriously inelastic (i.e. unresponsive to price increases) and coal used for electricity generation is essentially insulated from market pressures by the system of electricity regulation in Canada. This, however, misses the real point. The announced goal of Canadian climate policy is to reduce national emissions by 30% from 2010 levels by 2030 and then to go on reducing them to perhaps 50% from 2010 levels by 2050. That would mean a massive and costly transformation of the Canadian economy, the sharp reduction in transportation use and in resource industry activity, with devastating consequences for consumers and for provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador. Emissions reductions of that magnitude will not be achieved at low or moderate carbon tax levels. The taxes would need to be high enough to shut down entire industries. Myth #3: Carbon pricing will cost Canadian familiesFACT:It will cost families, so a carbon rebate or ‘dividend’ is offered to ease the financial pain. This is a case of bait and switch. By including a consumer rebate to a carbon tax measure, the government is trying to argue that it is achieving a social justice objective. If this were such a great idea, why has it not used the same approach with sales taxes or corporate income taxes i.e. raises the tax and then rebate the money to consumers, or better yet, just lower everyone’s income taxes? Anyone who thinks that this approach will catch on had better not hold their breath waiting for it. The provinces are taking different approaches to how they will tax and how they will rebate, if at all, which makes this subject very complicated. In some cases, only 70% or less of the emission sources will be taxed. In others, special exemptions, often politically motivated, will be given. There will be plenty of room for game playing as to who qualifies for a rebate and by how much. Finally, governments can be sure to keep ever high percentages of the revenues as the carbon tax rates go into the stratosphere. What cannot be denied is that the target groups – oil, natural gas, and coal producers and consumers – will be worse off by far; that is the whole point of the tax. Myth #4: Carbon Pricing Hurts JobsFACT:It does. All taxes impose what economists call a “deadweight loss” on the economy, as they take revenues from those that would have received them under free market conditions and reallocate them elsewhere. In the case of carbon taxes, they will disproportionately affect all fossil-fuel intensive parts of the Canadian economy  (like petroleum and mining, petrochemicals, metals fabrication, cement, aluminum and steel production) and transportation costs in the economy, which of course are incurred by all. These are costs that will not be incurred by firms in competing jurisdictions and especially in the United States. Given the high degree of economic integration between Canada and the United States, it is abundantly clear that the competitiveness of Canadian firms, and their ability to attract investment in future, will suffer. Some international context would be useful here. The rates used in carbon tax regimes vary widely from a low equivalent to US $1 per ton in Mexico and Poland to a high of US $139 per ton in Sweden. Within western Europe, the rates range widely as well, with one group using rates of US $9 per ton or less, and most others with rates in the range of US $16 to $29 per ton. In Canada, there is a combination of emissions trading and carbon dioxide taxes within a federal government policy framework that requires prices to be at least Cdn $20 (US $15) per ton in 2019 rising to Cdn $50 (US $38) per ton by 2022. In China, the average rate is about US $2 per ton. Imagine Canadian firms, with a carbon tax on their backs, trying to compete with Chinese firms. Myth #5: Big polluters are getting a breakFACT: Many do get breaks. This is the rhetorical equivalent of “sucking and blowing at the same time”. The Ecofiscal Commission claims that large emitters will pay dearly, but then says they will be subsidized to reduce emissions. Does this mean that punishing large emitters with high taxes is not enough or that these companies are not smart enough to figure out how to make efficiency improvements without applying to a government program for subsidies so that they choose the right one? Again, the magnitude of the emissions reductions sought by 2030 and beyond are much, much higher than can be accomplished by efficiency improvements. The effect will be to shut down whole segments of the economy, especially in resource-intensive regions. Myth #6: Carbon Pricing is a Cash GrabFACT: It is. The experience of British Columbia has already borne this out, as have studies of carbon pricing regimes around the world. In other jurisdictions, initial statements of intention to fully or partially recycle such revenues often have not borne out in practice. The Institute of Climate Economics (14CE) is a think tank based in Paris, France funded by the French Development Agency and Morocco’s Caisse de Depot et Gestion. In October, 2017, it published the results of a study of the use of carbon dioxide pricing in the 40 countries in the world in which they then existed. The Institute found that, on a global scale, only 29% of the revenues raised were recycled into the economy in the form of tax exemptions. Thirty-four per cent were used to subsidize programs that would reduce GHG emissions. The largest share, 37%, were allocated to the general budget. In other words, of course it’s a cash grab. The only question is how high a percentage of the revenues raised will be used to serve a wide range of politicians’ favourite projects. Myth #7: People cannot change their behaviours in response to carbon pricingFACT: If hundreds of similar measures aren’t working yet, why will this one work? The real issue is why, if carbon taxes are such a great idea and so effective in reducing emissions, federal and provincial governments are continuing to use every other program, subsidy, and regulation in the book and a dozen more every year in addition to carbon taxes. In Canada’s most recent reports to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, Environment and Climate Change Canada listed over 300 existing federal programs and other measures designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Natural Resources Canada’s website recently listed an addition 280 more programs and measures implemented by provincial and territorial governments. No one is keeping track of all the programs and measures being taken by municipal governments anxious to get into the game. Myth #8: There is no point to carbon pricing if governments rebate the revenues.FACT: Rebates are a distraction intended to fool Canadians by putting back into their left pocket a portion of the money removed from the right pocket and surreptitiously harming Canadian businesses in order to appear generous to the “middle class”. The statement would have been accurate if it had ended after the word “pricing”. Myth #9: We can use other, better policies to reduce our emissions.FACT: Governments are already throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this issue. The record of government action to date speaks for itself. Since 1992, when Canadian governments first began setting emission reduction targets, not one has been met. We are clearly on track to miss the 2020 target as well. It would take a miracle, or the worst recessions since the Great Depression, for Canada to make the 2030 target, and it gets worse after that. It is long past time to recast our objectives. Myth #10: There is no need to reduce Canada’s emissionsFACT: Canada is not the problem. The ‘myth’ statement is premised on the view that what Canada does or does not do to reduce emissions will affect global emissions trends. There is not one shred of evidence to support this contention. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2018, global GHG emissions from fuel combustion in 2017 totaled 33.4 billion tons. Canada accounted for 1.6% of this total. The IPCC has developed a mathematical model with which it attempts to measure the impact on average global temperatures by 2100 of emissions reductions made before that time. If one accepts the premises and methodology that underlies this model, the full implementation of commitments made prior to the Paris Agreement, including the sustained implementation of those commitments to 2100, would reduce average global temperatures by about 0.017 degrees from their present path, according to analysis done by Bjorn Lomborg.[1] The IPCC has estimated, however, that avoiding the 1.5 degree increase in temperatures would require that global emissions decline by at least 40 to 50% by 2030 and reach “net zero” by 2050. The actual emissions trends currently are dominated by the continued growth in emissions from developing (non-OECD) countries that now represent 63% of global emissions. In practical terms, there is a near zero likelihood that the goals suggested by the IPCC will be met. Any action taken by Canada to reduce emissions will thus have either a negligible or nil effect on average global temperatures. The “bottom line” is that there is no need for Canada to reduce its emissions to the point at which it severely harms Canadians’ economy and standard of living. Indeed, present climate policies, with their dire implications for western Canada, pose a threat to national unity far more serious than anything that has occurred since the debates over Quebec secession in the 1980’s and 1990’s. Those considerations surely outweigh the benefits of making symbolic gestures that will have no real effect on global emissions or climate trends. READ: The Alarming Scope of Future Carbon Taxes in Canada~~~~Related:Our rebuttal to Ecofiscal’s previous work “Let Them Eat Carbon” Video: READ:85 peer-reviewed papers show that carbon dioxide has little to nominal effect on climate change.[1] Lomborg, Bjorn.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/03/28/a-fathers-email-to-his-younger-family-members/,,A Father’s Email to His Younger Family Members!," Action Alberta had an interesting post the other day.With permission we repost a slightly edited version.You can sign up for their commentaries at:https://actionalberta.caHere is a thought-provoking, timely recently sent by a father to his family. We thought that it was so instructive that we are repeating it here! You may wish to consider sending it to your family as well!Dear Family:On May 5, 2015, I wrote a heartfelt email to all of you …… [His thoughts today follow]Personal WealthOver the last 4 years Alberta’s net financial assets have decreased by $47 Billion. During that period the equity in Alberta housing has decreased by an estimated $27 Billion. Based on a population of 4.3 million, that means that every man woman and child is on average $15,000 poorer today than in 2015 – $60,000 for a family of four.JobsIn 2014, 431,000 individuals were employed in the resource sector while 467,000 were employed in education, healthcare and public administration. (all numbers from Statistics Canada). In late 2018, 401,000 individuals were employed in the resource sector while 551,000 were employed in education, healthcare and public administration. During that period the public sector added 84,000 jobs (18%) while that portion of the private sector shrank by 7%. The government’s share of total employment is now 23.2% – the highest in decades.TaxesCorporate and personal income taxes (provincial & federal) have increased dramatically and we now also have a carbon tax which was not mentioned in the NDP’s 2015 campaign.Cost of GovernmentEven after 4 very tough years, the cost per capita ($12,717 ) of delivering Alberta’s government services, continues to be 14% higher than the average cost for the 4 largest provinces. No attempt has been made to reduce those costs or otherwise balance them with the vastly reduced revenues experienced during the downturn.DebtWhen the NDP took over in 2015, Alberta had no provincial debt. The debt is forecast to be $71 Billion next year and is projected to grow to over $100 Billion in the next 4 years, IF the NDP are re-elected.What About all of the Other Social and Non-Financial Issues?Healthcare wait times? Average class sizes? New schools & hospitals? Environmental stewardship? Human rights? Personal freedoms? Commitment to the arts? The rights & freedoms of the LGBTQ and other defined groups? Other social issues?If the economy is not strong, the budget not balanced and the debt not brought under control, the province will not be able to afford to adequately deal with those issues. Our standard of living, which has already materially eroded under the NDP, will continue to deteriorate. Societies that put their financial house in order first have the flexibility to address the other needs and wants of the citizens. The extreme example of a country that followed the spend/borrow/tax/repeat path can be seen in the disaster that is Venezuela today.Who will have to pay back the debt?My generation will not be around to service the interest and repay the massive debt that your government has incurred. That burden will fall to my children and their cohort and to the children of that group. Interest on the debt, together with repayment of principal, will become an increasingly more painful annual cost which government can only fund with increased taxes – a vicious downward spiral.Living Within One’s MeansI am very proud of the fact that each and every one of you understands how to budget responsibly and that you are committed to living within your personal means. The Alberta government forecast says they will run another $6.9 Billion deficit this year, which means they will have to borrow those funds at ever-increasing rates because the province’s credit rating has been materially impaired. The City of Calgary continues to substantially live beyond its means with misplaced priorities and many programs introduced in better times and are now much too expensive to maintain and in some cases of questionable utility.The federal government’s aggregate deficit under the Liberals since 2015 is $60 Billion and the recent budget confirms they are planning to run further deficits totaling an additional $66 Billion over the next 4 years, IF re-elected.QuestionI only have one very important question for each of you:Do you think it is time for the Alberta government to exercise the same level of financial discipline and prudence that each of you is required to demonstrate in your personal lives?I am hopeful that your answer to that question will guide your decision at the ballot box on April 16th.Love,DadP.S. If you would like to learn more about these important issues please refer to the excellent paper linked below, which I “borrowed” heavily from and which was written by David Yager, an associate of mine.David Yager is a Calgary-based oil and gas writer and energy analyst.

Claims of consensus are detrimental to open public debate.“Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.” ― Robert B. Cialdini, Influence: The Psychology of PersuasionAs you know, President Trump is developing a presidential review on climate change and many scientists and policy experts have recently publicly made it known to him that they hold strongly dissenting views on climate change from the alleged mainstream ‘consensus’.[1]  Though one can say there is agreement that climate change is real, as is evident over the ~4.5 billion years of earth’s existence, and clearly humans have some greater and lesser impacts on the earth, it is inaccurate to extrapolate these fundamental concepts into a claim that almost all scientists share a groupthink view of causes of climate change. We demonstrate the flaws in the claimed 97% consensus papers in this study.[2]We believe that the underlying reason for mass public alarm over climate change is due to the ClimateWorks billionaires and other commercial/investment interests in carbon trading, spending hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade, to fund environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) world-wide to push climate change hysteria in order to drive their global cap and trade plans and vested interests in renewables. The wind/solar renewables business case relies on the claim that fossil fuel use and power generation carbon dioxide emissions will cause global warming.[3]  NASA’s credibility is exploited by promoting a non-existent ‘97% consensus’ that misrepresents what scientists do agree upon.NASA holds a special place in the hearts of millions of people around the world. It was through the brilliant concepts and precision work of thousands of NASA employees and sub-contractors that so many exceptional space missions were successfully completed.  Indeed, all of these were only possible to bring into fruition using the energy from hydrocarbons and the many useful by-products.In the process of NASA’s space exploration, many long-held beliefs about earth, the moon, sun, and other extraterrestrial bodies were enlightened through discovery – only possible because scientists were willing to venture beyond initial perceptions and understandings.We believe this is the case with climate change science. Much excellent work has been done by thousands of scientists and this has enhanced our understanding of the climate. This work should have expanded our ability to discuss new findings. Instead, vested interests have made efforts to limit the public debate to name-calling of ‘denier’ to anyone with dissenting views or evidence, while demanding compliance to a ‘party line’ regarding human influence.The claim of ‘consensus’ is a powerful social proof – a psychological tactic that has been employed to shut down public debate and cost-benefit policy analysis.  NASA’s role in posting only the ‘97%’ consensus papers, without also posting dissenting papers or evidence, means that millions of people have been misled and meaningful questions on climate change or policy have been silenced.We request that you update the NASA Climate Change website to include the fact that there is no singular consensus on human influence on climate change.  If your site posts ‘consensus’ studies, it would be in keeping with the integrity of the scientific method, as outlined by Richard Feynman, to also post rebuttal studies to avoid supporting Cargo Cult Science.“It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty—a kind of leaning over backwards.  For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid—not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked—to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated….Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them.  You must do the best you can—if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to explain it. …In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.”[4]We look forward to seeing such updates on the NASA Climate Change website.Sincerely,Michelle StirlingCommunications ManagerCc:President Donald TrumpVice President Mike PenceDr. William Happer[1] https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/joint-letter-to-president-trump-in-support-of-proposed-presidents-commission-on-climate-security[2] https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf[3] ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeaks https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165Nisbet  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.524 Summary: https://web.northeastern.edu/matthewnisbet/2018/05/21/summary-of-strategic-philanthropy-in-the-post-cap-and-trade-years-reviewing-u-s-foundation-climate-and-energy-funding-at-wires-climate-change/[4] http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htmShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'consensus']",2019/03/27
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/03/27/climate-science-and-economics/,,Climate Science and Economics," Contributed by Kenneth B. Gregory, P. Eng.   © March 24, 2019Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is a major issue of our time.  There has been a great deal of research on both natural and anthropogenic climate change published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Unfortunately, governments and most news media rely on a political organization of the United Nations called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for information and assessments about climate science and policy options. The IPCC relies on climate models that assume all the warming recorded by instruments was caused by human activity despite the overwhelming evidence of large and rapid warming and cooling events before humans could have had any effect on global temperatures.  The sun’s activity and intensity has increased through the 20th century. Its magnetic flux in the 1990s was the greatest of the last 3000 years.[1] The IPCC falsely attributes natural warming and urban warming to greenhouse gas emission warming by ignoring the compelling evidence of natural climate change before 1950 that correlates well with indicators of solar activity.Current global temperatures are likely similar to that of the Roman Warm Period (1 – 200 AD) and the Medieval Warm Period (800-1100 AD), but much warmer than the Dark Age Cold Period and the Little Ice Age which ended about 1850. The temperature history shows an obvious millennium cycle, which strongly indicates that a large portion of the warming since 1850 was a natural recovery from the Little Ice Age[2].Several studies of urban warming show strong correlations between warming and indicators of economic development. McKitrick and Michaels 2017 estimate that about half of the warming over land since 1980 was due to urban warming.[3],[4] This urban heat island effect (UHIE)[5] is caused by several processes, including the direct heating by energy use in our cities, the change in the land cover by replacing natural vegetation with roads and buildings, which retains heat and prevents transpiration. Turbulent mixing the warm air aloft by high buildings with the near-surface air at nighttime which raises nighttime temperatures. These effects must be removed from the instrument temperature record to determine the warming effect of human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.the effect of CO2 emissions is projected to cause about 0.6 °C of warming from 2018 to 2100 … may be fully offset by natural cooling forces for the next 25 years.     The IPCC ignores the urban warming component of the temperature indexes they use. The IPCC acknowledges and agrees that there is a strong correlation between warming and economic development, but they dismissed the evidence by claiming natural atmospheric circulation  changes warmed the cities but not the surrounding country-side, a ludicrous claim.The most recent energy balance study of climate sensitivity to emissions by Lewis & Curry 2018[6] shows that if all the warming was due to GHG, the expected warming due to all emissions would cause 0.9 °C of warming from 2018 to 2100. Carbon dioxide (CO2) causes 90% of GHG warming. This forecast is based on an energy balance calculation that relates the total warming over the last 140 years to the GHG forcing estimates published by the IPCC. However, when the natural warming and the UHIE is accounted for, the effect of CO2 emissions is projected to cause about 0.6 °C of warming from 2018 to 2100. These estimate assume emissions continue to increase exponentially with no mitigation policies. However, the sun has entered a quiet, less active phase and the natural 65-year ocean cycle is changing to a cooling phase, so the projected CO2 warming may be fully offset by natural cooling forces for the next 25 years.The direct radiative warming effect of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use is well understood by climate scientists. An increase of CO2 in the air from 0.041% in 2018 to 0.064% in 2100 is expected to cause about 0.60 °C of warming[7] in that 82-year period assuming no other factors change, such as the amount of water vapor, clouds, snow and ice cover, and natural climate change.  The average of the climate models increases this warming to 1.2 °C by assuming water vapour, a strong greenhouse gas, increases in the upper atmosphere and clouds change to enhance warming. But the weather balloon measurements from NOAA show water vapour declining in the upper atmosphere, allowing heat to escape to outer space. News media stories and many official reports rely on a extremely high emissions IPCC scenario called RCP8.5. This scenario assumes coal use increases ten-fold and CO2 concentrations reach 0.094% (936 ppm) by 2100, which is way above an exponential extrapolation of the recent history. This is an near-impossible emissions scenario. It’s not going to happen. It is used only to scare people.The IPCC ignores natural climate change other than the change in the total solar irradiance (TSI), which is the heat output of the sun. This change is small, but the IPCC ignores the evidence that the sun’s impact on climate is much larger than what can be explained by the sun’s TSI change.  The conduct of the IPCC in this regard is contrary to fundamental scientific principles. Science requires that theory is tested against observational evidence, and where there is disagreement, the theory must be modified.The large solar effect may be due to the sun’s changing magnetic field carried by the solar wind which has a significant effect on cloud cover by affecting the creation of tiny aerosol particles that seed cloud formation, and large changes in the ultraviolet radiation that affects stratosphere temperatures, that eventually affects surface temperatures.[8] Natural climate change also includes long-term ocean oscillations, volcanic activity and other processes.The average of the climate models project a warming trend of the lowest part of the atmosphere from 1979 to 2018 that is 215% of the actual measurements, so the models are wrong. The model trend of the global bulk atmospheric temperature is 250% of the trends of the weather balloon and satellite data. This is because the models are far too sensitive to greenhouse gases. The bulk atmosphere warms more than the surface in the models because they increase water vapour in the upper atmosphere, while the measurements from weather balloons and satellites show declining water vapour.FUND is an economic model that simulates the welfare impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in various regions of the Earth.[9] It forecasts the wealth growth and the economic and social impacts of climate change and CO2 fertilization of plants.  It shows that Canada’s personal wealth, or gross domestic product per person (GDP/capita) is projected to increase from C$60,550 in 2018 to C$151,700 in 2100 despite climate change. This is an increase in personal wealth by a factor of 2.5.Dr. Richard Tol is an expert in climate economics and co-author of the FUND model. He wrote in his book “Climate Economics” published in 2014 “The impact [in Canada of climate change] is positive throughout the 21st century, as are incremental impacts”[10]. He shows the impact continually increases to 1.78% of GDP by 2100, equivalent to over C$100 billion benefit per year. The largest benefits for Canada are reduced space heating costs and higher agricultural production.The Alberta Government relied on a report produced by the US Government to develop their climate plan. That report utilized three economic models to estimate the social cost/benefit of CO2 emissions (SCC).  Two of those models have insignificant benefits of CO2 fertilization of plants and they fail to account for adaptation. They also assume that all warming is harmful, which clearly is untrue. The FUND model does include CO2 fertilization and attempt to account for adaptation, but the US Government report authors fudged the SCC higher in the model. They ran all three models using a distribution of possible climate sensitivities to GHG that are far above recent estimates. These factors vastly increases the SCC and makes the results inappropriate for climate policy. Correcting just the climate sensitivity to a recent estimate reduces the calculated SCC from the FUND model by 80%.[11]  The Alberta Government projects that their climate plan, which includes shutting down coal-fired power plants and imposing carbon taxes, would reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 2030 by 0.026 parts per million, thereby reducing global temperatures by 0.00007 °C, which is insignificant.[12]EDC Associates Ltd. published a study of the potential impact on Alberta’s electricity market of Alberta’s climate plan. The study finds that the cumulative cost of electricity from 2017 to 2030 is expected to increase by $3.3 to $5.9 billion depending on policy choices. The CO2 reduction would cost $420/tCO2, which is 14 times the current carbon price.[13]The Alberta government plans to replace inexpensive, reliable and dispatchable electricity from fossil fuels with extremely expensive and unreliable electricity from wind and solar electricity, which requires near 100% backup with natural gas fired power plants. The extreme variability of renewable power requires the backup power plants to rapidly ramp their power output up and down to offset the variable output of wind and solar power. This enormously increases the cost of the backup power and causes increased CO2 emissions per unit of electricity produced. In Europe, electricity prices are highly correlated with the amount of solar and wind on the grid, with prices in Denmark and Germany about 3 times higher than in Hungary, which has little wind and solar power. The relation implies that the cost of wind and solar power in Europe is 7.2 times the cost of power from fossil fuels.Warming and CO2 fertilization benefits the agriculture industry as CO2 is plant food and warming increases the area of arable lands and promotes growth. A study of CO2 fertilization on crops shows a global economic benefit of over the 50-year period 1961-2011 of US$4.0 trillion. The annual benefit in 2011 was US$176 billion (2018 dollars).[14]Studies of satellite imagery shows that the world has greened due to CO2 emissions. A study published in 2016 shows a widespread increase of growing-season leaf area, with the CO2 fertilization effect explaining 70% of the observed greening trend. The greening over 33 years is equivalent to adding a green continent 2/3 times the size of mainland USA.[15]The Canadian death rate in January is more than 100 deaths/day greater than in August. Similarly, the USA death rate in January and February is more than 1000 deaths per day greater than in July and August.[16]  Dr. Peiser wrote “Britain’s leading medical experts have calculated that a rise of the average temperature by two degrees Celsius over the next 50 years would increase heat-related deaths in Britain by about 2,000 – but would reduce cold-related deaths by about 20,000. In other words, the decrease in the number of cold-related deaths would be much more significant (by a factor of 10) than the heat-related deaths due to rising temperatures.” A major study published in 2015 examined 74 million deaths worldwide from 1985 to 2012 and found that the ratio of cold-related to heat-related deaths was a whopping 17 to 1.[17] It appears that much of these health benefits of warming are not included in economic models of climate change.On a global basis, the FUND model (Julia version) calculates that the net annual benefit of GHG emissions and warming from 1900 is around US$3 trillion/yr at 2100, or 0.85% of global GDP assuming an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.0 °C to a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere with 1.3 °C of warming from 2018. That is, global warming to 2100 is likely net beneficial.The annual global benefit of greenhouse gas emissions may be around US$3 trillion/year by 2100.So why are we putting a huge burden on ourselves to prevent a benefit to the extremely wealthy people of the future? If the economic forecasts are correct and future Canadians in 2100 will be 2.5 times wealthier than us today, they can afford to pay for adaptation measures if and when temperatures increase to levels that start to cause damages.[1] “A 3,000-Year Record of Solar Activity”, http://www.co2science.org/articles/V17/N32/C1.php[2] The natural warming is estimated at 0.084 °C/century, however, this is very uncertain.[3] Quantifying the Influence of the Urban Heat Island Effect,

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/03/24/the-use-and-abuse-of-ghg-reduction-targets/,Andrew Roman ,The Use and Abuse of GHG Reduction Targets," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, a former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior.The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment is a U.K.-based foundation that conducts studies and prepares policy briefs in support of the United Nations goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. In an October, 2018 policy brief entitled, Aligning National and International Climate Targets, it examined the extent to which the countries that adhered to the COP21 Paris Agreement in December 2015 have moved beyond setting general objectives to setting specific economy-wide emissions reductions targets, sector-specific targets, and then embodying these targets in specific laws and policies. The brief can be read here: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Aligning-national-and-international-climate-targets.pdf The brief argued that setting very specific targets and embodying them in laws and policies was important for four reasons: Setting “robust, consistent, and measurable” targets will facilitate monitoring of progress towards the attainment of country and international goals;Setting national quantified targets informs the design, implementation, tracking and revision of policies and measures;Setting transparent and robust targets supports political momentum, establishing benchmarks and “new norms of leadership on climate policy”; andThe Paris Agreement includes a ratcheting mechanism, which stipulates that countries shall prepare successive “Nationally Determined Contributions” (NDCs) every five years that “represent a progression beyond the Party’s current NDC, and reflect their highest possible ambition”. Concrete targets can serve as benchmarks to track the ratcheting up of ambition. One might be forgiven for viewing this endorsement of emissions reduction targets in a skeptical light. For the most part, since countries began setting GHG emission reduction targets in 1992, in almost no case have the targets actually been met. This is certainly the case for Canada. Every few years, however, another international conference is held at which countries discuss the desirability to imposing on themselves, collectively and individually, even more restrictive targets. COP21, in fact, represented the first time that the countries of the world recognized that they could not collectively set emission reduction targets because of the political and policy discord among them. That is why they committed only to submitting plans, individually determined, every five years. There is no legal requirement under the Paris Agreement for an individual country to set a target. In practice, emission reduction targets have served primarily  not as public administration management tools but rather as political commitments, usually well beyond a country’s ability to meet at acceptable cost. Environmental organizations have used these public commitments to shame governments that fail to take more stringent measures. Politicians have been caught in the Catch-22 situation of having to choose between being publicly berated for failing to commit to an ambitious target to please the environmental lobby, or being publicly berated every year when the emissions reductions inevitably failed to materialize. In any event, the Grantham Institute’s review of the performance of the signatories to the Paris Agreement since 2015 is quite revealing, in ways the Institute undoubtedly did not intend. While 157 of the 197 Parties to the Agreement have set economy-wide emissions reductions targets in their NDCs, only 58 have done so with domestic laws and policies, and only 17 of those are consistent with the targets set out in the NDCs. For the rest, there is insufficient data for comparison. Expressed in other terms, only 9 % of the signatories of the Paris Agreement have gone beyond general political commitments to express their emissions reduction objectives in law or policy that are consistent with the political commitments. The target planning horizons of countries differ. Conferences before 2015 led to the establishment of 2020 as one target-base year. COP21 extended that to 2030. Today, while most (142) countries have set 2030 targets in their NDCs, only 33 countries have set economy-wide targets in laws and policies beyond 2020. In fact, when the Institute examined all the targets set to date (including both economy-wide and sectoral targets) only 60% of them have a target year later than 2020. The Grantham policy brief recommended, of course, that more countries introduce targets in laws and policies. Reading the Grantham Institute brief, one cannot help but be impressed by the gulf between its focus on emission reduction targets as bureaucratic, legal and political instruments and the emission reduction demands being made of countries by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).According to the International Energy Agency, the global GHG emissions from fuel combustion in 2016 (the most recent year published by the IEA) were 32.3 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent. Those emissions arise from two groups, the 36 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED), the more developed countries, and the rest of the world, generally considered the developing countries. All of the OECD countries combined produced 11.6 Gt, or 36% of the total. The non-OECD countries combined produced 20.7 Gt, or 64% of the total. China alone produced 9.1 Gt.In its Special Report 15 of October, 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that global emissions must be reduced by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030; otherwise, it predicted a warming of 1.5 degrees C. sometime between 2030 and 2050, bringing “species extinction, weather extremes, and risks to food supply, health and economic growth.” As global emissions from fuel combustion were 30.5 Gt in 2010, that means emissions would have to decline to 16.78 Gt, or 15.5 Gt from 2016 levels, by 2030.Virtually all major authorities that publish analyses of global energy supply, demand and emissions project emissions to grow, not decline, by 2030. However, even if all economic and emissions growth could somehow be reduced to 2016 levels and frozen there until 2030, the emissions from the non-OECD countries alone (i.e. 20.7 Gt) would exceed the level that the IPCC claims must be the global maximum by 2030.In other words, even if the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada and all the other 36 countries of the OECD ceased to exist and did not emit one gram of GHGs by 2030, the IPCC goal would not be met. When no “target” short of oblivion would align with the IPCC’s analysis of the needed emissions reduction, the OECD countries either must question the IPCC’s analysis and objectives, or take a far more jaded approach to setting domestic targets and incurring large emission reduction costs.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['GHG reduction targets'],2019/03/24

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/03/19/rebutting-yahoo-finance-canadian-oil-sands-stocks-alive-and-well-despite-exxons-nysexom-as-yet-projected-production-cost-targets/,,Rebutting Yahoo Finance: Canadian Oil Sands Stocks Alive and Well – Despite Exxon’s (NYSE:XOM) as yet Projected Production Cost Targets," by Robert Lyman and Michelle Stirling ©2019On March 18, 2019, in Yahoo Finance, Ryan Vanzo filed a report claiming Exxon’s production target costs meant Canadian oil sands stock were ‘dead’.  However, his article was filled with flaws about global oil markets, supply and demand, according to Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior. Lyman notes that Vanzo reported one significant fact, which is that Exxon Mobil has set a goal (not yet attained) of reducing crude oil production costs in the Permian Basin to U.S. $15 per barrel. The Permian Basin is the area that has most benefited from the application of fracking technology, and has caused total U.S. oil production to double from 8 million barrels per day in 2010 to 16 million barrels per day in 2018. The International Energy Agency projects U.S. crude oil production to continue growing by 3.7 million barrels per day to 2023. This is undoubtedly a major addition to world oil supply, and has made it possible to satisfy the continuing steady growth in global oil demand which reached al all-time high of 100 million barrels per day in 2018. Lyman goes on to explain that Vanzo then leaps to a completely unjustified conclusion about the economic viability of Canadian oil sands production. The best way to view the world’s oil production is as coming from hundreds of different sources that vary in quality and cost, which the most important differences being between heavy and light crudes and conventional and non-conventional (i.e. tight oil, oil sands, and offshore production) crudes. These can be portrayed by a rising cost curve, or more accurately a series of cost curves for crudes of different quality. There have always been crudes that have a low cost of production and those with a high cost of production, with the marketability of the higher cost sources depending on demand trends. The Permian Basin oil is light crude, which competes with light crudes from all other places, but notably the Middle East. Oil sands crude is mostly heavy crude that competes with heavy crudes from many other sources, notably Venezuela. In other words, most Canadian oil sands crude does not compete with U.S. light crude oil produced from the Permian Basin. It competes with all the other sources of crude oil production in the world in meeting a seemingly voracious demand still growing at the rate of over 1.2 million barrels per day. Various parties are publishing stories in the media which appear to be throwing up a lot of diversionary reports these days the objective of which seem to be to suggest that it is not the present federal and Alberta government policies on carbon taxes, pipeline regulation, and climate that are impeding oil sands development. This, it seems, is both self-justification and an attempt to influence the the forthcoming Alberta provincial election, and perhaps the Canadian federal election. Neither investors nor Albertan nor Canadian voters should be fooled. Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society points out that, furthermore, investors and members of the public should be aware of the concerted anti-fossil fuel and Tar Sands Campaign waged by foreign green billionaires, with the objective of pushing global cap and trade, a price on carbon and their vested interest in renewables.  The vast scope of this campaign was reported on by Matthew Nisbet in 2018 in a peer-reviewed study, a summary of which is here.  This multi-million dollar, decade-long green trade war waged particularly against the Alberta oil sands in Canada, has shaken investor, insurer and bank confidence, primarily due to unrelenting attacks on the oil sands waged by green-billionaire-bankrolled environmental groups (aka “Tar Sands Campaign”). Part of this campaign appears to include that of the CDP and their damning Nov. 2016 report “In the Pipeline” which scared off some of the climate and carbon-risk obsessed institutional investors who are signatory to the UNPRI. So if you are an oil sands stock owner, says Stirling, if you are going to think twice, perhaps you should be thinking twice about who is behind the dramatic drop in share value and pipeline Blockadia and what is their end game.  World oil demand continues to rise.  Why is Canada the only market in the world facing this green trade war?  Maybe we should do something about it.– 30 –Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior to that.  Michelle Stirling is Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society and a member of the Canadian Association of Journalists and the AAAS. RELATED:Money Matters: The ENGO Political Advantage Money Matters: The ENGO Political AdvantageBig Green Money vs Conventional Energy Advocateshttps://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-1.pdf Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'climate change', 'Crude Oil', 'oil sands', 'Tar Sands Campaign']",2019/03/19

This war party resembles the three-hound of Hades, Cerberus, the capture of which comprised Heracles’s twelfth and final labor.The hellish hound’s most horrifying head is Trump’s foreign affairs camarilla. Deep state mavens John Bolton and Elliot Abrams habitually monger unilateral pre-emptive aggression. Cerberus’s much discussed, but toothless, second head is a US oil industry craving Venezuelan oil. The beast’s never discussed, but decisive, third head consists of a Democratic Party/EU coalition wedded to the petroleum phase-out initiative (a.k.a. Climate Change). They too covet Venezuelan oilfields; however, they do not want to develop them. They want to keep that oil below the soil.ContentsKeep it in the GroundThe Steam Injection Oil Extraction RevolutionSteaming the OrinocoWhy the Orinoco remains undevelopedThe EU’s petroleum phase-out passes the point of no returnA Democrat-EU alliance mongers the Venezuela WarConquering Venezuela isn’t feasible; creating a ‘Somalia on the Caribbean’ is.Keep it in the GroundThe Climate Change campaign is a smoke-screen for a fossil fuel phase-out initiative that arose in response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo. This perturbance prompted Western governments to commit to replacing petroleum as an energy source. Original propagandists sang “Energy Crisis” and “Peak Oil” refrains. Adherents, fortified by consensus science, claimed oil reserves were exhausted hence fuel taxes had to be imposed and oil substitutes incentivised.By the early-1980s it became obvious oil reserves remained abundant as oil extraction technologies expanded the volume of recoverable oil. Peak Oil sat upon a dusty shelf of cracked pots. In the mid-1980s petroleum phase-out planners pivoted toward claiming CO2 emissions from oil burning catastrophically overheated the atmosphere.While not as successful as the coal phase-out, the petroleum phase-out manifests in: carbon taxes; fuel emissions standards; mandatory bio-fuel blending; and vehicle electrification subsidies.For their part, front-line petroleum phase-out activists protest and litigate against oil extraction and pipeline construction. Prime targets are modern extraction methods like fracking.Obstruction of oil extraction dates to 1970s efforts to thwart drilling in Alaska’s National Wildlife Refuge, and conterminous hindrances of oil leasing in the US West. The pretext was protecting wildlife. Circa 2005 anti-petroleum campaigns ramped up; concentrating on unconventional oil. Blockading the Dakota Access Pipeline to throttle the Bakken Field shale oil bonanza, is one example.Another example is the Alberta oilsands siege. Through de-marketing, blockades, litigation and lobbying, campaigners stopped three pipelines and delayed two. Campaigners lobbied into place anti-oilsands: carbon levies, conservation requirements, and production caps. While campaigners deploy multiple pretexts, “global warming” is their main line. The Keystone XL oilsands pipeline was temporarily stymied by Obama who deemed its carbon footprint too large.A 2016 Keep it in the Ground web-proclamation declares that carbon embedded in fossil fuel reserves exceeds the climate’s carrying capacity:“Therefore, we, as over 400 civil society organisations… call on world leaders to put an immediate halt to new fossil fuel development.”Signatories included Global Catholic Climate Movement, Lutheran World Federation, Food and Water Watch, Rainforest Action Network, Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth; and focussed anti-oil extraction NGOs like: 350.org, Greenpeace, Oil Change International, and Fossil Free Europe.350.org was founded in 2007 by career climate alarmist Bill McKibben. (350 ppm is the atmospheric concentration of CO2 deemed safe by alarmist supremo James Hansen.) 350.org’s debut mobilization, the anti-Keystone XL campaign, drew support from National Resource Defense Council and Sierra Club. 350.org later obstructed the Energy East and Trans Mountain oilsands pipelines.350.org has 300 partner groups, 200 chapters, and 100 staff missioned to “stop all new coal, oil and gas projects.” On October 24, 2009, 350.org orchestrated 5,000 simultaneous demonstrations. Half 350.org’s $15 million annual budget comes from foundations.350.org’s Do the Math video claims humanities “carbon budget” (565 GT) is dwarfed by the carbon in fossil fuels reserves (2795 GT). Our only option is: “keep it in the ground.”In 2015 Nature magazine did the math; concluding that the 2 Celsius goal requires limiting mid-century CO2 emissions to 1,100 GT. As fossil fuel reserves possess thrice this:“…development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 C.”The New York Times, International Energy Agency and Obama endorsed Nature’s math.Greenpeace International’s mantra is “keep oil in the ground.” Greenpeace USA’s Keep it in the Ground webpage sermonises:“To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to keep the world’s remaining fossil fuels in the ground.”Fossil Free Europe consists of several dozen European student activist clubs. Their social media flutters with tales of student climate strikes. They oppose oil extraction.Oil Change International (OCI, est. 2005) boasts 200,000 supporters and 16 staff. Tides, Rockefeller Brothers and Hewlett provide funding. Sierra Club Executive Director, Michael Brune graces OCI’s board. OCI disseminates anti-oil propaganda while coordinating pipeline resistance. They express particular animosity toward “extreme fossil fuels” i.e. Venezuelan heavy oil.Innumerable lesser outfits round-out the field. Nigeria-based Oil Watch links to 50 anti-extraction groups from the Global South. Their motto is “keep oil in the soil.” Oil is the “devil’s excrement.”Leave it in the Ground Organization (LINGO) was launched at COP17 (2011, Durban). LINGO is a hub for scores of “extraction resistance initiatives” many of which engage in direct action.Better-heeled, but none-the-less committed to arresting oil extraction, are the financial specialists and tweedy profs drawn to Fossil Fuel Climate Conferences (FFCC); the second of which enlivened Oxford in 2018. KR Foundation, Stockholm Environment Institute, and International Institute on Sustainable Development are FFCC partners. Their goal is re-focussing climate policy onto restricting fossil fuel supply.Hostility to oil extraction is a prime impulse behind the divestment crusade. 1,029 institutional investors (churches, pensions, philanthropies and universities) worth $8.1 trillion, have committed to divesting from oil, coal and/or gas. Most are divesting from all three industries while dozens are divesting only from “tar sands” – betraying specific animosity to heavy oil.350.org boasts ongoing divestment agitations inside 308 universities and 105 city and state governments across the USA.In 2015 Guardian editor-in-chief, Alan Rusberger, launched a divestment agitation aimed at Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust. This Keep it in the Ground online community’s 210,000 members organise petitions, public appeals and tweet-storms. Their message to Bill Gates is:“Climate change poses a real threat to all of us, and it is morally and financially misguided to invest in companies dedicated to finding and burning oil, gas and coal.Guardian virtuoso George Monbiot kicked-off this initiative with an article bemoaning how climate campaigners address the problem from the wrong end. Restraining fuel consumption must yield to suppressing fuel extraction. Lowering demand without curbing supply merely lowers prices to the benefit of carbon intensive activity.The Steam Injection Oil Extraction RevolutionWhile much is heard of fracking; steam injection is the petroleum industry game-changer. Steam aids in harvesting of oils too viscous to be worked by conventional pumps.Initially, heavy oil was extracted via open-pit mining with giant shovels heaving mounds of oil-saturated sand onto dump-trucks for transit to separating vats of hot water. This has largely given way to steam injection. Alberta’s oilsands oil is now 80% extracted via steam injection.The simplest steam injection process uses a single well. A hole is drilled down to a heavy oil deposit; then steam is pumped down the hole, sometimes for months. Eventually oil concentrates near the well’s bottom of sufficient viscosity to enable pumping to the surface.SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) emerged 1978. Here, two lengthy perforated pipes are drilled horizontally through the deposit; one a few metres above the other. Both pipes emit steam until a teardrop shaped oil bubble envelopes the lower pipe. Then the top pipe continues to emit steam while the lower pipe draws oil to the surface. In 2017 Alberta’s oilsands yielded 2.7 million barrels a day; mostly via SAGD.Three innovations are coming.Solvent-Assisted SAGD adds chemicals to the steam injection process to further loosen-up the oil.Downhole Steam Generation lowers cylindrical furnaces down the well to improve heat conservation and fuel economy.Toshiba offers a miniature nuclear reactor specifically for heavy oil extraction. This 5 MW electricity generator simultaneously serves as the furnace for a 900 Celsius boiler. Reactors will render obsolete the expensive natural gas systems now used in steam injection.Steaming the OrinocoThe world’s fourth largest river, the Orinoco, rises in the Parima Mountains along the Venezuelan-Brazilian border then engraves a 2,000 kilometre north-easterly arc through Colombia before discharging into the Atlantic off Venezuela’s coast. The Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt stretches 600 kilometres along the north bank of the Orinoco’s easterly dash to the sea. The Belt is 70 kilometers wide.US Geological Service’s Estimate of Recoverable Oil Reserves of the Orinoco Oil Belt (2009) estimates “oil-in-place” to be up to 1.4 trillion barrels. Maximum “technically recoverable” oil is estimated at 652 billion barrels. Elsewhere the report speculates that fully exploiting SAGD might extract 70% of oil-in-place. The report relies on dated studies hence does not contemplate: Solvent-Assisted SAGD; Downhole Steam Generation; let alone nuclear power. Tackling Orinoco with these technologies should yield a trillion barrels.The report does not explore production costs. Canadian oilsands companies kept producing in 2018 after transportation bottlenecks tanked prices to $20 barrel. The business press guesstimates the breakeven price for Alberta oilsands to be around $30 a barrel.The Orinoco Belt has advantages over Alberta’s oilsands: a) its oil is lighter; b) its climate is hotter; and c) its closer to a coast. The Orinoco Belt sits at 9 degrees latitude. Its entire span is a few hundred kilometres from Atlantic shores. Orinoco production costs will be lower than Alberta’s oilsands.Global oil consumption is 35 billion barrels a year. The Orinoco alone could satisfy 100% of global demand for 30 years!Known global heavy oil reserves exceed 8 trillion barrels. The Orinoco will be another heavy oil recovery laboratory. As with Alberta, breakthroughs in the Orinoco will travel the world.Why the Orinoco remains undevelopedThe Orinoco remains undeveloped because Venezuela, the quintessential OPEC nation, possesses sufficient conventional (non-Orinoco) oil to meet its OPEC quota.OPEC (est. 1960) is Venezuela’s baby. Venezuela was one of five founding members. Venezuelans drafted OPEC’s charter. Venezuela drifted from the cartel in the 1980s but OPEC hawk President Chavez (r. 1999-2013) slashed production and adhered to quota. Between 2004 and 2015 production flat-lined at 2.4 million barrels a day (mbd) while Chavez circled Earth imploring OPEC comrades to maintain solidarity.Orinoco drilling began in the late-1990s. Circa 2010 Venezuelans contradicted their OPEC stance by luring investors with talk of raising Orinoco output to 4 mbd. Two dozen companies cumulatively pledged $200 billion. China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) committed $16 billion to three Orinoco ventures. Sinopec inked a $14 billion contract. A Russian consortium made huge commitments. Chevron, Matsui, Eni, Equinor, Petronas plus firms from Brazil, Argentina and South Africa signed Orinoco deals; …almost entirely for naught.Venezuelan’s state-owned oil monopoly (a partner in all ventures) systematically missed production targets. Pipelines and upgraders, needed to precede drilling, went unbuilt. Venezuela rarely provided its share of investment. Many firms pulled out complaining of: delays; inscrutable decision-making; and arbitrary ownership changes.Venezuela’s Plan A was: preserve OPEC. If OPEC failed Plan B sought to maintain revenues from the Orinoco. For Plan B to work shovel-ready projects had to be in place. Companies had to be strung along pending resolution of Plan A; even at risk of souring relations.Despite the current crisis (caused by low prices and economic warfare) the Orinoco is developing. CNPC’s Orinoco operation produces 130,000 b/d. A Chevron-led operation pumps 150,000 b/d of Orinoco crude. When this crisis passes an Orinoco volcano erupts.The EU’s petroleum phase-out passes the point of no return“Climate Change” means “European energy independence.” Europe imports $500 billion in fossil fuels annually.Electric vehicles (EVs, fully electric and hybrid) are Europe’s salvation. EVs are a pillar of the Climate Industrial Complex. The global EV industry earns $100 billion annually. This white elephant becomes farcically un-economical in the face of the coming tsunami of cheap oil.To aid the EV industry European governments are phasing out gasoline and diesel power vehicles. Germany will begin banning internal combustion engines in 2030. Scotland will ban new gasoline and diesel vehicle sales starting 2032. French and British bans begin in 2040. Austria, Denmark, Portugal and Spain have similar plans.An estimated 50 million EVs will cruise the world’s roads by 2030; many of those in Europe. Half of Norway’s new car sales are EVs. Volvo’s 2019 line-up is all EV. BMW is following suit.EVs are impractical without elaborate re-charging networks. Across Europe tens of thousands of charging points are constructed annually at enormous public expense. This transformative infrastructure mega-project requires separate grids and massive increases in electricity supply. The decision to go down the EV path will not be easily reversed.To accentuate his petroleum phase-out resolve Macron decreed an end to oil extraction across France and French overseas territories. This symbolic decree (France imports 99% of its oil) treats oil extraction like a scourge. Macron anticipates such declarations spreading EU-wide.A Democrat-EU alliance mongers the Venezuela WarIn 2014 a Democrat-led Senate passed the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act. This legislation, sponsored by Robert Menendez (Democrat-NJ), sanctioned Venezuela government officials and supported Venezuelan oppositionists. The Act sought to meet “the information needs of the Venezuelan people” through publications and broadcasts and through the “distribution of circumvention technology.” Obama signed immediately.In 2015 Obama declared: “a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States presented by the situation in Venezuela.”Days before Trump’s inauguration Obama renewed this declaration.At this time the US deep state played conductor to an orchestra of American and European agencies and foundations then disbursing $50 million yearly to Venezuelan politicians, activists and journalists. Key agencies were: USAID, National Endowment for Democracy, and (Democratic Party-affiliated) National Democratic Institute. Key foundations were: (Jimmy) Carter Centre, Soros’s Open Society and several government-linked German and Spanish concerns.The Democrat’s war drive survived Obama’s departure.On January 4, 2019 a Democrat-led House of Representatives swore in. On January 10 House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair, Eliot Engel (D-NY) said he would waste no time holding “Mr. Maduro” accountable. Simultaneously, former DNC Chair and Hillary Clinton “fixer”, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL) unveiled her Venezuelan-Russian Threat Mitigation Act. Debbie was flanked by former Clinton cabinet member and Clinton Foundation President, Donna Shalala (D-FL) who announced her Venezuelan Arms Restriction Act to prevent weapons sales, including non-lethal police gear, to Venezuela. Next up was Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL), sponsor of the Venezuelan Humanitarian Assistance Act aimed at allowing US operatives to bypass Venezuelan authorities and distribute “aid” directly to Venezuelans.EU powers ratcheted up sanctions against Venezuela in 2017. They pooh-poohed Venezuela’s 2018 elections and warned Maduro against inauguration. They unanimously boycotted his inauguration and quickly endorsed his auto-proclaimed rival Juan Guaido. As with Liberal Party-led Canada, EU countries were not being dragged into this by Trump. They moved swiftly and autonomously; sometimes ahead of Trump’s administration.Conquering Venezuela isn’t feasible; creating a ‘Somalia on the Caribbean’ is.Venezuela’s ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) regularly garners several million votes in national elections. A million PSUVers participate in candidate selection and platform drafting. PSUV’s 50,000 neighborhood councils hold meetings, elect representatives and lobby governments. PSUV auxiliaries, the “collectivos,” boasts thousands of paramilitaries. Relatively, PSUV is a larger more consolidated socio-political bloc than either the US Republicans or UK Conservatives.The PSUV’s Great Housing Mission constructed 2.5 million apartments therewith endowing a quarter of Venezuelans with dignified, affordable housing. Rural land reform and related programs earned PSUV support from small farmers and agricultural labourers.Venezuela’s armed forces have 350,000 personnel including 150,000 ground troops; but they are not who American war planners fear.To deter coups and invasions, PSUV launched the Milicia Nacional Bolivariana (MNB) in 2009. 400,000 civilians routinely engage in MNB training. President Maduro recently announced plans to increase MNB to 1.6 million; “armed to the teeth.”Anticipating US invasion Bolivarian doctrine emphasises asymmetrical warfare centered on heavy infantry. MNB will bring to battle thousands of mortars and recoilless rifles – each towable behind cars. Maduro loyalists possess a myriad of infantry portable anti-armour weapons; and 5,000 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles of a design that downed a score of US helicopters in Iraq. These weapons compliment 300,000 assault rifles; mostly AK103s. (Venezuela’s AK103 factory should be operational soon.) Venezuelan arsenals contain 45,000 sniper rifles.If bombed out of the cities the Bolivarians will retreat into a galaxy of rural cooperatives populated by compatriots skilled in that crucial guerrilla warfare technique: farming.US forces may make short work of Venezuela’s air force, navy and armour; but they will not quickly vanquish its infantry. They may make inroads on the ground but the likelihood of them creating conditions needed for exploiting the Orinoco seems remote.Conversely, through naval blockades, and close air support of mercenary brigades, Western powers may do unto Venezuela what they did to Syria, Afghanistan and Libya i.e. demolish vital infrastructure leaving a no-man’s land in their wake. A ‘Somalia on the Caribbean’ jibes with the petroleum phase-out agenda. Orinoco’s treasure will stay buried.ConclusionTwo tethered masses move in opposing directions. At one end several of the world’s most powerful political parties seek to banish petroleum with EVs, biofuels and electric rail. At the other end a petroleum extraction industry hones fracking, steam injection and off-shore drilling technology to conjure a cornucopia of cheap oil. While Venezuelans and their allies rejoice in the Orinoco’s bounty; petroleum phase-out policymakers, and their climate alarmist cheerleaders, gaze with dread upon maps of the Orinoco muttering: “keep it in the ground.”Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Venezuela']",2019/03/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/03/16/brazilian-scientists-demand-an-evidence-based-climate-agenda-for-the-real-interests-of-society/,,Brazilian Scientists Demand an Evidence-based Climate Agenda for the Real Interests of Society," For an evidence-based climate agenda and the real interests of society(translation of original, from the signatories)Open letter to the Minister of the Environment, Ricardo de Aquino SallesCc:– Your Honor Mr. Antônio Hamilton Martins Mourão – Vice President of the Republic;– Your Honor Mr. Marcos Cesar Pontes – Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications;– Your Honor Mr. Bento Costa Lima Leite de Albuquerque Júnior – Minister of Mines and Energy;– Your Honor Ms. Tereza Cristina Corrêa da Costa Dias – Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply;– Your Honor Mr. Gustavo Henrique Rigodanzo Canuto – Minister of Regional Development;– Your Honor Mr. Tarcisio Gomes de Freitas – Minister of Infrastructure;– Your Honor Mr. Fernando Azevedo e Silva – Minister of Defense;– Your Honor Mr. Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira – Chief Minister of the Institutional Security Office;– Your Honor Mr. Ernesto Henrique Fraga Araújo – Minister of Foreign Affairs. Your Honor Mr. Ricardo de Aquino Salles: The positions expressed by Your Honor in several interviews, before and after assuming the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), reinforce the expectation that its management may represent a decisive turning point in the orientation of Brazilian environmental policy, aiming at confronting the real problems of the Country and the performance of the MMA as a catalyst for synergistic actions with the other organs of public administration, as well as promoting an objective, pragmatic and non-ideological vision of environmental issues in society in general.In this context, the present signatories reiterate that the discussions and formulation of public policies on climate issues have been predominantly based on mistaken and narrow ideological, political, economic and academic motivations, not only from the basic principles of practice but also of the larger interests of society.It is noticeable that the extension of such interests and the international commitments assumed by the country to the “decarbonization” agenda of the world economy makes any abrupt attempt to reorient the national climate agenda, outside the “anthropogenic” scenario of climate change, to generate opposition from the sectors articulated around this scenario, including the powerful international environmental movement and a large part of the media, with considerable influence on internal and external public opinion.Nevertheless, some necessary course corrections are feasible in order to give a higher priority to certain initiatives of fundamental importance, both within the MMA and other ministries, to provide an effective improvement of the knowledge of the climate dynamics and an increase the general ability of society to cope with the most diverse meteorological and climatic phenomena that have always occurred in the past and will continue to occur in the future. We are convinced that such initiatives would represent better applications for much of the human and financial resources that have been mistakenly targeted for and depleted with the decarbonization agenda, particularly the National Climate Change Fund.Therefore, we offer you the following considerations, with the expectation that they may provide relevant subsidies for the MMA’s performance, taking advantage of the opportunity to formulate votes for success in its management. 1) There is no physical evidence of human influence on the global climateIn strictly scientific terms, the climatic question can be summed up in a single paragraph:Changes are the fundamental feature of climate, as evidenced by the evidence for the Earth’s entire geological history – that is, the climate is always changing (hence the term “climate change” becomes a pleonasm). As to the alleged human influence on the global climate, supposedly attributed to the emissions of carbon compounds from human activities, it would have to amplify the (gradient) rates of atmospheric and oceanic temperatures and sea levels recorded since the Industrial Revolution XVIII century. As there is no observed physical evidence that these latter variations are anomalous, relative to those recorded earlier, in the historical and geological past, simply, the human influence hypothesis cannot be proved in spite of all the fussing in this sense.All the prognoses that indicate exaggerated elevations of sea temperatures and sea levels in the coming decades, as well as other negative impacts attributed to the release of “anthropogenic” carbon into the atmosphere, are based on projections of mathematical models, which are only very limited simplifications of the climate system. Therefore, such alarmist scenarios should not be used to support public policies and long-range strategies with large socio-economic impacts, both nationally and globally.The human influence on the climate is restricted to the urban areas and their surroundings (the known effect of the “heat islands”), being these impacts very localized and without influence in the planetary scale.According to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR5 / IPCC) released in 2014, global average temperatures increased by 0.85 °C in the period 1880-2012, while average sea level rose by 0.19 m between 1901 and 2010.Now, even within the period of existence of humanity, there are records of much more marked numbers. Throughout the Holocene, the geological epoch corresponding to the last 11,700 years when human civilization has developed, there have been several periods with higher temperatures than today. In the Middle Holocene, 6,000-8,000 years ago, average temperatures were 2 °C to 3 °C above current levels, while sea levels reached up to 3 meters above current levels. Similarly, in the hot periods known as Minoan (1500-1200 BC), Roman (III BC-V AD) and Medieval (XIV-XIII AD), average temperatures of the planet were between 1-2 °C higher than current. And paleoclimatic data (ice cylinders from Vostok station, Antarctica) suggest that Earth’s temperatures were already 6 °C to 10 °C higher than the current ones, in the last three interglacial ones there are about 150,000, 240,000 and 320 thousand years ago.Between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago, in the cold period called Recent Dryas, atmospheric temperatures dropped by around 8 °C in less than 50 years, and by the end of that year they rose again in the same proportion in just over half a century.As for sea level, it rose about 120 meters, between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago, which equates to an average rate of 1 meter per century, fast enough to visually impact the successive generations of populations living on the continental shores. In the period between 14,650 and 14,300 years ago, there are records of an even faster rise, reaching about 14 meters in only 350 years, averaging 4 meters per century.In other words, such variations represent values ​​greater than an order of magnitude to observations made since the nineteenth century. Therefore, the latter fall well within the range of natural oscillations of climatic parameters and therefore cannot be attributed to the use of fossil fuels or to any other type of activity linked to human development.Although evidence such as these can be found in literally thousands of studies conducted on every continent by scientists from dozens of countries, duly published in the international scientific literature (see, e.g., the excellent site http://www.co2science.org), it is rare for any of these studies to have repercussions in the media, often more inclined to promote a sensationalist and disorienting alarmism. 2) The hypothesis of “anthropogenic” warming is a disservice to science and a risk to public policiesGood scientific practice presupposes a correspondence between working hypotheses and observed data that prove them. The “anthropogenic” climate change hypothesis is not based on physical evidence observed in the real world, since in the past, high temperatures occurred with low concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and vice versa. In addition, according to satellite data, the average global temperature (if any) has been stable over the past 20 years, although CO₂ emissions have increased by more than 11% over the same period. Therefore, despite the fact that a certain number of scientists have been added, their construction passes away from scientific methodology and the insistence on its preservation represents a great disservice to Science and its necessary placing in the service of the well-being of humanity.History records numerous examples of the ill effects of linking science to ideologies and other narrow interests. The prevailing commitment to imposing the “anthropogenic” hypothesis without the corresponding evidence has cost humanity dearly, in human, technical, and economic resources wasted with a nonexistent problem. Brazil is not unaware of this situation. On the contrary, there is an unreasonable commitment in the country to place it in a questionable position of “leadership” in the international negotiations on the climate.It is worth remembering that a number of leading countries have expressed contentious positions on the political guidelines based on such an unfounded hypothesis, in order to mitigate their impacts on their respective national economies.In addition, by giving CO₂ and other gases produced by human activities the role of climate dynamics players, the “anthropogenic” hypothesis simplifies and distorts extremely complex natural processes in which astrophysical, atmospheric, oceanic, geological, geomorphological and biological factors interact, which science only begins to understand in its scope and is still very far from being able to represent them in reliable mathematical models.Incidentally, the alleged 2 °C limit for raising temperatures above pre-industrial levels, which supposedly could not be surmounted and justified all the proposed restrictions on fossil fuels at international level, has no basis scientific basis. It is a “political” creation of physicist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research (PIK) and scientific advisor to the German government, as he himself admitted in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, published 10/17/2010.An example of the risks of this simplification to the formulation of relevant public policies is the real possibility that the period until the 2030s will experience considerable cooling of the atmosphere rather than heating due to the combined effect of a cycle of low solar activity (Cycle 25), the cooling phase of the Pacific Ocean (Pacific Decadal Oscillation-ODP), in a scenario similar to that observed between 1947 and 1976, and the trend of increasing global cloud coverage over the last 16 years. It is worth noting that, in that period, Brazil experienced a 10-30% reduction in rainfall, which caused problems of water supply and electricity generation, in addition to an increase in strong frosts, which contributed, for example, to eradicating cultivation of coffee in western Paraná. If such conditions are repeated in the immediate future, the country could have serious problems, including in the areas of expansion of the agricultural frontier of the Midwest, North and Northeast regions, and hydroelectric generation (particularly considering the proliferation of reservoirs of water “, imposed by the environmental restrictions of the last decades). 3) Obsession with CO₂ diverts attentions and resources from actual emergenciesThe sun, water and CO₂ are essential for photosynthesis and for life as we know it on planet Earth. That is, CO₂ is not a pollutant, but the gas of life!In addition, the obsession with reducing CO₂ emissions has led to an undesirable diversion of human and financial resources and attention from the real environmental problems affecting society today, whose solutions require public initiatives and investments and the awareness of broad social sectors. Not to stretch, some of the main ones are mentioned:– The lack of access to basic sanitation networks for more than 100 million Brazilians; about 34 million do not have access to treated water and only 45% of the sewage collected has some type of treatment, which generates losses estimated at R $ 56 billion per year, according to the “Trata Brasil” Institute.– Although a little more than 91% of the waste generated in the country is collected regularly, 41% of the solid waste collected is destined for inadequate landfills and landfills, generating large public health impacts, aquifer and water pollution and other problems (acc. to Panorama of Solid Waste in Brazil 2017).– According to the IBGE, 8.27 million people in 872 municipalities live in areas of risk – slopes, river floodplains and other unsuitable land for housing (Population in risk areas in Brazil, 2018).Unfortunately, despite their seriousness and urgency of confrontation, such problems are often not perceived as “environmental” by a considerable part of society and therefore do not receive even a fraction of the attention and publicity usually devoted to climate issues. 4) Better knowledge and greater resilienceInstead of the alarmism about global warming and the pseudo-panaceas “low carbon”, the climate agenda would have much to gain from a reorientation of priorities, favoring: a) a better understanding of the dynamics of the climate, with emphasis on paleoclimatic studies of the territory Brazilian; and (b) an increase in society’s resilience in dealing with extreme weather events and any future climate trends.The study of the climatic changes of the historical and geological past (paleo-climate) constitutes the most solid basis for the understanding of the climatic dynamics and its projections for the future. Particular attention should be given to the Quaternary period (the last 2.6 million years), in which the genus Homo has emerged and evolved. Within the Quaternary, the last 800,000 years have been marked by a succession of colder cycles, with an average duration of 90-100,000 years, and interglacial (warmer), with an average duration of 10-12 thousand years. Today, the planet is in an interglacial phase, beginning about 11,700 years ago, within which all human civilization has developed. Significantly, at least the previous three interglacial were warmer than the current one, and there is no evidence that the interglacial present can fail to be succeeded by a new glaciation. The most accepted explanation for the factors causing this dynamic is based on changes in cyclically-varying earth orbital parameters such as changes in the inclination of the axis of rotation and in the shape of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Therefore, it is evident that man is incapable of causing any minute influence on the cosmic factors and forces that govern it.In Brazil, Quaternary studies, although important and the existence of a reasonable number of research institutions and researchers dedicated to them, are still sparse and insufficient to allow the configuration of a paleoclimatic picture of the national territory and its continental environment, with the necessary depth to subsidize a consistent model of climate change to be defined for the country, that can provide relevant data to subsidize a global model more in keeping with reality. Therefore, this is a gap that needs to be considered in formulating a truly useful climate agenda, in which the MMA could act in consonance with the specific bodies of the MME and MCTIC. In addition, there is a need for local and regional studies, intermediates between the global / zonal and point scales of microclimates, which are of great importance for planning and territorial planning and should receive greater attention.As for resilience, this can be understood as the flexibility of the physical conditions of survival and functioning of society, as well as its capacity to respond to emergencies, allowing it to reduce its vulnerability to extreme weather phenomena, climatic oscillations and other natural phenomena which have occurred in the past and will certainly occur in the future.In this regard, two sets of factors stand out that contribute to reduce the vulnerability of society to meteorological and climatic adversities:a) an improvement in national weather forecasting capacity;b) the stimulation of research related to new advanced energy sources.In the first item, a key initiative would be to take the role of the project of a geostationary meteorological satellite of its own, essential for a country that occupies half of South America and has the responsibility of distributing meteorological information on a large part of the South Atlantic Ocean (the so-called METAREA-V) in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).Other relevant initiatives include:– the expansion and better territorial distribution of the network of meteorological stations, lower than the standards recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for a territory with the Brazilian dimension, with special emphasis on the work being developed by the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET);– increasing the number of meteorological radars and their interconnection with civil defense systems;– speeding up the consolidation of the national meteorological data base, part of which has not yet been digitized;– the establishment of a more efficient network for the dissemination of meteorological and oceanographic data to METAREA-V.The second item highlights the establishment of research lines for new energy sources, such as the use of thorium in nuclear reactors, nuclear fusion (with concepts that will be commercially available over the next decade) and sources based on new physical principles , such as chemically assisted nuclear reactions (so-called “cold fusion”), quantum vacuum energy (or “zero point”), and others, objects of research and development in several countries, but practically ignored in the country, which cannot give the luxury of being oblivious to them. For such research, Brazil has the necessary qualified human resources, distributed among academic research centers, state companies (Cenpes, Cepel, etc.), military personnel (IME, CTA, CTEx, IPqM) and some private technology companies. With regard to renewable sources, solar energy can be exploited, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast, but not with photovoltaic systems, of proven inefficiency, but with solar power (CSP), in particular those of parabolic troughs , in addition to the production of liquid fuels from algae and hydrogen from hydrogenase (reversible oxidation catalytic hydrogen molecular enzyme).All of these initiatives could benefit from the availability of some of the financial resources that have been allocated to programs linked to climate change along the wrong approach to reducing carbon emissions.An additional set of initiatives relevant to “climate resilience” involves physical infrastructure, in particular, food storage capacity, transport infrastructure, energy and communications, as well as other topics not directly within the scope of MMA, but potentially influenced Ministry’s guidelines and programs.In summary, the most rational and efficient way to increase society’s resilience in the face of inevitable climatic changes – warming or cooling – is the general elevation of their levels of human development and progress to the levels allowed by Science and the advancement of knowledge and the process of innovation. 5) “Decarbonization” is unnecessary and deleteriousSince “anthropogenic” carbon emissions do not produce verifiable impacts on the global climate, the entire “decarbonization” or “low carbon economy” agenda becomes unnecessary and counterproductive – indeed, it is a pseudo-solution to a problem nonexistent, at least as far as the climate is concerned (urban mobility incentive programs included in the Climate Fund, for example, justify themselves). The insistence on its preservation, by virtue of the inertia of the status quo, will not imply any effect on the climate, but will tend to deepen the many negative impacts of such guidelines.The main one is the unnecessary increase of a series of economic activities, due to:– subsidies for the exploitation of low-efficiency energy sources, such as wind and solar photovoltaic, already in decline in the European Union (EU), which invested heavily in them;– imposition of quotas and fees linked to carbon emissions, as the EU did to enable its carbon credits market, and countries such as Australia and France, where the great popular rejection forced its withdrawal;– imposing on various economic activities carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) measures that are totally useless from a climate and public health point of view, since CO₂ is not a toxic and polluting gas; It is worth to insist, it is the gas of life. The main beneficiaries of such measures have been speculators, equipment suppliers and CCS services and participants in the intrinsically useless carbon markets, which have no real economic basis and are based solely on an artificial demand created from a need nonexistent. 6) Looking at the futureFor the first time in history, mankind has a wealth of physical, technical and human knowledge and resources to provide the virtual totality of the material needs of an even larger population than today. This perspective makes it possible to universalize – in a fully sustainable way – the general levels of well-being enjoyed by the most advanced countries in terms of water infrastructure, sanitation, energy, transport, communications, health and education services and other achievements of modern civilized life. Despite the fallacious arguments against this perspective, the main obstacles to its realization, in less than two generations, are mental and political, not physical and environmental. Definitely, Brazilian environmental policy (including the climate agenda) needs to fit in with this perspective. Luiz Carlos Baldicero Molion(Retired) of the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), associate professor (retired) of the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), a professor of meteorology and postdoctoral researcher in Forest Hydrology, José Carlos Parente de OliveiraPhysicist, PhD in Physics and Post-Doctor in Atmospheric Physics, associate professor (retired) of the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), professor at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceará (IFCE) José Bueno ContiGeographer, PhD in Physical Geography and Professor of Climatology, Full Professor of the Geography Department of the University of São Paulo (USP) Fernando de Mello GomidePhysicist, titular professor (retired) of the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA) Ricardo Augusto FelícioMeteorologist, Master and Doctor in Climatology, Professor of the Department of Geography of the University of São Paulo (USP), member of the Brazilian Society of Meteorology (SBMET) Fúlvio CupolilloGeographer, Master’s in Applied Meteorology and PhD in Geography, Full Professor at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Minas Gerais (IFMG) Daniela de Souza OnçaGeographer, Master and PhD in Climatology, Professor of the Geography Department of the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC) Carlos Henrique JardimGeographer, master, doctor and postdoctor in Geography, professor of the Department of Geography of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Wellington Lopes AssisGeographer, Master and PhD in Geography, Professor of the Geography Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) João Bosco A. de MoraisGeologist, Master in Hydrogeology and PhD in Vulnerability of Aquifers, private consultant and advisor for the Environment of the Government of the State of Ceará Danilo Ericksen Costa CabralMeteorologist, Master’s in Meteorology, Executive Agency for Water Management of the State of Paraíba (AESA) Rômulo da Silveira PazMeteorologist, Master’s in Meteorology, PhD in Mechanical Engineering, Associate Professor, Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) Paulo Cesar Martins Pereira de Azevedo BrancoGeologist, senior researcher in Geosciences (retired) of the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM) Gildo Magalhães dos Santos FilhoElectronic Engineer, PhD in Social History and Professor of History of Science and Technology, Full Professor of the History Department of the University of São Paulo (USP) Thiago MaiaPhysicist, Master and PhD in Nuclear Physics and PhD in Astrophysics, petroleum engineer and private consultant Guilherme Polli RodriguesGeographer, Master in Climatology, environmental consultant Igor Vaz MaquieiraBiologist, specialist in Environmental Management Mario de Carvalho Fontes NetoAgronomist, editor of The Great Global Warming Swindle blog Richard JakubazskoJournalist, executive editor of Agro DBO magazine and co-author of the book CO₂ warming and climate change: are you kidding us?

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/03/16/parody-canadas-climate-refugee-plan/,,#Parody Canada’s Climate Refugee Plan," Gavin Schmidt tweeted that he liked a #ClimateStrike poster that read “Soon even moving to Canada isn’t going to solve our problems.”  That reminded us that we had a parody submission on the Canadian government’s tiered climate refugee program, that would at least be worth a laugh, if not serious consideration for some!!  See what you think.Introduction to the Climate Refugee PlansIf you are reading this, you are no doubt deeply concerned by the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Prognosticators of Climate Catastrophes (the “IPCC”), which confirms what the members of that panel have known since before their research began: humans have put just too darn much carbon dioxide into the air. Now, if the developed world spends trillions and trillions of dollars very quickly to completely destroy and then rebuild its energy infrastructure so as not to use any of those nasty fossil fuels, sends hundreds of billions of dollars in climate reparations to third-world dictators, and gives unelected officials sweeping powers to control our lives and redistribute wealth, the world just might be able to avert hotter (or perhaps colder) temperatures, more (or possibly less) snow, more (or possibly less) wind, more (or possibly fewer) hurricanes, too much rain or too little rain, stronger and more frequent (or maybe not) tornadoes, fewer dog-walking opportunities, reduced male fertility, and a whole bunch of unprecedented weather events just too nasty to think about. But what if our best efforts fail? What happens if spending a hundred trillion dollars or more does not limit the temperature increase to an arbitrary 1.5°C (which used to be an arbitrary 2°C) above the arbitrary baseline at an arbitrarily chosen level of CO₂ at a randomly selected point in Earth’s 4-billion-year history?  What if the gas you breathe out—the gas that plants turn into oxygen and that makes up a tiny fraction of all the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—is not the control knob for Earth’s temperature after all? What then?Well, we have good news for you! Canada’s Climate Refugee Plans™ are here.  Canada has come up with the following climate refugee plans that will save most of peoplekind™ from the ravages of there being just too much plant food in the air, causing plants to grow bigger and stronger and to inhabit areas where they just wouldn’t grow before. You can chose the plan that best matches your status in the world: the Climate Scientist Plan™, the Global Warming Journalist Plan™, the Tropical Islander’s Plan™, or the Everyone Else.  Well, almost everyone else: for the truly elite among you, we also have the Movie Star Plan™! Old stock Canucks need not despair, though, because Canada needs you, too: after all, who else could we get to pay for all of this?For the last few years, Canada has been busy laying the groundwork for our Climate Refugee Plans™.  There were pipelines to kill (two down, one to go), business competitiveness to destroy via punishing carbon taxes and/or threats thereof, terrorists to enrich, and drugs to legalize. Canada has not yet succeeded in pushing Canada’s emissions down to zero from a whopping 1.6% of the world’s total, but we are not done destroying the country’s economy yet—that could take more of the same climate policies.  We assume if elected again, the government’s primary environmental objectives are to legislate a complete ban on carbon dioxide in Canada’s airspace and to negotiate treaties with other nations to ensure that their carbon dioxide emissions do not enter Canada illegally.  (Illegal Irregular entry is reserved for refugees from the United States.)The LEAPers Climate Refugee Plan™https://theleap.org/The first 100 people who sign up for Canada’s Climate Refugee Plan™ will automatically be enrolled in the LEAPers Climate Refugee Plan™. This plan is reserved for those truly, truly special members of peoplekind who have an unquenchable desire to LEAP lead by example.One-way transportation will be provided by Fort McMurray truckers to you and 99 others to the northeast corner of Alberta, near the shores of Lake Athabasca—which just happens to be due north of… gasp!!… the Oil Sands!!  (Canada is not sure why, but a large number of Canadians who normally complain about excessive taxation have volunteered to contribute to the cost of transporting LEAPers to their new home.)  What makes the LEAP Climate Refugee Plan™ truly special is that the trip in by truck will be your last-ever contact with those nasty fossil fuels and the horrors of combustion.  Living just outside Wood Buffalo National Park, you can both survive and demonstrate your commitment to reducing methane emissions by culling the area’s large bison population by hunting with sticks, stones, and your bare hands. (Steel, of course, requires combustion.) You can supplement your diet by catching fish from the lake, gathering berries (stay alert for the many bears in the area), and eating members of the area’s truly enormous population of mosquitoes, black flies, and other insects.  You won’t even have to go looking for the insects—they will come right to you!  The dense forest will provide plenty of natural fiber from which you can weave your no-synthetic-material clothing and will shelter you from temperatures that often dip below −40 (it’s the same in Fahrenheit or Celsius) in the winter.While it might be tough to live without fossil fuels or combustion for the first while, Canada knows you have an unwavering commitment to saving the world by showing others how to do it.  A few dozen generations from now your descendants might be almost as good at living off the land as were the First Nations people that were in the area thousands of years ago, when the temperature was five four three two one degree colder than it is nowadays.  (Of course, they had fire and you can’t, but that should be okay, right?)  Think of the accolades for showing how lifestyles from when the world’s population was 500 million can be applied to seven billion!  Think of the statues that will be erected in your honor for being the first humans to kick the fossil-fuel habit!  Streets will be named after you!  Schoolchildren everywhere will sing in eternal praise of your exploits!Applicants for the LEAPers Climate Refugee Plan™ must pass Canada’s strict Canadian entry test.  When you get to the border, you must be able to say, “I am a climate refugee” or “Je suis un réfugié climatique.”The Movie-Star Climate Refugee PlanIf you’re a movie star, you know you are the top rung of humanity, the elite of the elites, second only to the LEAPers.  In recognition of this—and unlike all other Climate Refugee Plans™—the Movie Star Plan does not require that you give up using fossil fuels. After all, how could you flit around the world in your private jets, hang out in the tropics on your yachts, or air-condition your mansions, using enough energy for a few dozen little-people families, if you had to live by your own words? Instead of giving up fossil fuels, Canadian climate leaders need you to attend photo shoots with them and other stars and occasionally talk about sciencey stuff like greenhouse gases and carbon, and about Chinook winds signaling climate Armageddon like Leonardo DiCaprio did a couple of years ago. Canada also needs you to explain to the little people that, by giving up their jobs, foregoing meat, not heating their homes, walking to work, and paying more for everything because of Canada’s breath carbon dioxide carbon tax, they’re leaving a better world for you and other glitterati.As you know all too well, global warming will soon—say, in the next 100,000 years or so—make Hollywood uninhabitable. To save you from hotness (the temperature kind, not the star kind), we are offering you free land in and around Yellowknife, in Canada’s Northwest Territory.  Uncrowded, unspoiled, and free of paparazzi, the city has almost too many advantages for people of your elite status.From Hollywood, it is only 2691 miles (4330 km) by road, almost due north. By electric car, it should only take 24 days and 156 recharging stops to make the trip. For your chauffeur’s convenience we have provided Google’s route map. In case you need to stock up on supplies for a, well, rather cooler world, the route takes you right past the West Edmonton Mall. Of course, if you’d rather fly, the airstrip in Yellowknife will accommodate your private jet.The indigenous peoples’ name for the city is Sǫ̀mbak’è, which means, “where the money is.” Doesn’t the name just say it all?  And as the icing on the cake, there are several diamond mines just short, private-jet flights from the city.  In case you want to demonstrate your commitment to reducing CO2, we can arrange tours to and from the mines via dog-sled, with five-star cabins and photo ops along the way.The average daily high temperature in Yellowknife in July is a perfect 70°F (21°C). That’s only 9°F less than Hollywood’s July high of 79°F, so you and your offspring can count on many thousands of years of global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer before afternoons become intolerable again. Of course, the average daily high in January is −13°F (−25°C), so you’ll want to bring some of that really warm, fossil-fuel-derived, synthetic-fiber winter gear.On June 21, the sun rises at 3:39 a.m. and sets at 11:38 p.m., so as you and other stars have come to expect, the sun will almost never set on you—well, except in the winter. But we’ve got that covered, because the Northern Lights will continue to shine on you during many of the cold winter nights (see Figure 2). The City of Yellowknife even has an aurora forecast on its website and tiny lighthouses located around the city that alert visitors and residents when active aurorae are in the evening forecast.No doubt, stars, you’ll want to be among the first to demonstrate your deep concern about global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer by securing a spot well outside the soon-to-be-too-hot parts of the world, and Yellowknife awaits.Figure 1:  The drive from Hollywood to Yellowknife.  (Image by Google Maps.)Figure 2: Northern Lights in the Northwest Territories.  Their radiance is exceeded only by you! (Image from spectacularnwt.com.)The Climate Scientist Climate Refugee Plan™If you aren’t a movie star but you are a climate scientist, Canada knows you’re super-important for this plan, too.  So, Environment and Climate Catastrophe Canada has established a new climate research institute here in Canada that is large enough to house all of you. That way, you can have as many Conferences of the Parties as you wish, without having to consume any of those evil fossil fuels to get there.Knowing that the chief concern among many of you is the melting of polar ice and sea-level rise, we have found the perfect location for the institute: it’s Alert, in Canada’s Artic territory of  Nunavut (see Figure 3). At an altitude of 76 metres (250 feet), Alert is close enough to sea level that you can keep a close eye on Artic Ocean ice but not so close that it will disappear under the sea any time soon.  Of course, we already know that things are worse than we thought, but if things turn out to be worse than worse than we thought, Alert is surrounded by hills, thereby allowing for even more sea-level rise. And if things get worse than worse than worse than we thought, the British Empire Range, with several peaks over 2000 metres, is not far away.Alert is on Ellesmere Island, which is perhaps the best place on the planet to study climate change. You see, about 3.4 million years ago, the island was inhabited by High Arctic camels (see Figure 4). They inhabited a boreal-type forest dominated by larch trees that was also inhabited by beavers, deer, rabbits, and fish. Global temperatures were 2 to 3°C warmer than today, Arctic temperatures were ~19°C warmer, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were ~390 ppm, and the Arctic Ocean was ice-free for a significant period each year.[1],[2]  Since Ellesmere Island has an area of 196,235 km2 (75,767 mi2) and a population of 191, give or take a few, there’s plenty of room for the institute to expand.  The urban heat island effect should be minimal.  And with an annual average daily high temperature of −14°C, you’ll be able to keep all those supercomputers cool while they are running all those sciencey climate models, powered of course by wind turbines, solar panels (except from October to February, when there is no sun), and lots and lots and lots and lots of new-technology batteries.No doubt you will want to demonstrate your personal concern about carbon dioxide emissions and the use of fossil fuels to the rest of the world. So, there will be some restrictions on bringing in anything composed of petroleum products or that involved petroleum products in their manufacture—which, come to think of it, might require that you run your climate models using an abacus or an Aztec nepohualtzintzin.  But even if that’s the case, the models’ accuracy won’t suffer.Figure 3: The location of Alert, Nunavut, Canada (where the little blue writing is).  The image shows sea-ice extent on September 15, 2008.  (Image by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center)  Figure 4: During the mid-Pliocene period the high Arctic was balmier and was home to camels, as shown in this artist’s rendering.  (Image from Powell in Discover Magazine.)The Tropical Islanders’ Climate Refugee Plan™For those of you currently inhabiting oceanic islands whose homes are about to be swallowed by the sea—notwithstanding that Earth’s surface gained 173,000 km2 of land over the last 30 years[1]— Canada offers the Tropical Islanders’ Climate Refugee Plan™.  After travelling by sailboat, horseback, and dog-sled from your current island homes, you will be re-settled in one of Canada’s three territories. Covering approximately 3.7 million km2 (1.4 million mi2) and having a total population of only 120,000, there’s plenty of room to grow.  While temperatures today can be as much as 70°C below what you’ve become accustomed to, with global warming it won’t be more a few hundred centuries before your great-many-times-over grandchildren will be able to enjoy the climate you’ve come to know and love—unless, of course, the ice sheets that once covered the region to a depth of three to five kilometres return first.The Climate Journalist’s Refugee Plan™Male climate leaders in Canada say “don’t call me a man, call me a people” and they, who recognize as well as any modern climate journalist that you must never let facts get in the way of a good story, have come up with an unprecedented opportunity for climate journalists.  You know you’re a climate journalist when you have an unprecedented ability to use the word “unprecedented” an unprecedented number of times in association with unprecedented stories about unprecedented events caused by global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer involving heat, cold, wind, rain, fog, clouds, floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, continental drift, the movement of the magnetic poles, war, peace, famine, bumper crops, earlier and/or later freeze-ups, feminist glaciology (see below), reduced male fertility, melting ice, crime or lack thereof, increases or decreases in dog-walking opportunities, the motion of the planets, sunspots, comets, asteroids, supernovae, cosmic rays, and Donald Trump.  What’s more, you can understand and fully identify with this:[2]Through a review and synthesis of a multi-disciplinary and wide-ranging literature on human-ice relations, this paper proposes a feminist glaciology framework to analyze human-glacier dynamics, glacier narratives and discourse, and claims to credibility and authority of glaciological knowledge through the lens of feminist studies. As a point of departure, we use ‘glaciology’ in an encompassing sense that exceeds the immediate scientific meanings of the label, much as feminist critiques of geography, for example, have expanded what it is that ‘geography’ might mean vis-à-vis geographic knowledge (Domosh, 1991; Rose 1993). As such, feminist glaciology has four aspects: (1) knowledge producers, to decipher how gender affects the individuals producing glacier-related knowledges; (2) gendered science and knowledge, to address how glacier science, perceptions, and claims to credibility are gendered; (3) systems of scientific domination, to analyze how power, domination, colonialism, and control—undergirded by and coincident with masculinist ideologies—have shaped glacier-related sciences and knowledges over time; and (4) alternative representations, to illustrate diverse methods and ways—beyond the natural sciences and including what we refer to as ‘folk glaciologies’—to portray glaciers and integrate counter-narratives into broader conceptions of the cryosphere. These four components of feminist glaciology not only help to critically uncover the under-examined history of glaciological knowledge and glacier-related sciences prominent in today’s climate change discussions. The framework also has important implications for understanding vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience—all central themes in global environmental change research and decision-making that have lacked such robust analysis of epistemologies and knowledge production (Conway et al., 2014; Castree et al., 2014).In return for the opportunity to resettle in Yellowknife or any other soon-to-be-tropical location north of the Arctic Circle, you need only write unprecedentedly good things about our eye-candy climate leaders as they travel round the world inviting one and all to immigrate to Canada, no questions asked.  That should be easy, because according to some of the world’s top climate scientists, Canada is just “so hot.”  Interestingly, when some of those scientists could not find the missing heat that was supposed to be hiding in the deep oceans, they realized that Canada had absorbed it all.  They now have a solid explanation for why all the climate models except that boring Russian one predicted way too much global warming.  One top scientist warns, however, that when Canadian climate catastrophe leaders leave this earthly domain to take a rightful place among the Masters of the Universe, wham… a nearly instantaneous and unprecedentedly unprecedented amount of warming will occur, so we MUST act now to stop all other forms of warming.To be eligible for the Climate Journalist’s Refugee Plan™, you must also have an unwavering commitment to ignoring the past. After all, how could you report things as unprecedented if you also have to report that they happened last year, the year before, in 1954, in 1931, in 1806, and in 1780?  (Shhhh… 1780 is the year of the Great Hurricane of the Antilles that killed between 20,000 and 24,000 people.  Don’t tell anyone!)  You have to be especially careful not to report that the Earth is presently close to the coldest, lowest-CO₂ state it has been in over the last billion years.SummaryNo matter who you are, if you’re worried about the horrors to be wrought by global warming climate change climate disruption atmospheric cancer, now’s your chance to put all those worries behind you.  So, sign up now and beat the rush!  Of course, as we just said, everything will be paid for by the Canadian taxpayer, because according to one of Canada’s Climate Catastrophe Leaders and heroes, taxpayers that are allowed to keep their money would only spend it on themselves and their families.Welcome to Canada, eh![1]     G.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/02/21/the-green-new-deal-a-trillion-here-a-trillion-there/,,"THE GREEN NEW DEAL – A TRILLION HERE, A TRILLION THERE…"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and was a public servant for 27 years, a diplomat for 10 years prior to that service.The United States Democratic Party leadership appears to be enamored with the proposal for a “Green New Deal”, the idea of eliminating all fossil fuels from the US economy by 2030 and converting the economy into a fully socialized one. Several analysts have produced excellent reports explaining the implications of the energy part of the deal. I thought I might add a short comment that will make the issue more understandable for the average person. Over eighty per cent of U.S. energy use is now supplied by fossil fuels – oil, natural gas, and coal. Eliminating all these uses would mean eliminating oil use in transportation (i.e. cars, trucks, railways, aircraft and marine vessels, as well as off-road vehicles like tractors and construction equipment), power generation, and industrial, commercial and residential uses. It would shut down most petrochemicals production, including products ranging from plastics to roofing material. It would force the elimination of all coal, oil and natural gas-fired electricity generation and its replacement by renewable energy generation, meaning mostly wind and solar energy. Perhaps most important, it would mean electrifying the parts of the economy that now run on fossil fuels. That would more than quadruple current electricity demand. First QuestionsOne of the first questions people should consider is whether it is possible to convert all current electricity generation to wind and solar energy. Both of these sources are “intermittent”, meaning that they only produce when the conditions allow it – when the sun shines in the case of solar and when the wind blows in the case of wind turbines. Electricity is difficult and expensive to store; how much would it cost to store electricity so that it is available when the renewables are not generating? In November, 2018, Roger Andrews, a retired engineer, performed an analysis of this issue, examining the specific cases of Germany and California. His analysis can be read here: http://euanmearns.com/the-cost-of-wind-solar-power-batteries-included/ He deliberately used assumptions that would tend to bias the outcome of his analysis in favour of renewable energy. For example, he assumed that: Annual electricity demand in the two jurisdictions stays constant, and does not increase to allow for increased electrification of the economy;Transmission system upgrades are ignored (i.e. there are no costs to moving the electricity from where it is generated by often remote renewables plants to urban areas);The generators operate at a capacity factor of 25%; andThe cost of battery storage would be U.S. $200 per kilowatt hour, about half the current cost of utility-scale Li-ion batteries according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (a source always optimistic about the economics of renewables). The electricity demand patterns in Germany and California are quite different. In Germany, wind generation is highly erratic and peaks in the winter, while solar production is low but smooth. The result is periodic surpluses of generation over demand of up to 80,000 megawatts (MW) and deficits of up to 50,000 MW. The storage capacity requirement peaks in May at slightly over 25,000 gigawatt-hours. In California, both wind and solar generation peak in the summer. Although demand is only about half that of Germany, the result is that the storage requirement also approaches 25,000 gigawatt hours. CostsUsing his optimistic assumptions, Andrews calculated the combined wind plus solar levelized cost of energy (LCOE) to be U.S. $50 per megawatt hour. With storage and related capital costs included, the combined LCOE of a 100% wind and solar generation system was US $699 per megawatt hour for Germany and US $1,096 per megawatt hour for California. The total cost in each case was US $5 trillion. Within the United States, California represents about seven per cent of the total electricity demand, meaning that total U.S. demand is about 14 times larger. Germany’s electricity demand is 13.6 per cent of U.S. demand, so total U.S. demand is about seven times larger. That suggests that the costs of a 100% renewables electricity generation in the U.S. would be somewhere between US $35 trillion and US $70 trillion. If it were possible to transition to an all-renewable electricity generation system within eleven years, the cost would be somewhere between US $3.2 trillion and US $6.4 trillion per year. This does not include the costs of adding electricity services to meet the needs of electrifying the whole economy or the costs of adding generation to permit economic growth. By comparison, the total U.S. federal government budget for 2019 is US $4.4 trillion. ConclusionYou may judge for yourself how realistic or desirable this is. ~~~~Albertans will find similar ‘shocking’ information in this LinkedIn Post: “Wind’s Winter of Discontent” https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/winds-winter-discontent-curtis-sheptycki/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Green New Deal', 'New Green Deal']",2019/02/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/02/16/money-matters-the-engo-political-advantage/,Ron Little ,Money Matters: The ENGO Political Advantage," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who was a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that. He is s frequent contributor to Friends of Science Society.Changes in Traditional Application of Environmental PolicyYears ago, environmental policy in Canada was concerned primarily with protection or enhancement of nature through the regulation of activities that polluted air, land and water, especially where this had a significant impact on human health. This included requiring environmental assessment and review of major projects to ensure, before government permits were issued, that the agencies issuing the permits had taken fully into account the potential effects on local environmental quality and human health. That changed when governments began to focus on the claim that human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), central to the operation of modern economies, could have catastrophic future effects on the global climate. The adoption of aspirational international greenhouse gas emission targets as national policy moved the avoidance of global environmental effects to the centre of the national environmental policy agenda.Today, there are dozens of environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) that operate on both the traditional program activities related to protecting nature and avoiding local pollution and the more recent promotion of GHG emission reduction. To reduce GHG emissions, they seek a fundamental transformation of the Canadian economy away from reliance on fossil fuels. Most of these organizations have charity status under the Income Tax Act, and are regulated as such by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). ENGOs must submit annual reports on their activities and finances. These reports are made public, and thus offer very useful, although not comprehensive, information to the Canadian public about how ENGOs with charity status operate.The purpose of this article is to summarize the results of a survey of the information contained in the annual reports to the CRA by the 40 largest ENGOs, and to compare this with other organizations that also seek to influence environmental policies in Canada.Revenues of the largest ENGOs in CanadaTable 1 is a list of the largest ENGOs in Canada, ranked according to the revenues that they have received over the period 2000 to 2018. They include a wide variety of organizations ranging from some that are quasi-governmental in nature, such as the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), to relatively small, one-issue activist groups like the Climate Reality Project. They include both organizations that carry on a diverse set of activities and programs, such as Ducks Unlimited, and those with a single-issue or more regional focus such as Wildsight.Table 1Note: There are 34 listings here that incorporate 40 organizations. Some organizations have an advocacy and foundation or charitable arm. These have been combined in the table under one name and notes.Revenues of Environmental Law OrganizationsTable 2 is a list of environmental law organizations, again ranked according to the revenues received over the period 2000 to 2018. These organizations are primarily engaged in legal activities that they perceive to further the environmental policy agenda. These can range from lobbying activities to inform and influence the development and passage of legislation to intervening before regulatory bodies and launching lawsuits and court challenges to stop specific projects from proceeding.Table 2Revenues of the Main Political Parties in CanadaTable 3 is a list of the main political parties at the federal government level in Canada as well as a selective list of political parties at provincial government level, also ranked in order of revenues.Table 3Revenues of Competitive Market Think TanksFinally, Table 4 is a list of the “think tanks”, or public policy institutes with policy perspectives emphasizing the use of competitive market forces rather than government action to achieve public policy objectives.  Their analyses often place them in competition with the more interventionist views of the ENGOs, and sometimes they are considered by ENGOs as adversaries.Table 4The Story Told by the NumbersThe top 40 ENGOs received about $11.2 billion over the period 2000 to 2018.The “EnviroLaw” organizations received about $167 million over that same period.The combined revenues of the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts was almost $11.4 billion over the period.The total revenues received by all four main federal political parties over the period was about $631 million.The total revenues received by the major political parties at the federal government level and the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta over the period were $1.5 billion.The total revenues received by the market oriented (“conservative”) institutes over the period was $412 million.The revenues received by the ENGOs and their EnviroLaw counterparts over the period was over 18 times the revenues received by all federal political parties, and over 27 times the revenues received by the market oriented institutes.Both Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Nature Conservancy Canada annually receive higher revenues than all the major federal political parties; a large portion of the funding to these organizations is from the federal government.The revenue received by the Tides organization alone is more than the combined revenues of Canada’s two largest federal political parties, the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada over the period.The David Suzuki Foundation’s average annual revenues exceed the annual revenues of the federal New Democratic Party.Eight ENGOs have annual revenues that exceed those of the governing Liberal Party of Canada.Some ImplicationsAcross Canada there has been a concern expressed at all levels of government about the intrusion of “Big Money” and foreign influences into domestic politics. The Trudeau government has claimed that it wishes to identify and reduce such influencesYet, simply by reviewing the funding documented in the CRA files, we are now aware of the surprising concentration of wealth in non-profit, charitable organizations and their ability to influence public-policy in much the same way that we worried about “Big Money”.No one should be under any doubt that, whatever their other purposes and activities, Canadian ENGOs are significant political organizations. They use their large funds to influence public opinion and to lobby federal and provincial governments in ways that support their views, even when those views are directly at odds with the economic interests of certain regions, industries or firms. Money alone gives them clout, and they are not ashamed to use it.They are able to use their funds and influence to shape environmental policy and regulation.This might be entirely acceptable in a democracy, except for a few things. One is that many of these organizations were created by and remain heavily funded by foreign foundations that may not have Canadian interests at heart. At a minimum, Canadians should be able to see which foreign sources are pulling the strings, especially when the competitiveness or market access of Canadian firms is at stake.Secondly, the ENGOs almost all enjoy charity status and are thusImage licensed from Shutterstock.free from having to pay income tax. The result is what Finance Canada would call a “tax expenditure”, or a draw on the federal treasury caused not by a direct expenditure of funds but by tax treatment that departs from the norm. As that expenditure must be paid for, it is a cross-subsidy from all the other taxpayers of Canada. Some of the ENGOs’ activities appear to conflict with the fundamental purposes of charitable, non-taxable status. For the industries harmed by current climate policies, and especially the hydrocarbons industry of western Canada, subsidizing the adversary must be an especially bitter pill to swallow.~~~Related: Friends of Science Oct. 12, 2018 letter to Finance Minister Morneau on the activities of environmental charities.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/12/an-open-letter-to-the-minister-of-finance-on-the-matter-of-changes-to-the-charities-act/ Sources:For Canadian-based non-profit, charitable organizations all revenues are taken from publicly available CRA T-3010s reported in $CDN as reported in the year of filing.For Canadian-based non-profit, charitable organizations that are independently operating of their parent American organizations all revenues are taken from publicly available CRA T-3010s reported in $CDN as reported in the year of filing.For organizations that are dual registered as non-profit, charitable organizations in Canada and the US, all revenues are taken from publicly available CRA T-3010s reported in $CDN  as reported in the year of filing.For Canadian-based non-profit organizations all revenues were extracted from publicly available Annual reports issued by the organizations reported in $CDN as reported in the year of filing.For Stand.earth – FNA FOrestEthics – an American based non-profit organization operating in Canada the revenues were taken from IRS 990s reported in $US as reported in the year of filing.For Canadian Federal Political Parties all revenues were obtained Annual Party Financial reports filed with Elections Canada.For Canadian provincial Political Parties all revenues were obtained from Annual Party Financial reports filed with the appropriate Provincial Elections organizations: Elections BC, Elections Alberta, Elections Ontario, and Élections Québec.Where an organization operates more than one registered non-profit, charitable organization, the revenues have been combined as reported in the year of filing.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Canadian charities', 'climate change', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes', 'environmentalism']",2019/02/16
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/02/12/big-green-money-vs-conventional-energy-advocates/,,Big Green Money vs Conventional Energy Advocates," Foreign-funding for “No” vs “Pro” Conventional Energy in CanadaLINK to Report:  https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-Green-Money-NO-vs-PRO-FINAL-RevB-FEB-12-2019-1.pdfExecutive SummaryIn their campaigns to address alleged human influences on global warming, many environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) in Canada have chosen to take actions that harm the Canadian economy – blocking necessary energy infrastructure, promoting increased reliance on expensive intermittent sources of electricity supply, urging the imposition of carbon taxes that raise the costs of everything for consumers, and constantly increasing regulations. They say “No” to hydrocarbon energy development. People need to know more about why these policies are being promoted and adopted, and who is influencing this. We can begin to understand more, if we answer three questions:How large is the funding of environmental organizations in Canada, especially those that, in the name of addressing allegedly human-induced global warming, have harmed Canada’s resource economy?How much of this funding comes from foreign sources?How balanced is the debate between the adversarial positions? In other words, how does the funding of those who say “No” compare to the funding of non-governmental organizations that take positions in favour of resource development and especially those that are skeptical about claims of human-induced climate catastrophe? Over the period from 2000 to 2017, the 18 largest ENGOs in Canada took in almost $6.8 billion in revenues, according to public records. Many of them received large amounts of foreign funding, especially from the Moore Foundation, the Packard Foundation, the Tides Foundation, the Wilburforce Foundation and the Bullitt Foundation. For example, the Moore foundation donated over $9.5 million to the David Suzuki Foundation alone. While the Canadian petroleum industry is very large and spends billions of dollars in Canada, this says nothing about whether or how it influences public policy. Based on the registry of lobbying of the federal government, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers is very active in lobbying the federal government about policies, laws and regulations that affect it. By checking this database, however, one can find little if any evidence that the petroleum industry has directly challenged the global warming catastrophe thesis. One will find ample evidence that the lobbying by the ENGOs more than matches the lobbying by the petroleum industry. The oldest non-governmental organization in Canada that directly challenges the catastrophe thesis, is the Friends of Science Society, operating since 2002. We review, as a case in point, the claims of Ecojustice, who called for an inquiry into this group and said there are “deep pockets” supporting the Friends of Science. The annual revenues of this organization have been around $150,000 per year on average since 2011. Ecojustice, in contrast, has taken in more than $81 million in revenues since 2000, or about $4.8 million on average per year (based on available public records). The public debate on the global warming and related energy issues (i.e. coal phase-out, renewables, pipelines) is being skewed by the preponderance of finance on one side of the issue. The charity status granted to many ENGOs that allows them to avoid income taxation while still carrying extensive political activity and lobbying is anomalous. This raises questions vis a vis Canada Revenue Agency Charities Directorate policy related to ‘net public benefit’ versus ‘public harm.’[1] These ENGOs have the right in a democracy to lobby for their views, but why on the backs of taxpayers?[1] “when benefit is proven, it must be weighed against any harm that may arise from the proposed activity and a net benefit must result”  https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html#toc3Big Green Money NO vs PRO FINAL RevB FEB 12 2019DownloadShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change', 'Saskatchewan']",2019/02/12

The foreign investment in oil, gas, mineral resource or forestry drives the economy. Jobs are created, taxes are paid, arts groups and social charities receive support, employee teams often volunteer to fill the coffers of good causes like the United Way. The company pays money for services, the company and its people pay taxes – in return the economy thrives.According to Bloomberg as quoted in the Financial Post, the total stock of accumulated foreign investment in Canada at the end of 2017, including debt, was $704 billion. However, the total stock in the oil and gas industry was $120 billion, having fallen by $16.6 billion, or 12.2 %, in 2017, the largest decrease in 17 years.The National Energy Board publishes annual data on total investment (i.e. domestic and foreign) in the upstream oil industry. Annual investment in 2017 was $40.9 billion, up from $34.9 billion in 2016. Investment in oil sands was $13.6 billion, down 60% from the peak level of annual investment of $33.4 billion in 2014.On Jan. 20, 2019, CBC’s Wendy Mesley finally aired a story on foreign-funding of Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations (ENGOs).  In response to this and a flurry of related media coverage, Jessica Clogg, Executive Director and Senior Counsel of West Coast Environmental Law posted a blog in which she said:“It’s no secret that funders from outside of Canada are contributing to the work of Canadian environmental organizations. The real question is – so what?” – Jessica Clogg, WCEL blog post Jan. 30, 2019With three major approved pipeline projects blocked by foreign-funded ENGOs thousands of unemployed, taxpaying Canadians want answers.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/01/31/cher-alec-castonguay-en-francais/,,Cher Alec Castonguay… en français," Cher Alec,Très aimable de nous avoir écrit. Plusieurs de mes meilleurs amis en Alberta sont franco-canadiens. Moi aussi j’ai des amis au Québec, et j’y ai même travaillé dans le passé avec Claude Fournier et Marie-José Raymond. Curieusement, notre projet de scénario s’intitulait « Les cavaliers de la terre promise » – racontant la randonnée de la GRC dans l’Ouest pour y forger une nation, qui n’était qu’une idée à l’époque.C’était dans les années 1980, avant que l’Alberta n’ait acquis la réputation d’avoir du «pétrole sale». Comment est apparu ce sobriquet? Peut-être avez-vous entendu parler de la « campagne des sables bitumineux »? C’était un effort délibéré de verrouiller la troisième plus grande ressource pétrolière du monde et de garder un concurrent mondial, le Canada (via les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta et de la Saskatchewan), hors des marchés mondiaux.Jusqu’à présent, cela a été très efficace.Mais, vous ne savez probablement pas que le Québec y a joué un rôle de premier plan!En effet, à partir de 2009, la « Oak Foundation » suisse, basée en Amérique, l’un des partenaires de la fondation milliardaire « ClimateWorks », a octroyé $5milliards USD à la « Campagne mondiale pour l’action pour le climat » (GCCA www.tcktcktck.org ), basée à Montréal. Leur but était de « mobiliser l’opinion publique et revendications au Canada ». Les trois années suivantes, la Oak Foundation subventionna jusqu’à $2 million USD afin de faire pression sur les politiques, organisations et individus pour leur permettre d’agir sur le dossier du changement climatique.En 2010, la  « Sea Change Foundation », autre partenaire de ClimateWorks, injecta $4million USD dans la GCCA afin de « réduire la dépendance d’une énergie à haute teneur en carbone », « et le développement d’un programme. » Le but était de mobiliser le public via les syndicats et les groupes confessionnels afin d’influencer les traités internationaux sur le climat.On en arrive donc à environ $11.75 million USD déversés au Québec pour lutter contre des projets comme les sables bitumineux.Vous dites dans votre lettre: «Je comprends, vous êtes en colère.”Je ne peux pas parler au nom de tous les Albertains, mais en tant qu’amoureux du Québec et de ma propre province, la nausée me gagne quand je découvre le logo de la province du Québec sur le site Web “tcktcktck.org” de la GCCA, tout à côté du logo de la Fondation Oak… un portail de la province en direct au moment où j’ai pris cette capture d’écran !Ces bailleurs de fonds étrangers ont créé avec succès au Québec « Blockadia » des pipelines et ressources, bien avant que les Albertains aient la moindre idée de la campagne contre les sables bitumineux.Vous avez donc tort de dire que Trans Canada a tout gâché. Le Québec s’est radicalisé contre les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta via des saboteurs financés par des fonds étrangers depuis plus d’une décennie. Énergie Est était bien conçue ; des militants ont tout contrecarré, alléguant qu’une brasserie québécoise serait mise en danger, jusqu’à une professeure de Concordia qui, lors d’un groupe de discussion sur les sables bitumineux, éclata en sanglots, criant qu’elle ne pourrait jamais avoir d’enfants à cause des sables bitumineux de l’Alberta.Il est étonnant qu’elle n’ait pas pleuré sur la présence de raffineries et de pétrole étranger chez vous !The Grand Quebec Hypocrisy on Energy East, de Robert LymanObjectifs de Reduction des Emissions – Le Cas du Québec Nous-mêmes n’avions aucune idée de la gravité de la situation au Québec jusqu’à notre innocente campagne d’affichage en 2014. Nous nous concentrions sur les sciences du climat et leurs implications sur les politiques énergétiques.Et vlan ! Il apparut que mentionnner quelques faits scientifiques méritait une peine de prison ! J’ai analysé les thèmes contenus dans le fichier de plaintes que nous avons reçues du Ad Standards Council, et ai été surprise de la véhémente «frénésie convulsive» d’affirmations émotionnelles, si inattendu des franco-canadiens normalement rationnels que je connais – des gens qui adorent débattre des faits, pas les sentiments.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2766823Ce n’est que quelques années plus tard que les fonds mentionnés ci-dessus ont été portés à mon attention. Maintenant, tout cela a du sens, y compris la folle réaction de l’ACS.Et à propos de l’hydroélectricité que vous voulez vendre !Avant de critiquer les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta, où la réhabilitation des sols est loi, allons d’abord jeter un coup d’œil sur votre arrière-cour.  Carte de la baie JamesCentrale électrique principaleLa centrale électrique est encadrée en jaune, sur une carte du réservoir de 300 km de large Intégralité de la zone d’exploitation des sables bitumineuxEt voici l’ensemble de l’exploitation des sables bitumineux sur une carte de 300 km de largeD’après Norm Kalmanovitch, P.GeophComparons maintenant les empreintes respectives de la baie James et des sables bitumineux, chaque carte faisant 300 km de large.Voici à quoi ressemble la zone d’extraction des sables bitumineux lors de la remise en état, Alec. La baie James, elle, ne sera jamais récupérée. Source: https://www.syncrude.ca/environment/land-reclamation/our-progress/ Alec, vous dites «Keystone XL est à nouveau retardé aux États-Unis….»Non, pas du tout ! Keystone XL a été intentionnellement bloqué par la campagne contre les sables bitumineux. Les mêmes millions qui ont envahi le Québec pour radicaliser votre peuple contre le pétrole de l’Alberta et les sables bitumineux ont également financé « Blockadia au sud ».Alec, vous dites aussi: “et B.C. ne veut pas de l’extension TransMountain, qu’Ottawa a finalement décidé de nationaliser pour tenter de le compléter. ”Non ! La Colombie-Britannique a versé des millions de dollars à des organisations non gouvernementales de l’environnement – dont beaucoup d’organismes de bienfaisance subventionnés (!) – afin d’emprisonner le pétrole albertain.Vous dites que nous sommes en colère, Alec. Vous avez tout à fait raison !Nous sommes fâchés d’apprendre que le principal bloqueur de TransMountain, la Fondation David Suzuki, est financé par Power Corporation du Québec depuis 2007. Nous sommes vraiment sidérés de découvrir que la Caisse de dépôt et de placement du Québec était le deuxième actionnaire en importance de Kinder Morgan Canada. Qui a donc bénéficié de Blockadia et de l’achat ultérieur de TMX par le gouvernement fédéral?Ce qui nous rend furieux, c’est de découvrir que la Caisse de dépôt partage le lit d’Al Gore, ce type qui encourageait le Blockadia du pipeline TMX – un milliardaire qui applaudit à la perte d’emplois de centaines de milliers de Canadiens et aux suicides de ceux qui ne peuvent plus surmonter la perspective d’une ruine financière.Et maintenant vous nous dites que vous voulez vendre votre hydro aux autres provinces. On vous souhaite bonne chance!Nous savons que l’équipe du Manifeste LEAP, celle de Skoll and Gore, la famille Lewis-Klein et la bande Trottier «Acting on Climate» de McGill ont tous de grands espoirs d’avoir un réseau national éolien-hydroélectrique au Canada.Mais disons-le maintenant: ARRÊTEZ TOUT DE SUITE !C’est techniquement irréalisable, Alec. Il est insensé que des investisseurs idéologiques et éco-activistes financés par des fonds étrangers animent le programme énergétique au Canada – et le poursuivent vers la catastrophe.Nous avons interrogé des ingénieurs en production d’énergie à propos de cette idée de réseau éolien-hydroélectrique, qui, selon les LEAP, pourrait être facilement réalisée d’ici 2035.No chance, Alec. Here’s why.Aucune chance, Alec. Voici pourquoi.http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/09/29/power-generation-information-on-difficulties-of-instituting-the-proposed-wind-hydro-national-grid-network-in-acting-on-climate-change/https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/01/23/un-reseau-national-hybride-denergie-hydroelectrique-et-eolienne-le-plan-est-techniquement-irrealisable/?highlight=reseauNous n’en avons pas la certitude, mais soupçonnons, que depuis que les Amis de la science ont eu l’audace de dire aux Canadiens la vérité sur cette idée de production d’énergie, un groupe d’entre eux a tenté de nous faire emprisonner pour nos panneaux publicitaires.https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/12/03/news/breaking-ecojustice-files-complaint-competition-bureau-against-climate-denial-groupsEt quant aux objectifs de l’accord de Paris? Voulez-vous dire ceux qui sont principalement définis par la « World Resources Institute », collaborateur de « Generation Investment Management » d’Al Gore? Ceci ressemble beaucoup au bras public des milliardaires de « ClimateWorks » qui essaient de forcer le monde à adopter un système de « plafonnement et d’échange de charbone » mondial, et mettre leurs 12 trillions de dollars d’énergies renouvelables sur leurs intérêts propres sur le réseau…? Ce sont ces cibles dont vous parlez?ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165Nisbet https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.524Excusez-nous si nous trouvons tout cela un peu trop «commode» et semé de conflits d’intérêts. D’après les données scientifiques sur le climat, la planète se porte bien et le changement climatique n’est affecté que de façon nominale par les émissions humaines… (Mais de manière significative par les détournements importants d’eau comme la Baie James). Depuis 2013, le rapport du GIEC a clairement montré que le dioxyde de carbone n’était pas le « bouton de commande » du climat.  Et pour ce qui en est de la péréquation chez les Albertains, ce n’est pas le programme ou le transfert qui est si irritant. Nous sommes un pays confédéré, et le principe de cette confédération – comme dans le cas du chemin de fer Trans Canada il y a bien longtemps – était de faire en sorte que toutes les régions du pays puissent bénéficier des avantages naturels des richesses géographiques et des ressources… Nous, Albertains, «attendons» de pouvoir construire des pipelines à partir de nos bienfaits naturels des sables bitumineux vers les provinces qui possèdent les avantages naturels des ports océaniques. N’êtes-vous pas heureux de nous expédier sans question vos gallons de sirop d’érable ?Puisque nous avons partagé nos richesses d’environ 200 milliards de dollars de péréquation (2000-2014), cela ne semble pas être une attente déraisonnable…Vos excuses faiblardes, ça ne marche pas ! Surement pas avec moi. Et j’aime toujours le Québec et mes amis franco-canadiens, et bien plus que votre sirop !Je méprise ce que votre Blockadia, fondé par des étrangers, nous a infligé dans l’Ouest du Canada !Je suis également dégoutée de votre hypocrisie hautaine et condescendante envers une province meurtrie et ses citoyens. J’attends de lire si vous aurez la décence de publier ces constats et vérités que je vous ai indiqués dans ma lettre. Si c’est le cas, j’achèterai le premier tour de bière Big Rock.Big Rock…???And …”Is Abacus Data asking the right questions on Climate Change?”à plus tardMichellemedia@friendsofscience.org  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'changement climatique', 'climate change']",2019/01/31

The timeline references in the transcript of the video are random and simply to help the reader find the section of the video.   A similar presentation in French is posted at the end of this transcript.The relevant peer-reviewed paper is here:Earth-Science Reviews_FG_2016 (1)The power point is here:8._gervais (2)Prof. Gervais:Is there a correlation between temperature of the earth and CO2 emissions?In black you see the data by the Hadley Center in Britain, and in red, the satellite measurements. At the University of Alabama at Huntsville. So is there a correlation?1:29I will say, no.Why?Because when CO2 started accelerating between 1945 and 1975, temperature was decreasing.Definitely there is no correlation.Okay, after that there has been an increase of temperature but no more than between 1910 and 1948.1:59No correlation.Of course, the CO2 emissions, nowadays are six times more than it was between the period of 1910 and 1945.2:13Conversely, we see a good fit with a 60-year cycle, plus a straight line. But this straight line doesn’t fit the CO2 emissions….due to the change in slope you see in 1945.2:36This fit with a 60-year cycle gives much better agreement with data, than this…which is a picture taken from IPCC AR5 report, you see during the first increase between 1910 and 1945 – the models CMIP5 – does not see (show) the increase that has been observed. And now there is the problem of this century, you see again there is disagreement …let’s have a zoom on our century.3:22This is a picture taken from the IPCC AR5!You see the measurements…and you see the models. Not only the models doesn’t fit the experiment, but they don’t fit each other.  They disagree with each other, the models. Even with the same colors which is the same scenario.3:52Another picture which is also from inside the IPCC AR5 report – another way to show the same thing. In red, you have the observation in the period indicated. And in black you see the CMIP5 models.They run too hot, that’s clear – all of them!So, the alarmism is not validated.4:22This 60-year cycle is not only seen in temperature measurements, but also in other climate sentinels. For example, the sea level rise of oceans which also shows….of course there is much uncertainty on the data, but anyway, the computer creates a sine function that is in agreement with the data. And also, in between, you see the area of Arctic ice.When the temperature was low, there was a maximum of arctic ice; then when the temperature was higher, there was a low of arctic ice, and so on. And we see the same now.5:16This 60-year cycle is reported in many peer-reviewed papers, including Nicola Scafetta, who is in the audience. And, there is a possible explanation by the tide effect.  The tide effect of big planets of the solar system upon the sun.5:47Which is easily deformable because it is gas.Another possibility is the correlation of this cycle with what is called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.6:09Here is a plot of climate sensitivity published in peer-reviewed papers. Some people in the audience are among the authors of some data.  Is it clearly the alternative or the post-modern definition of ‘consensus’?6:40(audience laughter)Is it?Well…I recall the definition of ‘climate sensitivity’ – it is the warming of the earth in case of CO2 doubling.There are two definitions – “Transient Climate Response” (TCR) and “Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity” (ECS) .  Transient is at the time of doubling of CO2 while Equilibrium assumes several more unknown centuries to arrive to this equilibrium.7:10But anyway, in both cases, just a linear regression of the data points shows there is a cooling. Why?Probably because a number of authors have just noticed that in the low troposphere temperatures, since two decades, there is no change except fluctuations.At 10 kilometers, temperature has not changed in four decades.And you will see in a few minutes, in the low stratosphere, the temperature has not changed in a quarter of a century.8:10So, that’s why, that’s the possibility. Anyway.What has increased, not the emissions, but the CO2 in the atmosphere?It has been increased til the beginning of this century.Since this beginning, it is almost a constant, 2 ppm/yr.8:45That will mean that until 2068, in 50 years, there will be, if we extrapolate, 100 more ppm CO2 in the atmosphere.Why 2068? It is because according to a paper by Ollila who uses the data of BP – British Petroleum – the known reserves of gas and oil – known today – will be finished in 50 years. Of course, for coal, it is much more time.  But, known reserves – of course, we can discover more. But anyway, …9:40In order to make some calculations, what is CO2 ? This is the infrared spectrum of the atmosphere.We see, essentially, the absorption by water vapour, essentially by water vapor.Only two peaks or absorption, since it is the transmission, two peaks correspond to CO2.It’s really easy to understand. You see that young girl…if she kisses, alternatively, each boy, that’s one vibrational mode.Or, she is just hesitating…She’s hesitating like that…like a Chinese reading a book.  So, very easy.Both those absorptions in the atmosphere, absorb 100% of the radiation emitted by the earth.100%. We could say it is almost saturated.10:56This is exactly what was published by Rasool and Schneider.  I chose Schneider although he has become a well-known alarmist, but at the time he was not.  Why? Because earth was cooling, at that time (1971)!11:17…and he considered the climate sensitivity of 0.8°K.And he explains that this is because the CO2 bands saturate, and the addition of more CO2 doesn’t substantially increase the opacity of the atmosphere. Well, I will not detail the calculation because it is very easy. We start with the Stefan Bolzmann equation, make its derivative and therefore arrive to a simple equation, almost 0.2 degrees of AGW in 2068.11:59Experimental verification.That’s very important.In the low stratosphere, we would expect temperature change.There is no temperature change, with two different satellite measurements, since a quarter of a century.No temperature change.12:25If we believe IPCC, you should have this temperature change.This is not observed.Why?The Greenhouse Effect, according to IPCC, the definition is there.It is to consider the lowering of emission by CO2 at high altitude, due to an excess of CO2.12:55Increase of altitude means increase of temperature – uh sorry – decrease of temperature with altitude.But what happens, actually?This is the infrared spectrum again and this is this band again at 15 microns, in the troposphere – below – above the tropopause, 11 kilometers – above – you see that the absorption in both cases is always 100%. And above 11 kilometers, the temperature no longer decreases, but starts to increase again. The increase of temperature means a cooling effect, decrease of temperature means a warming effect.Okay.13:47This is because simply, the saturation which is observed in the low atmosphere, is not observed at higher altitude because the pressure is lower. And since pressure is lower, the dissipation of heat is by another mechanism, no longer collision of molecules at low altitude, it becomes emission, radiative effect, at high altitude because much less collision of course, due to the low pressure.14:20In addition, but I will not discuss that, again, one of the authors of this work, is my chairman, so he knows wellYou see, CO2 is so dangerous that it warms the earth before it has been emitted… That’s what is said with these measurements. Of course, normally a consequence FOLLOWS a cause. But it’s reversed…Well, I will not discuss it because I will need time to discuss that, that means that the ocean release CO2 because there are 60 times more CO2 in the ocean than in the atmosphere, and that may be the explanation.15:18But if that is true, that would mean that, (well I’ll skip that one …well maybe not) ..this picture has already been shown today, there is no correlation again – why?If we admit that there is a climate sensitivity of 0.6°C, of course no correlation is observed.Because either a doubling of CO2 or dividing by 2 would not change anything within the temperature range.This is also true for… I just want to use the last minute…to insist on earth’s greening.This is observed by satellite.18 million square kilometers.More interesting is the increase in the seasonal oscillation with time,Now is La Jola, you see the increase of amplitude of this oscillation is larger than it has been, it increases more rapidly than CO2 itself. This is a way to arrive to this conclusion.I will let you read…(applause)(applaudissements)Français FRENCH TRANSLATION OF THE ENGLISH VIDEO: (a similar video presentation in French below)Refroidissement de la sensibilité climatique – Réchauffement dû au CO2 anthropique en compétition avec un cycle de 60 ans  Y a t-il une corrélation entre température de la Terre et émissions de CO2? En noir, on voit les données du Hadley Center britannique, et en rouge, les mesures par satellites publiées par l’Université d’Alabama à Huntsville. Y a-t’il corrélation ?1:29Je dirais, non.Pourquoi ?Parce que lorsque les émissions de CO2 ont commencé à accélérer entre 1945 et 1975, la température baissait.Clairement, il n’y a pas corrélation.Bon, après il y a eu un accroissement de température mais pas plus que de 1910 à 1948.1:59Pas de corrélation.Car les émissions de CO2 sont de nos jours six fois plus élevées que ce qu’elles étaient dans la période entre 1910 et 1945.2:13En revanche, nous constatons un bon accord avec un cycle de 60 ans. Par ailleurs, la ligne droite ne reflète pas vraiment les émissions de CO2 à cause du changement de pente que l’on voit en 1945.2:36L’accord des données avec le cycle de 60 ans apparait bien meilleur qu’avec les modèles repris par le rapport AR5 du GIEC comme le montre cette figure tirée du rapport. On voit que le premier accroissement de température entre 1910 et 1945 n’est pas reproduit par les modèles CMIP5. Le désaccord est encore pire depuis le début de ce siècle. Zoomons sur notre siècle.3:22Voici une autre figure issue du rapport AR5 du GIEC.On voit les mesures (en noir) et on voit les modèles (en couleur). Non seulement les modèles ne reproduisent pas les mesures, mais ils ne sont pas d’accord entre eux. Même pour une même couleur correspondant à un même scénario d’émissions.3:52Une autre figure qui est également extraite du rapport AR5 du GIEC, une autre méthode pour montrer la même chose. En rouge, on voit les observations dans la période indiquée. En noir, on voit les modèles CMIP5.Ils chauffent trop, c’est clair, tous !Donc l’alarmisme n’est nullement validé.4:22Ce cycle de 60 ans n’est pas seulement observé dans les mesures de température, mais aussi par d’autres sentinelles du climat. Par exemple, la hausse du niveau des océans le voit aussi avec bien sûr une certaine incertitude dans les données, car l’ordinateur trouve une fonction sinusoïdale donnant le meilleur accord avec les données. Entre ces deux courbes, est présentée la superficie de banquise Arctique.Lorsque la température était basse, il y avait un maximum de banquise Arctique ; puis lorsque la température a été plus élevée, il y avait un minimum de banquise Arctique, et ainsi de suite. On observe maintenant un minimum similaire.5:16Le cycle de 60 ans est rapporté dans beaucoup de publications dans des revues internationales à comité de lecture, dont plusieurs de Nicola Scafetta qui participe à ce colloque. Ainsi existe-t-il une explication possible par un effet de marée. L’effet de marée des plus grosses planètes du système solaire sur le soleil.5:47Qui est aisément déformable parce que c’est du gaz.Une autre possibilité est la corrélation de ce cycle avec ce qui est appelée l’Oscillation Atlantique Multidécennale.6:09Voici reportés les valeurs de sensibilité climatique publiées dans des revues internationales à comité de lecture. Quelques participants à ce colloque sont auteurs de certaines. Est-ce l’illustration de la définition « post-moderne » d’un « consensus » ?6:40(rires de l’auditoire)Est-ce le cas ?Bon. Je rappelle la définition de la « sensibilité climatique » – C’est le réchauffement de la Terre en cas de doublement du CO2 dans l’air.Il y a deux définitions – « Réponse climatique transitoire » (TCR) et « Sensibilité climatique à l’équilibre » (ECS). Transitoire s’entend au moment du doublement du CO2 tandis que l’équilibre suppose un nombre inconnu de siècles supplémentaires pour arriver à l’équilibre.7:10De toute manière, dans les deux cas, une simple régression linéaire des données montre qu’il y a refroidissement. Pourquoi ?Probablement parce qu’un certain nombre d’auteurs ont justement noté que depuis deux décennies, la température n’évolue pas dans la basse troposphère aux fluctuations près.A 10 kilomètre d’altitude, la température n’a pas évolué depuis quatre décennies.Et on va voir dans quelques minutes que dans la basse stratosphère, la température n’a pas évolué depuis un quart de siècle.8:10Voilà pourquoi. C’est du moins une possibilité.Ce qui s’est accru, non pas ici les émissions, mais la proportion de CO2 dans l’atmosphère.Elle s’est accrue jusqu’au début de ce siècle.Depuis, elle reste à peu près constante à 2 ppm par an.8:45Cela signifie d’ici 2068, dans 50 ans, si l’on extrapole, 100 ppm de CO2 supplémentaires dans l’atmosphère.Pourquoi 2068 ? Parce que d’après une publication de Ollila qui utilise les données de BP – British Petroleum – les réserves connues de gaz et de pétrole – connues aujourd’hui – seraient épuisées dans 50 ans. Bien sûr, pour le charbon, on en aura pour plus longtemps. Mais quant aux réserves connues, on peut bien sûr en découvrir d’autres. Mais bon…9:40Pour faire quelques calculs, qu’est-ce que le CO2 ? Voici le spectre infrarouge de l’atmosphère.On voit essentiellement l’absorption par la vapeur d’eau, essentiellement par la vapeur d’eau.Seulement deux pics ou absorptions, puisque c’est la transmission, deux pics correspondant au CO2.C’est vraiment facile à comprendre. Vous voyez cette jeune femme. Si elle bise, alternativement, chaque garçon, c’est un mode de vibration.Ou elle est simplement hésitante.Elle hésite comme cela (en hochant simplement la tête) comme un chinois lisant un livre. C’est ainsi très facile.Ces deux absorptions dans l’atmosphère absorbent 100 % du rayonnement émis par la Terre. On peut dire que l’effet est presque saturé.10:56C’est exactement ce qu’ont publié Rasool et Schneider. Je choisis Schneider bien qu’il soit devenu par la suite un alarmiste notoire qu’à l’époque il n’était pas. Pourquoi ? Parce qu’à cette époque (1971) la Terre se refroidissait !11:17…et il considérait une sensibilité climatique de 0,8°K.Et il explique que c’est parce que les bandes de CO2 saturent et que l’addition de davantage de CO2 n’accroit pas de façon substantielle l’opacité de l’atmosphère. Je ne vais pas détailler le calcul parce que c’est très simple. On part de l’équation de Boltzmann, on la dérive, et on arrive à une équation simple donnant à peu près 0,2°C de réchauffement anthropique d’ici 2068.11:59Vérification expérimentale.C’est très important.Dans la basse stratosphère, on s’attendrait à une évolution de température.Il n’y a pas d’évolution de température, selon deux mesures satellitaires différentes, depuis un quart de siècle.Pas d’évolution de température.12:25Si l’on en croit le GIEC, on devrait avoir cette évolution de température.Elle n’est pas observée.Pourquoi ?Selon le GIEC, la définition de l’effet de serre se trouve ici.Il considère un abaissement de l’émission par le CO2 à haute altitude dû à un excès de CO2.12:55L’accroissement d’altitude signifie accroissement de température – non, pardon – diminution de température avec l’altitude.Mais qu’est-ce qui se passe vraiment ?Voici à nouveau le spectre infrarouge et de nouveau cette bande à 15 microns, en-dessous dans la troposphère, et au-dessus de la tropopause à 11 kilomètre, dans la figure du dessus. On voit que l’absorption dans les deux cas est toujours de 100 %. Et au-dessus de 11 kilomètres, la température ne décroit plus mais commence à augmenter. Un accroissement de température signifie un effet refroidissant, alors qu’une diminution de température implique un effet réchauffant.Bon.13:47C’est simplement parce que la saturation qui est observée dans la basse atmosphère n’est plus observée à plus haute altitude parce que la pression est plus faible. Et puisque la pression est plus faible, la dissipation de chaleur se fait par un autre mécanisme, non plus par collisions de molécules comme à basse altitude, mais par émission, effet radiatif, à haute altitude en raison de moindres collisions, bien sûr, à cause d’une pression faible.14:20En plus, mais je ne vais pas en discuter, un des auteurs de ces travaux est mon président de séance, donc il connait bien.Vous voyez, le CO2 est si dangereux qu’il chauffe la Terre avant même d’avoir été émis… C’est ce qui découle de ces mesures. Bien sûr, normalement une conséquence SUIT une cause. Mais c’est inversé…Bon, je ne vais pas le discuter parce que j’aurais besoin de temps, cela signifie que l’océan relâche du CO2 parce qu’il y a 60 fois plus de CO2 dans les océans que dans l’atmosphère, et cela pourrait être l’explication.15:18Mais si c’est le cas, cela signifierait que (bon, je vais passer cette planche… peut-être pas – elle a déjà été montrée aujourd’hui) montrant à nouveau qu’il n’y a pas corrélation. Pourquoi ?Si l’on admet une sensibilité climatique de 0,6°C, bien sûr aucune corrélation n’est observée.Parce que soit un doublement du CO2 soit sa division par 2 ne changerait quoi que ce soit (de significatif) dans une telle gamme de température.C’est aussi vrai pour le siècle dernier… Je voudrais simplement utiliser la dernière minute pour insister sur le verdissement de la Terre.C’est observé par satellite.18 millions de kilomètres carrés.Plus intéressant est l’accroissement de l’oscillation saisonnière au fil des ans.Ici à La Jola, on voit que l’accroissement de l’amplitude de cette oscillation est plus grand que ce qu’elle a été, elle augmente plus rapidement que le CO2 lui-même. Tout cela pour arriver à ces conclusions.Je vous laisse lire…(applaudissements) François Gervais – L’urgence climatique est un leurrehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2810008515/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'Porto Basic Climate Science Conference 2018']",2019/01/26
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/01/23/chinas-climate-u-turn/,Dr Francis Manns ,China’s Climate U-Turn," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and former diplomat for 10 years prior.The Global Warming Policy Foundation has just published a report by Patricia Adams entitled The Road from Paris: China’s Climate U-Turn. It is an account of the changes in China’s energy policy since the signing of the COP21 Climate Change Agreement in Paris in December 2015. The full version of the report, including its sources, can be found here: https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2018/12/China-U-Turn.pdf This article provides a summary of the report. Overview China’s signature of the Paris Climate agreement was hailed by the press as evidence that the world was fully committed to moving towards a non-carbon dioxide future. As the world’s largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, China was viewed as a global leader that would add momentum to the emissions reductions called for by the United Nations. A series of events have served to end China’s image as the “climate savior”. Most importantly, China has had to come face-to-face with how it will meet its own energy needs and assure its security of supply. Further, the clear lack of progress in the funding of the Green Climate Fund, to which OECD countries were expected to contribute at least $100 billion per year by 2020 and from which China hoped to benefit has signaled that the UN climate apparatus is unlikely to serve China’s financial objectives. China’s Energy Needs In the emissions reduction plan it submitted to the UN in 2015, China committed to “peak” its GHG emissions by 2030 and to progressively improve the energy intensity of its economy. Instead, the country has found itself scrambling to find ever more sources of energy to support its economic growth. Demand for energy has increased sharply, as much as 15% for natural gas over the past year. China’s “Belt and Road” (BRI) development initiative has focused on increasing energy supply through building pipelines, power facilities and ports in more than 70 countries, with a heavy emphasis on oil and natural gas, LNG and nuclear energy. China has quickly expanded its fleet of nuclear facilities and now has 45 operating reactors and 15 under construction.Coal remains the mainstay of China’s electricity generation system, even though it aims to reduce its reliance on coal over time to improve local air quality. China is already the world’s largest coal producer and consumer. According to Bloomberg and Wood Mackenzie,  it plans to add more mines, perhaps as much as 400 million tons of capacity by 2020. In terms of coal consumption, satellite imagery shows that many coal-fired power plants that were formerly halted have quietly been restarted. In total, 4.7 gigawatts (W) of new and restarted coal-fired power plant construction are either generating power or will soon be operational, expanding capacity by 4%. In other countries, China is involved in 240 coal-fired power projects in 25 BRI countries with a total installed capacity of 251 GW. China’s Local Air Quality Needs China’s planners had placed great hopes on increased use of wind and solar electricity generation to replace coal-fired generation and thus reduce local air pollution. As a result of large investments, the country now has the largest wind and solar generation capacity in the world. However, according to reports from the U.S Energy Information Administration, wind and solar account for only 2.7% and 0.5%, respectively, of China’s actual generation. This is partly because Chinese curtailment rates are the worst in the world (Bloomberg New Energy Finance). When several western countries abandoned the subsidies to solar and wind power and enforced anti-dumping policies on imports of Chinese equipment, Beijing responded with new subsidies that increased domestic installations. The subsidies, however, were so large and the market so undisciplined that the Ministry of Finance is now left with a subsidy backlog (money it owes the industry) of US $18.71 billion. The subsidy regime is now ending. At the same time, China is introducing a renewable energy quota system, which will require each province or energy retailer to source a certain percentage of electricity from renewables or to buy green energy “certificates” from renewables developers who are unable to bring their power to market, in effect downloading the cost of renewable power onto market actors, such as power networks and electricity suppliers and ultimately onto electricity consumers. The Chinese government last year ordered centralized district-heating plants in 28 northern cities to burn natural gas instead of coal, only to discover that the infrastructure to deliver and use the gas did not exist. This year, it has changed course, allowing coal consumption as needed in the northern cities, but banning new smog-producing industrial facilities in key cities and permitting increased coal-burning and smog pollution in parts of the country where air quality is a lower political priority. The average levels of pollution for the country as a whole remain 72% higher than guidelines set by the World Health Organization. Carbon Dioxide Emissions China’s GHG emissions increased by 1.7% in 2017 and are projected to grow by 4.7% in 2018. China’s carbon market has been scaled back and is now “low key”. The Green Climate Fund, which was supposed to receive at least $100 billion per year in contributions from the “Annex II” (i.e. mostly, OECD) countries, has received only a small portion of the promised commitments, and the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement virtually assures that it will not receive anything close to what the developing countries, including China, had hoped they could access. The fund is now beset with internal conflict and has approved only a relatively small number of projects. China thus is losing much of its motivation to keep up the pretense that it is committed to its emissions reduction plan. The failure of the Green Climate Fund gives China (and other countries that submitted emissions reduction plans to the UN) an “out”. All that will be left is the propaganda.~~~~Related:  “Where will the UN get its climate money now? ” Insights on the Green Climate Fundhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/04/where-will-the-u-n-get-its-climate-money-now/  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['China', 'climate change']",2019/01/23

Sustainable Development Agenda 2030," Contributed by Robert Lyman ©2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.Executive SummaryREAD FULL REPORT: THE UNITED NATIONS 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Jan 20 2019Canadians may view the federal government’s global warming policies as detached from other political and policy objectives, and not part of a broader national or international framework. The 2018 report by Global Affairs Canada containing a “voluntary national review” of Canada’s progress in meeting the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development shows that this is not true. In the paper that follows, I quote extensively from the report in order to give precise examples of the rationale that governs the Federal government’s approach and to show that it is part of an integrated whole. For those used to traditional public policy goals, the document is surprising, and in some respects quite alarming Reports of this kind historically have been dry recitations of programs and expenditures made in keeping with an international commitment. This document, instead, uses language typical of a federal Budget, full of striking, almost bombastic statements about the radical transitions in social, economic and environmental conditions that the government seeks to make. Further, the tone is not consensual, clearly representative of a wide range of viewpoints and regional perspectives in Canada. It is strident and ideological, a bold declaration that “progressive” values and highly interventionist approaches take primary place in the government’s thinking. The priorities are strikingly clear – the feminist agenda and the broader LGBTQ2’s gender goals, “reconciling” with indigenous people by giving them ever more funds and power, and transforming the Canadian economy towards a “green” version with renewable energy dominating and little role for the hydrocarbons industry. It is, in some senses, a declaration of victory over the more conventional goals and communities within the Canadian political system. One cannot help but be struck by the range of initiatives underway, many of which have largely escaped media attention in Canada. The spending commitments alone are eye-opening – $180 billion for infrastructure, of which $20 billion is for green infrastructure, $28.7 billion for public transit, $25.3 billion for social infrastructure, and $10.1 billion for trade and transportation infrastructure. The document expresses a profound belief that all this will increase Canada’s future prosperity, ignoring the fact that, apart from the trade and transportation investments there is no obvious reason why this should be so. In its endorsement of “progressive” goals, the document makes no reference to the groups apparently viewed as the villains and oppressors – especially Caucasian, heterosexual males; non-indigenous people; multi-generational Canadians; the oil and gas industry; and Canadian business generally. I wonder who is paying for all the programs. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Global Affairs Canada', 'UN Sustainable Development 2030']",2019/01/20
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/01/20/blame-canada/,Andrew Roman ,BLAME CANADA!," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.In 1999, there was a famous episode on the U.S. television animated series, South Park, in which a dowdy teacher harangued her class with the explanation of all that is going wrong in the world. “Blame Canada” she cried, and the class took it up with a rousing musical refrain. I am reminded of the absurdity of that episode, if not its sense of humour, by the present tendency of municipalities in some regions to sue Canadian oil companies for the alleged economic damages of global warming. The whole claim rests on a mountain of false assumptions and misjudgements, but I would like to examine just one set of them – the claim that it is oil producers in one country, Canada, that are responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions rising. At the heart of this allegation is the assumption that oil-related emissions of greenhouse gases, as measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), are the main sources of global emissions. Let’s examine that in terms of the emissions from the most widely used refined oil product, motor gasoline, throughout its life cycle. This is what is called a “wells to wheels” analysis. The estimates of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions on this basis have been changing over the past two decades as a result of intense study of the issue by various governments in Canada and the United States. Fifteen years ago, the rule-of-thumb calculation was that, of the roughly 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule produced wells to wheels for gasoline in the United States, 15% was attributable to exploration, production, transportation, refining and marketing and 85% was due to final combustion in the vehicle. After 2007, due to more detailed analysis carried out largely by the California Air Resources Board and its consultants, the percentages, on average, were revised to: Crude exploration and production: 8%Crude and product transport: 1.5 %Crude refining: 13%Final combustion: 78% Thus, the entire “upstream” portion of the oil-to-gasoline life cycle is now considered to constitute 22%, and the final consumption by the motorist constitutes 78%, or almost four-fifths. So, if one accepts the thesis that we should blame someone for oil-related emissions, who is it – the producers, refiners, or consumers? Consumers, of course, are not easy to sue. In around 2006, a number of U.S. private foundations began a well-funded systematic campaign to vilify the Alberta oil sands, a campaign that some researchers in Canada have tracked in terms of the financing provided to environmental non-governmental organizations here.  The “war” on oil sands resulted in significantly more attention to the emissions associated with different types of crude oil, and claims that gasoline produced in the United States using Canadian synthetic crude oil produced up to 45% more CO2 emissions than that produced using conventional crude oil. In 2009, Jacob Consultancy completed a study for the Alberta Energy Research Institute in which it delved in far greater detail into the GHG emissions at each stage of the production to consumption cycle for crude oils consumed in the United States. The following PowerPoint presentation, delivered in 2011, summarizes the results. https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/article/2011/03/Jacobs%20Consultancy%20LCA%20Meeting%20March%2021.pdf One of the most interesting of the study findings was that there are a wide range of emissions associated with the many different domestic and foreign crude oils sold in the United States, and that natural gas flaring during production was of unexpected importance in differentiating among the different crude CO2 emission levels. In fact, the studies concluded that Canadian oil produced by mining and SAGD methods produce on average about 10% more, or 10 grams CO2 per megajoule more, than gasoline produced using the average of U.S. domestic and imported market crudes. CA TEOR, a type of heavy California crude oil produced by enhanced recovery, produces higher emissions than the oil sands crude. Canadian oil producers have been making considerable progress in reducing the energy intensity of their production techniques. According to a recent report on the Natural Resources Canada website, GHG emissions per barrel of oil produced in the oil sands have fallen by 29% since 2000. https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/facts/cru The “bottom line”, I would suggest, is that close to 80% of the CO2 equivalent emissions from oil occur at the final consumption (i.e. combustion) stage, so that is where environmental zealots or the municipalities that wish to support them should focus their blame. A few final comments about context would seem to be justified. According to the National Inventory of GHG emissions published by Environment and Climate Change Canada, Canada’s emissions in 2016 were 722 megatonnes. All emissions from transportation, including road, rail, marine and aviation modes were 173 megatonnes, and those from all passenger road vehicles were 93 megatonnes. So, the fuel consumption by Canada’s fleet of light duty vehicles (cars, SUVs and pickup trucks) constitutes 12.9 % of Canada’s GHG emissions. You could eliminate every one of them, and leave us all dependent on walking, cycling and horses, and you would only get slightly over one third of the way to Canada’s 30 % emissions reduction target by 2030. Even that would not cause a ripple in the ever-growing tide of global emissions.

Here are TEN REASONS to EXIT PARIS NOW:The science is NOT settled – hundreds of scientists in Australia and thousands more throughout the world reject the theory that human production of carbon dioxide is driving dangerous global warming. And the 102 computerised climate models have always predicted more warming than has occurred. (They got it right once, 39 years ago.)Source: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/06/28/173948/2. There is no unusual global warming. Since the last ice age ended there have been warm eras hotter than today’s modern warming – the warm peaks are getting lower, not higher. Climate has always changed in response to forces far greater than human activities. The endless procession of man-made scare campaigns about cooling, warming, ice melting, sea levels, ocean acidity, cyclones and droughts have all proved false.3. Carbon dioxide is NOT a pollutant – it is an invisible natural gas that supplies the whole food chain. More carbon dioxide is beneficial to the biosphere – forests, grasses and crops grow better thus benefitting all animal life that relies on plants.4. The populous world nations are unlikely to curb their CO2 emissions – China, India, Russia, Brazil, USA, Japan, SE Asia, Indonesia, Africa and the Arab world will ignore Paris limits.5. Despite 20 years of favourable promotion, subsidies, taxes, targets and propaganda the contribution of the intermittent energy producers (wind and solar) to world energy supplies is trivial – about 3% (see if you can find “solar” in the graph below.)Source: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/09/12/highlights-from-the-2018-bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy/6. Australian energy policies, taxes and targets are making electricity more costly and less reliable, hurting consumers and driving industry off-shore. And once they have ruined electricity and coal their next targets will be agriculture and motorists.7. With no nuclear power, no geothermal power, limited hydro potential and increasing barriers to gas exploration, Australia has few options except coal for cheap reliable grid power, and oil products for transport.8. With a huge continent, a small population and heavy reliance on exports, each Australian will be heavily penalised by the Paris Agreement for the emissions associated with exports consumed by others.9. Compliance with the Paris Agreement will destroy industries and jobs, encourage bureaucracy and transfer controls and money to affiliates of the United Nations.10. Should the world experience even modest cooling in the decades ahead Australia will urgently need increased supply of reliable power for homes and industry and the global atmosphere will need more carbon dioxide plant food.Viv ForbesExecutive Directorwww.saltbushclub.comforbes@saltbushclub.comhttps://saltbushclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/saltbush-members.pdfThis is the first Saltbush Chain Letter entitled Exit Paris Now.Make sure you pass it on to at least FIVE recipients within 48 hours or the fleas of one thousand camels from the Saltbush country will infect your armpits. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/01/20
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/01/20/co2-and-global-warming-and-climate-change/,,CO2 and Global Warming and Climate Change," Contributed by Howard Dewhirst, FGS © 2019Howard Dewhirst is part of a group of Fellows of the Geological Society of London who have challenged the society’s position on human-causation of global warming.Friends of Science Society spoke with him at the Basic Science of a Changing Climate Conference in Porto, Portugal,  September 2018.Despite 30 years of effort and many billions of dollars spent, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and  the world have failed utterly to stop the rise of human CO2 emissions. Is this because people don’t care, or is it becoming more and more obvious that the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) hypothesis is flawed? Warming has undoubtedly occurred and this century is warmer than the last two, but the world’s average temperature has hardly moved since 1998, while CO2 has increased by 30%.Half of the warming post the Industrial Revolution had already occurred by 1943, before the increase in human CO2 emissions that began around 1950, so what caused this warming?Since the start of the last century, there have been two periods of warming, the first without increased CO2, the second post 1978, with sharply increasing CO2 emissions. There have also been two periods of cooling/lack of warming, both of which were accompanied by increasing CO2. If CO2 causes warming, the world should have continued to warm since ~1950 when CO2 emissions began climbing higher and higher, but it did not. This discrepancy suggests that the IPCC AGW hypothesis, that human CO2 emissions cause warming, may be wrong.What the increase in atmospheric CO2 has done, is increase crop yields world-wide, by ~30%, with as yet, few serious side effects; so why do we need to cut emissions now? And if Australia reduced its current 407 Mt CO2 emissions to zero, what difference would it make? World human CO2 emissions in 2017 were 33,444 Mt (= just 4.3ppm gross addition to the atmosphere), with China contributing 9,330 Mt and USA 5,100 Mt.  Australia produced 427 Mt (~= 0.05ppm). And what would its removal cost us? Just look at South Australia where the price of electricity is double what it is in Canberra, and three times the price in the US; and the state’s share of the Australian economy has fallen from 8% in 1986 to 6% in 2017 as more and more factories close; now apply that to the whole country.Daily we are told that Climate Change disasters are crippling the planet, as weather becomes more and more extreme, but it is not. 2018 is the first year ever, without severe (>F3) tornadoes in USA; Australian cyclone frequency has fallen since 1971, droughts and rainfall are not more frequent or severe, bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef is not increasing, nor are el Niños. Cold oceans absorb CO2 so the warmer the seas get, the less so-called ‘acidification’ there is. Fire damage in California is increasing but not the numbers of fires, suggesting forest management is the problem, as it has been in Australia. The average number of very hot days in USA and Australia is not increasingSea level rise at Sydney harbour is a steady 7.5 cm per 100 years, and shows no sign of being affected by increasing CO2. Malaria will not spread as the globe warms, as it is not a solely tropical disease, (the world’s largest known epidemic was in Siberia in 1920s). Alpine glaciers are retreating – and have been doing so since about 1825; global warming began around 1695 at the beginning of the end of the Little Ice Age and sea level rise began around 1795, all well before human CO2 made an appearance.Arctic sea ice is shrinking (but has not disappeared as famously promised by Al Gore), Antarctic ice is getting thicker and polar bear numbers are increasing, as is Antarctic sea ice. Overall the claimed impacts of human induced CO2 emissions are not happening.Endlessly we are also told that 97% of scientists agree that human CO2 is the cause of global warming; the analysis was skewed.  Al Gore made it famous in his ‘Inconvenient Truth’ video, but it is a deception.https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf There probably is 97% agreement that CO2 emissions are increasing and that the planet has warmed, only dictators get a higher percent of support than that. What is not agreed is that the warming is dangerous and was caused by human CO2 emissions.Wrapped up in the 97% debate is another even more blatant manipulation of data to give false support to the IPCC AGW hypothesis – Climate Gate. In 2009, a few thousand emails were hacked from the University of East Anglia department that produces one of the five or so sets of international climate data that are used to measure the world’s average temperature.  The most relevant is from Phil Jones ‘I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temperatures to each series for the last 20 years (i.e. from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s, to hide the decline’  What used to be called the Nuclear Winter, was a period of declining world temperature from 1943 to 1978 which the authors of the emails identified as a problem for their IPCC warming story, and which was eventually removed from the record. Slowly but surely the world’s temperature data sets were massaged to make them fit the IPCC song sheet; called homogenisation, temperature data from earlier years were made colder and data from later periods was made warmer, to give the erroneous impression that the world’s average temperature had always increased since the start of the Industrial Revolution.The Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which saw the Vikings settle in Greenland as farmers, is well documented and appeared in the First Assessment Report in 1990 of the UN climate panel report (IPCC). In a later IPCC report, the now infamous ‘Hockey Stick’ was featured and also saw the light of day in Al Gore’s video. That representation erased that MWP period and showed temperatures declining slowly from 1000 AD, with a sudden up-tick when CO2 started to increase. This representation is now hotly debated, but it was very effective in the video in selling the idea that it was all human CO2 and all our fault.For:https://news.psu.edu/story/344876/2015/02/14/research/iconic-graph-center-climate-debate Against:https://climateaudit.org/2005/04/08/mckitrick-what-the-hockey-stick-debate-is-about/ Here is how the Medieval Warm Period was represented in the 1990 IPCC report.Much of the IPCC argument about CO2 driven global warming, is derived from computer models, and it is to honour the routinely wrong projections from these models that other players fudge and fiddle with temperature data. What is truly astonishing is that all but one of the 100 plus models used by the IPCC to sell their story, predict a much warmer future than actually occurs. Yet it is these models that governments use to define/decide climate and emissions policy.The IPCC’s AGW hypothesis claims that human CO2 alone has upset the balance of the world’s carbon budget, and this alone, drives global warming and climate change; however polar ice core data covering the last 800,000 years shows that atmospheric CO2 always responds to changes in temperature, in other words atmospheric CO2 is a result of global warming/cooling, not the driver. This is the inconvenient fact which all of the data manipulation above is designed to counteract. And it is not just the recent past that is inconvenient as the AGW idea can’t explain why the Ordovician/Silurian ice age took place when atmospheric CO2 was ten times higher than today, nor for the Late Jurassic ice age when CO2 was 6 times higher. Nor does it explain how CO2 rose 25 ppm from the beginning of the Holocene while the average temperature declined. The geological record is endlessly clear, CO2 does not cause warming – unless you want it to, and are prepared to ignore or manipulate inconvenient facts.The scientific method shows that “If a theory rules out certain possible occurrences, … it will be falsified if these possible occurrences do in fact occur.” CO2 lagging temperature for over 500 million years falsifies the untested AGW hypothesis again and again.The latest IPCC report claims that it needs just $2.4 trillion per year for 30 years to ‘prevent’ climate change, this is the prize money that keeps the global warming/Climate Change gravy train lubricated. And their failure to achieve any reduction in emissions despite 30 years of effort suggests that they will not succeed in the future, no matter how much money is spent.The question is, where have these IPCC based predictions ever been correct?All models predict warmer temperatures than occur, but less than AGW Hypothesis (it I NOT a theory) projectsModels predict tropical tropospheric warming which has never been detectedModels fail to hindcast or forecast any multi-decadal oscillations such as el NinoModel projections fail to agree with any balloon and satellite temperature dataModels fail to explain warming pre-1943 when human CO2 negligible, cooling from 1943 – 78 and from ~1998 when CO2 was increasingModels fail to explain high CO2 during interglacials and subsequent coolingModels fail to explain drop in hurricane frequency from ~1969 to 1994Models cannot explain lack of clear trends in rainfall patternsModels fail to explain how Human CO2 behaves differently to natural CO2Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon dioxide', 'climate change']",2019/01/20
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/01/20/hyperbole-over-sanity-lets-talk-climate-crisis/,Andrew Roman ,Hyperbole over Sanity? Let’s Talk Climate Crisis," By Michelle Stirling ©2019Originally submitted as a rebuttal to the Calgary Herald.Dr. Vipond and Noel Keough wrote a compelling op-ed in the Calgary Herald, published Dec. 29, 2018, to end 2018 on a high note of climate hyperbole.  They talk a doomsday scenario on climate change which is straight from the Book of Revelations, tying floods, wildfires, and hurricanes to the use of fossil fuels and human-caused global warming.As atmospheric scientist Dr. Judith Curry testified to the US Senate in 2014, “This premise is not strongly supported by the scientific evidence:  the science of climate change is not settled, and evidence reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 weakens the case for human factors dominating climate change in the 20th and early 21st centuries.”Curry goes on to explain that, “…  with the 15+ year hiatus in global warming [now some 20 years], there is growing appreciation for the importance of natural climate variability;  IPCC AR5 and SREX [Special Report on Extreme Weather] find little evidence that supports an increase in most extreme weather events that can be attributed to humans, and weather extremes in the U.S. were generally worse in the 1930’s and 1950’s than in recent decades.”Canadian climate scientist, Dr. Madhav Khandekar, past IPCC expert reviewer, World Meteorological Organization regional expert, former Environment Canada researcher, has studied extreme weather events extensively.  He concludes that extreme events are an integral part of climate and unrelated to the use of oil, gas and coal or carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. He notes that there are more uncertainties in the greenhouse gas theory of climate change today, than in 2000 when he wrote this report for the Alberta government.Climate policy analyst, Dr. Roger Pielke, Jr. has written two very thoughtful pieces on climate change.  “Misdefining ‘‘climate change’’: consequences for science and action” (2005) discusses confusion over the political definition of climate change and the scientific definition.  When people are talking climate catastrophe – they are referring to the political, not the scientific definition.A second commentary, “Opening up the policy envelope,” provides insight and perspective on IPCC reports that use the wildest, least likely scenario (known as RCP8.5) to arrive at catastrophic claims and improbable ‘solutions.’Oddly, Dr. Vipond and Keough push for rapid decarbonization – a policy that Prof. Kelly of Cambridge states would cause mass deaths. Belgian philosopher and jurist Drieu Godefridi warns that people should be wary of climate catastrophists and their humanicidal tendencies. Meantime, climate scientists around the world continue to find that carbon dioxide has ‘low climate sensitivity’ – meaning even a lot of carbon dioxide emissions from use of oil, gas or coal, results in a very nominal warming effect.So, where does the climate ‘crisis’ come from?  Matthew Nisbet has revealed that billionaire foundations with vested interests in “Big Climate” have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations (ENGO) worldwide. They hope to establish a global cap and trade system. For that you need willing victims for this Ponzi scheme and a price on carbon. Why a price on carbon? So that the Renewable Energy Certificates generated by the wind and solar plants become like printing money from hot air – the only trouble is, that money comes from the pockets of citizens, never to be seen again. But scare them enough…they’ll give in.These transnational, unelected, unaccountable organizations, like the UNPRI and CDP Worldwide are climate-obsessed and employ ‘climate crisis’ as a means of gaining compliance for GHG reporting from corporations, as well as carbon pricing/cap and trade policies from governments. Citizens are not consulted – but they don’t want to live in energy poverty! Witness the Yellow Vests protesting across France.While Dr. Vipond and Noel Keough spend much of their time demonizing Alberta oil and Albertans, they appear to have no geopolitical perspective – that our main competitor nations – the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, are busy selling product worldwide, unhindered by pipeline Blockadia or absurd climate policies at home or abroad.Meanwhile, our competitors laugh all the way to the bank; vulture investors snap up divested and demarketed Canadian fossil fuel shares, while we gnash our teeth in impotent, carbon-duped rage. Canadians are already paying a carbon tax equivalent of $170/t on fuel; the US pays zero carbon tax and the world average is $8/t.As Dr. Curry has testified, carbon dioxide is not a control knob that can fine tune climate, so there is no scientific or economic justification for a carbon tax or fossil fuel phase-out.  Destroying Alberta’s economy and making people poor will not save the planet. Limited public funds can be better spent adapting to changes in climate and being prepared for inevitable wildfires, floods and storms.Another good use of some public funds would be a special budget applied to evicting the foreign-funded Green Trade Warriors running rampant in Canada.Michelle Stirling is the Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/01/05/climate-hysteria-invades-maryland/,,Climate Hysteria Invades Maryland," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2019. Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years. On January 2, 2019 the Maryland Board of Public Works rejected a proposed right of way for a subsidiary of Trans Canada Pipelines that would carry natural gas produced in Pennsylvania to West Virginia. The Board concluded that the pipeline would “bring Maryland environmental problems without economic benefits”. The rejection came after 60 elected state representatives sent a letter urging the board members to reject the proposal. In doing so, they referred to the fact that Maryland had passed a law in 2017 to ban hydraulic fracturing to produce natural gas in Maryland. The letter included these statements:“Given that Maryland has banned fracking, it defies our state’s existing energy policy to bring the same public health risks to our residents by way of a pipeline… Moreover, enabling fossil fuel production runs counter to the state’s goals of increasing renewable energy production.”The letter also noted that the pipeline would cross at least 10 wetlands and 19 streams, in addition to the Potomac River. When reading stories like this, one is tempted to think that indeed alien invaders have landed and turned a substantial portion of the population into beings completely out of touch with reality and logic. For the sake of dampening the enthusiasm of any in Canada who might applaud decisions like that taken by the Maryland Board, let us dissect it. Natural Gas Production in Pennsylvania Has Nothing to Do with Fracking in Maryland Whatever the merits of Maryland’s decision to ban hydraulic fracturing within the state, they presumably concern the allegations that this production system may have adverse effects on earthquakes and on groundwater quality in Maryland. It is not the responsibility of the Maryland government or any of its agencies to make judgments about the safety of natural gas production techniques in other states. In fact, Pennsylvania has been a significant gas producer for many decades and has the fastest rate of production growth in the U.S. Pennsylvania is fully capable of judging how to protect its environment and economy. Constructing Natural Gas Pipelines Does Not Pose Undue Environmental Effects It should be obvious that construction of a pipeline to transport natural gas across Maryland poses none of the issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. Natural gas transmission pipelines have been built in the United States for over a century. As indicated in the following graphs, there are about 320,000 miles of gas transmission and gathering systems in the United States. Mileage of Natural Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines in the United States 2004-2017 Source: U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety AdministrationWhy, one wonders, would anyone think that natural gas pipeline systems will pose unacceptable local environmental risks in Maryland when no other state in the union has found this to be so? Those 320,000 miles of gathering and transmission lines cross millions of wetlands, rivers and lakes. Indeed, constructing gas pipelines so as to safely cross waterways has been part of the engineering of pipelines for decades. Systems for avoiding adverse water effects are constantly improving, not deteriorating. Blocking Natural Gas Supplies to Neighbouring States will Not Support Renewable Energy The natural gas that would have been transported by the Trans Canada system was intended for delivery to West Virginia, one of the poorest U.S. states, but one that is seeking to have additional natural gas supplies for residential, commercial and utility purposes. To the extent that the natural gas would have been used for power generation, it largely would have replaced coal-fired generation, as gas is a cheaper fuel. The State representatives’ argument that denying the pipeline right of way would “enable” fossil fuel production is clearly wrong, in that fossil fuel-based electricity generation in West Virginia has been going on for many decades, and will go on for many decades to come. Blocking one source of natural gas supply does not mean that one has blocked them all, and West Virginia and its residents will almost certainly continue to search for the lowest cost, as well as the most reliable, source of electricity generation. That is not wind and solar energy. By attempting to constrain West Virginia’s decision as to its future sources of energy, Maryland demonstrated similar presumption as it did in judging that Pennsylvania should not produce natural gas by hydraulic fracturing. The Arrogance of Environmentalists Canadians, and Albertans in particular, will recognize the actions of Maryland as similar to those of British Columbia and Quebec in blocking oil pipeline access to export markets. In all these cases, those who claim that humans are causing a global environmental problem are choosing to use their geographic position as a blunt tool to deprive their fellow citizens of access to energy markets and/or access to secure and competitively priced energy supplies. They are doing so when the amounts of energy and related emissions involved are tiny compared to the global growth in emissions, which are driven by Asian economies. In effect, they are imposing significant economic harm on others for no environmental gain. These actions should be identified and condemned wherever they occur. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2019/01/05
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/12/31/carbon-tax-information-for-canadians/,,Carbon Tax Information for Canadians," Canadians will have many challenges in the coming year – one of them is the argument for or against carbon taxes. Be informed.  Here’s a collection of some of our more useful and popular resources.  Most of our material is written in plain language – we do provide some more technical material here.  For those who don’t enjoy reading, we’ve included some short videos. Please share and discuss these with family, friends and business associates.Dr. Judith Curry explains why carbon dioxide is not a control knob that can fine tune climate.https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/curry-senatetestimony-2014-final.pdf William Nordhaus versus the United Nations on Climate Change Economicshttps://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2018/MurphyNordhaus.html Excerpt: Consider, now, the scenario “Limit temp. to 1.5°C.” Recall that this is the IPCC’s current policy goal and that various environmental analysts and pundits also embrace it. Because Nordhaus just won the Nobel Prize for his work on climate change, one might suppose that his model would provide support for the UN’s goal. It doesn’t. As Table 1 indicates, Nordhaus’s model—at least as of its 2007 calibration—estimated that such a policy goal would make humanity $14 trillion poorer compared to doing nothing at all about climate change. Moreover, the $14 trillion magnitude of the net damages from the wrong policy—including what is now the UN’s goal—dwarfs the $3.07 trillion size of the net benefits from even the best theoretically possible policy. In light of Nordhaus’s calculations shown above, the apparently urgent need for “climate action” is not so urgent. It now looks more analogous to economists discovering the theoretical possibility of an “optimal tariff” but still understanding that free trade is the safest rule of thumb. Carbon Tax Reports, Video ClipsLet Them Eat Carbon: Rebutting Ecofiscal Commissionhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Let-Them-Eat-Carbon-FINAL-R-1-April-18-2018.pdfVideo: https://youtu.be/xBYbtQRzV2kCheckstop: Challenging the Canadian Federal Government’s Carbon Pollution Pricing Results report:http://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Challenging-the-Canadian-Federal-Government-FINAL-R-2-May-2-2018.pdfCarbon Kleptomania (Is there really such a thing as a carbon ‘dividend’??)https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Carbon-Kleptomania.pdfVideo: https://youtu.be/4jhvSyQ9Z2EAlberta Climate Plan – A Burden with No Benefit (technical)https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/AB_Climate%20Plan_Economic_Impact_Gregory_Tech.pdf McKitrick on Climate Change –a Plain Language Guide to Social Costs of Carbon (Carbon Taxes)https://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/McKitrick_Climate_Change_SCC_Feb_14_2015.pdf14 short, plain language video clips with Dr. Ross McKitrick, professor of economics at the University of Guelph, that explain carbon taxes and their failingsDr. McKitrick’s full presentation is here: (technical in nature)https://friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=750UN CLIMATE PANEL (IPCC) – We dispute their findings.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/12/31/the-humanicidal-temptation-of-environmentalism/,,The Humanicidal Temptation of Environmentalism," Originally published in French:La tentation humanicide de l’écologismeby Drieu Godefridi ©2018(an English translation)Fascinating fertility of the human spirit which, over the centuries, continues to generate theories and new ideologies, more fanciful than the others. Whimsical, and often dangerous; the history of the twentieth century of abundance testifies to it. It is forgotten, but Marxism was originally offered as a scientific theory; Marx claimed to describe the workings of history and to predict – not to advocate – the revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat, then the advent of classless, and ultimately stateless society. Marxism as a science, a hundred times refuted since the works of the socialist critic Eduard Bernstein, a thousand times refuted by the facts, is no longer claimed as such only by small, very local sects. The great ideology of our time is ecologism/environmentalism (in the sense of political ecology). Oh, nothing new. National Socialism, also supported by scientific pretensions, claimed its proximity to nature; thus the “Aryan brute” was deemed more “natural” and “healthy” than his nemesis, the merchant, the bourgeois, the Jew. This shoddy pseudo-science was quickly swept away by the wind of history, a great disinfectant of reason. In its contemporary version, ecologism/environmentalism is born of an improbable theoretical matrix, in which are mixed hostility to the technique (Jünger, Heidegger, Habermas), Malthusianism (Thomas Malthus, anti-humanist author at the turn of the XVIII and Nineteenth century, Paul Ehrlich) and what is called “deep-ecology”, or deep ecology (Hans Jonas), is the belief that man is not only a danger to man, but that he ‘inscribed in a fundamentally antagonistic relationship with nature. Contemporary environmentalism is an antihumanism in the strict sense. At best, man is perceived as a danger and a nuisance to contain; at worst, as a proliferating virus that needs to be eradicated. In this way, environmentalism breaks radically with the entire Judeo-Christian tradition, which makes man the seat of meaning and morality. In the Torah, Abraham enjoins men to stop worshiping trees, such as pagans, to understand that there is reason and meaning only in man. No need to multiply theoretical considerations. Because our thesis is shown, very simply, by the claims of contemporary ecologists. Let’s take two examples. During a conference given in September 2018 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7sMZiSKmqg), the astrophysicist Aurélien Barrau, member of the management committee of the Grenoble-Alpes Center for Theoretical Physics and the laboratory of excellence ENIGMASS, head of the master of subatomic physics and cosmology of Grenoble, member of the National Committee for Scientific Research (CNRS), explained that man is a nuisance to nature, and that our destructive behavior (for the macrofauna “) are unfortunately inherent, not only to what we do, but to what we are. The problem is obviously ontological, according to Barrau. Man, explains our physicist, is a weak creature, incapable of reasoning on a “collective scale”, in fact a sickly being. “Therefore, we need concrete, coercive, unpopular political measures that oppose our individual liberties, and we can not do otherwise.” Terrible sentence! A regime that suppresses individual freedoms – to move, to heat, to dress, to undertake, to circulate, to create, to found a family – is not only “authoritarian”. Such a regime is totalitarian in the strict sense, aiming to regulate the life – the survival – of men down to the smallest detail of their deeds and actions. This is what I called the totalitarian temptation of environmentalism. In an interview with “Libération” dated July 29, 2018 (Originally at: https://www.liberation.fr/planete/2018/07/29/francois-marie-breon-la-te-four-le-climat-is-contraire- -aux-libertes-individuelles_1669641), the climatologist François-Marie Bréon of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences (IPSL), author of the IPCC (UN political body on climate) explains that we must imperatively give up the heating, tourism, simply shutting down entire sectors of our economies, and finally giving up individual freedoms and democracy, all of which are incompatible with the fight against CO2 emissions. Still these measures will be insufficient, specifies this distinguished climatologist. For the only measure capable of preserving the environment would be to divide humanity by ten. Mr. Bréon remains in default of specifying how to get rid of nine tenths of humanity. This is what I call the humanistic temptation of environmentalism, perfectly consistent with its theoretical foundations. We must take environmentalism seriously. Not as science, because political ecology is not more scientific than were Marxism or National Socialism. We must take environmentalism seriously because this ideology brings claims that are more totalitarian and humanicidal. and more radical than any of its predecessors.Drieu Godefridi is author of “IPCC – A Scientific Body?”https://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=drieu+godefridi+IPCC+political+or+scientific The original French version is “Le GIEC est mort: Vive la Science”https://www.amazon.fr/GIEC-est-mort-Vive-science/dp/2960047370 He also authored: “La Revolution Trump”https://www.amazon.ca/r%C3%A9volution-Trump-Drieu–Godefridi/dp/2930650141 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'environmentalism']",2018/12/31
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/12/31/priorities-for-the-bush/,,Priorities for the Bush," News from our friends “Down Under”31 December 2018Priorities for the Bush.The enemies of the bush (resident in green-and-pleasant Brisbane) want to close the Queensland pastoral colleges in droughty Longreach and Emerald.It’s time for the Feds to act – slash spending on the climate alarm and climate tourism industries and use the money to save these threatened colleges.For too long tax payers have watched federal agencies like CSIRO waste money on climate models that do not work, on carbon accounting that is not needed, on never-ending climate jamborees, and on re-invention of “carbon farming”.Our great pastoral industries need trade-skilled people with relevant academic knowledge. They do not need lectures from city academics in green uniforms who are often hostile to rural industry.Farming parents would prefer their taxes were spent on local colleges educating their sons and daughters in practical skills rather than sending them to the coast to learn how to smoke pot, drink beer, buy ice and follow the green religion.Our rural food bowl is far more important to Australia than all the tax-supported climateers with their dodgy science, biased forecasts and green propaganda.Viv Forbesvforbes@bigpond.comWashpool   Qld AustraliaDisclosure: Viv Forbes is Executive Director of the Saltbush Club.   www.saltbushclub.comShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['agriculture', 'climate change']",2018/12/31
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/12/29/globe-and-mail-editorial-or-climate-activism/,Ron Little ,Globe and Mail – Editorial or Climate Activism?," Op-ed contributed by Michelle Stirling © 2018. Michelle Stirling is Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society.Like many things in the world of climate change, conflicts of interest appear to abound in a Dec. 25, 2018 Globe and Mail editorial entitled: “Politicians are robbing from the future to pay for the present.”The editorial takes a shot at Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, claiming his reference to ‘intergenerational theft’ on debt, could be applied to the issue of carbon taxes (which the Conservatives oppose) and climate change, which the Globe and Mail editorial team insists requires us to rein in greenhouse gas emissions to ensure a live-able planet tomorrow.It is problematic that the editor-in-chief of the Globe and Mail is also a Senior VP, Office of the CEO of the Royal Bank of Canada.*  Royal Bank touts climate change as “one of the most pressing issues of our time” and curiously claims “In December 2015, nearly 200 governments adopted the Paris Agreement, a legally-binding international agreement…”[1]*Note: Globe and Mail states on their updated May 2, 2018 editorial board page: “John Stackhouse is Editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail.” Royal Bank on their RBC Wealth Management page about Mr. Stackhouse as VP state:  “Prior to this, John was editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail (2009-14).”Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior, writes in “The COP21 Agreement – Just the Facts, Please” that the COP21 Paris Agreement is voluntary and legally non-binding.[2] We know that the Paris Agreement is legally non-binding because President Trump pulled the USA out of Paris.This means that Canada can leave at anytime, the sooner the better.  To meet Paris targets, Lyman explains in his presentation “Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?”[3] what the impact of Paris greenhouse gas reduction targets would be for Canada.“Assuming that emissions do not grow one bit over the next 32 years as a result of increased economic activity or increased population, achieving a 50 per cent emissions reduction from 2005 levels would mean reducing emissions to 369 megatonnes CO2 equivalent. That is comparable to completely eliminating the current emissions from oil and gas production, electricity generation, and all emissions-intensive industries like mining, petrochemicals, auto and parts manufacturing, iron, steel and cement. Gone. Achieving the aspirational goal of 80 per cent reduction recommended by the IPCC would mean reducing emissions to 147 megatonnes CO2 equivalent. That would be comparable to reducing Canada’s per capita emissions and our energy economy to the current levels of Bolivia, Sudan or Iraq.”Why isn’t the Globe and Mail reporting on that?Is it a conflict of interest for Mr. Stackhouse to also be promoting Smart Prosperity[4] while sitting as Editor-in-Chief[5] of a major Canadian newspaper (with a reported readership of 7.4 million people across all platforms) and VP of a major bank?  Globe and Mail’s editorial code of conduct is here.Smart Prosperity is pushing “Clean Growth” – a sector that Robert Lyman describes as a “Clean Growth Hallucination”.[6] As discussed in a compilation of Robert Lyman’s “Subsidies to Solar and Wind Energy in Canada – an Inventory,”[7] these so-called “clean” industries typically survive on tax subsidies and special treatment, often with a pass on environmental issues and enhanced incentives and goodies like flow-through shares.  As illustrated in our report “Grounded in Reality,”[8] Smart Prosperity’s demand for accelerated clean tech fails to appreciate that competitor nations are succeeding, not because of their clean-tech sector, but because they have ample port access and most have large merchant marines.While the Globe and Mail laud carbon taxes as a means that “..most conservative economists believe is the most efficient way to curb emissions…” they don’t reference the view of Dr. Ross McKitrick, who has pointed out that carbon taxes are far too high, because they are calibrated to climate models that run far too hot.[9]They don’t reference economist Dr. Richard Tol, past lead author of the UN’s 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report who left the panel and refused to sign the report because it was too exaggerated and apocalyptic. He is quoted as saying: “The organization is being led and controlled by people who have a stake in climate policy.”[10]Tol has developed an economic model that assesses the relative benefits and damages of warming.  His FUND model estimates that Canada benefits by over six billion CAD dollars per year thanks to the recent moderate warming and the net benefits continually increase throughout the 21 century. .[11]Perhaps the Globe and Mail was referring to Ecofiscal Commission economists? We rebut their report with “Let Them Eat Carbon.”So who are the people who have a stake in climate policy?  Well, all the signatories to the UNPRI – UN Principles for Responsible Investment.  This is a transnational, unelected, unaccountable, exclusive club of institutional investors and major banks and corporations, all of whom must ‘comply or explain’ once they sign on to this ‘voluntary’ organization. Some of the founders are Canada’s largest pension funds, Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management, the UN Joint Chiefs of Staff pension fund, etc.[12] In 2014, the UNPRI had pension funds sign the Montreal pledge, to get out there and push “climate laggard” corporations and governments in Canada, Australia and the US to get on the climate change hysteria bandwagon.  Institutional investors became activists!In Canada, NEI Investments was identified and lauded by the UNPRI as one of the most active on that file.  NEI delivered a letter to Premier Notley on Sept. 8, 2015, with a list of what they thought the Alberta Climate Plan should be…and voila.[13]They and their 120 signatories, most of whom have little or no geographic or national relationship to Canada (i.e. Church of Sweden pension fund) have caused Albertans to have a crippling carbon tax, phase-out of coal (putting 7,000 people out of work; 30 communities destroyed), cap on oil sands production and an addition of the virtually useless wind and solar to the Alberta power grid, destroying Alberta’s last economic advantage for industry.Would it not be appropriate for the Globe and Mail to provide full disclosure of these apparent conflicts of interest related to its editorial board, not to mention that the Globe and Mail is owned by Woodbridge Company Ltd, the majority owner of Thomas Reuters which has swallowed climate change, hook line and sinker?The Globe editorial then tries to take a shot at Scheer on the issue of preserving a financial benefit for future generations in the form of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, while mocking Alberta’s Heritage Trust Fund, where Norway got the idea.  The Globe claims the Norwegian Fund is worth $1.3-trillion; let’s not forget Norway’s External Debt reached 651.3 USD bn in Jun 2018.[14] Let’s also remember that Norway is a (tiny) country of 5 million people, ringed by open water and dotted with ports; Alberta is just a land-locked province of 4.2 million people, blocked by its confederation “partners” on east and west coasts from reaching any markets.https://mapfight.appspot.com/ca-vs-no/canada-norway-size-comparison Back in 2013 the headlines talked about Norway’s “mythical wealth”: “At three-quarters of a trillion dollars, the Norwegian Oil Fund appears to provide plenty for a country with scarcely 5 million citizens.  Yet the country has accumulated a foreign debt that, at $657 billion, is almost as massive.  Subtracting the debt from the fund’s $740 billion leaves a balance of only $83 billion.” In 14 Years (2000-2014) Alberta sent $200 Billion to the Federal Government. Imagine had Alberta kept that money for itself. So had we kept those $s in 2014 we would have had at least $218 billion and any investment growth, which would have been significantly greater than the $83 billion Norway had then.And speaking of carbon taxes and Norway, one should remember Norway is a tiny country where most of the population live in dense centers around the coast. Sea freight is the cheapest form of transport in the world. Norway is also about 97% hydro powered.A 2004 peer-reviewed paper on carbon tax effect in Norway’s decade long “ambitious climate policy” says that:“While the partial effect from lower energy intensity and energy mix changes was a reduction in CO2 emissions of 14 percent, the carbon taxes contributed to only 2 percent reduction..”[15]They summarize by saying:“In the wake of the Brundtland commission (United Nations, 1987), Norway has been one of the most devoted advocates for more ambitious climate policies. Carbon taxes were implemented in 1991 and received broad attention in the policy debate. The highest carbon tax rate was US$51 per tonne CO2 in 1999, and the average tax was US$21 per tonne CO2. This is among the highest carbon taxes in the world, and average tax is three to four times higher than the most common estimates for the quota price in the Kyoto Protocol. Our study shows that despite politically ambitious carbon taxes, this policy measure has had only a modest influence on GHG emissions.”In a fossil-fuel dependent country like Canada, of vast distances and cold, dark winters, where our present fuel taxes (federal and provincial combined) add up to an equivalent $170/t carbon tax, how much more can we bear without bankrupting the people and running business offshore?But more important, the federal government claimed it would rely on evidence-based science for policy. In this case, a carbon tax is completely useless. Since 2002, scientists have known that carbon dioxide industrial emissions are not the main driver of climate change. In 2005, a large group of leading scientists convened to discuss a new metric as the radiative forcing theory (greenhouse gas) was not viable to properly ascribe climate forcing agents.“New studies on climate forcing agents not conventionally considered have, however, raised doubts as to the continued viability of the radiative forcing concept. For example, the climatic effects from light-absorbing aerosols or land-use changes do not lend themselves to quantification using the traditional radiative forcing concept. Aerosol effects on clouds are difficult to describe in terms of simple radiative forcing. These challenges have raised the question of whether the radiative forcing concept has outlived its usefulness and, if so, what new climate change metrics should be used.”[16]In 2013, in the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 report, it was revealed that warming had stagnated since before Kyoto was ratified, despite a significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration.  This stagnation was not projected by any of the climate models (computer simulations), all of which were running two to three times hotter than observed temperatures. That means there has been no warming of any statistical significance for some 20 years now. Dr. Judith Curry testified to the US Senate in 2014 that carbon dioxide is not a control knob that can fine tune climate; attempts to reduce carbon dioxide as a “precautionary principle” may be futile in the face of natural variations of the sun and earth’s internal systems (volcanoes, ocean currents, atmospheric oscillations).  Dr. John Christy testified to the US Senate Mar. 29, 2017, referencing IPCC material, on the influence of natural variability as the driver of climate change, as opposed to greenhouse gases.A further element, not discussed by climate obsessed financiers like Michael Bloomberg or Mark Carney who circulate in Mr. Stackhouse’s world of banking, is the so-called “climate sensitivity” of carbon dioxide – meaning the effect carbon dioxide has on changing the climate.  Over the years, researchers have progressively set the sensitivity lower and lower, meaning that if there is a low sensitivity to carbon dioxide, even if there is lots of carbon dioxide, warming will be nominal; some scientists claim there is a saturation point after which there would be no more warming.  NOAA noted in 2010 that stratospheric water vapour is the ‘wild card’ in global warming.[17]As reported by Matthew Nisbet in 2018, much of the climate hysteria has its roots in a billionaire foundation, dedicated to instituting a global cap-and-trade system. They have been funding environmental groups for over a decade for more than $600 million a year, world-wide, to accomplish that goal.  This is confirmed in the ClimateWorks Wikileaks material.ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165Why are these revelations not front-page news at the Globe and Mail?Why is “Carbon Kleptomania”[18] not an editorial feature at the Globe and Mail?  Why isn’t the “Alarming Scope of Future Carbon Taxes[19] front page news at the Globe and Mail?  This is potentially breathtaking intergenerational theft  that would be accomplished by establishing a carbon tax, a tax based on questionable science. This policy is being advocated for by a news outlet whose editorial team, associates and owners have curious climate or carbon-related interests that don’t appear to meet the Globe and Mail’s neutrality, objectivity, and stated apolitical policy in their Code of Conduct.Is that editorializing or plain old climate activism?—–The Paris Climate Fraud – John Stossel Robert Lyman: Climate Change Policy – A Threat to CanadaRobert Lyman – Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?[1] http://www.rbc.com/community-sustainability/_assets-custom/pdf/RBC_ClimateChangePosition_Disclosure_Statement_2017.pdf[2] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/09/the-cop21-agreement-just-the-facts-please/[3] http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/05/10/can-canada-survive-climate-change-policy/[4] https://www.smartprosperity.ca/leaders/john-stackhouse[5] https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/the-globe-and-mail-editorial-board/article4203446/[6] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/19/the-clean-growth-hallucination/[7] http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/11/05/subsidies-to-solar-and-wind-energy-in-canada-an-inventory/[8] http://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/grounded-in-reality-may-03-2017-final.pdf[9] https://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/McKitrick_Climate_Change_SCC_Feb_14_2015.pdf[10] https://nltimes.nl/2014/04/08/dutch-professor-leaves-un-climate-panel[11]  “Calculating the ‘Social Cost’ of CO2 Emissions Using FUND” and “The Economic Impact of  Greenhouse Gas Emissions“[12] https://www.unpri.org/pri[13] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/08/08/an-open-letter-to-clients-and-investors-of-nei-investments/[14] https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/norway/external-debt[15] Greenhouse gas emissions in Norway: do carbon taxes work? https://doi.org/10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00151-4[16] https://www.nap.edu/read/11175/chapter/1#vii[17] https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/news/2010/stratospheric_water_vapor_impacts_global_warming.html[18] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Carbon-Kleptomania.pdf[19] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/29/the-alarming-scope-of-future-of-carbon-taxes-in-canada/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Andrew Scheer', 'carbon tax', 'climate change', 'Ecofiscal Commission']",2018/12/29

They also create tides in the oceans and ground waters as well as “Earth Tides” in crustal rocks that affect the timing of Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.“The ancient Greeks and Egyptians, South African water engineers and Australia’s most famous weather forecaster, Inigo Jones, all knew that the sun was a key factor in weather/rainfall cycles. Most of the world’s calendars are based on movements in the solar system, and ancient monuments from Stonehenge, to the Pyramids, to the Americas are testament to the pervasive influence of sun and planets in human history.Source: https://carbon-sense.com/2016/02/14/cycles-control-climate/#more-1559“Solar cycles have been observed for over 2,000 years and sunspots have been recorded in detail since the invention of the telescope in 1610. This record shows that cold periods like the Little Ice Age have coincided with periods of low sunspot numbers.“David Archibald’s analysis of solar activity suggests that the sun has driven a warming phase since about 1900 but probably entered a new cooling phase about 2006.“A new cooling era would play havoc with world food supply, and those who rely on unreliable wind/solar energy will regret their choices.“With reckless bravado, foolish Western politicians and their minions have placed all of our bets on an old fading gelding called “Global Warming”. They have not noticed a vigorous white stallion, “Global Cooling” which is racing down the straight.“Even a small cooling will reduce world food supply in three ways.“Firstly, any reduction in surface temperature will reduce crop growth and growing season in all sub-polar regions.“Secondly, reduced solar radiation will reduce evaporation from the oceans and must reduce precipitation on land.“And, worst of all, cooling surface temperature on the oceans will cause oceans to absorb more carbon dioxide plant food, so plant/crop growth will be lower than in today’s warm well-fertilised atmosphere.“Carbon dioxide has never driven world climate and will play an even smaller part in future.”The first Saltbush “Solar Activity Watch” by David Archibald can be found here:http://saltbushclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/solar-activity.pdfDavid can be contacted at 0410 664853Viv ForbesExecutive Directorwww.saltbushclub.comhttp://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/saltbush-members.pdfWashpool  Qld  Australia0409 2777 94Further Reading:Cosmic Cycles, not carbon dioxide control climate:https://carbon-sense.com/2016/02/14/cycles-control-climate/#more-1559The Sunspot Cycle:https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtmlSunspots and Rainfall Cycles:https://carbon-sense.com/2008/05/26/alexander-2008/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2018/12/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/12/25/the-inner-sanctums-of-climate-change-propaganda/,,The Inner Sanctums of Climate Change Propaganda," Contributed by William Walter Kay BA LL B © 2018See more of William Kay’s work at: http://www.ecofascism.com/index.htmlThe Inner Sanctums of Climate Change PropagandaWilliam Walter Kay BA LL BAt the close of the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco (September 14, 2018) twenty-nine foundations signed a communique heralding the “largest climate-related philanthropic commitment ever made.” The foundations pledged $4 billion (over 5 years) to the Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) campaign. Nat Simons, Sea Change Foundation co-founder, hastened to add:“The multi-billion commitment announced today is only a down payment.”The 29 signatories are hardly the full complement of CAGW-funding philanthropies. Moreover, philanthropy’s overall contribution to the CAGW crusade is bested by businesses from the Climate Industrial Complex, and by government environment and energy agencies. That said, philanthropic money, being the least encumbered of the funds empowering this campaign, tends to steer the ship.Too much attention goes to clumsy movement dinosaurs like Greenpeace, and to celebrity scientists and ephemeral enviro-ministers. Far more important personages inhabit the nexus between Big Green philanthropy and certain academic faculties honing the cutting-edge techniques of Climate Change Communication.*The Yale Program for Climate Change Communication (YPCCC) styles itself thusly:“We conduct scientific research on public climate change knowledge, attitudes, policy preferences and behaviours and the underlying psychological, cultural and political factors that influence them.”YPCCC is a branch of America’s oldest green academy: the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. YPCCC cooperates with the Yale Center for Business and Environment and the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy.YPCCC is funded by 8 philanthropies and 2 government agencies; the latter being: National Oceans and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Science Foundation (NSF). Notable among the former are four Global Climate Action Summit signatories (MacArthur Foundation, Heising-Simons Foundation, Grantham Foundation and Energy Foundation).The “flow-through” Energy Foundation pools funds from 23 philanthropies in order to distribute them in an orderly fashion. Energy Foundation donors include 10 Global Climate Action Summit signatories.YPCCC dates to a 2005 Aspen confab summoned by Yale’s School of Forestry whereat 100 environmental, business, media, religious and political chieftains agreed upon the battle plan: Americans and Climate Change: Closing the Gap between Science and Action.YPCCC’s dozen-strong faculty have PhDs in enviro-studies, psychology or political science; and careers straddling the academic-activist divide. YPCCC boasts 18 PhD Research Affiliates (4 from George Mason University, 2 from other Yale departments). YPCCC’s 33 doctoral students specialise in social media, video production, and/or digital advertising.Prior to becoming YPCCC Director in 2007 Anthony Leiserowitz (PhD, Human Geography) had been: Senator William Faust’s (D MI) assistant; an Aspen Global Change Institute coordinator; and a JFK School of Government consultant. Leiserowitz currently adorns the Copenhagen-based KR Foundation’s 5-member board; which grants $20 million a year to enviro-causes.Leiserowitz’s YPCCC crew conduct: public opinion polling; climate messaging research; surveys and experiments. They map national and international attitudes and behaviours. They publish reports and papers. They provide public presentations (and private briefings). YPCCC research is used by: CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, and the Guardian.YPCCC does more than observe and report. YPCCC subsidiary Yale Climate Connections partners with: Pulitzer Center, Thomson Reuters, and CNN spin-off One Big Story; and with start-ups: H2O Radio, This Planet, and I See Change, to run a news service that rolls-out broadcast-quality articles and videos on topics ranging from religious mores to extreme weather.Climate Connections funds and supervises ChavoBart Digital Media whose daily 90-second climate-related radio shows are broadcast on 400 American radio stations. ChavoBart, a private company, serves a dozen conservation NGOs. ChavoBart makes “actionable information.”Climate Connections reaches an additional audience of hundreds of thousands through Twitter, Linked-in and Facebook. Climate messaging goes out. Data comes in.Bud Ward oversees Climate Connections’ 3 full-time staff and 17 regular contributors. Ward has been an enviro-journalist since 1974 and an enviro-journalist organiser since 1988. After the Cold War, Ward created the foundation-funded Central European Environmental Journalism Review. Ward collaborates with the: UN, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Society of Environmental Journalists. Ward, a regular National Public Radio guest, was George Mason University’s 2009 “Climate Communicator of the Year.”*In 2007 YPCCC, and the foundation-funded Environmental Defense, co-launched George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication (GMU4C). YPCCC and GMU4C co-produce the annual: Climate Change and the American Mind.GMU4C’s principal professors are Ed Maibach and Connie Roser-Renouf. Former PR exec, Maibach is a senior member of the National Climate Assessment. He was lead speaker at a White House press event and has addressed the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Connie Roser-Renouf is active in the National Academy of Sciences and runs a national program facilitating CAGW museum exhibits. She was lead author of Global Warming’s Six Americas and the 2016 Elections – a much-referenced document, co-produced with YPCCC.GMU4C funding comes from NASA, NOAA and NSF; and from several philanthropies including Energy Foundation and Grantham Foundation. The latter, a movement dark-horse, was founded in 1997 by British-born octogenarian Jeremy Grantham of the Boston-based Grantham, Mayo, van Otterloo investment firm ($70 billion under management). Grantham, an avowed corporatist, divulges few details about his philanthropy.GMU4C employs 46 faculty and staff and 8 doctoral students. GMU4C boasts 18 affiliated professors and 5 partnering journalism societies.In 2009, together with foundation-funded Climate Central, GMU4C began an initiative aimed at fusing public health with climate change. This partnership liaises with medical societies to discover the “health harms of climate change.” A 2016 conference on this topic attracted 9 medical societies. In 2018 they launched the Medical Society Consortium for Climate and Health. Presently, 5 national medical associations partner with GMU4C.In 2009, with NSF funding, GMU4C began converting media weathercasters into climate educators. This initiative, Climate Matters, partners with the American Meteorological Society, NOAA and NASA. In 2014 Climate Matters’ pet weathercaster interviewed President Obama regarding climate change. (GMU4C claims their polling convinced Obama to speak more about climate.)Climate Matters provides weekly CAGW awareness packages to 600 weathercasters. Thanks to this program 75% of Americans have CAGW messaging surreptitiously insinuated into their weather reports. CAGW/weather combo reports have increased 17-fold since 2012.(A key Climate Change Communication metric is the percentage of people believing current weather to be CAGW-influenced. One of the most effective mechanisms for shifting people from CAGW scepticism to CAGW acceptance involves instilling the idea that local weather is becoming “weird.”)*The trajectory of the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Climate Science (ORECS) exposes academic trends. Circa 2015, ORECS began soliciting climate science papers for content in marketable encyclopedia sets and handbooks. A team of 40 distinguished advisers and editors (dominated by Germans and Scandinavians) was convened and papers appeared. Tellingly, ORECS immediately spawned the semi-autonomous Oxford Encyclopedia of Climate Change Communication to:“…examine the origin and evolution of our understanding of climate change as presented in communication and media, including their effects on public opinion and policy.”Moreover, of the 206 science papers ORECS published, 119 are Communications papers. Other papers deal with politics and policy. Papers actually dealing with climate science comprise only 30% of the climate science encyclopedia. Persuasion is what persuasion science does.Oxford Encyclopedia of Climate Change Communication Editor-in-Chief Matthew Nisbet got his PhD in Communications from Cornell and now teaches at Northeastern. Nisbet, an AAAS consultant, is also Editor-in-Chief of Environmental Communication – the International Environmental Communication Association’s journal. Environmental Communication’s editorial board overlaps with Nisbet’s encyclopedia board. Connie Roser-Renouf is also on EC’s board. Nisbet, the author of 75 papers, is: “among the most influential communication researchers of his generation.”*Europeans spearhead Climate Change Communication science, although they do not always name it such. One node is Hamburg U’s Center for Sustainability and Climate Change Management. To aid their interdisciplinary and educational programming work they hosted the World Symposium on Climate Change Communication in Graz, Austria (2018).In 2016 Sweden’s Chalmers University of Technology hosted 25 “climate denial” specialists. This conference was the brainchild of Professor Martin Hultman. Attending via Skype from Oklahoma was Hultman’s inspiration, Professor Riley Dunlap.Dunlap’s study of climate scepticism among American conservative men, Cool Dudes, so impressed Hultman he did a knock-off on Norwegians also titled Cool Dudes. Hultman reckons 63% of Norway’s “conservative” men are “deniers” (compared to 36% of Norway’s overall population).In 2018 Hultman kicked-off his Center for Studies of Climate Change Denialism (CEFORCED) – the world’s first research institute dedicated to denialism. CEFORCED is hosted by Chalmers University and funded by the Swedish Energy Agency. CEFORCED has recruited 40 research affiliates from around the world.CEFORCED is the Swedish government’s reaction to homegrown climate sceptical groups like Stockholm Initiative and Climate Sense, and the more worrisome “Right-Wing Populist” Swedish Democrats, who audaciously challenge meteorological authorities’ climate pronouncements.*Understanding Right-wing Populism (RWP) is a Climate Change Communication priority. Professor Lockwood’s Right-wing populism and the Climate Change Agenda (2018) relays what his scholarly peers deem the Right-Wing Populist’s universal lament:“…this is our polity, in which we, the democratic sovereign, have a right to practise government by the people, but we have been shut out of power by corrupt politicians and an unrepresentative elite who betray our interests, ignore our opinions, and treat us with contempt.”This is not a “right-wing” statement; it is a pro-democracy statement. Lockwood concedes:“…the core populist ideology does not fit neatly into the conventional left-right ideological dimension.”According to Lockwood, populists are rebelling against the fact that:“…mainstream political parties have become more technocratic and converged on a centre-right policy agenda around a middle-class voter, and a cartelization of politics.”Populists are economic nationalists resisting the UN and EU. Populists want national governments, not supranational bureaucracies, to set policy. As CAGW is the supranational issue par excellence, populist climate scepticism is merely collateral damage of a broader rejection of globalism.The Comparative Manifesto Project analysed the climate views of 13 European RWP parties. Four were climate sceptical (British National Party, UK Independence Party, Danish People’s Party and Italy’s Northern League). Eight were climate silent or climate ambiguous. Only Greece’s LAOS embraced CAGW orthodoxy.Most European RWP parties do not reject CAGW; preferring to marginalise climate and focus on immigration. Austria’s Freedom Party, Hungary’s Fidesz and Jobbik, and Finland’s Finn Party avoid climate. When pressed, they express mild scepticism not outright rejection. Nevertheless, climate is a watershed issue. Mainstream (non-populist) parties explicitly endorse CAGW science and mitigation.Many European RWP parties are pro-nuclear. Some are pro-renewables (Austrian Freedom Party, Danish People’s Party and Hungary’s Jobbik). All oppose enviro-taxes. Poland’s Law and Justice Party is pro-coal and only begrudgingly complies with EU diktat regarding renewables. Germany’s Alliance for Democracy (AfD) is pro-coal, pro-nuclear and hostile to renewable subsidies. Many AfDers express climate scepticism, however when the topic surfaced at their 2016 national convention an unbridgeable fissure opened.American populism surfaced not as an independent party but as a Republican faction. Tea Party Republicans are the stoutest organised expression of CAGW rejection. According to Dunlap, by 2008 “climate change denial” had become “a virtual litmus test for Republican political candidates.” Trump won Tea Partier hearts by calling climate change as a hoax.*CAGW Communicators are prohibited, upon pain of ostracism, from doubting CAGW. Hence CAGW disbelief must be attributed to failings of the heretics, not to flaws in CAGW. Six failings are proffered:Confirmation Bias – deniers only seek evidence validating denial;Libertarianism – libertarians would rather deny science than accept solutions requiring government intervention;Dunning-Kruger Effect – deniers have low intellectual abilities and delusions of superiority. “Smart idiots” become less persuadable the more tidbits of knowledge they accrue;Tribalism – deniers belong to denier families, churches or parties. Tribal loyalty overrules science;Conspiracist Ideation – deniers suffer paranoid delusions wherein climate scientists form part of a nefarious global conspiracy;Fossil Fuel Disinformation – deniers are duped by oil and coal company propaganda.In their effort to blame scepticism on Big Oil’s libertarian goons, Dunlap’s team assembled data which sceptics may find valuable. Did you know?108 CAGW-sceptical books were published between 1982 and 2010;87% came through publishing firms. 13% were self-published;71% of the professionally published books were funded by, or written by persons connected to, free market think tanks like Cato Institute, Heartland Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Marshall Institute, Hoover Institute, and Institute for Economic Affairs;Pre-1999 CAGW-sceptical books were nearly all US-published; thereafter scepticism went global.*Global Warming’s Six Americas and the 2016 Elections categorises Americans by attitude towards CAGW. The breakdown:Alarmed 17%Concerned 28%Cautious 27%Disengaged 7%Doubtful 11%Dismissive 10%The “Alarmed” demand government action. “Doubtfuls” and “Dismissives” oppose government action and support Trump. Pew research also shows stark differences of opinion between Republicans and Democrats regarding CAGW.The authors of Climate Change and the American Mind (2018) surveyed 1,278 adults. 14% did not believe global warming was happening. 28% said the warming was natural. 21% were very worried about global warming. 61% believed US weather was already affected; 29% believed it was greatly affected.Climate Change Communicators engineer polarisation.The “Alarmed” cohort doubled over the last decade due to media and educational persuasion; not due to climatic change. A quarter of the Alarmed harangue politicians. Many Alarmed believe carbon dioxide causes skin cancer. Many believe global warming is intentional. Much climate communication aims at pressing the “Concerned” into the torch-and-pitchfork toting mobs of the Alarmed.At the spectrum’s other end Communicators lure Doubtfuls away from Dismissives. Here they heed the words of Yale Climate Connections contributor, Dana Nuccitelli:“One thing most social scientists agree on is that people are more open to information when it comes from “trusted sources” – people with whom they have shared values.”Such thinking has prompted the “conservative-to-conservative” projects creating golden opportunities for Bob Inglis and Katherine Hayhoe et al.In 2012 GMU4C recruited six-term Congressmen Bob Inglis (R SC) to front their RepublicEn experiment. Inglis, a former climate sceptic, works the conservative lecture circuit with an “I Saw the Light” testimonial. This fetched him a JFK Profile in Courage Award. RepublicEn recently recruited its 5,000th Republican. In 2016 Inglis and Hayhoe were placed on Politico’s 50 list. Hayhoe earlier made Time Magazine’s 100 list.Katherine Hayhoe was born unto an Evangelical father, Doug Hayhoe (PhD Ed. M.Div.). She began her career studying Astronomy but jumped on the CAGW bandwagon in 1995, ultimately earning a PhD in Atmospheric Science. En route she married an Evangelical pastor.Evangelicals constitute 25% of the US electorate. They incline toward CAGW scepticism. Doug Hayhoe explains this by pointing to the social and theological conservativism of his Evangelical tribe. Stem cell and Evolution controversies convinced many Evangelicals that scientists have hidden agendas.CAGW communicators approach this constituency through the Evangelical Climate Initiative, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action; and through turbo-charging Katherine’s career. Now an YPCCC Research Affiliate and a RepublicEn advisor, Katherine tours the US delivering crafted 45-minute lectures to Evangelical congregations. The first seven minutes are devoted to Christ.Doug Hayhoe studies his daughter’s impact on audiences using before-and-after surveys. In a published study he reports impressive increases in CAGW concern among audiences who listen to Katherine’s sermon.Like many CAGW Communicators Katherine recommends ditching the label “Denier” for “Dismissive.” She defines this cohort as:“…a dismissive person will dismiss any evidence, any arguments with which they’re presented because dismissing the reality of climate change and the necessity for action is such a core part of their identity that it’s like asking them, you know, to cut off an arm.”Leiserowitz believes Dismissives constitute a loud, over-represented 11% of America. He bemoans:“We are now in an environment where it is very difficult to have a rational conversation about climate change with people who think it’s just a conspiracy. That deeper hard-core conservative base, that has so infused Republican politics in particular has marched the party and many of its staunchest core supporters out on the limb very far from this problem and its source.”Leiserowitz’s directives:“You don’t have to persuade Dismissives – who tend to think it’s all just a liberal conspiracy – that climate change is real. You just have to persuade them not to be in active resistance to climate solutions.”In other words: Forget about converting sceptics. Demoralise them. Neutralise them. Vilify them.Uber-hip climate pundit Michael Barnard has picked up the beat:“It must not be very pleasant to hang out with other global warming ‘skeptics’ these days what with so many of the crowd being so obviously frothing racists and deluded.”Barnard’s trendy epithet, “xenosceptic,” serves a dual purpose. Doubtfuls can be drawn toward CAGW acceptance by convincing them that Dismissives are blinded by odious ideologies. Dismissives can be silenced out of fear of being associated with frothing racists.ConclusionThe official narrative has late-1980s scientists discovering Earth’s temperature to be unnaturally over-heating; then rushing out to alert policy-makers. CAGW, however, did not arise from science. It arose from government oil and coal phase-out programs. Phase-outs are the horse; CAGW is the cart. Phase-outs are the dog, CAGW is the tail; …and what a tale.Even sceptics have difficulty grasping that Climate Change is all propaganda. They ensnare themselves in endlessly untangling the ever-lengthening Gordian Knot of CAGW pseudo-science. This is crucial work for sure, but there comes a times to ask: why do scientists fudge temperature data, exaggerate sea level rises, and lie about polar bears? The answer is that their portentous papers, like the pretentious publications that print them …ain’t nothin’ but propaganda.SourcesBarnard, Michael.

IPCC Fatal Error?," Contributed by consulting geologist Dr Roger Higgs, Geoclastica Ltd Technical Note 2018-6 (one slide only), updated © 25th December 2018PDF of slide also posted here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329880738 IPCC’s 2013 report (co-author physicist Dr M. Lockwood FRS), citing publications by Lockwood, says the sun “cannot explain global mean surface warming over the past 25 years, because solar irradiance has declined over this period” (red bar versus blue bar below). (So instead IPCC blames man’s additions of CO2, a gas that even now totals just 1/2500th [400ppm] of Earth’s atmosphere [near plant-starvation level], 1/10th of previous values.) But this assumes Earth’s average surface temperature reacts very quickly to solar-output changes, with a time-lag of only 3 years (y) or less. On the contrary, massive ocean thermal inertia (google it), discounted by IPCC, possibly causes a 25y lag, as shown below by simply cross-correlating the solar (cosmic-ray proxy) and temperature graphs (compare circles & yellow bars). Similarly various pre-2013 authors estimated 15-20y lag, based on theory. As predicted by the lag, Earth is now cooling (green box). This cooling, which so far has lasted 2.7y (Feb 2016 peak to Oct 2018), already exceeds all other coolings since 1995 (green bars) in both duration & magnitude (0.5°C). If, as I predict, cooling continues (dotted green bars), man-made-global-warming believers will by 2021 have to admit they were wrong, that CO2 is blameless, and that Svensmark’s sun/cosmic ray/cloud/temp. link is correct. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2018/12/25

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/11/28/an-open-letter-to-the-intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change/,Alan Lebis ,An Open Letter to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change," November 28, 2018Contact information for the IPCC Secretariat C/O World Meteorological Organization7bis Avenue de la PaixC.P. 2300CH- 1211 Geneva 2, Switzerland Phone : +41-22-730-8208/54/84Fax : +41-22-730-8025/13ATTN:    Dr. Hoesung Lee,  ChairDear Sir, RE: Call to Retract IPCC SR15 Report – Crime Against Humanity, Lack of Due Diligence, Faulty Scientific Premises and Conflicts of InterestWe have thoroughly reviewed the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change SR15 report and call upon you to retract it for the following reasons:Promoting Crime Against HumanityAs early as Oct. 23, 2007, the UN Special Rapporteur on Food, Jean Ziegler, called the use of biofuels a ‘crime against humanity’[1] saying:“It is a crime against humanity to convert agricultural productive soil into soil which produces food stuff that will be burned into biofuel.” His words seem to have been ignored by the IPCC in the recent report which advocates for a completely untested model of biofuel use as a means of generating electricity – this being Biomass Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), which would, at scale, entail the use of arable land that is one and a half times the size of India. The work of the New England Complex Systems Institute, dating back to 2011, has shown that biofuels and food speculation have led to a dramatic surge in food prices worldwide, causing mass civil unrest, an underlying driver of migration.[2] It is negligent, unethical, and immoral of the IPCC, a UN body, to advocate for untested biofuel ‘solutions’ in its report that would obviously constitute further such crimes against humanity. Negligent ReviewIn 2015, Jonathan Lynn, Head, Communications and Media Relations, of the IPCC communicated with Friends of Science Society regarding a press release.[3]  At that time, as outlined in our exchange of correspondence, we asked the IPCC for peer-reviewed studies supporting the claims made in the Summary for Policymakers, SPM.4.2.2. “Decarbonization…” of the 2013 report, that wide-scale deployment of wind and solar were a “cost-effective mitigation strategy…”  Mr. Lynn indicated that there were none, but if such material was available, it would be incorporated into the next report. This was not done for the IPCC SR15, even though the report strongly advocates for renewables. Several studies, like that of Prof. Michel J. Kelly of Cambridge,[4] show that renewables cannot support basic society in terms of Energy Return on Energy Invested, and he asserts that rapid decarbonization would result in mass deaths.[5]  “Burden of Proof”[6] shows that there is no credible evidence that 100% renewables systems are viable. Our recent assessment, “In the Dark on Renewables”[7] demonstrates the folly of renewables, the burdensome costs imposed on an unwitting public, and the lack of due diligence by government policymakers, many of whom seem to rely upon IPCC reports without question as the work of the “world’s top scientists.”  Such negligent review is not an exemplar of top science. Faulty Premises on Climate ScienceThe recent IPCC SR15 report is based on three key faulty premises which are detailed in our report “Faulty Premises = Poor Public Policy on Climate” and summarized below.[8]Faulty Premise #1: that we are in the “Anthropocene” Epoch – we are not, it is the Holocene which began some 11,700 years ago.[9] The drive to officially recognize the Anthropocene Epoch has been deemed by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) Commission on Stratigraphy to be political rather than scientific.[10]Faulty Premise #2: that carbon dioxide would be a commodities trading market and as simple and profitable to institute as the sulfur dioxide trading markets. It is not. Sulfur dioxide markets were a select microcosm, affecting a few hundred, specific industries which were able to easily incorporate industrial scrubbers to reduce pollution; carbon dioxide and related proposed taxes affect every element of modern society. Where sulfur dioxide can be reduced into a tangible, trade-able product, carbon markets are fraught with fraud as carbon trading is based on “the lack of delivery of an invisible substance to no one.” While some see carbon dioxide reduction targets as the ‘great equalizer’ because it is common to all processes of modern society (and to people, carbon dioxide breathing carbon-based life-forms), it is, in fact, highly prejudicial, particularly toward northern countries where people are reliant on fossil fuels to survive.  Further, the proposed Green Climate Fund makes a mockery of so-called ‘climate justice’ by being designed to allow wealthy Saudi Arabia to apply for funding, while requiring bankrupt Greece to pay in.Faulty Premise #3: that carbon dioxide from human industrial emissions is the driver of climate change and global warming.  In fact, despite a recent significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, there is no statistically significant comparable rise in global average mean temperatures for ~20 years. Climate models predicting warming have widely diverged from observations, indicating that they are useless for forecasting what temperatures will be 20 or 100 years from now. Dr. Judith Curry testified to the US Senate that carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can fine tune climate, and that the 2013 IPCC report weakened the case for human causation of climate change.[11]  Dr. John Christy testified to the US Senate that the IPCC’s own documents show that human greenhouse gases have little effect on climate; nature is the greater factor.[12]A number of scientific papers published in recent years shows that the climate is much less sensitive to increasing CO2 emissions than simulated by climate models. For example, the paper by Dr. Ray Bates[13] used empirical data to estimate that the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) is tightly constrained with a best estimate of 1.02 °C and a likely range of 0.85 °C to 1.28 °C. Climatologists Nicholas Lewis and Dr. Judith Curry[14] published an important paper in the Journal of Climate that estimates the ECS best estimate is 1.50 °C with a likely range of 1.20 °C to 1.95 °C, assuming all the warming was human-caused. However, accounting for the natural recovery from the Little Ice Age, the ECS best estimate drops to only 1.28 °C. The corresponding Transient Climate Response best estimate drops from 1.20 °C to only 1.02 °C. These values are much less than the mean climate model estimates for ECS and TCR of 3.2 °C and 1.8 °C, respectively. Considering the large benefits of warming and CO2 fertilization, the Social Cost (Benefit) of Carbon Dioxide is significantly negative, meaning CO2 emissions are net beneficial to human welfare.Climate Change Policy is Fraught with Conflicts of InterestParties with vested interests in renewables and global carbon markets have been spending over $600 million a year funding Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations (ENGOs) to push climate catastrophe hype as a reason for incorporating renewables on the grid, with the ultimate objective of establishing a global cap and trade system.[15]  These parties enacted this plan with no regard for national sovereignty, a founding principle of the United Nations Charter, Chapter 1, Article 2.1.[16] These plans have been socially and economically detrimental to all societies where they have been foisted upon citizens, particularly in Canada where our resource industry has been severely damaged due to the foreign-funded interference by these groups. This is contrary to the UN Charter IX, Article 55 a.  These groups have conflicts of interest in that key players, such as WRI (World Resources Institute), which claims to have helped set ¾ of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions for the countries that are signatory to the Paris Agreement, have also been funded by parties with vested interests in renewables.  The unelected, unaccountable, transnational groups – UNPRI and CDP Worldwide – are acting as activist investors and skewing markets worldwide, based on their dogmatic acceptance of the faulty principles of the IPCC described in point 3) above. This is contrary to the founding principles of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (which encourages free trade, the reduction of trade barriers, fair practices and no unilateral implementation of policies).[17] In Canada, promoting unsubstantiated claims in contrary to the Competition Act; this is greenwashing – a form of fraud. Yet with your otherwise unexamined position of ‘authority’ without critical scrutiny, your unvetted claims will be relied upon by many businesses and policymakers.  This is against the public interest.https://www.canada.ca/en/competition-bureau/news/2017/01/not-easy-being-green-businesses-must-back-up-their-words.html Furthermore, in Canada, ENGO charities are required to provide a net public benefit – yet many are entangled in the IPCC process or funded by foreign advocates of a global cap and trade system – a system that is based on the faulty scientific premises of the IPCC reports.

Côte d’Ivoire alone had 492 participants.In recent years in the world, millions of people have died in armed conflicts, others in famines or lack of clean water, and even in our countries citizens are dying of cold because they can not afford to heat up or even shelter, while millions of people are parceled in refugee camps, or have taken the dangerous path of a Europe which counts down to tenths of degrees which it threatens the very existence of its populations.Nobody died because of global warming . An overall warming of 0.4 to 0.7 ° C depending on the sources -seven tenths of a degree- throughout the twentieth century, remember.So where are the priorities, and is it wise that taxpayers continue to directly or indirectly fund the annual stays of our (ir)responsible leaders in more tourist than scientific stays, so that they make a presence in cyclical conclaves which also lead to so many failures? It would also be fun to calculate the “ecological footprint” of these gigantic conventions designed to reboost climate catastrophism.Here are the significant parts of the ticket published by Viv Forbes in 2014 in the WUWT site of Anthony Watts (3) (home translation)Jo Moreau . Twenty-two years ago, a group of green activists calling themselves “The Earth Summit” gathered in Rio and invented a way to visit the world at the expense of taxpayers: to initiate endless conferences on alarms threatening the environment.(…) But they discovered the juiciest vein of veins with their creation called “Global Warming”, and its sub-branches “Climate Change” and “Extreme Weather Phenomena”.These “noble causes” have generated a profusion of steering committees, reference committees, political committees, scientific subgroups, working committees, evaluators and leading agencies, and have generated meetings with 20,000 participants from around the world. countries in places such as Rio, Berlin, Geneva, Kyoto, Buenos Aires, Bonn, The Hague, Marrakech, New Delhi, Milan, Montreal, Nairobi, Bali, Poznan, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Qatar, Doha, Warsaw, Stockholm , Lima, Abu Dhabi and New York.The Climate Conferences circuit has become a real boon for airlines, hotels and fine restaurants, even more so than the Olympics or the G20.Taxpayers around the world have spent the last 21 years spending money that would have been much better spent on flood control infrastructure, drinking water supply for drought-endemic populations, and pollution control. .Viv ForbesSaltbush Club – AustraliaHundreds of Consumers, Business people and Scientists say: “Get out of the Paris Agreement.” (1) http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/08/25/cut-the-costly-climate-chatter/(2) http://www.cop24.katowice.eu/(3) https://belgotopia.wordpress.com/2015/05/21/la-conference-de-paris-2015-on-the-climate-arrive-trop-tard/See as well :https://belgotopia.com/2018/11/16/la-cop-24-est-a-nos-portes/ After all, climate change is a MORAL issue…that’s why they fly everywhere! Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'COP24']",2018/11/28

A leading American news site “Fox news” headlined yesterday “Paris burns – Long Live the Resistance”, while the influential “Drudge Report” shot out “Paris Burns – Towards Civil War?” Who is right?There are three reasons to doubt the state’s claims of ‘dying gasps’ of this tax revolt. First of all, yesterday there were some reports claiming 750,000 demonstrators throughout France (according to a police union). If so, this would be six fold the figure offered by Castaner, the Socialist Minister of the Interior. The number is important, as the “Yellow Vests” are a popular movement without structure or organization. Although lip service, even the regime supporter media outlet BFMTV – offered a unanimous view that the movement is supported by the majority of the French, who cannot stand any more financial pressures. When there is no more money, ideology no longer holds anyone in thrall. Above all, in January 2019, both a new fuel tax increase and a withholding tax take effect. This tax oppression mechanically condemns millions of formerly middle-class and working poor French people to a head-first plunge into poverty where they will no longer know how to pay for the necessities of life: heating, fuel, medical care, food. It seems doubtful that the revolt of people is diminishing when the state progressively and aggressively confiscates the means of their subsistence, and finally their dignity. ~~~~Drieu Godefridi is author of “IPCC – A Scientific Body?”https://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=drieu+godefridi+IPCC+political+or+scientific The original French version is “Le GIEC est mort: Vive la Science”https://www.amazon.fr/GIEC-est-mort-Vive-science/dp/2960047370 He also authored: “La Revolution Trump”https://www.amazon.ca/r%C3%A9volution-Trump-Drieu-Godefridi/dp/2930650141  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'changement climatique']",2018/11/28

Kelly as early as 2010, rapid decarbonization, another Utopian push by IPCC acolytes, would result in mass deaths.Consequently, we hope our new billboard campaign will raise public awareness on these issues. We believe such a law would be very detrimental to Canada specifically, and to all democracies in general. We are running the billboards in French and English.And we’re happy to be on the media tower on the corner of Yonge and Dundas in Toronto. Many people wonder, if carbon dioxide is not the driver of climate change, then we don’t need a carbon tax at all – but what does drive climate?  Our group and our international network of scientific colleagues have been reviewing the science since 2002 and while climate change is the result of complex interactions of a dynamic system, overall the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change.This does not mean humans have no effect on climate or the environment – of course we do! It just means carbon taxes won’t stop climate change and we can better use climate-related money to restore the environment and mitigate our impact.  Comments and questions are welcome!Please read our new reports to understand our position:Faulty Premises = Poor Public Policy on ClimateIn the Dark on Renewables: Rebutting Deloitte Insights and Climate RealityShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'COP24', 'democracy']",2018/11/27

They reject most of the IPCC conclusions.Secondly, a large international group of scientists and business people from 16 different countries (including Australia) have joined the Clexit Movement which urges world-wide withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and cessation of the costly war on coal, cattle and cars.Thirdly, the US government has repudiated the Paris Agreement, and proposals for a carbon tax were rejected by voters in the recent US elections.Fourthly, the growing BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) have no intention of making meaningful cuts to their production of carbon dioxide. Brazilian president-elect Jair Bolsonaro has vowed to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.Fifthly, the nations of Oceania and the Third-World-Network are keen supporters solely because they expect to get a big share from the enormous “Green Climate Fund” (to be filled by climate bunnies like Australia).Finally, hundreds of new modern coal-fired power stations are being built in many nations of the world, often using good quality Australian coal to power the manufacturing and refining industries which are being driven out of Australia because of its high-cost unreliable electricity.Our current energy/climate policies are making us: “The Climate Bunny of the Pacific Rim.”Viv ForbesSecretary of the Saltbush ClubViv Forbesforbes@saltbushclub.comShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Paris Agreement'],2018/11/27

Please see the Belgotopia blog for many interesting, long lists of wild climate and weather events throughout the years. Changing climate is the ‘normal’ – nothing ‘new’ about it. History helps put the climate ‘hysteria’ in perspective.https://belgotopia.com/2018/11/16/la-cop-24-est-a-nos-portes/ COP24 is at our DoorThe Katowice conference on global warming will take place from 2 to 14 December 2018, again justifying all the media runaways that will spare us no flood, natural disaster or “temperature record” (on the rise, of course) where it occurs on the planet.This “United Nations Conference on Climate Change” is another step towards the more and more obvious goal of the United Nations: to  eventually impose a world government.A key instrument in this agenda, the climate debate has for a considerable number of years, left the scientific field for the ideological, political and financial domains. He has become the object of all exaggerations and amalgam, imposing a single point of view on the question, and muzzling any contestation or draft debate. It justifies a profound change in industrial and economic policy in developed countries. Part of the leaders of countries receiving compensation for so-called climate disruptions will undoubtedly be confirmed a generous distribution of funds fed by the taxpayers of the so-called “rich” countries.Let us first recall some facts which at least are not very questionable.– The climate is everything except stable. Throughout history, our planet has been the scene of sometimes sudden and often catastrophic weather events. (1)– We can admit a certain global warming, as it appeared at the end of the “Little Ice Age” in the middle of the 19 th century. However, the magnitude of this warming is subject to discussion, given the evolution of measuring instruments, architecture and location of weather stations requiring adjustments for all manipulations. (2)– There is NO scientific evidence that human activity causes climate change. The whole argument of the supporters of the IPCC is based on a correlation between the increase of industrial activities on the one hand, and global warming of the earth’s temperature on the other hand. But correlation does not mean any causality …– CO2 emitted by human activities represents less than 5% of all CO2 released annually into the atmosphere, 95% of this CO2 being released by nature.– It is wrong to claim that there would be a global consensus of all scientists, which would be in line with the conclusions of the IPCC. Tens of thousands of scientists of all disciplines have expressed varying degrees of reservations about these conclusions, when they are not totally opposed to them.The press, especially European and even more French-speaking, has seized the catastrophic scenarios emitted by the followers of the anthropogenic global warming, and has established a total blackout on any information or theory that would go against what has become unique and obligatory thought.The entire media and political world is in tow of ideological-political movements and NGOs such as GREENPEACE, the WWF or Global Footprint Network, whose “studies” and anathemas are considered divine words that nobody takes the trouble to check, or dare to dispute.We have been able to mix everything and anything in a gigantic “melting pot”, maintaining the confusion between pollution and global warming, or calling CO2 a pollutant, which is not despite recent attempts to to classify in this category.But who benefits from this state of affairs?First of all, part of the scientific world. Today it suffices to involve anthropogenic global warming in any study to see the financial windfall of subsidies open up. In a few years, the annual global budget for climate science has grown from $ 170 million to several billion dollars.The political world has found in the subject a good way to collect votes, and today everyone wants to look greener than green. The implementation of such a policy also justifies the creation of a multitude of so-called “ecological” taxes, affirmed or disguised, benefiting in addition to the unexpected approval of a large part of the population.The industrial world is engulfed in the juicy new market, by the premature marketing of so-called “renewable” energies such as wind power or photovoltaics. This placing on the market was facilitated by incentives, bonuses, green certificates, network improvements and various tax refunds supported by all taxpayers, financial incentives also essential to impose the emergence of electric vehicles. This is the triumph of what is called “connivance capitalism”.The financial world benefits greatly from the system put in place by investing in companies, banks or so-called “ecological and responsible” funds.This convergence of interests has taken on such a global dimension that any backtracking has become extremely difficult because it brings into play the credibility of the main pillars of our societies: the political, the humanitarian and the industrialist.But of all this, the vast majority of my readers are aware. And that’s the problem: we go around in circles in a small circle of convinced. And yet, each of us can extend the debate by intervening in the comments of computer logs, in social networks, within his private or professional circle etc …Challenging the conclusions of climate conferences, combating “one-size-fits-all thinking” and reestablishing an exchange of ideas on these issues that engage the future of our society is paramount and must involve all of us.Jo MoreauNote: Friends of Science Society’s view is slightly different than that expressed here. Friends of Science Society agrees that humans affect climate change, however more regionally than globally and through many other means (i.e. land use, water diversion, Urban Heat Island, deforestation, etc) than simply carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the effect of carbon dioxide emissions has been one of fertilization and some places, like Canada, have a net benefit from nominal warming.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/11/18/in-the-dark-on-renewables-rebutting-deloitte-insights-and-climate-reality/,renewableguy ,In the Dark on Renewables: Rebutting Deloitte Insights and Climate Reality," Deloitte Insights and Climate Reality have recently issued reports making claims that renewables – especially wind and solar – are as cheap and as reliable as conventional coal-fired or natural-gas-fired power.We demonstrate that these claims are not valid and show that wind and solar exist almost entirely due to preferential government programs and subsidies.Mass deployment of wind and solar can destabilize power grids. Solutions like batteries, flywheels, and pumped hydro are exorbitant in cost. Renewables-plus-storage systems cannot reasonably be scaled up to meet society’s demand for reliable power.Large additions of wind and solar do not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In any case, human-produced CO2 is not a control knob that can fine-tune Earth’s climateDeloitte Insights, an imprint of Deloitte LLC, recently published a report entitled Global Renewable Energy Trends—solar and wind move from mainstream to preferred.[1] Shortly thereafter, Climate Reality issued an e-book entitled How Renewables Work: A Practical Guide to Wind, Solar and Geothermal.[2]  According to Deloitte, wind and solar are now benefitting from three enablers:The first enabler is that wind and solar are reaching price and performance parity on the grid and at the socket. Second, solar and wind can effectively help balance the grid. Third, new technologies are honing the competitive edge of wind and solar. As this report shows, these claims are not valid.LINK TO REPORT: In the Dark on Renewables FINAL Nov 18 2018The assertion that wind and solar are reaching performance parity on the grid and at the socket ignores the reality that they require nearly equal amounts of conventional power generation to back them up because the wind does not always blow and the sun sets every day. Since wind and solar power generation systems are paired with fossil fuel, nuclear, and/or hydro back-up generation, wind and solar are effectively redundant, which means consumers effectively have to pay for two sets of generators. And while the costs of wind turbines and solar panels may have dropped in recent years, successfully integrating those technologies requires transmission-system upgrades, energy storage systems, and certain technical upgrades that all come at an additional cost.Regarding the claim that wind and solar can effectively help balance the grid, it is true that certain technical advancements can reduce the negative effects that wind and solar have traditionally had on system stability. However, no amount of technical wizardry will allow wind to contribute to system balancing when the wind is not blowing, and no amount of wizardry will allow solar to contribute to grid balancing at 3:00 a.m. local time.The price parity claim, which is based on a value known as the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), is also invalid. Even if the LCOEs of wind and solar were lower than the LCOEs of conventional generation—a debatable proposition—that does not translate into lower overall costs for consumers. The problem with the LCOE as a cost metric is that it ignores all the peripheral costs of forcing wind and solar onto the grid that were just noted.According to Climate Reality, the transition to 100% renewable energy systems will be helped along by geothermal energy for heating and cooling.  This claim, too, is largely invalid. While geothermal is playing a role—and will continue to play a role—in the world’s energy systems, it is simply not capable of replacing traditional heating and cooling systems in all situations or all locations.The absurdity of the notion that it will now be easy and cheap to convert to 100% renewable energy systems is highlighted by the following chart, which comes from BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy.[3]  Renewables (excluding hydro), shown in dark orange, accounted for just 3.6% of world primary energy consumption in 2017. Consequently, renewables advocates are effectively suggesting that we can rebuild the world’s entire energy system while maintaining the existing one as a backup, and that we can do in a ludicrously short period while keeping costs low.  This is simply not reality.Please read the full report, linked above.~~~~[1]     https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/industry/power-and-utilities/global-renewable-energy-trends.html?id=us:2sm:3tw:4di4624:5awa:6di:MMDDYY:HANDLE::author&pkid=1005414[2]     https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sites/default/files/renewables_ebook_09_2018.pdf[3]     https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/downloads.htmlShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon dioxide', 'carbon tax', 'decarbonization']",2018/11/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/11/17/the-composition-of-global-emissions/,Ken Gregory ,THE COMPOSITION OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018EXECUTIVE SUMMARYLink to Full Report: THE WORLD OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS briefProponents of urgent action to reduce greenhouse emissions in Canada usually maintain that the countries of the world are all cooperating to sharply reduce emissions, and that Canada must not separate itself from the “international community”. The purpose of this note is to provide data from some authoritative sources to test the validity of these claims. British Petroleum is one of the most expert and respected sources of statistics on historical and current energy supply, demand and emissions. It produces an annual Statistical Review of World Energy and makes it available without charge. The 2018 edition of the Review provides data concerning the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from energy combustion from countries, regions and the whole world over the period 2007 to 2017 inclusive. From 2006 to 2017: Global emissions increased by 3,365 megatonnes (Mt), from 30079 Mt to 33,444 Mt.The only regions that reduced emissions over the past decade are Europe, the Russian Commonwealth (CIS) countries, and North America.Emissions grew significantly in all other regions, but especially in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.The non-OECD countries increased their emissions by 4,547 Mt, almost four times as fast as OECD countries’ emissions declined.Emissions in China and India alone increased by 3,000 Mt.China’s emissions alone increased at the monthly rate of 166 Mt; the increases in China’s emissions every three and a half months exceeded Canada’s 2017 annual emissions. Using data from the BP Statistical Reviews back to 1990, when governments began setting emission reduction targets: The use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) grew from 7 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (Gtoe) in 1990 to 11.4 Gtoe in 2016.The share of total world energy consumption held by fossil fuels declined from 88% to 86%; in effect, the world is “decarbonizing” at the rate of about 1% per decade, not urgently as claimed by proponents. The International Energy Agency, in its Global Energy and CO2 Status Report of 2017, used a slightly different methodology than BP, but made similar findings. In 2017: Global emissions grew by 1.4% to 32.5 Gt.72% of the growth in global energy demand was met by fossil fuels.World oil demand rose by 1.6% (or 1.5 million barrels per day), exceeding the annual average rate on 1% during the previous decade.Global natural gas demand grew by 3%.Global coal demand grew by 1%, reversing the decline in the previous two years. The continuing growth in global emissions is the complete opposite of what the U.N and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claim is required to meet the goals set out in the 2015 COP21 Agreement in Paris. The continuing growth in emissions, driven by the desire of the developing countries for higher incomes and living standards, show that there is nothing countries like Canada can do affect the overall trends, regardless of the costs incurred.~~~~Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant.

Millions will imbibe this refined piece of climate communication.This critical abridgement confines itself exclusively to facts and quotes from Losing Earth but it does not present them in the scattered order deployed by Rich, who might claw his eyes out if he ever reads it.*In 1958 a prime-time episode of the popular, Bell Science Hour, warned CO2 emissions were warming the atmosphere. Due to melting polar ice soon:“An inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley. Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water.”This episode would be shown in classrooms for decades.On November 27, 1963 President Johnson told Congress industrial emissions had: “altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale.”In 1965 Johnson’s Scientific Advisory Committee again warned CO2 emissions might melt polar ice and suggested efforts to forestall this catastrophe. One scientific advisor, Gordon Macdonald, wrote “How to Wreck the Environment” (1968) to toy with the possibility of weaponising CO2 emissions. A government-funded scientist since 1961, Macdonald belonged to an elite government scientist cabal, the JASONs. He later advised Nixon on the environmental dangers of coal burning.*In the early-1970s United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) began holding semi-annual conferences on the “greenhouse effect.” Conference planners competed with several rival scientist-fronted alarmist campaigns, such as Paul Ehrlich’s population bomb and the Club of Rome’s resource depletion scare. An even more dubious hypothesis advanced by celebrity scientist Carl Sagan, environmental biologist Stephen Schneider, and NASA’s Ichtiaque Rasool warned an ice age was dawning due to industrial aerosols. (Rasool boosted James Hansen’s NASA climb.)The mid-1970s spawned many climate intrigues:The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution created a subsidiary, led by ecologist George Woodwell, to advance climate policy.Anthropologist Margaret Mead convened a symposium on the “greenhouse effect” at the National Institute of Environment. Warning “the whole planet may be endangered,” Mead dog-whistled:“It is inevitable that there will be clash between those concerned with immediate problems and those who concern themselves with long-term consequences.”  A clique of humanities professors began debating whether the “greenhouse effect” was solvable. Michael Glantz, a political scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, opined:“…democratic societies are incapable of dealing with climate problems.”President Carter sought to solve the OPEC-induced “energy crisis” with solar power and synthetic fuels. To demonstrate resolve, he used solar power to heat the White House’s water.Carter, of course, did much more to advance the cause:He oversaw the founding of a National Commission on Air Quality (NCAQ) in 1977 missioned, in part, to stabilise climate;His new Energy Department deployed the JASONs to write: “The Long-Term Impact of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide on Climate” (1978); which re-spun the familiar suite of weather horrors;He established an Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects within the Energy Department. (In 1980 this Office disbursed $200 million);His EPA Administrator assembled a climate science squad who immediately issued reports linking coal-burning to catastrophic CO2 emissions; and,His Energy Security Act (1980) directed the National Academy Science (NAS) to fund analyses of climate change.Circa 1979 the federal government employed several dozen full-time “global warming” scientists. Many more would join them, including James Hansen. He had been with NASA since the mid-1960s modelling other planet’s atmospheres. In 1979 NASA began studying human-caused atmospheric change.In February 1979 scientists from 50 nations gathered at the World Climate Conference (Geneva). They unanimously demanded urgent action on CO2-induced warming. The topic also appeared on the G-7’s agenda in Tokyo, June 1979.In May 1979, the Office of Science and Technological Policy asked the National Research Council to assess the CO2 issue. Thus MIT’s Jule Charney corralled oceanographers, modellers and meteorologists into a mansion at Woods Hole. They were joined by officials from the Departments of State, Energy, Defence, and Agriculture; the EPA and NOAA. (Bert Bolin, future climate supremo, attended.)Hansen joined via telephone. In Hansen’s model doubling atmospheric CO2 raised temperatures by 4 degrees Celsius. Another model estimated doubling CO2 would raise temperatures 2 C. Splitting the difference Charney picked 3 C. This estimate appeared in his “Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment” and remains an atmospheric “fact.” The Aspen Institute; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Vienna); and American Association for Advancement of Science hastily endorsed Charney’s report.Throughout 1979 and 1980 Washington buzzed with “greenhouse effect” briefings. At the first congressional hearing on the topic, convened April 3, 1980 by Senator Paul Tsongas (D Mass), Gordon Macdonald recommended a coordinated USA-UN energy policy. He didn’t endorse synfuels; placing his hope in nuclear and solar.At Congress’s request NCAQ invited 24 experts to a 3 day conference in St Petersburg, Florida (October 29-31, 1980). David Slade, Director of the Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects, attended as did reps from the nuclear industry, environmental movement, and EPA. All received copies of Charney’s report.Attendees agreed on the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy but fell out over the transition’s timeline, and over the basic urgency of the problem. Slade thought evidence of anthropogenic warming might not manifest within the lifetimes of the assembled. Environmentalists argued that by the time humans detected anthropogenic warming it would be too late. The group failed to agree on a wording for the opening paragraph of their joint statement.Four days later Americans elected Reagan president. While Reagan’s choice of James Watt as Interior Secretary and Anne Gorsuch as EPA Administrator had environmentalists howling; within a few years they were both gone. Republican congressmen facilitated their ouster. Reagan never purged the federal government’s scientific establishment. Despite threats, the Energy Department and its Carbon Dioxide Office survived.“Global warming” and/or the “greenhouse effect” received lavish media coverage during the early Reagan years. Leading magazines pitched articles titled: “Another Warning of the Greenhouse Effect,” “Global Warming Trend ‘Beyond Human Experience,’” and “Warming Trend Could ‘Pit Nation against Nation’” etc.On its August 21, 1981 front-page The New York Times hyped a forthcoming Science paper by James Hansen’s team. They conceded the past century’s warming lay within the range of historical averages, however, they predicted an anthropogenic warming signal would emerge from the noise of natural weather flux sooner than expected. Uniquely, the Science article offered a policy recommendation: abandon fossil fuels. Within months Hansen was promoted to: Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies.     Congressional hearings are standard mechanisms for attracting media coverage. Al Gore created a sub-committee within the Committee on Science and Technology so he could chair hearings on hot button enviro-issues. Gore’s first “global warming” hearing (1981) flopped in terms of coverage but did elicit testimony from a Brookings Institute wonk about humanity’s profligate use of fossil fuels being an existential threat.Gore broached “global warming” again on March 25, 1982. At this hearing Republicans William Carney (NY) and Robert Walker (Penn) out-did Gore who merely called for further research. Most sanguine of all was Gore’s star witness, James Hansen. Pointing to sea-level rises of 4 inches since 1880 and a conterminous global temperature rise of 0.4 C, Hansen predicted:“Within 10 or 20 years we will see climate changes which are clearly larger than natural variability.”No other scientist believed the signal would emerge so quickly.Hansen’s immediate concern was chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which he claimed had caused half the warming since the 1970s.Spring-boarding off this congressional hearing Dan Rather’s CBS Evening News devoted 3 minutes to the “greenhouse effect.”Back in 1980 Carter commissioned a separate $1 million analysis of the CO2 problem led by William Nierenberg, Director of Scripps Oceanography. Nierenberg announced their findings on October 19, 1983 at a gala in NAS’s Great Hall. The 500-page Changing Climate added little to Charney’s report. It predicted massive ice melts, famines and cannibalism. It recommended accelerated transition to renewables.At the press conference, to the dismay of climate scolds, Nierenberg didn’t call for immediate action, only further research. The Wall Street Journal used the scrum to advance a “we can cope” line. CBS stressed Nierenberg’s statements contradicted a recent EPA report. The New York Times excerpted Changing Climate’s gloomier predictions.*In November 1985 in Villach, Austria, 89 scientists from 29 countries sounded the most forceful global warming siren yet by a scientific body. Their exertions were temporarily overshadowed by CFC concerns. CO2 and CFC campaigns conflated partly because CFCs are a greenhouse gas; however, it was CFC’s threat to atmospheric ozone, first alleged in 1974 by British government scientist F. Sherwood Rowland, which attracted global attention.In 1977 UNEP and WMO convened a World Plan of Action on the Ozone Layer to promote an international treaty banning CFCs. In a defensive response 500 businesses involved in refrigeration and plastics created the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy. DuPont, by far the world’s largest CFC manufacturer, realising it would profit from the transition to replacement chemicals, converted the Alliance into a pro-ban lobby.On March 22, 1985 UNEP’s Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer successfully collected a flush of signatures on a treaty banning CFCs. The treaty’s lack of specifics set the stage for the “ozone hole” crisis.British government scientists rang the alarm in the May 1985 issue of Nature. The “ozone layer” over Antarctica had apparently disappeared. According to Rich:“The urgency of the alarm seemed to have everything to do with the phrase “a hole in the ozone layer,” which charitably put, was a mixed metaphor. For there was no hole and there was no layer.”Ozone (O3) appears throughout the atmosphere. Densest concentrations, up to 15 ppm, occur mid-stratosphere. Ozone depletions over Antarctica are temporary phenomena lasting 2 months a year. Here again is Rich:“In satellite images colorized to show density the darker region appeared to depict a void. When F. Sherwood Rowland… spoke of an “ozone hole” in a university slide lecture in November 1985, the crisis had found its catchphrase. The New York Times used it the same day in its article about the British team’s findings, and while scientific journals initially refused to use the term within a year it was unavoidable.”  News services blasted out stories linking the “ozone hole” to: blindness, skin cancer, crop failures, immune malfunctions, and mass die-offs of fish larvae.On June 10-11 1986 Senator John Chafee (R RI) chaired back-to-back hearings on CFCs and CO2. According to Chafee:“Ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect can no longer be treated solely as scientific questions. They must be seen as critical problems facing the nations of the world, and they are problems that demand solutions.”NASA’s Robert Watson presented the CFC story. This consisted mainly of a three-minute film depicting a satellite’s view of Antarctica. The film, an animation with the grainy quality of a slasher flick, showed every day of October for seven consecutive years. Subsequent months, which would have shown ozone replenishment, were omitted. With the polar vortex madly gyroscoping, the “ozone hole” bled across Antarctica whilst fading from flesh-tone pink to the dark purple of a hemorrhaging wound. Watson’s cartoon elicited a bounty of coverage. Peter Jennings’ ABC World News Tonight did a feature segment on the “ozone hole” warning of worldwide famine.On June 11 Chafee summoned CO2 witnesses James Hansen, Al Gore and George Woodwell. The proceedings ended with Chafee imploring the State Department to negotiate an international solution to “global warming.” Interest spiked overnight. “Global warming” headlines re-appeared by the dozen.By 1986 Reagan advocated reducing CFC emissions by 95%. Every US Senator supported the Vienna Convention. UNEP and WMO gnomes calculated they could do with CO2 what they had done with CFCs. On the day he signed the Montreal Protocol (August 26, 1987) EPA Administrator Lee Thomas speculated CO2 would be the subject of the next international agreement.In 1987 Congress devoted 8 days to climate hearings. These appeared across three committees and both chambers. Senator Joe Biden introduced legislation on a national climate strategy.On October 27, 1987 John Topping hosted “Preparing for Climate Change” in a hotel near the Capitol. Topping, an old-time Rockefeller Republican, served as an EPA official under Reagan before founding the Climate Institute. He had little difficulty raising $150,000 for his conference; mostly from BP, GE and American Gas Association. Among the scientists Topping culled were: Gordon Macdonald, George Woodwell and environmental biologist Stephen Schneider (who had sojourned from global cooling to global warming). The conference blossomed into a love-in between some 250 business and environmental lobbyists. Festivities concluded at a dinner party at Topping’s DC townhouse.In November 1987 Senator Tim Wirth (D CO) unveiled a legislative package aimed at “converting the science of climate change into a new national energy policy.” Conterminously, Hansen re-appeared before the Senate. As a representative of a US Government agency Hansen had to vet his testimony through the Office of Management of Budget (OMB). They told him to tone down his alarmism. Hansen, in protest, testified as a private citizen; albeit making full mention of his government credentials. Climate lobbyists, led by Topping, scandalised OMB’s oversite. Hansen predicted substantial warming by the 2010s.*The USA never lead the global warming campaign. In 1988:Germany’s parliament endorsed a 30% CO2 emissions reduction target;Sweden announced plans to freeze CO2 emissions and impose a carbon tax;Norway’s and Canada’s Prime Ministers called for a binding international treaty;British PM Thatcher warned the Royal Society that global warming could “greatly exceed the capacity of our natural habitat to cope.”The UN chartered an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) co-managed by UNEP and WMO.In March 1988 forty-two Senators, nearly half Republicans, demanded Reagan call for an international climate treaty. In May, Reagan and Gorbachev pledged cooperation on the issue.1988’s hot summer wrought forest fires and regional droughts. Hansen exploited this backdrop in his June testimony before a Senate hearing called by Wirth who, by telling news agencies to expect a major statement, packed the chamber with cameras. Hansen didn’t disappoint. He claimed “with 99% confidence” that CO2 emissions were changing climate. Outside the hearing room he declared: “the greenhouse effect is here.”On the very morning before Hansen’s controversial testimony he attended a NASA briefing whereat his mentor, Ichtiaque Rasool, showcased NASA’s new CO2 research program. (Rasool too had drifted from cooling to warming.) Regarding evidence of anthropogenic global warming, Rasool stated: “no respectable scientist would say that you already have a signal.”Despite his outlier status Hansen’s alarmist testimony made headlines. The New York Times placed “Global Warming has begun, Expert Tells Senate” atop its front-page. The reportage relayed robust warnings from several Senators. Public awareness of the “greenhouse effect” hit 68%.Days later (June 27, 1988) politicians from 46 nations and 300 scientists attended the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere, in Toronto. Their unanimously signed communique called for a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2005.In 1988 thirty-two climate bills entered Congress including Wirth’s omnibus National Energy Policy which, inter alia, raised an international climate treaty to a national aspiration. The Congressional Budget Office studied carbon taxation. The Energy Department explored 2% per year emission reduction scenarios.Gore started his 1988 presidential bid emphasising climate. Dismal results in New Hampshire convinced him the issue wouldn’t fly. The Democratic primaries winner, Michael Dukakis, downplayed climate. He called for more domestic oil production while boasting about America’s 300-year coal supply.By contrast, George Bush Sr did a five-state environmental tour spouting soundbites like:“I am an environmentalist. Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the power of the White House effect.”VP candidate Dan Quayle piped in:“The greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue. We need to get on with it. And in a George Bush administration, you can bet that we will.”Ten days after Bush’s inauguration Secretary of State James Baker hosted an IPCC confab. The make-nice comments Baker mouthed at this event would be his last statements on the topic. He recused himself on the pretext of his past dealings as an oil industry lawyer.Baker’s behind-the-scenes resistance to the climate crusade was redoubled by Chief of Staff John Sununu; a man who lacked deference for scientists; and who believed conspiratorial forces used the imprimatur of science to advance anti-growth agendas. When he listened to elite enviros run-on about long-term consequences – “Sununu heard jackboots marching.”Like many Republicans, Bush was conflicted about climate; often defaulting to Sununu and Baker. In April 1989 a bipartisan group of 24 Senators recommend emission reductions. Weeks later at an IPCC gathering in Geneva, Bush’s EPA Administer, William K. Reilly, pushed for a global treaty. Reilly clashed with Sununu.The US was the last hold-out opposing climate negotiations. Ultimately Sununu caved but not before recruiting Dr. Allen Bromley, a Yale nuclear physicist who considered Hansen’s science “poppycock.”Hansen testified at another Gore hearing in May 1989. The OMB sought to change his testimony to prioritise US economic welfare. The New York Times blared: “Scientist says Budget Office Altered his Testimony.”The first global diplomatic climate conference took place November 7, 1989 in Noordwijk, Netherlands. Sununu insisted Bromley accompany Reilly and ask the Japanese and Soviets to go slow.Noordwijk witnessed a classic eco-activist stunt. The Dutch Government gave eco-activists all-access passes allowing them to enter the area where flags of participating nations flew. Eco-activists, with French Government photographers in tow, lowered the American, Soviet and Japanese flags to half-mast. The photos covered front-pages across Europe, accompanied by angry statements from a Sierra Club spokesman.Despite the hoopla the conference failed to reach consensus. America was blamed.*Nathaniel Rich paints Noordwijk as the unforgiving moment of truth. Thereafter nefarious fossil fuel mongers mobilised a campaign to suppress science, misinform citizens, brainwash kids and bribe politicians. Because of this campaign Bush rejected specific emissions reductions at Rio and the Senate rejected the Kyoto Protocol.To Rich the only number that matters is annual global CO2 emissions. In 1990 they were 20 billion tons. In 2017 they hit 32.5 billion.Rich advocates gargantuan state intervention into the energy industry. He wants high carbon taxes and increased investments in renewable energy, nuclear power, and other decarbonisation technologies. He explicitly calls for recruiting youth through fear.Rich concludes:“Keeping the planet to two degrees of warming, let alone 1.5 degrees, would require transformative action. It will take more than good works and voluntary commitments. It will take a revolution.”~~~~The opinions of contributors to Friends of Science Society’s blog may not reflect the view of the society or its board or members, but contribute food for thought for free and democratic debate.William Kay blogs at:  www.ecofascism.comHis latest book:The Green Swastika: Environmentalism in the Third ReichPrevious book release:From Malthus to Mifepristone: A Primer on the Population Control MovementShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2018/11/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/30/faulty-premises-poor-public-policy-on-climate-responding-to-ipcc-sr15/,Ron Little ,"Faulty Premises = Poor Public Policy on Climate, Responding to IPCC SR15"," Faulty Premises = Poor Public Policy on ClimateIn a Climate of Conflict of InterestResponding to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report SR15REPORT LINK: Faulty Premises Poor Public Policy on Climate Oct 30 2018 FINALExecutive SummaryClimate science is a complex blend of chaotic, dynamic systems. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Summary Report 15 (SR15) attempts to predict the implications of a 1.5°Celsius (C) rise in Global Surface Mean Temperatures (GSMT) over the temperature of the pre-industrial era.  The focus of the report is on the influence of human industrial emissions of carbon dioxide as the assumed driver of climate change and recent warming. Despite the number of scientists involved, science can go astray for no other reason than a singular focus through ‘the same lens.’Friends of Science Society is critical of the IPCC SR15 report, pointing out the following:We are in the Meghalayan, not the Anthropocene. The IPCC SR15 report claims to view climate change through “the lens of the Anthropocene.” This term is popularly used to describe a modern geological period wherein humans are assumed to have a larger impact on the world than nature. On July 13, 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) issued a statement that the earth is now in the Meghalayan, a period that began 4,200 years ago.  In response to questions as to why the term “Anthropocene” had not been included, at least for the past 50 years of presumed human influence, the IUGS responded that the term “Anthropocene” has not even been submitted for consideration and that the term has only sociological, not scientific relevance.  The IPCC should not use this ‘lens.’All climate models (simulations) used by the IPCC run ‘too hot’ versus observations. The computer simulations project future warming (thus being the rationale for global warming climate policies) show significantly higher temperatures than what is being observed. Only the Russian climate model and satellite/weather balloon data closely match present temperatures in the lower troposphere. This suggests that most climate models ascribe too great an effect of warming (climate sensitivity) to carbon dioxide. This means the climate models should not be used to set public policy.No temperature can be accurately measured to a precision of less than ±0.1°C. global temperature data is a metric of averaged and adjusted data from many sources, suggesting that a 0.5°C difference in temperature is moot and an arbitrary figure. It does not reference an actual measurement of earth’s temperature; people are being misled.The IPCC claims, in its founding principles, to be policy neutral. However, the IPCC SR15 makes many recommendations regarding Carbon Dioxide Removal Systems (CDRS), most of which are untested and unvetted and proposed with no cost-benefit analysis. Such recommendations are contrary to the purpose of the IPCC and should be disregarded by policymakers. The IPCC should simply report on scientific findings.Rapid decarbonization is impossible and unrealistic as proposed by the IPCC. The world runs on more than 80% fossil fuels for energy; all other forms of power generation, including hydro, nuclear, wind and solar are completely reliant on fossil fuels for their creation. Millions of people would die if rapid decarbonization was implemented. There is no suitable, equitable alternative to fossil fuel energy for modern society. Any official, international body of scientists who are recommending a course of action leading to mass deaths should be disbanded.There is no clear evidence that the changes or warming since the mid-1800s are caused by human use of fossil fuels – though indeed there has been some warming and various perceptible changes in some natural features. Indeed, the range of climate change discussed falls well within natural variation since 1850. Likewise, global temperature records are incomplete, inconsistent, methods/placement of monitoring stations have changed, and temperatures are not monitored at equidistant places at the same time. The validity of the Global Average Surface Temperature is imprecise.The proposed remedies of wind and solar increase carbon dioxide and cause warming. Rather than reduce fossil fuel use or aid in carbon dioxide reduction, wind and solar in fact require vast quantities of fossil fuels for productions, installation, and natural gas back-up – resulting in an increase in carbon dioxide. Wind and solar are ineffective, expensive and cause power grids to destabilize, putting society at risk, harming industry, jobs, and consumers through heat-or-eat poverty. The devices are made of bonded materials and are largely unrecyclable. Wind and solar are contrary to sustainability and environmental goals.Extreme weather events are an integral part of climate. The IPCC’s AR5 report and their SREX special report on extreme weather both make it clear that human effects on climate are not deemed to increase extreme weather events; neither is an increase of carbon dioxide. The IPCC should clarify this with the media rather than allowing the press to engage in terrifying hyperbole. Extremely disproportionate cost-benefit ratio should dissuade policy makers and citizens from following IPCC SR15 recommendations on carbon pricing. The cost of emissions reduction in 2030 is about 95 times the benefit assuming the climate sensitivity to CO2 from the climate models. When using the Lewis and Curry 2015 climate sensitivity estimate determined from measurements, the cost of emissions reduction in 2030 is about 210 times the benefit, however this estimate doesn’t account for natural climate change. Using the best economic model that include benefits of warming and CO2 fertilization of crops, and accounting for the natural warming from 1850, each $880 spent on mitigating a tonne of CO2 would prevent a net benefit of $8, increasing the loss to $888 per tonne of CO2 mitigation. Indeed, Dr. Judith Curry notes that carbon reduction efforts to ‘stabilize climate’ may be futile in the face of natural climate change.The science is not settled. Anderegg et al (2010)[1] revealed that 34% of IPCC contributing authors disagreed with the IPCC declaration on human influence on climate. Hundreds of other scientists have disputed IPCC findings on human-causation in peer-reviewed papers, books, blogs and videos. There is inadequate scientific review by the IPCC of the Nongovernmental International Panel Climate Change reports. There is limited review of natural forces of the sun and planetary dynamics, and natural internal variability like ocean currents, volcanic eruptions and tectonic activity and its correlation to earth’s magnetism (and thus solar influence). Reducing carbon dioxide from human industrial activity is a futile response to the continuous climate changes on earth; adaptation and investment in resilient infrastructure and response is a better use of public funds.Science is a process of progressive knowledge and insights into how things work.  What begins with well-intentioned agreement on aspects of scientific understanding, expands and changes over time with new insights.[1] http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'IPCC']",2018/10/30
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/24/jane-q-canadians-carbon-tax-quandary/,Greg Vezina ,Jane Q. Canadian’s Carbon Tax Quandary," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years. On October 23, 2018 the Trudeau government announced that 90% of the revenues that it raises in carbon taxes from provinces that fail to implement their own carbon pricing regimes will be returned to households directly through rebates, starting in April, 2019. Jane Q. Canadian, who lives in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, is trying to figure what this means, so she goes to her friendly climate expert. Jane: Can you explain to me what’s going on? Expert: Sure. Do you have two purses? Jane: Yes. A black one and a brown one. Expert: Well, the government is going to put $90 into your black purse. Jane: Wow! That’s great. Just one question. Where will the money come from? Expert: Oh, it will come from taxes on the carbon dioxide produced by goods and services sold in the economy. Jane: What are those? Expert: The taxes will be imposed on anything that uses oil, natural gas or coal, directly or indirectly. Jane: I don’t understand. What or who uses oil, natural gas or coal directly? Expert: Well, you do when you buy gasoline to fuel your car or natural gas to heat your house. So does everyone else, including private businesses. Jane: What or who uses those fossil fuels indirectly? Expert: You do when you buy electricity that is generated using coal. You also do when you buy things that have to be manufactured using energy or transported, distributed and marketed to you. Again, so does everyone else, including private businesses. Jane: Gee, that includes almost everything I buy, even groceries. So, how much will that cost me? Expert: Well, that depends. On average, the government will collect about $100 per person. It will come out of your brown purse. Jane: Wait, you said at the beginning that I would get $90 deposited to my black purse. Now, you say that I will get $100 taken out of my brown purse. How does that make me better off? Expert: I said that these things apply on average. Individuals may be affected differently. Jane: How so? Expert: It depends on how much they buy that uses energy, how much they change their buying habits and how companies react. Jane: How does what the companies do affect me? Expert: Well, only small companies will get carbon rebates. When other companies are taxed, they will respond in different ways. Some will raise their prices to recover the tax from their customers. Jane: Customers? You mean me? Expert: Yes, that’s right. Of course, the companies might try to reduce other costs instead, like salary costs. Jane: Salary costs? My son works for a store. You mean it might lay him off? Expert: It could. Of course, the company might accept a lower profit. Jane: What happens when the carbon taxes go much higher? Can companies go on cutting profits indefinitely? Expert: Some can for a while. Many, unfortunately, will just have to go out of business. Jane: Which kinds of companies might have to go out of business? Expert: The ones that produce a lot of carbon dioxide emissions as part of how they operate and have no way to reduce them with the technology now available. Jane: Like who, for example? Expert: Oil producers, natural gas producers, coal producers of any heavy industry that uses a lot of fossils fuels in its production, like mining, steel, or cement. Jane: I work for the heavy oil plant here. You mean I could lose my job? Expert: Yes, but it’s all to save the planet. Jane: How will it save the planet? Expert: It will reduce Canada’s greenhouse emissions. Jane: Does that mean that global greenhouse gas emissions will go down? Expert: No, because emissions are growing too fast in developing countries like India and China. Jane: So, if global emissions will keep going up regardless of whether the Canadian government imposes carbon taxes, how are we saving the planet? Expert: It’s the principle of the thing. Jane: so, let me get this straight. I will get $90 in my black purse, but lose $100 from my brown purse, the prices of almost everything I buy will go up, my son may be laid off, and the company I work for may go out of business. There will be no actual environmental benefit. Expert: That’s about right. There’s just one more thing. Jane: What’s that? Expert: Don’t forget to vote in next year’s federal election.~~~~Carbon Kleptomania: Carbon Kleptomania Report:https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Carbon-Kleptomania.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change']",2018/10/24

Who doesn’t want a holiday from this bipolar circus that we call ‘modern democracy’? I guess not me. As a Dutch columnist living in Berlin, Germany, I amplify whatever feelings are crawling around from ‘our side’ about our current political climate: loathing and disappointment towards elitists politicians, mob ‘justice’ and intolerant, left wing ideologies. Also the frustration about one-sidedness and propaganda in de mainstream media and the lack of confidence things will change under this political roof any time soon.These ‘feelings’ of doom are not the fruits of our wild imagination (anymore). As you may have noticed, the ruling classes have been using virtually every propaganda organ at their disposal to whip up mass hysteria over a host of extremely dubious threats to “the future of democracy” and “democratic values,” such as ‘populists’, ‘racists’,  ‘Russia’, ‘Hungary’, ‘Trump’ and the temperature on our planet. In Germany it is almost impossible to attend any public gathering involving art, music, sports, children, or having a hamburger in a ‘foodcourt’, without noticing the official stamps of moral approval on everything.Newspaper stands remind me constantly of ‘our fight against those Hitler/neonazi racists’. Where it used to say “sunny” or “cloudy” on my phone, my weather-app now constantly reminds me “the air is unhealthy.” Mind controlling my sunny day means the hysteria will stop at nothing, I guess.“Poels was personally targeted and harassed as a ‘climate change denier‘ after making a movie about the climate change.”I talked to the Dutch, prizewinning and left-wing filmmaker Marijn Poels a lot about this issue. He was personally targeted and harassed as a ‘climate change denier‘ after making a movie about the climate change debate in 2016. “My life has completely turned around”, he told me the first time we met for an interview. “I have to figure out what happened,” he told me later. ‘What had happened’ turned into the second part of trilogy, called ‘PARADOGMA‘.I was lucky to help out. We both recognized that our political views were ‘problematic’. So how could we share and test our ideas? How could we prevent falling into the trap of mental prisons of our own? How to approach difficult topics without pissing off even the ones you’d expect where on ‘our side’. The answer was: you can’t prevent the pushback at all. It has to happen.And so we visited the controversial Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson in January 2018. Peterson at the time had just become well-known for his fight against ideological indoctrination at universities, his YouTube lectures on the Bible, Nietzsche and Carl Jung and his opposition against a Canadian transgender rights bill that was in fact targeted at free speech (in his opinion). Peterson, now a cult-like mega-star in fancy suits, was in Amsterdam for a few days and I was invited to interview him about his book ‘12 Rules for Life ‘.“you can’t prevent the pushback at all. It has to happen”.The whole encounter became a starting point for PARADOGMA. Peterson was a canary in the coal mine, an pivotal figure in a much larger story, a story that Poels had been working on since the release of that climate-critical documentary ‘The Uncertainty Has Settled‘ (February 2017). PARADOGMA is about what happens when you wake up the political correct beast, about the consequences heretics face today. Instead of being invited to tons of festivals (like Poels was used to) with ‘The Uncertainty Has Settled‘, he received threats — emails and phone calls, from Greenpeace and scientists  — and many rejections from venues. Poels devoted himself completely to figuring out why accidentally tripping into a deeper layer of reality is so problematic, why people are being mocked and harassed in our ‘democracy’ for their ideas and labeled as a ‘Nazi’ and ‘conspiracy theorist‘. What makes these ideas ‘dangerous’? In PARADOGMA he talks to the ‘most dangerous philosopher on earth’: the Russian Alexandr Dugin. “It is dangerous to be human,” Dugin says with a smile.In PARADOGMA Poels delves deeper into the phenomenon of denunciation: why are jokes more and more problematic, what is the mechanism behind the tyranny of the ‘majority view’. And of course the key to understanding the underlying behavior: the leading role of the corporate establishment that sends us constant messages. “You’re either with us or against us.” The message is, “we will tolerate no dissent, except for officially sanctioned dissent.” The message is: “try to fuck with us, and we will marginalize you, and demonize you, and make you go away.”Much to my surprise, the pre-screening of PARADOGMA for journalists and supporters of the film in the German cities Stendal and Potsdam led me to the idea that we are less alone than we think. Entrepreneurs from the Netherlands flew over for the film, people from the cast were there, including the German stock exchange ‘guru’ and writer Dirk Müller.Poels and his cameraman Volker M. Schmidt have succeeded in making complex themes –polarization, groupthink in journalism, intolerance for people with different views – more visible by taking the themes away from the darkish atmosphere of the alternative media, that have relished too long on their moral debt, their position as ‘responsible players’ in a debate that was never set on their terms. PARADOGMA opens up the idea that people can actually change their mind about things — because it is safer than we think, safer than we have been taught to believe. PARADOGMA has that potential to expand the discussion on how we got here and how we can move forward.“that we belong to the world, not to corporations and governments. This is the real‘globalist’ view” Poels made over fifty films, mostly about Third World issues and human rights violations. I believe it was this experience, his mastering the ‘closeness distance dance’ that made PARADOGMA suitable for a wider audience. After the screenings the public was visibly processing what they had seen. “Very impressed,” I heard. And: “I have to watch this with my friends. Maybe they will finally understand where I’m coming from. “There is a craving, a need for returning to our senses — now. Because at the end of the day, all this talk about ‘sides’, narratives and propaganda is diverting us from the real issue: that we belong to the world, not to corporations and governments. This is the real‘globalist’ view, not some fake narrative. And all the creativity, energy and hope that comes from acknowledging this, is a sign we can find our way back. Through cinema, through sharing our ideas and finding relief in the idea we are not alone, not crazy and not ‘a side’.More info: www.paradogma-film.comIn an interview with Friends of Science Society, while in Calgary, Poels talks about his unexpected journey when making “The Uncertainty has Settled” Poels presentation at Friends of Science Society’s 15th Annual Event: See many more video clips of Marijn Poels’ interviews on our YouTube (just scroll down). Edmontonians loved “The Uncertainty Has Settled” – people want open, civil debate:Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'democracy', 'Paradogma']",2018/10/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/21/report-on-the-porto-climate-conference/,,Report on the Porto Climate Conference," Contributed by Benoît Rittaud, President of the Association des Climato-réalistes. © 2018Benoit Rittaud books on Amazon.See interviews with attendees at the Porto Conference on Friends of Science YouTube.This report was originally published on the Dutch-Language climate website climategate.nlLeading scientists from all over the world gathered in Porto, Portugal on 7 and 8 September 2018 to discuss the state of science from a climate-realistic perspective.Fernanda Ribeiro  After applause for Fernanda Ribeiro, dean at the University of Porto, who made it possible to hold the conference there, lectures took place over two days on the state of science from a climate-realistic perspective. It is too early to claim that there is a comprehensive and complete theory that can explain the development of the climate (without using CO2 as an explanatory factor). In his presentation on Saturday afternoon, however, Nils-Axel Mörner tried to sketch a synthesis of what such a coherent theory might ultimately look like. Nils-Axel MörnerAccording to his presentation, and without going into the details of mechanisms that are not well understood, one should – and that is no surprise – look at the influence of solar activity fluctuations on climate change. This variability manifests itself through four mechanisms: the modification of the ocean circulation (in his first presentation Nils-Axel Mörner pointed out that the Portuguese coast is an ideal observation post to study the changes of the Gulf Stream), clouds (we think of course of the work of Svensmark and Shaviv), luminosity and ultimately the winds. Depending on the author, it is one or the other factor that dominates.   As far as the winds are concerned, several speakers (Nils-Axel Mörner, Piers Corbyn and Nicola Scafetta) were particularly interested in the matter of Length Of the Day. This is in line with the work of Vincent Courtillot, which clearly shows that the variation in earth’s rotational speed (which can be accurately measured since the 1960s) correlates with climate characteristics, due to the effect of earth rotation on zonal winds. (Vincent Courtillot had already suggested this idea at the end of a debate at the Academy of Sciences, which took place four years ago.)Vincent Courtillot While some of the lectures related to the effects of the sun on our planet, another presentation was focused on the effect of the planets on the sun. The variation of solar activity (in particular measured on the basis of the number of sunspots) can be explained by analyzes of the movements of the planets. The gravity of the largest planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) is of an order of magnitude sufficient to measurably influence the position of the centre of gravity of the solar system, depending on the position of those planets. I am still not really convinced of any of the proposed alternatives. In my opinion, there is still a lot of work to be done before they can be presented as poured in concrete. That is, to avoid the risk that the astronomical cycles mentioned by one or another may be discarded with reference to the famous statement of John von Neumann:‘With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.’Francois GervaisAmong the cycles that still hold, is that of 60 years (perhaps to be distinguished into two separate but very similar lengths, according to Roger Tattersall). That would please François Gervais, a French climate realist, who as usual held a solid presentation on climate sensitivity.Roger TattersallAs far as the cycles are concerned, Roger Tattersall seemed to me the most convincing speaker. He discussed the stability of a number of dynamic systems, such as those of the main satellites of Jupiter. He also related to the Fibonacci sequence. It is known that this set of numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …) has the fundamental property that the ratio of two consecutive terms (8/5, then 13/8, then 21 / 13, etc.) comes ever closer to the value (1 + √5) / 2. This value is called the Golden Ratio. The golden ratio has a special arithmetic property: this is the number which is, in an exact mathematical sense, the furthest away from the set of fractions (the numbers of the form m / n with m and n integers). This property could explain the presence of the first terms of the Fibonacci sequence in these considerations of orbital stability. Roger’s ideas about the history of science, by Kepler’s writings, were equally interesting. A question that was discussed several times was that of a future solar minimum. It is true that the particularly weak solar cycle 24 is enough to justify predictions of a possible equivalent of a Dalton Minimum or, more strongly, of a Maunder Minimum (a period during which in France the wine froze in the glasses in winter) . This search for the next minimum may have been motivated by wishful thinking. This could mean the end of the current warming and therefore probably also of climate alarmism. Anyway … Most of the speakers on this topic suggested the arrival of a minimum around 2030 (although one of the speakers considered the end of this century to be more likely). I leave this prediction to the speakers involved and only point out that it corresponds to the idea of a 60-year cycle and the development of the global temperature. Moreover, this hypothesis has the advantage that it can be tested in time. We will definitely have to wait a few more years to get clarity. But we do not have to wait until 2050 or 2100, as with the IPCC models. Camille Veyres, the second of our [French] team, was one of the few who tried to give a broad presentation about the mistakes that the IPCC had made (he spoke of “fraud”, I disapprove of these kinds of qualifications). He did his utmost to clarify his ideas as concisely as possible in order to stay within his 20 minutes speaking time slot. In addition, various presentations focused on more specialized themes, such as Albrecht Glatzle ‘s important and interesting lecture on methane, the unexplained stabilization in recent years and the lack of any link between the geographical distribution of its concentration and that of the location of livestock farming. (NOTE: Albrecht’s paper and poster discussed here in English, Spanish and German)Peter RiddA funny coincidence that around the time that the local version of the ridiculous “global climate march” began, Peter Ridd’s presentation took place. This Australian specialist from the Great Barrier Reef was fired by his university because of his criticism of the imminent demise of it, which is being predicted almost every year. Ridd himself could not come. His presentation was therefore presented by Nils-Axel Mörner.Christopher EssexThe best was not saved before the end (that was my presentation, which was the last …), but for the beginning, with an excellent presentation by Christopher Essex. He sketched, among other things, an impressive picture of what happens when we conduct a thought experiment with regard to our perception of the speed with which time passes by slowing down or accelerating it. (There is, he told us, an episode of Star Trek based on this idea). For example, if we take a picture of a wild river with a shutter speed of a few minutes, the movement of swirls and waves will disappear, leaving only an image of water that is seemingly perfectly calm. More generally, slowing things down (or speeding them up, depending on the point of view), transforms a dynamic into a structure, as with a photo of the starry sky taken with a shutter speed of one hour, with the movement of the stars (too slow for the eye) resemble a structure made of light arcs and circles whose pole star is the common centre – with this property that it is impossible to reconstruct the direction of the movement of the stars without additional information.Benoît RittaudAll in all, it was two days that were worth the effort. Disagreements, discussions, questions … as many indications that climate-realistic conferences are indeed scientific conferences.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PS.The summaries can be viewed on the website of the conference. The presentations and videos will soon be put on the website. Source here.Dutch Text:Verslag Porto klimaatconferentiePorto Een bijdrage van Benoît Rittaud, President van de ‘Association des climato–réalistes’.Vooraanstaande wetenschappers vanuit de gehele wereld verzamelden zich op 7 en 8 september 2018 in Porto, Portugal, om de stand van de wetenschap vanuit een klimaatrealistisch perspectief te bespreken.Fernanda Ribeiro. Na applaus voor Fernanda Ribeiro, decaan aan de Universiteit van Porto, die het mogelijk maakte om de conferentie aldaar te houden, vonden gedurende twee dagen lezingen plaats over de stand van de wetenschap vanuit een klimaatrealistisch perspectief.Het is te vroeg om te kunnen beweren dat er een sluitende en complete theorie bestaat, die de ontwikkeling van het klimaat kan verklaren (zonder gebruik te maken van CO2 als verklarende factor). In zijn presentatie op zaterdagmiddag probeerde Nils–Axel Mörner echter een synthese te schetsen van hoe zo’n coherente theorie er uiteindelijk uit zou kunnen zien.Nils-Axel Mörner. Volgens zijn presentatie, en zonder in te gaan op de details van mechanismen die nog niet goed worden begrepen, dient men – en dat is geen verrassing – te kijken naar de invloed van fluctuaties van de zonneactiviteit op de klimaatveranderingen. Deze variabiliteit manifesteert zich via vier mechanismen: de wijziging van de oceaancirculatie (in zijn eerste presentatie wees Nils–Axel Mörner erop dat de Portugese kust een ideale observatiepost is om de veranderingen van de Golfstroom te bestuderen), wolken (we denken daarbij dan natuurlijk aan het werk van Svensmark en Shaviv), luminositeit en uiteindelijk de winden. Afhankelijk van de auteur, is het de een of de andere factor die domineert.Vincent Courtillot. Wat de winden betreft waren verschillende sprekers (Nils–Axel Mörner, Piers Corbyn, Nicola Scafetta) vooral geïnteresseerd in de kwestie van de lengte van de dag. Dit komt overeen met het werk van Vincent Courtillot, waaruit duidelijk naar voren komt dat de variatie in de rotatiesnelheid van de aarde (die sinds de jaren 1960 nauwkeurig kan worden gemeten) correleert met klimaatkenmerken, door het effect van aardrotatie op zonale winden. (Vincent Courtillot had die gedachte al geopperd aan het einde van een debat bij de Academie van Wetenschappen, dat vier jaar geleden plaatsvond.)Terwijl sommige voordrachten betrekking hadden op de effecten van de zon op onze planeet, was een andere presentatie gericht op het effect van de planeten op de zon. De variatie van de zonneactiviteit (in het bijzonder gemeten aan de hand van het aantal zonnevlekken) kan worden verklaard uit analyses van de bewegingen van de planeten. De zwaartekracht van de grootste planeten (Jupiter, Saturnus, Uranus, Neptunus) is van een orde van grootte die voldoende is om de positie van het zwaartepunt van het zonnestelsel meetbaar te beïnvloeden, afhankelijk van de positie van die planeten.Ik ben nog steeds niet echt overtuigd van een van de voorgestelde alternatieven. Naar mijn mening is er nog behoorlijk wat werk aan de winkel, voordat zij als in beton gegoten kunnen worden gepresenteerd. Dat wil zeggen, om niet het risico te lopen dat de astronomische cycli, die door deze en gene werden genoemd, kunnen worden afgeserveerd met verwijzing naar de beroemde uitspraak van John von Neumann:‘With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.’ Francois Gervais.Onder de cycli die nog steeds stand houden, is die van 60 jaar (misschien te onderscheiden in twee afzonderlijke zeer vergelijkbare looptijden, volgens Roger Tattersall). Dat zou François Gervais, een Franse klimaatrealist, plezier doen, die zoals gewoonlijk een degelijke presentatie hield over de klimaatgevoeligheid.Wat de cycli betreft, leek Roger Tattersall mij de meest overtuigende spreker. Hij stelde de stabiliteit van een aantal dynamische systemen, zoals die van de belangrijkste satellieten van Jupiter, aan de orde. Hij legde ook verband met de rij van Fibonacci. Het is bekend dat deze reeks getallen (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …) de fundamentele eigenschap heeft dat de verhouding van twee opeenvolgende termen (8/5, dan 13/8, dan 21/13, etc.) steeds dichter bij de waarde (1 + √5) / 2 komt. Deze waarde wordt de gulden snede genoemd. De gulden snede heeft een speciale rekenkundige eigenschap: dit is het getal dat, in exacte mathematische zin, het verst is verwijderd van de verzameling breuken (de getallen van de vorm m/n met m en n gehele getallen). Deze eigenschap zou de aanwezigheid van de eerste termen van de rij van Fibonacci in deze overwegingen van orbitale stabiliteit kunnen verklaren. De ideeën van Roger over de geschiedenis van de wetenschap, door Kepler’s geschriften waren evenzeer erg interessant. Roger Tattersall.Een vraag die meerdere keren aan de orde kwam, was die van een toekomstig zonneminimum. Het is waar dat de bijzonder zwakke zonnecyclus 24 genoeg is om voorspellingen te rechtvaardigen van een mogelijk equivalent van een Dalton-minimum of, sterker, van een Maunder-minimum (een periode gedurende welke in Frankrijk in de winter de wijn bevroor in de glazen). Deze zoektocht naar het volgende minimum is misschien ingegeven door wensdenken. Deze zou het einde kunnen betekenen van de huidige opwarming en daardoor waarschijnlijk ook van het klimaatalarmisme. Maar goed …De meeste sprekers over dit onderwerp suggereerden de komst van een minimum zo rond 2030 (hoewel een van de sprekers het einde van deze eeuw waarschijnlijker achtte). Ik laat deze voorspelling voor rekening van de betrokken sprekers en wijs er alleen maar op dat deze overeenkomt met het idee van een 60–jarige cyclus en met de ontwikkeling van de wereldwijde temperatuur. Bovendien heeft deze hypothese het voordeel dat zij tijdig kan worden getoetst. We zullen zeker nog een paar jaar moeten wachten om duidelijkheid te krijgen. Maar we hoeven niet te wachten tot 2050 of 2100, zoals bij de IPCC-modellen.Camille Veyres, de tweede van ons [Franse] team, was een van de weinigen die probeerde een brede presentatie te geven over de fouten die het IPCC had gemaakt (hij sprak van “fraude”, ik keur dit soort kwalificaties af). Hij deed zijn uiterste best om zijn ideeën zo beknopt mogelijk te verduidelijken om binnen zijn 20 minuten spreektijd te blijven.Daarnaast concentreerden verschillende presentaties zich op meer gespecialiseerde thema’ s, zoals de belangrijke en interessante voordracht van Albrecht Glatzle over methaan, de onverklaarde stabilisatie in de afgelopen jaren daarvan en het ontbreken van enige link tussen de geografische verdeling van concentratie daarvan met die van de locatie van de veehouderij. Peter Ridd.Een grappig toeval wilde dat rond de tijd dat de lokale versie van de belachelijke “wereldwijde klimaatmars” begon, de voordracht van Peter Ridd plaatsvond. Deze Australische specialist van het Great Barrier Reef werd door zijn universiteit ontslagen, vanwege zijn kritiek op de nakende ondergang daarvan, die bijna elk jaar wordt voorspeld. Ridd zelf kon niet komen. Zijn voordracht werd daarom gepresenteerd door Nils-Axel Mörner. Christopher Essex.Het beste werd niet voor het einde bewaard (dat was mijn voordracht, die de laatste was …), maar voor het begin, met een uitstekende presentatie van Christopher Essex. Hij schetste onder andere een indrukwekkend beeld van wat er gebeurt als we een gedachte–experiment uitvoeren met betrekking tot onze perceptie van de snelheid waarmee de tijd voorbij gaat, door deze te vertragen of te versnellen. (Er is, zo vertelde hij ons, een aflevering van Star Trek gebaseerd op dit idee). Als we bijvoorbeeld een foto van een wilde rivier nemen met een sluitertijd van enkele minuten, verdwijnt de beweging van kolken en golven, waardoor er slechts een beeld overblijft van water dat schijnbaar volkomen kalm is. Meer in het algemeen, het vertragen van dingen (of het versnellen ervan, afhankelijk van het gezichtspunt), transformeert een dynamiek in een structuur, zoals bij een foto van de sterrenhemel die is genomen met een sluitertijd van een uur, waarbij de beweging van de sterren (te traag voor het oog) lijkt op een structuur gemaakt van lichtbogen en –cirkels waarvan de poolster het gemeenschappelijke centrum is – met deze eigenschap dat het onmogelijk is om de richting van de beweging van de sterren te reconstrueren zonder aanvullende informatie. Benoît Rittaud.Al met al waren het twee dagen die de moeite waard waren. Meningsverschillen, discussies, vragen … evenveel indicaties dat klimaat–realistische conferenties inderdaad wetenschappelijke conferenties zijn.PS,De samenvattingen kunnen worden bekeken op de website van de conferentie. De presentaties en video’s zullen binnenkort op de website worden gezet.Bron hier. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'Paris Agreement', 'Porto Climate Conference']",2018/10/21

AgriGHG-2018 english FOSContributed by Albrecht Glatzle, Paraguay © 2018 Participants At the AgriGHG-2018 conference some 200 marvelous people came together, nice, friendly, and very competent in their respective fields (from fish breeding to agroforestry). It was a pleasure to talk to them. I estimated the average age of participants from all over the world at about 35 years (from graduate students to research department directors). In the 4 parallel sessions and poster presenters the typical speakers were post-doctoral fellows but of course also quite a number of professors. There was a parallel conference of the Global Research Alliance. They were debating policies for the worldwide implementation of “climate smart agriculture” with some 100 high level delegates (with a higher average age, maybe 50 or even 55). This group, from dozens of countries, included leaders from several international organizations such as GRA (Global Research Alliance), FACCE (Program on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change), CCAFS (Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security), ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System), IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute), the vice president of FAO (Food Agriculture Organization), the president of WFO (World Farmers Organization), plenty of national institutions (e.g. New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre), and (ex-)ministers from several countries. There were also joint plenary events and panel discussions. So as an attentive participant one could get a clear impression of the thought structures of the key players in policy and research for presumably mitigating manmade climate change and climate change impacts in agriculture. Expressed and unexpressed positions and beliefs[personal comments are in brackets in italics] The delegates represented tens of thousands of researchers from national and international institutions and organizations. These groups together move several hundred millions of world taxpayers’ Euros every year. These activities provide tens of thousands of well-paid employment positions. Also, thousands of students get the opportunity and a topic for a thesis research. This is certainly good news, as long as all these activities are based in the solid ground of good science. May I, however, express some doubts in this respect?There was not one single opportunity during the whole conference that I was aware of that any of the widely proven beneficial impacts of (manmade) CO2 emissions on nature, agriculture and global food security was even mentioned, even though this is evident in literally hundreds of scientific publications (a very up-to-date summary: https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/climate-change-reconsidered-ii-fossil-fuels—summary-for-policymakers). I was not aware of one single participant who wouldn’t have considered CO2 as a pollutant that needs to be reduced. When I mentioned this point, the CO2 is beneficial to agriculture, etc., to a modeler of GHG-impacts, he said that so far he had not yet considered this point in his models, but he plans to do so in future. It was somehow irritating that a conference focusing on Agriculture totally ignored the most important nutrient of life, CO2.There was a consensus at an apparent 100% level among all participants of the conference that the climate is predominantly controlled by manmade GHGs and that the future of the world’s climates depends on the effective reduction of GHG emissions. I could not hear the expression of the slightest doubt that this could not be true or that the IPCC-defined science could possibly not be settled. No one questioned this stance. Nobody among the participants felt the slightest need to resume any debate on the validity of the dogmatic view that human GHG-emissions are responsible for climate change and alleged climate disruptions. Several high-level decision makers stressed that our efforts to mitigate Climate Change are not nearly ambitious enough. FAO-vice-president considered rich nations responsible for the climate distortions that we are supposedly witnessing. So, these nations should pay for the “damage caused”. Others (Werner Kutsch, ICOS) welcomed the fact that “we can feel climate change so clearly in this hot summer” (in part of Europe). “This will raise awareness among politicians and encourage them to do more” [spend more money], he added. The social scientists among the participants seemed to be the most convinced of the alleged scientific consensus and of the need to act urgently and even to exert pressure on the countries: “We have all legal and moral right to control the real mitigation efforts of the countries, including the least income ones, to see what they are really doing” (senior female bureaucrat from CCAFS). “70% of the agricultural mitigation potential is in developing countries.” (Castro Salazar, FAO) It was of course admitted by all leading speakers that it is not easy to achieve the reduction targets agreed on in the Paris agreement. “There is no way to get mitigation running unless we achieve win-win situations” (Andy Reisinger, NZ Agric.-GHG Research Centre). [However, win-win-situations in costly mitigation projects can only be achieved within certain limits (e.g. in the case of higher energy efficiency or by beneficial soil fertility impacts of Carbon sequestration within Soil Organic Matter). So, what could be more obvious than increasing the opportunity costs for “business as usual”, in order to make mitigation efforts more attractive? The higher the assumed damages caused by an uncontrolled “wild” climate, the higher the acceptable costs for damage containment. Once the potential damages caused by climate extremes are assumed to be very high and once the feasibility of forcing the climate to a desirable behavior by GHG-mitigation have been accepted, the costs of mitigation can be fairly high and are still pretending to produce a profit.The most recent IPCC report SR1.5 (http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/) is a prime example of an attempt not only to make efforts to reduce GHG emissions more attractive, but also to declare them overdue and to be virtually essential to survival. Without presenting a profit and loss account, the IPCC takes it for granted that, in order to avoid catastrophic damage, practically every conceivable effort is worthwhile to reduce global warming to 1.5º instead of 2ºC, whereby it is stubbornly assumed that the mean global temperature is directly dependent on the greenhouse gas concentration in the air (without taking into account the numerous scientific publications of recent years that massively question this). But what happens, if dangerous climate extremes have not been increasing (as even admitted by the IPCC) and there is no discernible influence of human GHG emissions on the climate? All mitigation efforts become pointless! This was, by the way, the central message of the around 100 scientists from all over the world who gathered at the  international conference on “Basic Science of a Changing Climate” at Porto University just a week before the Berlin conference (https://www.portoconference2018.org/). Contrary to Berlin, in Porto the diverse drivers of climate change were in the focus of discussion. Nobody agreed with the IPCC hypothesis that CO2 and other manmade GHGs could be the dominant cause of eternal climate change (as it was accepted unopposed by all participants in Berlin).] Back in Berlin, an example of a mitigation success story was presented by Heather McKhann from FACCE who celebrated this formula LD50 + N0 = +SOC and –N2O as a kind of breakthrough. [However, isn’t it sort of banality that halving livestock density (LD50) can stimulate carbon sequestration through the built up of soil organic carbon (SOC), and that the renunciation of Nitrogen fertilizer (N0) will reduce Nitrous Oxide emissions? There was no comment on how these measures affected yields and profitability and the audience obviously did not miss it!] I had the pleasure of meeting in Berlin for the fourth time (the first time in his new position) the very sympathetic president of the World Farmers’ Organization WFO, the South African Theo de Jager. He presented a slightly different mitigation strategy: Knowing that humanity needs to eat and depends on farming for the foreseeable future, he suggested that his member organizations will prepare a plan how to reduce GHG-emissions from Agriculture and Livestock husbandry at a world-wide scale. With this message he then wants to address national and international politicians telling them how much it will cost to achieve the planned reduction targets. So he expects high subsidies and good business for the farmers who will implement the mitigation efforts agreed on [of course at taxpayers’ and consumers’ costs]. [This however also includes some risks for the global food security: With unhealthy incentives there will be an increasing competition for arable lands between food crops and afforestation or energy crops, which inevitably will increase food prices.] Yet the FAO Vice president Castro Salazar was confident that agricultural GHG-emissions can be brought to zero by 2100 through emission reduction (20%) and compensation (80%). [However, as shown in Germany, bioenergy farmers (trying to offset carbon emissions) depend entirely on subsidies and purchase guaranties. They are unable to compete on a free energy market. Once the price guaranties expire, all farmers specialized on bioenergy will have a very hard time to reorganize their farms back towards a conventional agricultural business without subsidies.] Theo de Jager, president of the World Farmers’ Organization told the audience at a panel discussion his unique experience when he met with a regionally well-known nomad in the Sahel zone: This elderly man owns more than 3000 head of cattle, beautiful animals, wonderfully tame. One can walk into the herd and touch the animals. Around 70% of the herd is male (but only 5% are needed for mating!). Only 30% are female animals capable of calving. Jager suggested to the owner of the herd that he should sell most of the surplus male animals every year and thus become a rich man with fewer animals but much higher reproduction rate, and less grazing pressure on the land. “Are you selling your children?” asked the nomad. “No, but the animals are not your children.” “But they are like my children!” “How many have you slaughtered lately?” “Six in the past two years: 2 for a funeral and 4 for a wedding.” “And how many animals died?” “Around 600!” (which is a significant part of the calving rate). When saying goodbye, Jager was asked for his telephone number and WhatsApp address! Jager expects a fundamental change of commercial attitude with the next generation growing up in Africa.[This is definitely the most striking example of inefficiency in a wholeheartedly practiced livestock production system. However, does this also mean that nomadism practiced since thousands of years is unsustainable? Certainly not! But how does this insight fit to the efficiency concept in our criteria for sustainability? Isn’t the luxury of keeping thousands of horses just for pleasure particularly in the richest countries a modern example of “inefficiency”?] Another wise comment made by Jager: “The food supply chain is a chain, which cannot be pushed but has to be pooled (by demand)”. This means translated: Try not to impose restrictions to production but rather listen to what the market is asking for. Farmers tend to produce demand-oriented. [While this is a captivating argument, sometimes one might be forced to pool the (supply) chain: Recently I was searching in German supermarkets for charcoal without the WWF-label. I couldn’t find it! Isn’t it a very clever strategy practiced by the WWF to try to occupy sort of monopolist position in the commercialization of its “sustainability-blessings” for a variety of food and forestry products (perceived by the public to represent the highest standards of integrity, objectivity and scientific soundness)? On the other hand, the production sector has to decide to what extent he really shares common ground with WWF and whether or not he is prepared to give WWF a (paid) platform to spread its logotype with his products.] This is really a fundamental question for agriculture considering the disturbing remarks made by Sonja Vermeulen (Global Lead Scientist for the Food Practice of WWF) in a panel in Berlin: “Food is the biggest driver for loss of nature.” [Should we reduce humanity for the sake of nature?] “Halving carbon footprint of food within the next 5 years is our target.” [And what if carbon footprint is absolutely irrelevant for anything as evidence suggests?] “Shift in diet is the most significant mitigation tool at lowest cost” [reducing red meat consumption, just as The Guardian also called for recently: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown?CMP=share_btn_tw]. A carbon price of 150$/t would double the price for beef. [Will humanity let prescribe its food consumption habits by WWF, IPCC and FAO just because these organizations erroneously believe this could bring the climate to a desired behavior?] [It is disturbing to what extent farmers’ organizations and leading personalities from politics, science and economy are wrapping themselves in sackcloth and ashes, accepting without any resistance that agriculture is making a significant contribution to a potentially dangerous climate change, although the scientific justification for this allegation does not stand up to critical scrutiny. They are prepared to accept considerable restrictions and expenses in order to “save” the climate by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, in the illusionary expectation to ultimately emerge as beneficiaries from the externally imposed codes of conduct, the costs of which are expected to be covered by taxpayers and consumers under the auspices of politics regulating everything.The alternative strategy would be to face up to the weakly substantiated allegations of the harmfulness of agriculture and livestock husbandry for the climate, and to prove the contrary with well-founded scientific counterarguments. This, however, only is possible when farmers accept the overwhelming evidence of CO2 being their most important ally. As soon as farmers think it is meritorious to fight the most important nutrient of life, CO2, as if it were a pollutant, they have lost. Then they are prisoners of the quasi-religious illusion of a dangerous, man-made climate change fed by distorted science.] Personal impressions and experiences at the Berlin conference Apparently, I was the only dissident participant at this conference. Maybe I was even the only participant travelling at his own expenses. When I submitted my abstract (see attachment below, clearly documenting my critical position) I applied for a slot to give a presentation. Despite a promise to be informed about my admission to the conference by May, without further notice, only after my inquiry in June I was informed that I had been admitted for a poster presentation. When I arrived in Berlin and presented myself to the chief organizing lady she remembered my name very well among several hundred participants (and I had the strong feeling that this was due to my dissident position, which drew her attention). I guess I was admitted to the conference, despite my undesired message, for two reasons:As an alibi that even inconvenient contents will be allowed to the conference.Being the only participant from Paraguay my participation meant one country more attending the conference.However, my opinion should not attract too much attention. That’s why I think I was only allowed a poster presentation. Moreover, on the introductory plenary session it was noticeable that I was stubbornly overlooked by this very lady, moderating the discussion, in spite of my early and clearly visible requests to ask a question. When it came to the poster presentation, I was the fourth who had three minutes to explain the essence of the poster. My performance was a bit faltering, but still coherent and clear. What really surprised me was the fact that I was the first one to receive applause for my explanations. This showed me that, in spite of the ostensible unanimity on the apparently manmade climate change, there was a dormant potential in the audience for doubting the official version, when plausible scientific arguments were presented. This was the essence of my three-minute poster presentation (see poster below): We were looking for livestock influence on the climate and could not find any. Why is that?IPCC claims are incompatible with reality. The irrefutable reality of extended warm periods in preindustrial times is witnessed by prominent tree trunks preserved in glaciers and moors well above the present-day tree lines.On the other hand, the global warming forcing components as defined and quantified by the IPCC are very much dominated by manmade GHG-emissions. Natural climate influence has been reduced to a tiny effect of direct solar irradiance. There is no way whatsoever to explain any significant warming at preindustrial GHG-levels with these IPCC tools. There’s clearly something wrong with the IPCC concept. Therefore, manmade GHG emissions cannot be the main driver of climate change.There is a wealth of scientific evidence that manmade CO2-emissions have been beneficial for Nature, agriculture and global food security. On the other hand, we can see, at best, only a tiny climate effect from the increase of CO2 from 0.03 to 0.04% since the beginning of industrialization.There is no discernible livestock fingerprint, neither in the geographical methane distribution……nor in the historical evolution of average methane concentration in the air.Livestock born methane emissions do not fit at all to the geographical pattern of methane concentration as measured by satellite.Between 1990 and 2005 global methane concentration leveled off completely in spite of a significant increase of world cattle population by more than a 100 million head during this period.We conclude that livestock emissions are insignificant for the global methane budget.The IPCC guidelines for National GHG-inventories do contain methodological errors. These guidelines give instructions how to estimate total emissions from managed ecosystems. However, emissions from native ecosystems are explicitly not taken into account.All agro-ecosystems replaced native ones at some stage in history. So, to determine the manmade part of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agro-ecosystems, total emissions have to be corrected for the natural baseline emissions, which even occur without any human influence. This correction is omitted in the IPCC guidelines. Therefore, the IPCC falsely considers all farm born methane and nitrous oxide emissions as manmade at a 100% level. The logical consequence is a systematic overestimation of manmade emissions from agro-ecosystems, an error which propagated undetected hundredfold through scientific literature.In conclusion we cannot see any substantiated livestock influence on the climate. Of course there were some critical questions:One lady said she was not a scientist herself, but what I explained is fundamentally contrary to current scientific views. She asked me if I was a climate scientist.My answer: No, I am an agricultural scientist, but I have been intensively involved in the scientific debate on climate change for more than 10 years and have also contacted dozens of prominent climate scientists. I have come to the compelling conclusion that eternal climate change is not primarily man-made, not even the present one. Moreover, science has never been a question of presumed majority consensus. Last week I participated in a congress at Porto University, Portugal, where around 100 leading scientists from 4 continents debated “the Basic Science of a Changing Climate”. Although there were disagreements between participants in some details, the participants presented diverse scientific evidence of internal earthly drivers of climate change, and external solar and planetary drivers of climate change. Many of these are seen in visible evidence of cycles embedded in earth’s geology. This group of scientists sees that humanity is not the principal driver of climate change [https://www.portoconference2018.org/].A USDA scientist from Washington DC (US Department of Agriculture) accused me of giving biased information on CO2. During the Milankovitch cycles, he said, CO2 and temperature had been running parallel. So, CO2 caused temperature change.My answer: Not at all! Temperature change was always leading and CO2 following. So, CO2 could not be the cause for a changing temperature. The warming ocean gasses CO2 out, the cooling ocean re-absorbs CO2. Plenty of beneficial impacts of additional CO2 have been documented. However, there is no convincing scientific evidence that this trace compound – CO2 – could cause any dangerous warming.”But CO2 produced a feedback, i.e. the re-enforcement necessary to obtain the observed warming” he added.My answer: There is no proof of any CO2-reinforcement and no need for that to explain temperature change between ice ages and interglacial periods. To the contrary, CO2 re-enforcement would eventually lead to a runaway effect of temperature which simply did not occur.“What about sea-level rise and ocean acidification?”My answer: Unadjusted data measured with hundreds of tide gauges along the coastlines all over the world do not show any acceleration of mean sea level rise since more than 60 years (Mörner; Parker; Wysmuller).There is no ocean acidification; pH of sea water is alkaline and ranges from 7.8 to 8.3. The most “acid” sea waters are offshore Peru (pH 7.8), one of the richest fishing-grounds worldwide. Corals thrive at places where CO2 is released from the ocean floor. So, CO2 is not the cause for coral bleaching. Moreover, there is no convincing evidence of any detectable decline in average ocean water alkalinity.“But you’re right in two points”, the USDA-scientist said: “We also realized that the release of methane from cattle is of minor importance globally. And we also found that the IPCC guidelines ignore natural baseline emissions from ecosystems, overstating the manmade emissions” he added. [For me, this was the second time that a scientist admitted the erroneous omission of baseline emissions, committed by the IPCC. The first time it was at the Marrakech COP22, when I talked to a US-scientist working at CIAT, Colombia. Strangely, however, this gentleman defended the concept, that politics that provide funding for research do have the right to lay down the methodological rules of how to define manmade emissions. “When they tell us to ignore baseline emissions we have to do that.” Of course, I strongly disagreed to this submissive concept as it clearly contradicts good logic and science.]At the end of the discussion a lady, also from USDA, advised me: “As you’re not a climatologist yourself, you have to believe the experts! Your position shows me they’ve still got a lot of work to do making their message more logical for everyone to understand.” At the last day of the conference three participants, whom I did not know and with whom I had never spoken before, greeted me in a very friendly way as I passed by (independently from each other). One of them I had seen before, two or three times, watching closely my poster during the breaks. Had I delivered a new, convincing message to the three of them with my poster? But they didn’t want to show too clearly that they sympathized with my position (that we are not yet on the brink of the end of the world, which only can be averted by mitigating GHG emissions)? Conclusions At the conference AgriGHG-2018 in Berlin leading policy makers and scientist from many countries came together representing thousands of professionals who deal with all imaginable topics related to the modern concept of “climate smart agriculture”. The many programs (only a tiny portion of which could be presented at the conference) spend hundreds of millions of euros and create, directly and indirectly, tens of thousands of well-paid jobs worldwide. Every now and then these programs generate interesting amendments of basic scientific knowledge or other desirable side effects. Their intended additional value, however, can only be achieved under the (illusionary) assumption of very high opportunity costs for doing nothing, i.e. only with major mitigation efforts catastrophic climate change and its catastrophic consequences can presumably be avoided. But what if the climate was not controlled by man-made GHG emissions? The whole concept of “climate smart agriculture” would collapse and all the costly programs would lose their legitimacy. Therefore, it is obvious that– the concept of climate controllability through GHG emission avoidance– and the idea that CO2 is a “climate-killing” pollutantmust be cultivated by the beneficiaries of the programs as an inviolable scientific consensus, and any criticism of this dogma must be combated. Tens of thousands would lose their jobs as soon as a broader public was aware that the GHG-dominated IPCC models have been wrong. Therefore, all questioning of GHG driven Climate Change is considered a threat to business and to income by all those who have a vested and even existential interest in the idea that the climate can be controlled effectively in a desired way by human action. Under these conditions it is, of course, undesirable to cast doubt on the aforementioned beliefs or even to start a new debate about them. Skeptics are therefore ignored, excluded and even eventually discriminated against. Such behavior is all the easier to justify if one can decorate it with highly ethical arguments, such as saving the planet from catastrophic climate change. Even farmers’ associations seem to follow this strategy on the (erroneous) assumption that, although they can be affected by serious land use restrictions, they will ultimately (under the protection of politics) emerge as winners from this game, and the respective bill will finally be paid by others (i.e. the consumers). Such a constellation, a complex mixture of interests, real and distorted science, quasi-religious beliefs, group pressure and herd instinct, is very unfavorable for maintaining an open debate, which has always been an essential feature of sound science. I was pleased to see that this kind of open debate did happen, for example, at the conference on “The Basic Science of a Changing Climate” at the Faculty of Geography of the University of Porto in early September 2018 (https://www.portoconference2018.org/). This event was attended by many emeritus (and therefore independent) scientists (all of whom had travelled on their own expenses), and I had the honor to be among them. Opponents had tried to prevent this conference with an open letter to the dean’s office but could not assert themselves. The right of free speech and exchange of scientific arguments has finally won in Porto. But what was it like in Berlin? Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['agriculture', 'climate change', 'GHG reduction targets']",2018/10/14
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/12/climate-change-and-you-whos-afraid-of-1-5c/,,Climate Change and You – Who’s Afraid of 1.5°C?," With all the climate hysteria in the news stemming from the recent IPCC report, I wrote to Prof. Christopher Essex to ask about his views on the 1.5° C  issue and what it would mean to me.  Here’s what he replied. – Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager, Friends of Science Dear Michelle, They don’t mean 1.5 ° C. They don’t mean that the weather will always be 1.5° C hotter everywhere. Somedays it will be cooler some of the time and in other places it will be warmer some of the time, and sometimes a little bit of both here and there. No one really even cares about such a small difference anyway. Most of us will be hard pressed (outside disputes with your spouse over the correct setting of  your  thermostat) to sense a change of 1.5 degrees, especially if humidity, cloud cover and wind can vary too.What people care about is if the weather is different. God only knows how to determine “different” about something that changes every day and even every hour anyway. Oh yes, its the average weather—whatever that means. You can forget about models telling you about average weather. All observational meteorological phenomena are below their resolution for very basic reasons. They are famously wrong on what they come up with. Similarly all climate energetics in the vertical are also below their resolution, for similarly basic reasons. In those below-resolution domains they use fake physics, which is politely called parameterization. Mathematically speaking that can mean anything at all. What 1.5° C really means scientifically is nothing.But that does not stop the cultural momentum desiring  tax policy  to control the weather.Let’s put this into a proper perspective. I don’t mind large amounts of snow. When it is fresh, white and fluffy it is kind of pretty. But damn, it falls on roads and sidewalks. Do you think that we can have an international treaty requiring that snow not fall on roads or sidewalks? I am sure that policy people and ideologues will come up with something if asked as long as someone tells them that experts told them that particular ideological political policies will achieve that. There is no danger that they will use common sense. No normal person will believe that policy will have any control over where snow falls, only ideologues and academics could be bamboozled into that.I don’t see that 1.5°C is any different.RegardsChris____________________Dr. Christopher Essex,ProfessorDepartment of Applied Mathematicsthe University of Western OntarioShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2018/10/12
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/12/the-eco-war-on-oil-pipelines-dispatches-from-the-front/,,The Eco-War on Oil Pipelines – Dispatches From The Front," This is a summary of proceedings.  For detailed information and specifics, please refer to the original file.  https://hotair.com/archives/2017/08/22/dakota-access-pipeline-developer-sues-greenpeace-eco-terrorist-campaign/ Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.The general public has a positive view of environmental organizations. They are perceived as being so friendly and peaceful in an almost Ghandi-like way that we just cannot help supporting them and donating. After all, they are saving the planet, right?  They are protecting nature for our grandchildren, right? Then, along comes a news story that shows how utterly false these images are. Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) is one of the largest companies in the United States owning and operating oil and natural gas pipelines. It is also the sponsor of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline in the United States. It begins in the Bakken shale oil fields in northwest North Dakota and continues through South Dakota and Iowa to Patoka, Illinois. Together with the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka to Nederland, Texas, it forms the Bakken system. The $3.78 billion project was announced to the public in June 2014. The pipeline was completed by April 2017 and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017. It became commercially operational on June 1, 2017. In August, 2017, ETP filed a federal lawsuit in the United States against Greenpeace International and its affiliate organizations, BankTrack, Earth First!, and other environmental organizations and individuals. In July, 2018 a federal judge dismissed the group BankTrack from the lawsuit and threatened to do the same for Earth First! unless ETP could make a better case against them. ETP filed a revised suit in August 2018, which brought this back into the news. I read the original ETP complaint upon which it based its lawsuit. The ETP Complaint in General The ETP complaint is based on the company’s perception of the actions of environmental groups over the period between the time when its initial proposal and route was approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the ultimate completion of the pipeline. The preliminary statement reads as follows: “ This case involves a network of putative not-for-profits and rogue eco-terrorist groups who employ patterns of criminal activity and campaigns of misinformation to target legitimate companies and industries with fabricated environmental claims and other purported misconduct, inflicting billions of dollars in damage. The network’s pattern of criminal and other misconduct includes (i) defrauding charitable donors and cheating federal and state authorities with claims that they are legitimate tax-free charitable organizations; (ii) cyber-attacks; (iii) intentional and malicious interference with their targeted victim’s business relationships; and (iv) physical violence, threats of violence and the purposeful destruction of private and federal property.” The preliminary statement describes the tactics employed by environmental groups according to the “Greenpeace model”. These include: “(1) manufacturing a media spectacle based upon phony but emotionally-charged hot-button issues, sensational lies, and intentionally incited physical violence, property destruction, and other criminal conduct; and (2) relentlessly publicizing these sensational lies, manufactured conflict and conflagration, and misrepresented ‘causes’ to generate funding from individual donors, foundations, and corporate sponsors.” In a storyline that would be very familiar to those in Canada who have observed the tactics used by foreign-funded environmental organizations to oppose and sensationalize proposals for new oil pipelines, the 187-page Complaint describes at length the many measures that ETP took to assess, plan and prepare for the selection of an acceptable right of way for the Dakota Access pipeline and to consult exhaustively with private landowners, communities and aboriginal groups. Much of the controversy that subsequently surrounded the pipeline was based on claims that: The pipeline was intentionally constructed over sacred and culturally important sites (when, in fact, ETP had gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid such sites);The pipeline was constructed on tribal lands without permission (when, in fact, the pipeline was constructed almost exclusively on private land, with the remaining land comprised entirely of federal, not tribal lands);The pipeline was approved and constructed without tribal consultation (when, in fact, both ETP and USACE, the U.S. federal agency responsible for reviewing the project before issuing permits, consulted extensively with the tribes);The pipeline created a substantial risk of an oil spill that would poison the tribes’ drinking water (when, in fact, the route where the pipeline travels already contained an existing pipeline that has operated without incident or objection for decades and crude oil was being transported regularly through tribal land and water, without objection, by truck and rail, which are far more environmentally risky means of transport); andThat ETP had engaged in abusive treatment of protestors (when, in fact, all the attacks and violence were initiated by the protestors). The Campaign Waged against the Dakota PipelineMuch of the Complaint consists of a detailed documentation of illegal actions taken by Greenpeace and other environmental organizations. The following are some of the examples cited:In August, 2016, environmental organizations set up “resistance camps” near pipeline construction sites as bases for coordinating violent protests and fomenting public disorder to disrupt construction of the Dakota Pipeline.Red Warrior Camp recruited new members and trained them in criminal trespass, violence and property destruction. They supplied materials for and directed the attacks, and provided free legal representation and bail for those arrested for such illegal activities.“Bold Iowa” organized and trained “action teams” of five people each to mobilize repeatedly to prevent construction. These action teams trespassed on live construction zones and physically prevented construction by lying in front of bulldozers or other construction equipment.“Mississippi Stand”, another group, had members regularly use “steel or drop dragons” to lock themselves to construction equipment and construction sites and climbed into sections of the pipe to occupy the pipe so construction could not proceed. On November 10, 2016 Mississippi Stands activists, armed with screwdrivers, climbed onto a section of pipe to occupy it and prevent construction. After the activists were removed and arrested, construction workers were forced to rip out the plastic section of the pipe to ensure that the activists had not drilled any holes in the pipeline with their screwdrivers.Red Warrior coordinated large scale attacks on construction sites that concluded with arson, property damage and arrests. For example, on October 26, 2016, a large group of people led by Red Warrior entered Dakota Access property, set up roadblocks, and established an encampment. After requests from police that they vacate the property, the activists returned, set up makeshift barriers and lit them on fire to prevent officers from accessing the site. They threw Molotov cocktails, logs, rocks, debris, and even urine at the officers. They also set fire to numerous vehicles, three pieces of Dakota Access construction equipment, and two bridges. One activist fired three shots from a pistol at the police, narrowly missing an officer.Another group, Akicita, attacked a Dakota Access security guard who went to investigate equipment that was on fire. Akicita members rammed the guard’s vehicle off the road and threatened him with knives.On November 20, 2016, about 650 protesters, led by Red Warrior, attempted to flank a group of police officers. They started fires on a bridge to Dakota Access property and threw objects and homemade weapons, including grenades and flares, at police.In August, 2016 activists set fires to destroy construction equipment in Jasper County, Reasnor and Mahaska County, Iowa.On November 8, 2016, Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya of Mississippi Stand went to a construction site in Iowa and added motor oil and rags to six coffee canisters, placed them on the seats of six pieces of machinery and set them on fire. They damaged two excavators, a bulldozer, and a side boom, causing more than $1 million in damages.On at least three occasions, Reznicek and Montoya used blowtorches to cut holes in the pipeline.Greenpeace and its affiliates launched cyber-attacks on ETP under the guise of a front organization called Anonymous.In September, 2016, in Morton County, Red Warrior marched on to private property, blocked traffic, trampled a wire construction fence and stampeded with hundreds of protestors, horses, dogs, and vehicles onto lands where construction was ongoing. They threatened security personnel with knives, hit them with fence posts and flag poles, and otherwise attacked them. Several security officers were hospitalized as a result. This happened again later that month.The protestors took their battle to local law enforcement. USACE reported that “families of police officers are reportedly being threatened, followed home, and having their residence photographed and videotaped”.The protestors set up a semi-permanent camp site to harass construction for months. When the pipeline was finial finished, they left 250 truckloads of trash and waste at the protest site, precisely on the lands that they claim the native tribes hold sacred. Damages SoughtETP is seeking financial compensation for the damages inflicted on its property and business, including the damage to its reputation, brand and goodwill. The direct damages are estimated to be at least $300 million, and the total if granted could be as high as $1 billion. ConclusionThis promises to be a long drawn out legal battle. It is rare for an energy company to fight back so directly and vigorously against a group of environmental organizations that often enjoy widespread public support, whether deserved or not. The tactics employed by Greenpeace and related groups go far beyond the “peaceful” image they like to present to the public. They clearly see themselves as having the moral right to take actions that in most instances would be regarded as criminal and would irretrievably damage the reputation of those committing them. Too often, the tactics employed by radical environmental organizations in the United States are imported into Canada. One wonders how well equipped Canadian pipeline companies and law enforcement are to deal with this.   Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes']",2018/10/12

These are our opinions.Oct. 12, 2018The Honorable Bill MorneauMember of Parliament for Toronto Centre & Canada’s Minister of FinanceRE: https://www.fin.gc.ca/n18/18-083-eng.aspEmail:  fin.charity-bienfaisance.fin@canada.caMinister Morneau,RE: Comments on proposed changes to the Charities Act in the 30-day consultation periodWe address your request for comments in the following pages and in an open letter we posted to our blog as we believe these matters to be in the public interest.Part of the proposals to revise the Charities Act concern the removal of limitations on political activity.We submit that many Canadian Charities are already far too politicized, and several charities are clearly acting on behalf of offshore or corporate interests, to the detriment of Canadians.  Detailed examples are listed in the Appendix.Implementing Recommendation no. 3 of the Report of the Consultation Panel on the Political Activities of Charities to allow charities to pursue their charitable purposes by engaging in non-partisan political activities and in the development of public policy is a slippery slope.  The definition of “non-partisan” political activity is far from clear.  Shouldn’t supporting Minister McKenna’s Global Warming policies to the detriment of Canadian industries be deemed partisan?  Also one could argue that opposing the same policies would be deemed partisan to the opposing parties.As a group consisting of tax paying Canadians we request that if anything, the charities involved in receipt of foreign funds, which have agitated for ever more stringent environmental and climate policies, should be delisted as charities.Canadian taxpayers should not be further humiliated by being forced to support foreign funded ‘charities’ that are making them jobless.  There is no justice in that – eco or otherwise.Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETY Appendix of Eight ExamplesWest Coast Environmental LawIn an excerpt of the offshore funder, the Oak Foundation’s grant database[1] the grant says that West Coast Environmental Law (WCEL) of Canada was funded for $97,131.00 USD in 2010.  The purpose was: “To constrain development of Alberta’s tar sands through a legislative ban on crude oil tankers on British Columbia’s north coast. This would necessitate the cancellation of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline proposal to transport tar sands oil and bitumen to Asian markets. …”This came to pass. We would like to ask, what is the net public benefit of this multi-billion-dollar loss to the Canadian economy, thanks to the work of the advocacy arm of a Canadian ‘charity’ funded by offshore interests?[2]It would appear that some charities in Canada already operate with extremely broad political influence and that this level of influence appears to be acceptable to the Charities Directorate.  Is it acceptable to Canadian investors and industry?  Is this acceptable to the thousands of out of work oil and gas workers who have been forced to subsidize (through tax receipts) the anti-industry operations of this offshore funded ‘charity’? This tanker ban ruling has done immense harm to the Canadian economy – particularly to the group of First Nations investors and potential First Nations earners who looked forward to job creation through the Northern Gateway project – people who are looking to raise themselves out of on-reserve poverty. [3]  It is a tragic and true irony that one of the foundation principles of charities is the alleviation of poverty.  In this case, a federally registered charity ensured on-going poverty for thousands of First Nations people. Scope of Foreign InfluenceResearcher Vivian Krause[4] has documented in some detail the millions of dollars of foreign funds flowing to Canadian federally registered environmental charities and related non-governmental organizations.The global scope of such influence is clarified in the ClimateWorks Wikileaks document: ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeaksThe 2007 “Design to Win” document has been online for years.[5]The content of this document is supported by other peer-reviewed work by Matthew Nisbet. [6] Other commentators, such as Counterpunch are more specific about the objectives and parties involved.[7]None of this appears to represent charitable work.  The foundations involved appear to have vested interests in global cap and trade and renewables. Proxy for Corporate Interests – David Suzuki FundWe note that Mr. Peter Robinson, CEO of the David Suzuki Fund, was one of the members of the advisory panel on changing the charities act.In reviewing the Power Corporation’s Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP Worldwide) reports, posted on line, we found that Power Corporation states that it has been funding David Suzuki Foundation since 2007.[8]  David Suzuki Foundation has also been funded by offshore interests according to Vivian Krause, and also operates a US Charitable Foundation.Power Corporation owns a number of subsidiaries, some of them in the renewable wind and solar industries.  David Suzuki Foundation has been agitating to phase out coal and incorporate wind and solar, especially in Alberta.  David Suzuki Foundation made a submission to the Alberta government’s Climate Leadership Panel that was solely dedicated toward the implementation of wind power in Alberta.  The Alberta Climate Leadership Panel moved forward to implement some 5,000 MW of wind and solar in Alberta and to phase out coal.  A Power Corporation subsidiary is now building a wind farm in Jenner, Alberta.These seem unlikely coincidences.David Suzuki Foundation has engaged in anti-pipeline and anti-oil rhetoric for years and has agitated against pipelines to the coast in British Columbia.  One of the major shareholders of Kinder Morgan Canada, the company owning the Trans Mountain pipeline and the expansion project, is Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec – which is also reportedly an investor in Power Corporation or Power Financial Corporation, and thus may receive a direct or indirect benefit from the Canadian government’s purchase of the Trans Mountain Expansion project.  As noted, Power Corporation reports it has funded David Suzuki Foundation since 2007.Thus, it would appear that this charity has taken partisan political positions on a nationally-approved public work – the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion, approved by the NEB and federal cabinet – resulting in immense public harm and cost to the public in the form of forced purchase, by the Canadian government, of the moribund project, loss of revenue to federal, provincial, municipal and First Nations coffers due to underpricing existing exports and lack of access to regional and international markets, and the consequent widespread job loss.It is our understanding that charitable activities are defined as such because they are to provide a net public benefit. Indeed, charities were never established to act in political capacities, according to correspondence we received from the CRA. The following are the foundational reasons for the approval of a charity and its related activities:If following this mandate, charitable activities would be local, would provide a specific, tangible and measurable benefit, serving a local need.  There would be a net benefit to society.Clearly, in the example of the food bank, these needs would be better served by local people and a local organization, rather than establishing a top-down government body from Ottawa to administer a local food bank.This is not the case with a large national/international charity like the David Suzuki Foundation which has been blocking pipelines.  Excerpt of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Charities ‘net benefit’ guideline:It is difficult to believe that a partially foreign-funded ‘charity’ has more professional and technical insight and expertise about a pipeline’s performance and value to the nations, than the National Energy Board, which has been successfully approving energy and infrastructure projects for about the past 50 years.Some out-of-work oil field people have committed suicide.  It is hard to believe that pipeline blockades can be considered to be a ‘net public benefit’ when the country is losing some $50 million a day in revenues, and when global demand for oil is up, but Canadian access to markets is blocked by foreign-funded ‘charities.’May we note that all communications we have seen on these matters from the David Suzuki Foundation have been partisan in nature.EcojusticeThe anti-pipeline, partisan nature of Ecojustice has caused significant damage to the Canadian economy.Ecojustice has run a campaign to push for changes to Canada’s environmental laws, which industry and economics experts say have now made Canada a ‘hostile’ place to invest or try to do business.Since 2016, Ecojustice has been agitating against the NEB and Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion as clearly outlined by their Executive Director in this email to their subscribers.Ecojustice: Devon Page, Executive DirectorTo: <subscriber@ecojustice.ca>May 19, 2016 at 10:07 a.m.Feds have no choice but to tell Kinder Morgan no.Dear Friend,The National Energy Board (NEB) is set to release its recommendation on Kinder Morgan’s controversial application for the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project later today, and like many others awaiting the Board’s final report, we expect the outcome will leave us disappointed.Our cynicism does not come without experience. In recent years, Ecojustice lawyers have represented environmental interests during most of the major pipeline project reviews in Canada, and have been disappointed time and time again.We have been involved in the reviews for Enbridge’s Northern Gateway pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 9 reversal and Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, and we plan to participate in the review for TransCanada’s Energy East pipeline. We know pipelines, and we know how their review processes stack up. Generally speaking, they have gone from bad to worse — but that’s a tale for another day.With the number of gaps and deficiencies in its application, Kinder Morgan’s pipeline plan should never have seen the light of day, let alone be considered for final approval by a federal government that has promised to combat climate change and improve environmental assessments. Proving the old adage that it is quality, not quantity that matters, the company’s 15,000-page application failed to provide information that sufficiently evaluates the project’s many risks, including its effects on endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, threats to people and communities in the region, and the potential impacts of a major oil spill in the Fraser River or the Salish Sea.  We’ll know soon the extent to which these deficiencies are captured in the Board’s final report, but it is a certainty that climate change, the proverbial elephant in the room during these pipeline reviews, will barely register.And how could it? Climate change was entirely excluded from the Board’s scope of review, and appeared to be excluded from the approval process altogether until the newly-formed federal government tacked on some degree of climate consideration with the introduction of its interim environmental assessment measures in January 2016.While the measures are a welcome start, the prescribed ‘climate test’ misses half the picture. Only upstream greenhouse gas emissions will be assessed; downstream emissions will not be considered — despite the fact they account for the majority of this project’s climate impact. And even the analysis of upstream emissions is flawed. Based on the first draft climate assessment for another pipeline (Enbridge Line 3) the test fails to consider projects in the context of Canada’s national commitments and underestimates projects’ climate effects. We will have to wait until late May, after the NEB’s recommendation, to see the results of Kinder Morgan’s climate assessment.While details of the interim measures continue to emerge slowly, it remains unclear whether or how the climate assessment, done outside the NEB’s review by Environment Canada, will factor into Cabinet’s final decision. The best case is that this climate assessment will lead to a decision to not approve the pipeline expansion; the worst case is that it is meaningless and amounts to window dressing before a final approval. Time will tell.These half measures and unanswered questions are particularly disturbing when you consider that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his ministers swept into office with bold promises to take action on climate change and restore faith in Canada’s battered environmental assessment process. To his credit, Trudeau has since committed to, and signed, the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. However, the inadequacy of his government’s interim measures suggest that Trudeau’s pledges might be just that: All talk, and no action.We’re bracing for disappointment later today, but let’s not forget that the NEB’s recommendation on Kinder Morgan’s pipeline is not the final word on the matter.  When the Harper government gutted Canada’s environmental laws in 2012, it stripped the NEB of its role as the final decision-maker on projects like the Kinder Morgan pipeline and endowed the federal cabinet with that power instead.In other words, this is a golden opportunity for the federal government to demonstrate the bold leadership it has promised Canadians. If they are to truly deliver on their commitment to evidence-based decision-making and meeting the climate targets set in Paris, Trudeau and his ministers have no choice but to reject the Kinder Morgan project outright.It’s pretty simple.  All they have to do is say, “No.”Sincerely,Devon Page, Executive DirectorEcojustice is Canada’s only national environmental law charity. Help us build the case for a better earth.DONATENone of the materials we have seen have been non-partisan in nature. Many focussed on ‘climate change’ which was never part of the NEB’s mandate to begin with, introducing a false and misleading factor suggesting (to the public and legislative authorities) that there was negligence by the NEB, which was not the case.As described by former public servant and former diplomat, Robert Lyman, in this post:“The Federal Court of Appeal’s decision rests on two highly dubious claims of fact: first, that the National Energy Board did not examine the marine tanker consequences of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, when it clearly did; and second, that the modest increase in tanker traffic places the Orcas at a much higher risk of collision with shipping. Common sense, however, does not necessarily trump law.” [9]As reported by Vivian Krause, Ecojustice has been funded by offshore ClimateWorks partners via Canadian charity TIDES.It should be noted that Ecojustice client “Living Oceans” is a recipient of ClimateWorks partner funding via the Oak Foundation.The following is part of an anti-NEB campaign that Ecojustice ran for several months prior to the subsequent court case wherein they represented various parties. This is not impartial. This was part of a point and click email campaign to Members of Parliament, which raises questions about the fairness of the ruling by the Federal Court of Appeals.  Judges, no matter how impartial on the bench, are part of society and may have been exposed to this false and misleading material.We challenged these claims as false and misleading in this piece:wattsupwiththat.com/2017/08/25/ecojustice-competition-bureau-inquiry-the-competition-bureau-has-discontinued-the-inquiry-into-friends-of-science-society-that-ecojustice-publicly-called-for-on-dec-3-2015/Did the Trans Mountain Expansion project get a fair trial?  Normally it is not the convention that a plaintiff has the right to publicly denigrate a defendant for weeks or months.[10]How is this to the public benefit?  How is it non-partisan?If the foregoing illustrates how federally registered charities operate when the Canada Revenue Agency Act forbids partisan political activities that cause harm to the public; what will be the ramifications when or if the restrictions are lifted, as recommended by the panel [11]  (one panel member being part of the David Suzuki Foundation, a charity criticized herein for their political and proxy activity)? Tides CanadaAs noted above, the CRA requirement for the charity’s objective was that it should be local in nature, to the public good and with no fiduciary benefit to others, however we have noticed on TIDES Canada pages calls for action that appear to be related to investments and to international activity.Correspondence from the CRA to us states: “The Objective must limit the scope of the organization’s activities…”The TIDES main page website as it was, seems to contravene all of the above, offering ‘investment’, ‘international’ opportunities, ‘pooling’ of gifts, to ‘make the world a better place’ – none of this appears to meet the above parameters at all, especially the offer of ‘international’ giving – what place or who is that (ie. Vis a vis a ‘soup kitchen in Halifax’)?tidescanada.org/information-for-individuals-and-families/The operation of ‘charities’ in Canada has opened the door to all kinds of foreign and proxy influence to the detriment of Canadians and the Canadian economy.  We are not able to ascribe intent or legality of any of the issues listed herein – but we question how the outcomes have in any way provided net public benefit – the fundamental purpose of a charity.The ENGO market is proud of putting people out of work and costing our nation dearly. Why do we put up with this? What are the CRA charitable guidelines for if not to be enforced for the betterment of Canada?In the case of the International Funders of Indigenous People, in their 2010 report, there is a clear statement that ENGOs and various indigenous groups planned to engage in pipeline blockades with the intent of shutting down the Alberta oil sands (tar sands).  People at the event also advised they were willing to spend millions of dollars in legal fees (compensated in part by employing dozens of law students) in order to force certain constitutional issues.  In the case noted below, they spent $15 million dollars and spent 15 years.  How many First Nations students could have attended school, travelled or been provided with a better lot in life in that time and with that money?  How much did it cost the taxpayer to defend the case on behalf of the federal government?While there are certain very real wrongs that must be addressed in court – there are also limitations on the taxpayers’ purse and practical needs of the parties involved – where mediation and common goals might make more sense.But as we find in many of the pipeline blockade cases, or the demand for more stringent environmental management – nothing is good enough for these foreign funded ENGOs.  So, one can conclude that the Tar Sands Strategy is truly stating the objective. The objective is to drive up costs of production, hamper development with court challenges, denigrate and smear the product and workers as ‘dirty,’ drive off investors, and ultimately shut the project down (or of course, make it open season for vulture investors – another possibility.)Excerpts of the International Funders of Indigenous People’s 2010 report:[12]  Other Uncharitable ActsENGOs have tremendous public and political power at the moment:they are registered as provincial and federal lobbyiststhey have mobbed the mic at hearings and reviews; they can activate their large followings via social media within secondsthey have initiated EC complaints and appealsthey have interfered with international relations, initiating NAFTA CECE complaintsthey have coordinated with foreign ENGOs to demean Canadian resource activities in Washington DC.(linked examples are: Pembina Institute’s testimony to US Senate in 2012 calling for a $150 ton carbon tax on the oil sands[13]; “Wildlands League” part of CPAWS (106865272 RR0001) in a 2001 intervention on softwood lumber to US; Joint NRDC, Alberta Wilderness (118781251 RR0001), and West Coast Environmental Law Association (advocacy arm of the West Coast Environmental Law Research Foundation # 119292415 RR0001) (and others) submission in 2003 to the US Dept of Commerce on softwood lumber.)It should be noted that many of these large US ENGO groups – like NRDC and WRI – have received funding from Al Gore’s climate alliance and are listed as ‘collaborators’ for his clients in Generation Management.These forces have significantly interfered in domestic Canadian natural resource development and resource utilization (primarily energy) policies.While the “Forces of No” have every right to undertake activism in a democracy, but they have no right to expect their activities is be afforded the implied respect and financial privilege, on the taxpayer’s dime, or the – social license – afforded to charitable, non-profits that are actually  engaged in ‘good works’ for the common Canadian – millions of people who are in need of bread, work, dignity, or health support.To give them such privilege without restriction, besmirches real charity done to advance a public good for Canadians. Continuing to make this mistake in policy and law threatens the integrity of the charitable and volunteer sector as well as the economic and political stability of the country.Not Grassroots – Recipients of More Tax FundsMembers of the public might be very surprised to learn that some charities have millions of dollars in assets.  The David Suzuki Foundation has some $19 million in assets (Source: CRA) and operates an endowment fund that earns them some $600,000 a year.World Wide Fund (World Wild Fund – WWF)[14] reports $20,946,149 in revenues with Government funding $305,804 (1%).In the year of the Paris COP-21 conference, WWF received $293,309.00 from Environment Canada.It is concerning that investigative journalist, Donna Laframboise, has reported in her book about the Intergovernmental on Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body that reviews scientific evidence to allegedly provide impartial reports for governments on climate change, has been infiltrated at the highest levels of authorship by Greenpeace and WWF ‘legends’ – activists who are not scientists.[15]As reported in the foreign billionaires’ ClimateWorks project, pushing global cap and trade, they have reportedly seconded and directed people to act on their behalf at events like the Paris COP-21 events.Ms. Morgan of WRI[16] appeared at COP-21 as a representative of Greenpeace.Since at least one of the ClimateWorks partners (Oak Fund) is also a funder of Greenpeace, it is difficult to understand these relationships.  Greenpeace is not a registered charity in Canada, but has frequently collaborated with other charitable ENGOs, like in the push for the disastrous Ontario Green Energy Act. (Pembina Institute is the non-profit advocacy arm of the Pembina Foundation: Registration number: 875787913RR0001)Here are two examples of Oak Foundation grants to Greenpeace Canada, intended to ‘phase-out’ the oil sands and drive off investors. Source: Oak Fund on-line grant database. Climate Change is the Green CloakOn the particular issue of climate science, since 2003[17] and 2005[18], the science community has recognized that carbon dioxide is not the main driver of human influence on climate.  The IPCC itself cannot provide us with any peer-reviewed material showing that wind and solar are effective or adequate replacements for coal or other conventional power, despite the IPCC touting them as such in their Summary for Policy Makers.[19]  Yet all these ENGO charities claim there is a ‘clean energy revolution’ in progress and that we ‘must decarbonize.’ Author and Prof. Em. Vaclav Smil, energy expert, disagrees.[20]Clearly the ClimateWorks billionaires and their global cap and trade project has had a tremendously negative impact on Canada’s economy due to their funding of diverse ENGOs – most of which are federally registered charities which employ dozens of Ottawa lobbyists.  It is impossible for us to know whether these ENGOs knowingly acted as agents for an external purpose – but the result is that our environmental legislation has been turned upside down by foreign-funded ENGO charity activists, and dozens of ENGO lobbyists in Ottawa have acted against the interests of hard-working Canadians.Meanwhile, global demand for oil, gas and coal grows while Canadian products are virtually landlocked.[21] But Canada is now seen as a place that is ‘hostile’ to investment.[22]Climate change hysteria not founded on fact.The climate is much less sensitive to greenhouse gases than the IPCC claims, that extreme weather is not getting worse, that crop yields are dramatically increasing, that the planet is greening by both CO2 fertilization and by warming, that the rate of sea level rise is little different from 80 years ago, that the area of tropical islands are increasing, that beach area is increasing, that warming reduces heating costs by many times greater than it increases cooling costs, that warming net benefits health and reduces deaths.Our evidence is outlined in this brief that we previously prepared for the Prime Minister.http://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lt-to-PM-justin-Trudeau-july-18-2018-FINAL.pdf In ClosingCanadians jobs and the economy are being damaged by the current scope of operations and cooperative campaigns of the many federally registered environmental charities in Canada. We believe it would pose a danger to free society to provide them with any further freedom to engage in political activity, particularly as they are subsidized by all taxpayers through their charitable status, but their views do not represent those of all taxpayers.~~~~[1] oakfnd.org/grant-database-env.html set “Select a programme of interest” to Environment and “Quick Search” to “canada west coast”[2] https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/t3010form22quickview-eng.action?&fpe=2017-04-30&b=119292415RR0001[3] https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/we-are-very-disappointed-loss-of-northern-gateway-devastating-for-many-first-nations-chiefs-say[4] http://fairquestions.typepad.com/rethink_campaigns/[5] https://www.climateworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/design_to_win_final_8_31_07.pdf[6] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.524[7] https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/10/16/how-tides-canada-controls-the-secret-north-american-tar-sands-coalition/[8] https://www.powerfinancialcsr.com/static/pfc/pdf/Power_Financial_CDP_2017.pdf (pg 17)[9] https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/08/31/the-law-versus-logic-a-review-of-the-federal-court-of-appeal-decision-on-the-trans-mountain-expansion-project/[10] http://www.lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/3251710-ziegel.pdf[11] https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/09/27/news/federal-government-assembles-panel-explore-charities-and-political-activities[12] http://internationalfunders.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IFIPConferenceReport2010.pdf    IFIP is a US registered charity; a number of Canadian ENGOs appear to have participated in this event.[13] https://fcpp.org/2012/05/18/a-decade-of-evidence-against-catastrophic-global-warming/[14] https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/t3010form22quickview-eng.action?&fpe=2017-06-30&b=119304954RR0001  119304954 RR0001 [15] https://www.amazon.ca/Delinquent-Teenager-Mistaken-Worlds-Climate-ebook/dp/B005UEVB8Q[16] https://www.wri.org/profile/jennifer-morgan[17] https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642623738[18] https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11175/radiative-forcing-of-climate-change-expanding-the-concept-and-addressing[19] http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/11/05/a-matter-of-public-interest-on-the-ipcc-does-it-recommend-or-not-recommend-that-is-the-question/[20] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guXaWwQpe4[21] http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/09/the-international-energy-agency-global-energy-and-co2-status-report-2017/[22] http://www.pphb.com/pdfs/musings/Musings041718.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Canadian charities', 'climate change']",2018/10/12

Here’s my response from this week’s town hall in Saskatoon about why we’re moving forward with putting a price on pollution: pic.twitter.com/A7xmhftaQv— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) September 16, 2018That’s simply not true.  Since the 1970’s, ever increasing regulatory measures and emissions guidelines have been put in place for all forms of industry and transportation.  A national air quality monitoring system (NAPS) was set up and it has steadily monitored and ensured that polluting emissions are reduced – dramatically.  As well, the provinces and most large industrial emitters also have on-site monitoring for important reasons:1) they want to ensure they are below or at allowable emissions levels;2) industry has their own equipment for internal review and for compliance in the event they are charged with exceeding their allowable emissions;3) technical equipment failure or poor calibration is possible;4) in the case of extremely noxious substances, the public may be at risk of exceedance and this must be avoided at all costs;5) the corporate consequences for exceeding allowable emission levels are stiff fines or plant shut-downs or other consequences.Polluters have paid to implement emissions reduction technology, they have paid to install monitoring systems, they continue to pay various levels of taxes and penalties related to the types of noxious emissions, they have paid to create layers of legal, regulatory staff and compliance reporting systems – and if these measures fail, they pay very stiff penalties for polluting.  The company operations can be shut down – which costs them thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars a day. In addition, many corporate employees live or work in the region and care about their environment and communities – they want clean air for themselves and their children.You taxpayers have paid to pollute as well.  There are fuel taxes on gas and diesel.   Car manufacturers have paid to upgrade vehicle engine and exhaust design to reduce emissions – and that is passed on to you in vehicle price, but you benefit – with cleaner air.  The greatest “Ground level contaminants” (at the level of human breathing) come from vehicle exhaust.  As the late Jim Prentice pointed out during his public debate for the 2015 Alberta election, he was the Environment Minister who introduced the more stringent fuel efficiency standards in Canada, cleaning up the air you breath.In Prime Minister Trudeau’s Sept. 16, 2018,  Saskatoon homily on ‘treating the atmosphere like a sewer” he refers to a theoretical example of one company operating without expensive pollution controls having a commercial advantage over a competitor with such emissions controls.Ironically, he is making the case against his demand for even more carbon taxes.The greatest emitters in the world are China, India and the United States.  Only the US has any comparable ‘clean air’ emissions legislation to Canada, the biggest emitters have none! The US does have stringent emissions controls . However,  Canada’s more stringent environmental regulations and carbon tax make us much less competitive. (not to mention our competitive disadvantages of a very cold climate and vast shipping distances- both of which naturally require more energy for even basic operations.)Clean Air Regulatory AgendaUS-Canada Air Quality AgreementSo, what is the Prime Minister really saying? He’s conflating carbon dioxide (CO2), a benign gas, with noxious pollutants.  Does he want us to follow the folly of France? In trying to reduce carbon dioxide, they offered incentives to diesel – resulting in terrible urban air pollution – worse than Beijing. The irony? Otherwise, France is all on nuclear power for electrical generation – deemed to be ‘clean.’Canadians do care about the planet and air quality, we have gone the extra mile to reduce noxious emissions – and the result has been that we are a less competitive nation on the world market for manufacturing and resource extraction.The Prime Minister is sorely ignorant of all that Canadian scientific, engineering experts and industry partners have done to make sure we have some of the cleanest air in the world – along with the best manufacturing, human rights and safety practices on the job.The Prime Minister wrongly denigrated industry leaders as being uncaring buffoons in claiming that “…right now we are polluting the atmosphere, and it’s free. There’s no cost associated with, you know, polluting.”Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, reported that there are already some 37 different GHG reduction measures in place – taxes, regulations, subsidies – at the federal level, costing uncalculated billions of dollars and with no audit or evaluation as to how well they are achieving stated objectives.At the provincial level, there are dozens of fuel tax-related measures across Canada.Sadly, the Prime Minister and Minister McKenna are completely misinformed on this file, and misinforming Canadians. Here is Minister McKenna …mystified.  Perhaps someone will send her this op-ed to inform her.blob:https://www.theglobeandmail.com/d69f7899-4dd7-48f0-a056-fd6e8f2dc218 Related:Dr. Judith Curry explains why carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can fine tune climate:Click to access curry-senatetestimony-2014-final.pdfAlberta’s First Climate Leadership Plan was Established in 2002Foreign billionaires’ plan to push global cap and trade by funding local ENGOs:ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeakshttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/57594/16165  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon dioxide', 'carbon tax', 'climate change', 'polluter pay']",2018/10/06
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/10/06/macron-vs-trump-compare-the-results/,,Macron vs Trump: Compare the Results!," Contributed by Drieu Godefridi © 2018  (La version française suit)Drieu Godefridi is a Belgian philosopher, jurist, and author of  La révolution Trump (French) and  The IPCC: A Scientific Body (English)   French:  Le GIEC est mort – Vive la Science! When Trump and Macron came to power, a few months apart, faced with the delirious enthusiasm of a certain European “right” for Macron, I did not dare to cool their ardor. I limited myself to state that with two programs as divergent as those of MM. Trump and Macron, it would be interesting to compare the results. Eighteen months later, it is clear that the column “results” of the two men could not be more contrasted. The growth is dizzying in the US, it is zero in France. Wages increase in the USA, they stagnate in France. Normative hell is reduced to the USA; it continues its delusional expansion in France and in the EU. The US renegotiated to their advantage “free” trade agreements that were unbalanced: nothing like this in France / the EU. The US effectively governs international relations, domesticate terrorist regimes such as North Korea or Iran; while France is manoeuvring behind the scenes to continue trading with the mullahs’ terrorist regime. The cost of energy falls in the US, by the virtue of a rational policy, while Macron engages his country in an ecologist flight forward that is promised to explode the energy bill of households and businesses. Unemployment no longer exists in the USA; it remains an inaccessible Everest in France. Let’s stop this cruel litany. In summary, regardless of the objective indicator favored, Macron produced NO tangible results on any plan, while the US government multiplies them. More worrying is the disarray that must be described as “symbolic” of the French regime, with a Macron who does not hesitate to appear with thugs half naked in postures to say the least surprising for a president of the French Republic. Better: he surrounds himself with dubious people with delinquent behavior in the area of ​​his own security, as the Benalla case attests.  All this does not bode well. The failure of “macronism”, which is only another variation of French socialism, is achieved.May this regime not end in anarchy. MACRON/TRUMP : COMPARONS LES RESULTATS !Quand Trump et Macron sont arrivés au pouvoir, à quelques mois d’intervalle, face à l’enthousiasme délirant d’une certaine “droite” pour Macron, je ne m’étais pas risqué à refroidir leurs ardeurs. Je m’étais limité à constater qu’avec deux programmes aussi divergents que ceux de MM. Trump et Macron, il serait intéressant de comparer les résultats.Dix-huit mois plus tard, force est de constater que la colonne “résultats” des deux hommes ne saurait être plus contrastée. La croissance est vertigineuse aux USA, elle est nulle en France. Les salaires augmentent aux USA, ils stagnent en France. L’enfer normatif se réduit aux USA; il poursuit son expansion délirante en France et dans l’UE. Les USA ont renégocié à leur avantage des accords de libre-échange qui étaient déséquilibrés : rien de tel en France/UE. Les USA gouvernent effectivement les relations internationales, rivant leur clou à des régimes terroristes tels que la Corée du Nord ou l’Iran; tandis que la France manœuvre dans la coulisse européenne pour continuer de commercer avec le régime terroriste des mollahs. Le coût de l’énergie baisse aux USA, par la vertu d’une politique rationnelle, tandis que Macron engage son pays dans une fuite écologiste en avant promise à faire exploser la facture énergétique des ménages et des entreprises. Le chômage n’existe plus aux USA; il reste un inaccessible Everest en France.Arrêtons cette litanie cruelle. En résumé, quel que soit l’indicateur objectif que l’on privilégie, Macron n’a produit AUCUN résultat tangible sur aucun plan, tandis que le gouvernement américain les multiplie.Plus inquiétante est la débandade qu’on doit qualifier de “symbolique” du régime français, avec un Macron qui n’hésite pas à s’afficher avec des petites frappes à moitié nues dans des postures pour le moins surprenantes pour un président de la République. Mieux : il s’entoure de gens douteux au comportement délinquant dans le domaine de sa propre sécurité, ainsi que l’affaire Benalla en atteste.Tout cela n’augure rien de bon. L’échec du “macronisme”, qui n’est qu’une énième variation du socialisme français, est acquis. Puisse ce régime ne pas finir dans l’anarchie.Drieu GodefridiShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'France', 'Trump']",2018/10/06

Specifically, these are 1) scientific principles, 2) natural and anthropogenic contributions, 3) backwarming by atmospheric carbon dioxide, 4) climate models, 5) benefits of a warming planet and increasing carbon dioxide, 6) other ecological and health problems, 7) family size, 8) uninterruptable and inexpensive electricity, 9) biofuels and 10) rising sea level. My ultimate conclusions are to generate more electricity with nuclear energy and emphasize adaptation where needed rather than expending resources in the hope of mitigating a global warming that could be dominated by natural effects.LINK to PDF of complete essay:  ClimateEssay1. SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES. The scientific method has delivered uncountable benefits worldwide through our understanding of how nature works leading to new technologies, often aided by the availability of abundant energy. The essential feature of the scientific method is to develop a mathematical theory or model to explain some phenomenon and then make predictions of other phenomena to establish the validity of the model. As successful predictions accumulate, confidence in the model increases, while failed predictions indicate that the model must be revised or rejected. According to Popper (1935, 1959), acceptable scientific theories can be falsified by observations, but never established beyond question. Instead, we just obtain a better understanding of the limits of validity of a particular theory. For example, future research very likely will change our theories and understanding of turbulence, but already flight and wind tunnel experiments have given us confidence in the safety of aeroplanes. In other cases, as noted by Kuhn (1962), a paradigm change occurs, as from Newtonian gravity to Einstein’s General Relativity, demonstrating that we never can say the science is settled. Since science is based on observations confirming predictions, we must recognize that any consensus among scientists about a particular issue proves nothing. Before the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887, there was a consensus among most physicists that all space required a substance called the aether to transmit light waves. Prior to 1984, when two Australian doctors demonstrated that the bacterium Heliobacter pylori caused gastric ulcers, there was a consensus that blamed anxiety. Similarly, recent research has challenged the consensus that linked heart disease and cholesterol consumption. Also central to the scientific method is the full publication of the methods and data used to reach a particular conclusion. Otherwise there can be no independent check on a scientific claim. Even the most careful and scrupulous of scientists can make mistakes or have unrecognized biases. The publication of the Climategate emails revealed a determined rejection of this fundamental principle.“…We have 25 or so years invested in the work. Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try to find something wrong with it…”—Dr. Phil Jones, Director of the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia University,email to Warwick Hughes, 2004,and“I’m getting hassled by a couple of people to release the CRU station temperature data. Don’t any of you three tell anybody that the UK has a Freedom of Information Act.”—Dr. Phil Jones, Director of the Climatic Research Unit,disclosed Climategate e-mail, Feb. 21, 2005. Lack of information about the tuning (calibration) of climate models is another important example. As described by Voosen (2016) “For years, climate scientists had been mum in public about their ‘secret sauce’: What happened in the models stayed in the models. The taboo reflected fears that climate contrarians would use the practice of tuning to seed doubt about models—and, by extension, the reality of human-driven warming. … Indeed, whether climate scientists like to admit it or not, nearly every model has been calibrated precisely to the 20th century climate records—otherwise it would have ended up in the trash.” If we do not know the assumptions that went into the calibration of a climate model, how can we validate it and trust its predictions? Another aspect of the scientific method is the careful and consistent use of definitions. Thus, any discussion of climate should begin by stating the time scale needed to distinguish between climate and weather and defining the term climate change. A rise in global temperatures beginning about 1975 led to concerns about the effects of human-generated carbon dioxide (CO2), the formation of the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases in 1985 and the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. However, after temperatures stopped rising in the early 21st century, it was clear an interval longer than 10 years was needed to average out the random effects of weather, so now the World Meteorological Society recommends 30 years. Furthermore, we must be careful using the term climate change. Is it the sum of all natural and anthropogenic effects or just the human contributions? Our climate always has been changing naturally so it is essential to state which is being discussed. Also, the term greenhouse gas for CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and certain chlorofluorohydrocarbons is very misleading. Greenhouses become hot by preventing the interior air heated by the sunlight absorbed by the plants from mixing with outside air, not by absorption by the glass enclosure. The only connection between CO2 and greenhouses is the addition of CO2 to about 1000 parts per million to enhance the growth of the plants inside. A more appropriate name for the infrared radiative backwarming by our atmosphere would be the Arrhenius Effect in recognition of Svante Arrhenius (1896, 1906) for his calculations of the global heating due to CO2. Similarly designating CO2 as a pollutant, when that gas is essential for life on Earth, is an unscientific label. As well we should avoid the misleading term “ocean acidification”, which leaves the impression it is used to raise alarm. The present pH range of 8.4 to 7.8 in the oceans is decreasing at a rate between 0.13 to 0.24 per century (IPCC2013 p 3.8.2) so adding CO2 is shifting the oceans towards the neutral pH of 7.0 making them less reactive. In a few centuries this might be a problem for some organisms, but not because of a reaction with acidic water. Finally, scientists should welcome challenges to their results and recognize that often useful criticism can come from someone working in a different discipline. Convincing responses to challenges, as well as independent reproduction of initial results, help build confidence in theories and models. Science progresses by the persistent questioning of every measurement, every theory and every model. 2. NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. In spite of temperature being an intensive thermodynamic variable, so any average has no physical meaning for any system outside of thermodynamic equilibrium, climatologists find it useful to calculate the temperature anomaly for a site, the difference with respect to some long-term average for the same time of day and then average over the whole earth, with extrapolations for regions with no measurements. There is no scientific basis for believing that a time series of this single statistic, which happens to be in temperature units, can represent the evolution of the whole earth, which certainly is not in equilibrium. See for example the discussions by Essex and McKitrick (2007) and Essex, McKitrick and Andresen (2007). Nevertheless, the IPCC uses curves such as Fig. 1 to illustrate a gradually rising global temperature and the consequences of increasing atmospheric CO2, which is plotted in Fig. 2. Prior to the Mauna Loa data, which began in 1958, we have measurements from ice cores from the Antarctic Law Dome (Etheridge et al. 2001) indicating a rise from 291 ppm in 1880 to 334 ppm in 1978, overlapping well with the direct measurements. The relevant CO2 infrared absorption bands are strongly saturated so they contribute in proportion to the logarithm of the concentration. The rise in the temperature anomaly from 1975 to 2001 did occur while the CO2 concentration increased from 331 to 371 parts per million by volume (ppm) (ln 371/331 = 0.114), but the comparable rise from 1910 to 1945 happened during a much smaller change of 300 to 310 ppm (ln 310/300 = 0.0033) in atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, CO2 does not account for the slightly decreasing temperatures from 1945 to 1975 nor the level interval from 2001 to the beginning of the strong natural El Nino event of 2016. Fig. 1. The global annual average near-surface temperature anomalies since 1850 from the United Kingdom Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/~timo/diag/tempts_12monrunning_global.png ). The 1998 and 2016 spikes are due to the natural El Nino warming of the Pacific Ocean.Fig. 2. History of atmospheric concentration of CO2 above Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The annual oscillations result from the increasing growth of vegetation during spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere. (www.http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/graphics_gallery/mauna_loa_record/mauna_loa_record ),(ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/antarctica/law/law_co2.txt ).If any conclusion can be taken from Fig. 1 and 2, it must be that effects other than CO2 make an important contribution to terrestrial temperatures. Thus, for example, Chen and Tung (2018) proposed that changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can affect global temperatures.“Our results, based on several independent indices, show that AMOC changes since the 1940s are best explained by multidecadal variability, rather than an anthropogenically forced trend.” However, IPCC2013 (SPM-12) states that, “It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in the global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.” Unfortunately, this statement is an opinion based on unvalidated climate models. Furthermore, even if that statement were verifiable, it is too broad to be of any use in deciding what must be done. A 90% effect would signal the need for drastic changes in life style for all developed countries and constrained development in the others, while at 55%, adaptation rather than mitigation should be sufficient. If we want to make rational choices between investments in adaptation and mitigation, the priorities for future investigations should be a better understanding of the natural contributions to climate change, as well as the effects of human changes in land use and the feed-back mechanisms mentioned below. 3. BACKWARMING BY ATMOSPHERIC CO2, THE ARRHENIUS EFFECT. At atmospheric pressures, the well studied spectrum of CO2 has some infrared bands that absorb sunlight reradiated from the earth’s surface. The much-less-abundant CH4, N2O and some CFC’s also contribute some absorption bands, but the dominant absorber is water vapour. Note how quickly a desert site cools at night compared with a humid location. The heating of our atmosphere and then the earth’s surface by these absorbers is not in question. The issue is how much that heating can be affected by positive feedback processes such as the extra absorption caused by the increase in water-vapour present in warmer air and the negative feedback due to the reflectivity of additional clouds. Aerosols that reflect, absorb and scatter radiation and influence cloud formation also could produce a negative feedback while carbon soot would have a positive effect. Thus, the Charney Report (1979) estimated an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees C for a doubling of the CO2 concentration once equilibrium occurs. After 34 years of abundant research money and dozens of computer models, the latest report, IPCC2013, proposed the same unhelpful range of 3 degrees and added the comment “No best estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity can now be given because of a lack of agreement on values across assessed lines of evidence”, which means that we do not even know the probability distribution. A temperature increase near 1.5 degrees for a doubling of CO2 should be manageable with adaptation technologies while 4.5 degrees would imply that major efforts in mitigation are needed. The broad IPCC estimate is an output of climate models – the same models mentioned above that lack validation because we do not know the calibration details. Since climate models must include the whole earth, the fastest computers still require averaging over grids of about 102 x 102 km2 on the earth’s surface and 1 km in altitude. Consequently, much of the basic physics that occurs on smaller scales is represented by a multitude of parameters that must be tuned (calibrated) by fitting the model to observed phenomena. If the steep temperature rise from 1975 to 2001 in Fig 1 affected the tuning, there could be a warm bias, so empirical methods are preferable. Thus, Lewis and Curry (2018) determined an ECS of 1.50 K (5%–95% range: 1.05–2.45 K) by comparing global temperatures during the interval 2007 to 2016 with the interval 1869 to 1882 and the corresponding concentrations of CO2. 4. CLIMATE MODELS Numerical models that provide useful weather predictions for some 10 days ahead are an outstanding achievement representing the three phases of water in the earth’s atmosphere interacting with local geography, all warmed by the sun during the day and radiating to space at night. These weather models are validated by comparing predictions with actual happenings and benefit from continuing revisions when the predictions fail. Climate models are an extension of these weather models, but the long-term nature of climate makes such comparisons with reality much more difficult. Where they have occurred, the results from the models have not been very supportive, as in Fig. 3, copied from the 2013 IPCC Report. This pattern of the climate models predicting higher temperatures than observed has continued with later temperature data if one discounts the natural 2016 El Nino warming of the Pacific Ocean.Fig. 3. Model predictions and temperature observations from IPCC2013 (Fig. 11.9). Beginning in 2006, RCP 4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) labels a set of models for a modest rise in anthropogenic backwarming gases corresponding to an increase of 4.5 Wm-2 or 1.3% of the total solar flux integrated over all wavelengths. In addition to this comparison with the observations, the authors of the chapter on climate models in the IPCC2013 report give many reasons to question the reliability of climate models. Thus IPCC2013 (p 9-10) states,“Model tuning aims to match observed climate system behaviour and so is connected to judgments as to what constitutes a skillful representation of the Earth’s climate. For instance, maintaining the global-mean top-of the-atmosphere energy balance in a simulation of pre-industrial climate is essential to prevent the climate system from drifting to an unrealistic state. The models used in this report almost universally contain adjustments to parameters in their treatment of clouds to fulfill this important constraint of the climate system.”Further, on calibrating the parameters, IPCC2013 (p 7-14) states“The simulation of clouds in modern climate models involves several parameterizations that must work in unison. These include parameterization of turbulence, cumulus convection, microphysical processes, radiative transfer, and the resulting cloud amount (including the vertical overlap between different grid levels), as well as subgrid-scale transport of aerosol and chemical species. The system of parameterizations must balance simplicity, realism, computational stability and efficiency. Many cloud processes are unrealistic in current GCMs, and as such their cloud response to climate change remains uncertain.”  Furthermore, referring to multimodel ensembles (MME), IPCC2013 (p 9-17) states,“the sample size of MME’s is small, and is confounded because some climate models have been developed by sharing model components leading to shared biases. Thus, MME members cannot be treated as purely independent.” The following page (IPCC2013 p 9-18) continues with“As a result, collections such as the CMIP5 MME cannot be considered a random sample of independent models. This complexity creates challenges for how best to make quantitative inferences of future climate.”.  The absence of adequate documentation, identified by Voosen (2016) in Section 1 above, already was noted in IPCC2013 (p 9-10),“With very few exceptions modeling centres do not routinely describe in detail how they tune their models. Therefore, the complete list of observational constraints toward which a particular model is tuned is generally not available.” and“It has been shown for at least one model that the tuning process does not necessarily lead to a single, unique set of parameters for a given model, but that different combinations of parameters can yield equally plausible models.” Chapter 9 of IPCC2013 also references in multiple places an important paper by Knutti et al. (2010), who discuss the combination of projections from multiple climate models and state in their abstract,“Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behaviour is often not sampled.” Climate models can be very useful to help understand various physical processes and identify which are the most important, but it is premature to use them for reliable estimates of the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic contributions to climate change or to predict quantitatively the consequences of additional CO2 in our atmosphere. It is regrettable that these serious issues about the reliability of climate models are not repeated in the IPCC Summary for Policy Makers. 5. BENEFITS OF A WARMING PLANET AND INCREASING CO2. All the concerns about climate change are based on the often-unstated premise that the mean global temperature and its distribution were optimum just prior to the industrial revolution and we must do everything possible to limit any increase of more than 2 degrees C and preferably no more than 1.5 degrees. Climatologists tell us that our production of CO2 already has used up about a degree of that warming. Yet, we have coped well with that increase and have welcomed the benefits of industrialization. Why should any increase of more than another degree be so serious? We do know that more people die each year due to excess cold than to excess heat (Gasparrini et al. 2015). Also, as expected for a warming climate and increasing CO2 concentration, the world is becoming greener. From satellite observations of the leaf-area index for the years 1982-2009, Zhu et al (2016) found greening over 25 to 50% of the global vegetated area compared with decreases on less than 4%. Their ecosystem models indicate that CO2 fertilization can account for 70% of the greening. Even though there is much uncertainty about the quantitative effect of CO2 and similar atmospheric gases on global temperatures, we need a rational discussion comparing the benefits and dangers of more CO2 and rising temperatures and what are acceptable limits. A key part of that that discussion should be the extent that developed countries must lower their living standards and how much developing countries must forgo improvements to achieve these limits. 6. OTHER ECOLOGICAL AND HEALTH PROBLEMS. Anyone who claims that climate change is the most serious threat to the Earth is stating an opinion with no scientific basis and is diverting attention from other important ecological and health problems. Surely, providing adequate fresh water and food for everyone deserves more attention than the uncertain human contributions to climate change. Where does basic medical care for the developing world come in our list of priorities? The prevalence of AIDS remains a significant challenge in Sub-Sahara Africa. Furthermore, according to the Economist (2018 June 2-8, p. 54) malaria kills 400 000 people a year. Should eradicating malaria be less important for the affected countries than reducing the generation of CO2? What about excess fishing of the oceans or all the pollution from non-degradable plastic waste? In areas prone to earthquake, should strengthening buildings have priority over climate-related projects? We do not have the resources to deal with all these challenges. Choices are required. Most developed countries allocate significant funds in foreign aid to help address many of the above problems. However, now there is the risk that governments will divert some of this money to fulfill commitments to the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement. Whatever our view of the dangers of CO2, we must give serious attention to the other challenges to health and ecology. 7. FAMILY SIZE. More people inevitably result in more generation of CO2 and more use of all of our Earth’s resources, whether fresh water or scarce minerals. The absence of a person is a much more effective way to reduce CO2 than any life-style change when that person joins the adult population. One does not want to consider forced population control as was the case in China from 1979 to 2016, but rather to note the effects of increasing opportunities for women outside the home in developed countries. Birthrates have fallen, often seriously, below the stable number of 2.1 babies for each woman, while countries such as Nigeria have 5.4 births per woman according to the Economist (2018 Jul 21, p. 35). Thus, in developing countries where the birthrate exceeds about 2 per woman, the priorities should be to educate women and generally enhance prosperity so that women see alternatives to large families. The use of the cheapest fossil fuels, even coal, to increase the availability of electricity that would ease many tedious tasks, could in the long term more than offset the CO2 generated. Fewer grandchildren will ease the task of saving the planet.  8. UNINTERRUPTABLE AND INEXPENSIVE ELECTRICITY. Life in developed countries has become totally dependant on uninterruptible electricity. Loss for an instant can reset critical controllers, loss for hour can leave people stranded in trains and elevators and loss for a day can spoil food in refrigerators and confound industrial processes. These risks become much more likely when wind and solar sources become too large a fraction (more than about 20 to 30%) of the electricity supply. In the case of Sweden, a Reuters report of 2018 Jul 2 stated, “Sweden will have to import more electricity during winter as the country, a net power exporter to the rest of Europe, shifts from nuclear to wind, its grid operator said. Last winter, the first since the closure of its Oskarshamn 1 reactor, stretched Sweden’s resources as peak consumption rose by 800 megawatt (MW), triggering start-up procedures in its reserve energy plants. Sweden’s power balance will deteriorate further from next winter when the country will need imports and the situation will become worse with two more of its reactors closing by 2020, state-grid Svenska Kraftnat (SVK) said in a report on Monday.” There is much talk about renewable sources displacing fossil fuels for all electricity generation, if not for all energy needs, but proper engineering analyses tell us this is not possible with existing technology if we require an uninterruptable supply for extended intervals. As an example, Andrews (2017) compared actual daily average wind and solar generation in the Texas grid for the three years 2010 – 2112 with the actual demand. Then he calculated what storage would be needed if the renewables were increased to match the average demand and the surpluses, mainly in the spring and fall, were used to compensate for the shortfalls that occurred during the winter and late summer. He concluded that to match the demand on all occasions with batteries would require storage of 5×1013 Watt hours corresponding to 4×107 times the 1.3×106 Watt-hour battery system that Neoen-Tesla has installed in South Australia. For California, the storage problem became real on 2018 Sep. 10 when the governor signed legislation committing the state to generate 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by the year 2025, 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2045 while planning to close its last nuclear generator, Diablo Canyon, by 2025. Further ignoring engineering realities, the governor also signed an executive order requiring the total CO2 emissions to be negative after 2045 (http://euanmearns.com/california-goes-carbon-negative/#more-22547 ). An alternative scheme for storage is to pump water to a high elevation when excess energy is available. Then when renewables are not producing, the head of water can generate electricity. However, it is difficult to find sites with sufficient volumes and altitude differences. For example, the large Coire Glas water storage system being constructed in Scotland with a capacity of 30 GWh (Mearns 2013) represents only 2 seconds of the United Kingdom peak electricity consumption of 5×1010 GW. The modest capacity provided by the South Australia battery or pumped water in Scotland could cover brief intervals of no sun or wind, but not extended calms when the sun is unavailable. Some electricity grids hope to cope with gaps in renewable generation by increasing the price of electricity when the supply is limited to encourage non-essential users to wait, but in one study Andrews (2018) concluded that electricity demand is relatively insensitive to price and that higher electricity rates will not achieve significant demand reductions unless raised to levels where many people are no longer able to pay their electricity bills. Another approach is to continue to burn fossil fuels for electricity, but then capture and store the CO2. Suitable processes are feasible on a small scale, but none are yet practical on the necessary industrial scale (Andrews 2016). Thus, a common solution is stand-by generators powered by natural gas, but in this on-off mode they are much less efficient, so some of the saving in CO2 is lost and the users have the capital and operating costs of duplicate fossil-fuel generating systems and their connections to the grid. Thus, we can understand why, in most locations, electricity prices continue to rise while the costs of solar cells and windmills are falling (Shellenberger 2018). If we want uninterruptable electricity without burning fossil fuels, we must recognize the only practical large-scale alternatives are hydro and nuclear generation. Since most of the world’s suitable hydro sites already are developed unless we wish to destroy more river valleys of natural beauty, hydro power will not contribute much more to the world’s energy resources, and always is at risk from droughts. Nuclear fission is the remaining option. It is not cheap, but it provides the essential continuous base for a reliable energy system without producing CO2. Climatologist James Hansen (2017), consistent with his concern about the effects of CO2, explained his support for nuclear electricity,“The people who argue for all renewables think that – well if we can go from 0% to 10% to 20% renewable then we’re on the way and then it will get easier and we’ll get 100%. Well it’s actually, if you look at the engineering, it’s actually the opposite. When you get to 20 or 30%, then it gets harder! Not easier! …because of the intermittency of the renewables. We have to phase out carbon emissions at a rate of several percent a year. I don’t see any way we can do that without the help of nuclear power. Nuclear power is essentially carbon-free energy”  Electric vehicles can have many practical uses. However, if their primary purpose is to reduce the generation of CO2 from fossil fuels, this will happen only where the major source of the electricity is hydro or nuclear. The limited storage capacity of electric vehicles often will require charging when the wind is not blowing and the sun not shining. Also, one must ask how many charging cycles are possible before the process becomes inefficient and the battery must be replaced and how much fossil fuels and scarce materials have been used in the manufacture of the battery.  9. BIOFUELS The requirement in many jurisdictions that automobile fuel contain a certain percentage of alcohol derived from crops is often justified as a way to reduce CO2 generated by road transport because regrowth absorbs the CO2, but the enthusiastic proposers never thought through all the consequences. Past advocates such as Al Gore now admit it was a faulty scheme (Kolawole 2010), but the profits to corn farmers have generated such a strong support in American states like Iowa that few politicians have the courage to challenge the policy. Not only does the generation of the alcohol from corn produce more CO2 than it saves, it also diverts the crops from feeding people. (Lomberg 2013). Similarly, the production of palm oil for biofuels is transforming more and more natural tropical rain forest to cultivated rows of palm trees, thus constraining the habitat of many species, particularly the orangutan (http://savetheorangutan.org/about-orangutans/habitat ) Furthermore, the use of tropical peatlands for palm trees releases large quantities of stored CO2 (Watts 2011). Wood chips from temperate forests are another popular biofuel. As reported by Montague (2018), chips from trees harvested from the south-east United States are shipped to northern England for burning in the Drax thermo-electric plant because the rules of the European Union classify wood chips as a renewable resource earning a tax advantage, even though the benefits in reduced atmospheric CO2 take the many-decade life of a tree to arrive.10. SEA LEVEL Many island communities and many coastal cities worry about the effects of rising ocean levels, so like global temperature it is important to separate anthropogenic effects from the natural contributions before assigning any blame. Tide gauges (http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/map.html ), which reference changes in sea level to adjacent land, provide the only long-term measurements, but they can be compromised by instrument updates, location changes, variations in ocean currents and land rise or subsidence. Also, there were very few tide gauges outside of Europe prior to 1900. Fig. 4 is Bitterman’s (2015) plot of seven analyses of the tide-gauge data and Fig. 5 his plots of the rate of change since 1870 showing large fluctuations. The 1940-1950 peak rate occurred before the recent acceleration in the concentration of atmospheric CO2, so the cause of the latest rate increase remains uncertain. In her review of the literature, Curry (2018a) concluded,“There is substantial multi-decadal internal variability in the sea level change record, including an apparent ~60-year oscillation. This variability confounds analyses of sea level rise acceleration and attribution to human caused climate change. In view of the multiple modes and periods of internal variability in the ocean, it is likely that we have not detected the full scale of internal variability effects on regional and global sea level change.” Fig. 4. The sea-level anomaly from various methods and the satellite data since 1992 as plotted by Bitterman (2015). Fig. 5. Rates of sea-level rise calculated by Bitterman (2015) from Fig. 4 by smoothing with a filter of half-width of 15 years and then differentiating  Beginning in 1993 satellite observations also have provided sea-level information, but the complex corrections add much uncertainty. Curry (2018b) discussed these and concluded: “In my opinion, the value of the altimeter data is in understanding regional and interannual variability, and that the first 6 years of altimeter data should be pretty much ignored in climate change arguments. In any event, the altimeter data set is not useful by itself (owing to its short length) for detecting long-term accelerations that could be attributed to human-caused climate change.”Increasing global temperatures are expected to raise sea levels through the thermal expansion of ocean waters and the melting of polar ice, but it is premature to conclude that human activity has had any effect yet on rising sea levels.Nevertheless, many locations are at risk from the natural effects, particularly storm surges. Protecting existing human habitation and valuable real estate with sea walls and strongly discouraging further development in such areas should have high priorities in any climate-action policies and funding. Even if the IPCC predictions of a human-caused rise of 0.3 to 0.6 m by 2100 were valid, this is insignificant compared with storm surges of multiple meters.Mid-ocean atolls are in a special situation. As Darwin (1838) recognized, atolls are not submerged by rising sea level, they are dynamic structures that rise with it. See, for example, the Tuvalu study by Kench et al. (2015) “There is no evidence of heightened erosion over the past half-century as sea-level rise accelerated. Reef islands in Funafuti continually adjust their size, shape, and position in response to variations in boundary conditions, including storms, sediment supply, as well as sea level.” Eschenbach (2010) has summarized the situation with atolls and recommended that their residents– recognize there are limits on the population and tourism an atoll can support,– conserve fresh water to maintain the central reservoir that floats above the denser salt water,– prohibit the catching of parrot fish and all other beaked fish that help build the reefs,– minimize the use of coral sand to construct buildings, roads and airports and collect it from dead zones,– reduce the loss of coral sand by constraining the flow patterns of wind and water.To this I can add my own comment – stop claiming reparations from developed countries for a naturally rising sea level. 11. CONCLUSIONS. If our goal is to save the planet for our grandchildren, we must be not burden them with the repayment of debt incurred installing renewable energy sources when we are unwilling to spend the money now. For example, when the citizens of Canada’s Province of Ontario objected to the high electricity costs due to favourable contracts for renewable sources, the recently defeated government borrowed money to reduce the present rates. If we want dependable electricity without producing CO2, we should invest in more nuclear generation. Furthermore, until we have more certainty in the relative importance of natural and human contributions to rising global temperatures, we should prioritize adaptation over mitigation. Otherwise we could waste much effort and resources trying to limit a temperature rise over which we have limited control while neglecting places where early adaptation could be useful.  12. FINAL COMMENT. Every scientist, regardless of his or her own conclusions about the relative importance of natural and human contributions to present climate change, has the duty to challenge all unscientific statements and practices about the subject. Otherwise, as discrepancies continue to accumulate, the whole scientific enterprise, far beyond just climate change, is at risk of being rejected by the rest of the population.LINK to PDF of complete essay:  ClimateEssay  ~~~~[1] Report cover turbulent image: By C.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/29/the-alarming-scope-of-future-of-carbon-taxes-in-canada/,renewableguy ,The Alarming Scope of Future of Carbon Taxes in Canada," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.A few weeks ago, a group calling itself Canadians for Clean Prosperity released a report containing an analysis of the benefits they claimed would result if the federal government were to return all the revenues from carbon taxes to the individuals and households in the provinces from which the taxes were collected. Their analysis did not explain very clearly how revenues taken out of taxpayers’ collective right pockets could somehow become much larger when they were redeposited in taxpayers’ left pockets. It was only when one read the background papers that one discovered that the proposal entailed transferring the revenues collected from taxes on Canadian businesses, and especially taxes on businesses in energy-intensive industries, to individuals and households that the source of the largesse became evident. Destroying Canada’s energy economy and its most important industries is not the route to prosperity. The Canadian media, as is unfortunately typical, failed to delve into the details of the Clean Prosperity proposal, and generally thought that it was a political winner for the governing Liberals. This is not the first time that the Canadian media has failed to inform Canadians about the pitfalls of carbon taxes. Will Governments Refund the Tax Revenue to Citizens? Let us examine the claim that Governments will return all the revenues they receive from carbon taxes to the public, either through refunds directly to taxpayers or reduced rates of other generally applied taxes like personal income taxes or sales taxes. The British Columbia government claimed that it would do that when it introduced carbon taxes, but it only took two years for it to decide to use the revenues to subsidize new programs and pet projects. In fact, no government in Canada that has introduced carbon taxes (or cap-and-trade carbon permit pricing with the same effect on consumers) has ever returned all the revenues to taxpayers. In fact, the experience in all jurisdictions that have implemented carbon pricing regimes (carbon taxes or Emissions Trading Systems) is that full recycling of the resulting revenues is the exception rather than the rule. The Institute for Climate Economics (I4CE) is a think tank based in Paris that is funded by the French Caisse de Depots, the French Development Agency and Morocco’s Caisse de Depots et Gestion.  In October 2017, it published an article summarizing the results of its study of the use of carbon prices in the world. The article, entitled Global panorama of carbon prices in 2017, can be found here:https://www.i4ce.org/wp-core/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Global-Panorama-Carbon-prices-2017_FINAL_5p-2.pdf  The I4CE article contains some interesting information using data for fiscal year 2013-2014. More than 60% of the revenues received by governments from carbon pricing went to members of the European Union.On the global scale, only 29% of revenues were recycled into the economy in the form of tax exemptions.34% of the revenues were used to subsidize projects that would reduce GHG emissions.37%, the largest share, were allocated to the general budget. So, the record clearly shows that politicians and treasury officials, when provided with a windfall of revenues from a carbon tax, are very unlikely to return all of it to the citizens directly. Instead, as should be no surprise to those who study public administration (or human nature), they spend it on their preferred causes, groups and industries. What Can Canadian Taxpayers Expect in Future? The discussion of carbon taxes and their impact on taxpayers has so far also focused exclusively on the relatively low carbon taxes that have been introduced to date. These are generally in the range of $15 to $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide. It has ignored the effects of the much higher carbon taxes that will inevitably come if governments are to have any hope of attaining the extremely stringent carbon dioxide emission reduction targets that they have set. The federal government’s carbon tax schedule extends to the end of 2022, rising to $50 per tonne in that year. That is just the beginning. The government’s goal is to reduce Canada’s carbon dioxide emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 and by at least 50% from 2005 levels by 2050. That means a reduction from 704 megatonnes (Mt) in 2016 to 512 Mt in 2030 and 366 Mt by 2050. To get anywhere near those targets would require much, much higher carbon taxes. Environmental organizations are already calling for carbon taxes in the range of $200 to $300 per tonne, or higher. To help people understand this, I have prepared an analysis of what the increasing carbon tax rates would mean in terms of higher taxes on gasoline and higher revenues to governments from taxes on all carbon fuels. The following background information will help readers to understand what follows: The Canadian federal government establishes the general policy framework governing carbon dioxide taxation and pricing (i.e. permit pricing) in Canada; under the current framework, the federal governments sets the minimum rates that must apply each year, but it encourages the provincial governments to decide which system they will use and allows them to use the funds received, on the condition that they comply with the federal regime.Both carbon taxes and cap-and-trade permit systems are very complex. There are different rules governing which industries and firms are covered, which are exempt, and how rates will change.Under a “pure” carbon tax system, the tax on a specific fuel depends on its carbon content; coal has the highest carbon content and natural gas the lowest among the major fuels, with motor gasoline slightly less than diesel fuel.Canada’s carbon dioxide emissions in 2016 (the most recent year for which data is published by Environment and Climate Change Canada) were 704 megatonnes (Mt).Since 2005, Canada’s emissions have declined at the annual average rate of 2.5 Mt. The National Energy Board, it its 2016 Energy Outlook report, projected Canada’s emissions would continue declining at a gradual rate to 2040. The following table shows what would happen to carbon tax rates per tonne of CO2 and per litre of gasoline and the revenues that would accrue to the federal and provincial governments under a scenario in which carbon dioxide emissions continued to fall at their current rate (i.e. falling from 704 Mt in 2016 to 669 Mt in 2030). To make the projections more conservative, I have further assumed that governments will grant tax exemptions to 20% of Canadian industrial emission sources based on concerns about international competitive effects.Table 1   CARBON TAX RATES AND REVENUES TO CANADIAN GOVERNMENTS (2030)Tax rate($/tonne) Tax per Litre(cents)Revenues ($billion/year)202.2411.0304.4816.65012.027.68019.244.110022.455.220044.8111.030072.0165.6The revenues to governments would be considerably higher if no exemptions were given to industry. Compare the revenue projections from carbon taxes under this scenario with the most recent data on actual revenues received by the federal government from different taxes, as set out in Table 2. Table 2         CANADIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAX REVENUES BY SOURCE – 2016 ($Billions) Income TaxesCorporate TaxesSocial SecurityConsumptionOther14541825036Conclusion From this analysis, it is easy to see how the revenues from carbon taxes could easily become one of the largest sources of revenues to the government, making it even less likely that politicians would forego the opportunity to make use of this revenue windfall to spend on favoured causes and constituencies. Carbon taxes will almost certainly become a large and harmful burden on the Canadian economy.~~~~Read our rebuttal report to the “Carbon Dividend” proposal.  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change']",2018/09/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/26/carbon-kleptomania-rebutting-the-carbon-dividend-proposal/,renewableguy ,Carbon Kleptomania – Rebutting the “Carbon Dividend” Proposal," Friends of Science report “Carbon Kleptomania” rebuts the “carbon dividend’ proposition of Canadians for Clean ProsperityFriends of Science Society’s new report Carbon Kleptomania rebuts the notion that Canadians could make more money back from carbon taxes than what they pay in.Carbon taxes are an expense, not an investment. Canadians for Clean Prosperity issued a report by Mark Cameron, based on commissioned research by Dave Sawyer of EnviroEconomics, which modelled (computer simulated) potential benefits of carbon tax rebates. The report was entitled “Federal Carbon Price Impacts on Households in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario” released on or about Sept. 22, 2018. The report confuses the notion of a ‘dividend’ (which is a profit-share return on a successful business investment) with a carbon tax ‘rebate’ which is a subsidy to low income families who are burdened by the carbon taxes on their personal energy use (gasoline, natural gas, electricity), and the carbon taxes embedded in the products or services they pay for. Businesses must pay carbon taxes, which are treated like any other operating expense. That cost is passed on to the consumers. The report from ‘Clean Prosperity’ falsely says “There will be enough funds to give households back more than they paid in because carbon taxes are collected not only on households but also on business and industrial emissions.”  Households, as consumers, pay for the carbon taxes that are initially charged to businesses as those costs are embedded in the price of all products. Cameron’s report[2] reframes carbon taxes that come from the pockets of citizens as if a carbon dividend, such as that paid by profitable corporations back to shareholders. Citizens of Canada are not investing in something when they use vital energy resources to heat their homes, light the lights, drive to work, or have a job where energy is an integral factor for the work to exist. They are paying for a product and delivery of service. Energy – especially in Canada – a ‘winter’ country – is an essential means of survival. Years ago, our aboriginal and pioneer ancestors burned wood and dung – “buffalo chips” – to keep warm and cook food at the camp fire.  Imagine the government would have taxed them on these basics they needed to survive!  There is no difference today on coal, natural gas and oil – without them, modern society would collapse into anarchy within days.[3] Thus, the concept of a tax like this on essential services is fundamentally contrary to the motto of Canada – “Peace, Order and Good Government.” Friends of Science Society rejects this ‘dividend’ distortion.  Taxes on citizens are not comparable to shareholder dividends; dividends are beneficial returns on increasing profit.  By contrast, carbon taxes take the most from the poor, favor green crony capitalists, hurt the most vulnerable of our Canadian society and run small and medium sized businesses into the ground. This report is a compilation of relevant commentaries by Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/23/just-beyond-tomorrow-a-reflection-on-future-climate-policy/,,Just Beyond Tomorrow – A Reflection On Future Climate Policy," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior to that.To the extent that there is one, much of the current debate about climate policy in Canada revolves around the use of policy instruments rather than objectives. Those who claim that human influences will have catastrophic effects on the future environment have so tilted (one might say “poisoned”) the public policy debate that few, if any, politicians are prepared to question their thesis for fear of being branded a “denier”. Name-calling, however inaccurate, injects plenty of heat but no light on the key questions involved. Much of the opposition to current climate policy, therefore, has focused on questioning the three primary policy instruments favoured by the federal government – the imposition of carbon taxes, the use of large subsidies to promote wind and solar energy development, and the use of regulation to delay and discourage fossil fuel development. The controversies have remained focused on the short-term effects and consequences of these policy measures. All major federal political parties have announced their acceptance of the greenhouse gas emission (GHG) targets previously adopted at meetings of the parties to the International Framework Convention on Climate Change. Perhaps it is time to explore exactly what attainment of those targets would mean in practice. In other words, perhaps we should examine not just what governments will do if they stay on the present course to 2023 (the end of the present schedule of carbon tax increases) but beyond that to 2030 and to 2050. Those dates are only 11 and 31 years away, well within the lifetimes of most Canadians living today. Are we on the right course? The Targets In May 2015, Canada indicated its intent to reduce GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. In previous international meetings, former Prime Minister Harper agreed to the target of reducing GHG emissions to between 50% and 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. A number of provinces, including Quebec and Ontario, subsequently committed to reduce their emissions by at least 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. Canada’s emissions in 2005 were 732 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt). Thus, the emissions targets would be 512 Mt by 2030 and somewhere between 366 Mt (50%) and 146 Mt (80%) by 2050. The targets make no allowance for increases in Canada’s economic activity or population. What are the Current Trends?To judge how easy or difficult it would be to meet the accepted targets, we might start by considering what our experience has been since 1990 when governments first started setting emission reduction goals.  How have Canadian emissions changed and at what cost? Unfortunately, there are no published reports by the federal and provincial governments that document how much has been spent by governments and by the private sector since 1990 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, how much additional cost has been added to electricity consumers’ rates by provincial policies that favoured renewable energy sources and forced the phase out of coal-fired power generation, or how much revenue has been foregone by Canadian oil producers as a result of strained pipeline access to export markets driven by climate policies. There is absolutely no doubt that the cost, if it were compiled, would run to tens of billions of dollars. To that effort can be added the consequence of lower emissions due to the most serious economic recession since the Great Depression. As a result of all this effort and cost, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Canada’s GHG emissions actually rose from 611 Mt in 1990 to 732 Mt in 2005 and to 745 Mt in 2007, before declining to 682 Mt during the financial recession in 2009. Since then they have slowly increased and then decreased, arriving at 704 Mt in 2016. Since 2005, the trend is an average annual decline of 2.5 Mt per year. If Canada stayed on this trend line, total emissions would be 668 Mt by 2030 and 616 Mt by 2050. We would miss the GHG emission targets by wide margins.  Assessing the Feasibility of Meeting the Future TargetsTo attain the 2030 target of 512 Mt, emissions would have to decline by 192 Mt from 704 in 2016. That is an annual average reduction rate of 17.4 Mt, seven times higher than the rate actually experienced since 2005. To attain the target of 366 Mt by 2050, emissions would have to decline by 338 Mt, or 9.9 Mt per year, four times as fast as they declined from 2005 to 2016. To attain the target of 146 Mt by 2050, emissions would have to decline by 690 Mt, or 20.2 Mt per year, eight times as fast as they declined from 2005 to 2016. Let us consider the enormity of the changes required to meet those targets. We can do so by reviewing the sources of emissions today, the economic and technological challenges involved in changing current practices and the policy capability of governments to manage/force such a transition. According to ECCC’s National Inventory Report on Greenhous Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada 1990-2016, the breakdown of emission by economic sector for 2016 is as indicated in the following table:TABLE 1Canada’s GHG Emissions by Economic Sector, 2016Sector  Emissions (Mt)PercentageOil and Gas18326.0Electricity7911.2Transportation17324.6Heavy industry7510.6Buildings8111.5Agriculture7210.2Waste and other415.8Total704 100.0Source: ECCC The National Inventory Report can be viewed here:https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/documents/pdf/climate-change/emissions-inventories-reporting/nir-executive-summary/National%20Inventory%20Report%20Executive%20Summary%202018.pdf As indicated in the table, the two largest emission sources are the oil and gas industry, centred in western Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador, and transportation. Emissions are caused mostly by the use (i.e. combustion) of the fossil fuels of coal, oil and natural gas. The production of these fuels only adds to emissions due to the extent large amounts of energy required in the exploration and production process. Transportation, the second largest source, involves all the major modes (i.e. road, rail, marine, aviation and off-road). Contrary to public perception, light duty passenger vehicles (cars, SUVs and pick-up trucks) account for only 11.5% of all emissions in Canada. What is at Stake in Attempting to Meet Current Targets? Achieving the targets set for 2030 and 2050 clearly cannot be accomplished by minor changes in energy use, energy efficiency improvements and minor changes in lifestyle. What is at issue is the prospect of fundamental structural change in Canada’s energy economy, in the economic fortunes of Canada’s regions and in Canadians’ standard of living. Using the 50% reduction by 2050 (from 704 Mt in 2016 to 366 Mt in 2050, a reduction of 338 Mt), some or all of the following changes would be required: Complete elimination of Canada’s coal, oil and natural gas industries;Complete elimination of the use of coal and natural gas-fired power plants for electricity generation;Significant reductions in Canada’s energy-intensive industries like mines and minerals; petrochemicals; iron, steel and aluminum; auto and parts manufacturing, and cement;Significant reductions in use of aircraft for commercial and tourist purposes;Significant reduction in the number of private vehicles;Major changes in farming practices;Unprecedented shifts of freight transportation from truck to rail and of passenger transportation from aircraft and private cars to heavy rail and light transit; andExtensive and extremely costly electrification of the transport system. The view that such changes are feasible rests upon proponents’ faith, not in any demonstrated capabilities. Faith in what? In this: That the problem of large-scale electricity storage, which scientists have been working on for decades with only marginal success, will somehow be solved;That the widespread use of intermittent electricity generation sources like solar and wind energy will not completely destabilize the electricity supply system, leaving the economy vulnerable to frequent brownouts and blackouts;That many other technologies now only in the laboratory or in demonstration stages can be commercialized and marketed at far faster rates than has ever been experienced in any industries other than informatics; andThat governments, contrary to long-established practice, will be successful in centrally planning the energy economy and in picking the technology winners to support by subsidies and regulatory instruments. To this can be added some presumptions that are political or governmental in nature: That politicians and treasury officials can be trusted to pass up the opportunity for creating new programs and aiding favoured constituencies presented by receiving hundreds of billions of dollars in carbon tax revenue;That federal and provincial governments will cordially resolve the enormous tradeoffs in the distribution of economic costs and benefits from climate policies;That Confederation will survive a transformation that impoverishes Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the resource industry dependent regions of other provinces and that shuts down indefinitely northern Canada’s aspirations for resource development. Canada has not met a single one of the emissions reduction targets that have been set previously. It is virtually certain that it will not meet the 2020 target of a 17% reduction from 2005 levels. Yet, governments continue to set ever more demanding and untenable targets, and the major political parties, intimidated by the media and environmentalist lobby groups, continue to pay lip service to the objectives. With every passing year, the world’s GHG emissions grow higher, driven by economic development in Asia, making whatever we do in Canada irrelevant to the global condition. When will we awake to the dangers posed by the present course? Climate Change Policy – A Threat to Canada   Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Paris Agreement']",2018/09/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/23/cavemen-climate-and-computers/,,"Cavemen, Climate, and Computers"," © Christopher Essex.  Republished with permission of Christopher Essex.  Of Cavemen and Differential Equations A debate takes place between a mysterious time traveler and a paleolithic shaman before an audience of paleolithics about the merits of cooking with microwave ovens. The mysterious traveler introduces the electromagnetic field, and discusses the merits of eating cooked versus raw. The shaman sings mystically about what the gods say. Meanwhile the audience chants, “Club. Club. Club. …” It sounds bizarre, but I didn’t entirely make it up. I have lived it—well, mostly. There wasn’t any time travel, of course, and the subject was climate change rather than microwave ovens, but everything else was much the same, modulo some details. Naturally, objections to the paleolithic aspect may arise: this is the modern world, not the old stone age. Modern people are educated, supporters of science, and not just a bunch of superstitious cavemen, aren’t they? Well, let me relate some of my experiences in answer. Sometimes I give a pop quiz before giving an interview on climate. Tell me, I ask the journalist, what you know about the Navier Stokes equations. It’s pretty vague, so nearly any puny, pathetic answer would do. But there is still one wrong answer: what’re the Navier Stokes equations? Despite the low standard, they never pass. Some think that’s unfair, but is it? Those equations tell us how water and air move—tough to have an intelligent conversation about climate without that. Scientists are criticized for speaking in incomprehensible ways. But compromising has led to distorted, simplistic gibberish, making the full technicalities appear like a fraud to keep outsiders out. And then the near-gibberish gets set like concrete and called “science.” But, mathematical equations are precise language. While little known to popular culture, they’re essential to human understanding of Nature. Sadly, equations appear freely in public less frequently than pornography, and can prove to be even more socially unacceptable. Have you ever seen a differential equation in a newspaper? Claiming to discuss climate while trying to escape mathematics comes across to me like children wailing for dessert after refusing to eat their vegetables. But if I forego the quiz and the journalist wants to talk about actual science, instead of the messenger (i.e. me), doing the interview with scientific technicalities off-limits is more challenging than doing charades. At least in charades, when you act out a movie title, you can count on the audience knowing what a movie is. After decades of slavering climate obsession, we are still admonished not to question the persistent and stunningly stunted level of discourse because it’s “unfair.” While many worry about climate, time and again they fail to truly discuss it because of awkward cultural attitudes about science. Instead, I’ve witnessed something else. It sounds an awful lot like, “Club. Club. Club. …” Saying it is unfair to question this makes a heartbreaking joke out of us all.  Speaking for the GodsThe stranger from the future begins to explain how microwave ovens work. But Maxwell’s equations, and the dipole moment of the water molecule don’t seem to make much headway with the paleolithics. In desperation, he falls back to the gibberish method. “Well, the microwaves rub up against the water, causing heat from friction.” Oh, wait. That’s the explanation for microwave ovens given to modern humans. Making fun of us on science is too easy. But given the torrents of prattling nonsense flowing endlessly from the mouths of our illustrious leaders, journalists, and academics on climate, it’s richly deserved. I would be sympathetic if I did not believe that people were capable of much better. Most underestimate their scientific side: you can do it human; it’s built in. It might seem hard, but like Brussels sprouts, differential equations are good for you. Some squirm to avoid their vegetables, and others enable their tortured avoidance. The enablers force us to indulge people who act like cats gingerly stepping around a puddle when scientific technicalities are in play. By all means don’t use microwave ovens if you think they infest your brain with leprechauns. However, if we are facing political decisions over policy affecting everyone, you should not get to step gingerly around the puddle. You should either step up and learn, or get out of the way in favor of those who have. The usual method for dealing with what you don’t know is to consult an expert. People do that with physicians, auto mechanics, and plumbers all the time. It’s mostly okay. But there are issues where it isn’t. Climate is one of those. Oh yes, I know we can all understand droughts, heat waves, snow, floods, storms, and the wrath of the gods. But how do you know whether any of these phenomena are related to climate change? This isn’t a plumbing issue. Even if you don’t do your own plumbing, you know when your toilet does not work, and when it’s fixed afterward. That’s crucial. After farming out everything else to experts, knowing whether you got what you want or need is your last link to your own problem. It keeps you in charge. However, if you farm out something like climate to experts, where you have no expertise yourself, outside of some prejudice and folklore, you are like a child, precisely because you cannot say, on your own, whether or not there is a problem, let alone whether it has been fixed or not. So, why not just put the experts in charge then? You would only vote according to what they tell you anyway. Isn’t that the concept? Think about that. If you don’t step up to learn new things when needed, what starts with plumbing flushes away democracy. But, cluelessness not withstanding, children and cavemen insist on decision making anyway. There are a number of popular methods. The most primal of these is to decide whether you trust some particular expert. Where would you begin? Maybe you can discover whether the expert had any shady real-estate dealings. Were there extramarital affairs, prior convictions, drunk driving charges? How about cheating on taxes? Exposing moral turpitude as a way to make up minds about climate experts may sound a bit hyperbolic, but it isn’t. It’s the first approach to the climate problem. Aficionados decide on physics through moral turpitude. Reality check: that should sound bonkers. The moral turpitude of choice is fraud. Allegations are made that false opinions are bought and paid for from experts by forces that aim to deceive. If identified, the next step is to just ignore the offending experts, after some primal Paleolithic vilification. Simple enough. But how can you find fraudulent experts out? You could turn to an “expert” at  investigating the experts. But this is just another expert problem. Do you trust the experts on experts? Is this a concern? Well, yes. There is a rich industry of activists anxious to share their “expertise” in implicating putative climate experts in evil deeds. But thoughtful people soon catch on that something is amiss. Many of their claims are outrageous smears that are probably actionable. Nevertheless, celebrities, government officials and even heads of state deal freely in them. It’s fashion, like narrow lapels and short skirts. There are any number of libelous websites that claim to expose climate experts who do not practice “right thinking.” Why is this injustice spree allowed to stand? Ironically, despite allegations of being on the take, many of the libelous sites could probably be closed down if the experts in question actually had money for libel actions. Real climate experts are real scientists. They don’t test the morality of experts to decide what’s true in Nature, because they don’t believe any experts. That’s science. They don’t worry about deception, because we humans do an excellent job at getting things wrong even without lies! For them, the issue is finding out the falsehoods irrespective of motives. Test things, not persons. That’s science at its best. It follows that real scientists find the moral turpitude test, and the accompanying primal politics, bewildering. It’s a farce to them. So, let’s set moral turpitude aside. Another popular tactic for asserting control, when you know nothing, is to test qualifications: the competency method. Maybe you can decide on which expert to believe based on whether the expert is qualified. I once heard from a journalist who was compiling a list of those qualified to speak publicly about climate. His dream, simply put, was that qualified experts speak and everyone else shuts up. He approached me to determine whether I should be on his list. I asked him what made him qualified to decide who was qualified? Silence. It borders on a self-referential paradox. Who is qualified to choose who is qualified to compile such a list? It wasn’t even necessary to point out that self-appointed qualification deciders might just rule out experts holding views they don’t like. So much for the competency method.  It would be simpler if all experts were to say the same thing. This is easily achieved, if you are up for some mathematical madness. Simply define experts as those holding a particular prescribed position. All experts then agree by definition. Other views, equally by definition, are not from experts. It’s simple. Forget about distinguishing between experts; they’re all alike, by definition. Your contribution to important discussions need only be to reply to doubters with, “the experts all agree.” It’s liberating. Who cares who agreed or what they might have agreed to. Try it: ask people who and what. It’s no wonder that climate journalists, who have never heard of the equations that govern the motions of air and water, could survive despite a quarter century of boiling climate fervor. But, despite the madness of it, if you don’t actually know anything, how can this even be achieved? Any prescription for what’s “correct” requires at least some knowledge to set the definition. Maybe you could farm that out too. But you do need to be reassured that some canonical position has actually been set by someone, even if you avoid learning what it is. Moreover, you still need to know specific tasks that you are called on to do by the inscrutable, duly defined experts. While the paleolithics might not be able to help you with microwave ovens, they would recognize at once who you need. You need a shaman to intercede for you with the gods. The experts recede into the background as unknowable entities of power (the gods). They’re interpreted for you by some bold, charismatic personality (the shaman). Al Gore is a shaman. So, in the end, despite our democracy, modernity, sophistication, and technology, we return to the old stone age, because it all boils down to what the shaman tells us the gods say, while the supplicants chant, “Club. Club. Club…” And if you do not agree that this is “science,” then you believe in smoking and that the earth is flat, or something like that. But the modern supplicants actually chant something else equally devoid of scientific content: “climate change is real; the science is clear; the scientists all agree.” I suggest you look off into the distance, hold your arms wide, and repeat it full voiced, three times, to get the full inspirational effect. I’ve tried it. It’s a compelling ritual. Perhaps it could be put to music.  Enablers and Oracles These methods aren’t for everyone. But there’s a fourth, very hip, alternative. It was once explained to me by a certain sociologist. She told me that it did not matter that she knew nothing about science. She knew what to do anyway. Her explanation was so smooth it was like a song, Don’t know much about climatology; Don’t know much about astronomy; Don’t know much about a physics book; Don’t know much about the math I took; But I do know what we should do; and I know that if you do too, what a wonderful world this would be. But no matter how mellifluous the explanation, reasoning matters. If we don’t act, she reasoned, things may or may not turn out bad, but if we do act then things will be fine. Therefore, we must act. Her thinking is sometimes described as the “precautionary principle.” The precautionary principle originates from medicine, where it’s more of a do-no-harm kind of thing. Inaction, instead of action, is the prudent course there. The climate version is upside down. So instead we’ll call it the “wonderful world method” for ditching science (WWM). It takes talent to make science in a scientific issue disappear, which WWM does. But where did it go? If the WWM cases are put into a table, listing “action” and “inaction” against “bad” and “fine”, there are four possibilities, not three. The “action and bad” case is missing. You can’t rule it out by being hip. Instead you need to define things precisely. For example, what’s “action?” What’s “bad?” How does “action” or “inaction” lead to “fine” or “bad?” The missing case seems like a stray thread, but if you pull on it everything unravels. The scientific questions didn’t disappear; they were just embroidered over. There are surely more methods to avoid learning the science needed. As any parent knows, there are boundless excuses to avoid your vegetables, and there are also always enablers who feel it’s cruel to make the kiddies eat them. The climate policy process is a no-vegetable enabler’s paradise. That process envisions policymakers standing before the single closed door of an otherwise sealed room. A note, written in mystic runes, is slipped under the door. Imagine visiting an oracle in ancient Greece. Policymakers leave with the word of the gods. It’s so simple: scientists figure out science; policymakers listen to what they have to say; policymakers make policy that doesn’t contradict the laws of nature.Then we all ride off into the sunset basking in a warm utopian glow. Problem solved.Vegetables successfully uneaten. This process embraces all four methods for ducking science. The unseen within the sealed room are the gods. The policymakers visiting the oracle are the shamen. Who is selected to be in the sealed room? Well, only competent experts of unquestioned morality (as long as they’re in the room) are selected. Who selects them? Only the shamen know. But where’s WWM here? This is the really interesting part. No one actually cares about what the oracle wrote, let alone why. In reality, of course, the note is not a piece of paper, but rather a huge tome: the scientific report of the UN’s climate panel. Not only do few ever read it, but policymakers actually doctor it after they receive it. That is, as the policymakers walk away from the door with the note, they scratch out some lines, and reword parts, while inserting little somethings here and there. That way the note will agree with what they think the oracle ought to have said. What! You didn’t know? It’s no secret. It’s standard operating procedure for the UN panel. What difference does it make! WWM makes the scientific issues irrelevant anyway. The frank purpose of the UN climate process, according to its founding head, is to “orchestrate” scientific opinion. The current head is less frank, uttering things like “climate change is real” instead. I don’t think he sang it to music though.  On being Smarter than a Screwdriver People are much smarter than they are given credit for, when given half a chance, a bit of encouragement, and are not trumped by fashion. If everyone involved put as much effort into learning and explaining over the last 25 years, as they put into avoiding, enabling, and groupthink, we would not be living the life Kafka. But no matter how Kafkaesque our approach to this problem is, an inexplicable toe hold remains when the nonsense is alleged to be backed by computers. Computer cachet is a pernicious part of the superstitious cloud of confusion stopping us from thinking. Computers aren’t oracles either. They are just tools, like a screwdriver. The first rule when using a screwdriver is to be smarter than the screwdriver. You can hurt yourself if you aren’t. It’s the same for computers. The question is sometimes put to me as to whether computer climate models are ready for policymaking. Climate models are the best we have, but they are far from good enough. Even many experts are unaware of the extent of their limitations. Computers can only hold a finite number of numbers. Computer scientists call that a “finite representation.” Because of that you can get garbage out even when you don’t put garbage in. It alters arithmetic; it alters the equations themselves, and it means important physics has to be faked because modern computers are far too slow and their representations are far too small for climate. No climate model fully employs the known physics. They are empirical. But climate forecasting is not an empirical problem. If one had a computer large enough it is easy to estimate how long a typical modern computer would take to do one 10-year forecast without some of this fake (empirical) physics. With a Kolmogorov microscale of about a millimeter for air, one gets numbers like 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.* That is longer than it took for Douglas Adams’s famous fictional computer, Deep Thought, to answer the cosmic question. (See answer below) I could elaborate, but in a time of neo-shamanism, moral turpitude experts, and WWM does it matter? The climate fervor was never about “science.” That word is just a gimmick and a weapon. Policymakers can get little from computer climate models if they fail to grasp their deep, unredeemable limitations, while being distracted by para-scientific agendas. It’s no good wondering whether climate models are ready for policy, when most policymakers are not ready for models. They are not smarter than this screwdriver. *Or…the age of the Universe, squared.~~~Pop-Quiz for Journalists Read “Taken By Storm”https://www.amazon.ca/Taken-Storm-Troubled-Science-Politics/dp/1552639460Ron Clutz of “Science Matters” offers a collection of cavemen-climate cartoons.https://rclutz.wordpress.com/2017/09/10/cavemen-climate-sunday-comics/  Deep Thought – Answer To The Ultimate Question – The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy – BBCShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'climate models']",2018/09/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/23/paradogma-documentary-by-marijn-poels-touring-in-european-cinemas-this-october/,,"PARADOGMA, documentary by Marijn Poels touring in European cinemas this October"," TRAILER RELEASE 10-8-2018Berlin – Award-winning Dutch documentary filmmaker, Marijn Poels, announces the upcoming release of his new independent film “PARADOGMA.” This is a sequel to his controversial climate and energy film “The Uncertainty Has Settled.” PARADOGMA, part two of a trilogy, begins its European debut in selected cinemas from October.PARADOGMA was inspired by the social and personal consequences Poels experienced after the release of “The Uncertainty Has Settled”.  In the film he asks critical questions about climate science and energy policies without giving answers. He was both praised and attacked for this oblique approach.It seemed that questioning the paradigms related to climate change science or energy policies, caused a knee-jerk dogmatic response in most people, usually condemning him as a social heretic. Hence, the titlePARADOGMA.Poels had spent nine years working in poverty and conflict countries, making over 50 films, often working in dictatorships and conflict zones.The censorship and condemnation Poels experienced from many people over “The Uncertainty Has Settled” left him with questions which he saw applied to other parts of society.  People who dare to question important themes today, are often silenced or labeled as suspicious and dangerous. Where once democracies valued and encouraged debate, Poels saw that Western society is dividing itself with stark lines between the left, the right, the good or the bad.What is strangling debate? How liberal is the West? Should we ignore or embrace other perspectives? PARADOGMA is a critical, thought-provoking journey through ancient tribal conflicts, in a new era wherein world views clash and free speech crumbles under pressure to conform. Poels therefore traveled the world to meet Canadian clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson, Russian philosopher Alexandr Dugin, German author Dirk Müller and others.https://youtu.be/k7OsyP4xNj0 PARADOGMA is the second part in a planned trilogy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/23/airbag-vert-au-lieu-de-serre-globale/,,« Airbag Vert » au lieu de « Serre globale »," Conférence de Climat à Porto – Tout à fait naturel !Contributed by Claus U. Rieth © 2018English version: https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/18/global-green-airbag-versus-global-greenhouse/ « Bases scientifiques d’un climat changeant » – ainsi le sujet de cette conférence qui avait lieu àl’Université de Porto en Portugal le 07. -08. Septembre 2018. Chercheurs de premier plan de différentsdomaines, ingénieurs experts et esprits critiques étaient présents, de la météorologie, l’océanographie,les mathématiques, la géophysique, la géologie et d’autres. L’audience compétente de 80 personnesétait venue de tous les coins du monde : la Nouvelle Zélande, l’Australie, le Canada, les Etats-Unis, laGrande-Bretagne, la Norvège, la Suède, la France, l’Allemagne, l’Italie, la République Tchèque, lePortugal. Le focus primaire de cette conférence visait les bases scientifiques de la recherche sur leclimat. Néanmoins au cours des sujets différents les questions de la communication vers le public seposaient.La doyenne de la Faculté des Lettres, Fernanda Ribeiro, prononçait les mots d’ouverture et insistait surla liberté de la recherche comme condition d’un progrès scientifique. Toute l’audience y consentait. Lesconférences et débats tournaient autour de quatre aspects :1. Changements de climat et du temps2. CO2, sensitivité de climat et effet de serre3. Fonctions de renforcement dans le système de climat4. Evidences observés, interprétations, et Géo-éthiqueNils-Axel Mörner, ancien chef du Département Paléo-physique & Géo-dynamique de l’Université deStockholm animait le cours de la conférence, hôte de la Faculté des Lettres et représenté par MariaAssunçao Araùjo, professeur au Département de Géographie et membre du « Projet de niveau de merportugais » avec Pamela Mattlock-Klein. Lors de la conférence un groupe de manifestants arrivait pourprotester contre cette conférence sans même essayer de parler à l’audience.Commandants et passagers clandestinsLes chercheurs posaient unanimement le CO2 sur la banquette du fond du mobile de climat. Aucun/esoutenait l’ »hystérie » dans les médias et la politique à réduire ce « menace » assumé promu par leGIEC et ses papiers politiques et les lobbys derrière les publications médiatiques dominantes.Considérant la quantité énorme de vapeur d’eau – H2O gazéiforme – dans l’atmosphère, le H2Ogazéiforme est le player dominant sur la planète. Avec 1% d’humidité absolue en moyenne ( = 20%rélative), le H2O gazéiforme domine le CO2 d’un taux de 0,04% ( = 410ppm – particules par un million)d’un facteur 25, dont 94% du CO2 sont issu de l’émission naturelle – des océans et des sols – etseulement 6% sonts issu des sources antropogènes – énergie fossile et production de ciment enprincipal. Ce dernier représentant que 18ppm de 410ppm de tout le CO2 dans l’atmosphère – de lasurface de la mer jusqu’une altitude de 8000m – ou un particle de 2500. Le commandant en second desgazes atmosphériques en jeu du climat c’est la vapeur d’eau invisible ou H2O gazéiforme. Le CO2 parcontre n’est que négligeable, ainsi le consensus des chercheurs (Veyres, Gervais, Harde). Pareille pourles autres gazes atmosphériques responsabilisés pour le changement de climat comme l’ozone et le CFC.Un airbag vert pour la TerreLa Terre vis-à-vis Vénus et Saturne a heureusement développé un « airbag » ou coussin atmosphériquecomme moyen de sécurité pour notre vie. Vapeur d’eau / H2O gazéiforme et CO2 ont au moins troispropriétés bénéfiques : ils protègent la Terre du refroidissement – sinon les températures sur la Terrediminuaient ou augmentaient à des conditions insupportables pour des êtres vivantes. Ils agissent d’uncoussin thermique. Deuxième : ils protègent notre vie et celle des animaux et plantes d’une radiationsolaire et cosmique excessive comme des verres polaroids. Troisième : ils assurent la bonne croissancede toute la vie des plantes vertes sur la Terre. Sans CO2 pas de photosynthèse, pas de croissance endessous de 150ppm de CO2 (Veyres, Gervais, Harde). Le verdoyer mondial avançait grâce au CO2 –meilleur croissance de légumes et de fruits, des céréales et d’algues pour une population toujourscroissante sur Terre qui va bientôt arriver à 10 milliards d’hommes. Sans coussin atmosphérique, sanscet airbag vert, il y aura bientôt plus de famine et plus de morts de faim.Grâce aux océansLes océans marquent le visage de la Terre vu de l’espace spatial de « planète bleue », comme lesastronautes peuvent observer souvent avec plein d’émotions. Les océans sont un réservoir de chaleurd’énorme capacité – la capacité de chaleur de 2,5 m de l’eau sous la surface correspond à celle de toutela colonne d’air dessus de 8000m d’altitude, de la troposphère entière. Les océans produisent 50% del’oxygène par les algues qu’ils contiennent, comme une pub dans les rues de Porto nous disait. Ainsi lesocéans absorbent aussi 70% du CO2, chaque année 1/10ème du CO2 atmosphérique, le stockent et letransfèrent au grand bleu profond et là c’est transformé en Calcium-Carbonate et d’autres carbonates etsombre au fond de la mer comme sédiment. Le CO2 est aussi stocké en forme de gaz dans l’eau. Lesocéans contiennent 50 fois la quantité de tout le CO2 naturellement et anthropogènement émis. Leurrôle est encore beaucoup sous-estimé car il y a très peu de points de mesure vu particulièrement lasurface vaste des océans. Des courants profondes d’eau froide bougent lentement du pôle nord au pôlesud de la Terre. Cette circulation thermo-haline (haline – de « hals » gr. sel) prends un temps de 140 ans(!) pour y arriver. C’est un des agents majeurs du climat à part du soleil et de H2O gazéiforme (Mörner,Corbyn). Le grand bleu des océans bouge – lentement comme le Blues musical.Lune, Soleil et EtoilesTout le monde sait que les marées sont gouvernés par la lune, même ceux qui habitent dans le pays etqui ont une fois passé des vacances aux côtes bretonnes ou normandes. Les marées changent parl’influence de la gravité de la masse de la lune, plus précisément dit. Dans l’espace il n’y a que le soleil, ily a aussi les planètes et leurs lunes et les étoiles lointains. Les effets de masse s’additionnent à l’instard’un bus qui prends plus longtemps à accélérer ou freiner plus il y a des gens dedans. Ainsi les planètes :s’ils sont tous dans la même ligne, la Terre fait un léger saut et elle accélère ou freine (Tattersall, Zeller).Aussi le soleil : plus le soleil envoie d’énergie par la radiation électromagnétique ou photogène, eténergie c’est la masse par la vitesse au carré comme nous a enseigné Einstein, plus la rotation de la terreaccélère. Comme dans un manège à chaines les sièges volent plus haut et distants au centre plus vite lemanège tourne – l’eau des océans à l’équateur monte plus plus vite la planète tourne. Mais car laquantité de l’eau de mer est fixe, le niveau de mer monte dans la zone équatoriale et baisse dans leszones polaires. Pareil, si l’activité solaire baisse, c’est l’effet inverse, et le niveau de mer augmente denouveau dans les zones polaires et baisse à l’équateur (Wysmuller, Mörner, Corbyn, Assunçao). Leniveau de mer monte et descend avec le soleil comme les marées avec la lune.Le besoin du « bain de soleil »Comme chacun/e gêle la nuit quand le soleil s’est couché et le ciel est clair – aussi la Terre. Sansradiation solaire dans l’atmosphère protégeant la terre refroidissait et chauffait à des températuresd’autres planètes invivables, personne n’y pourrait vivre. Car la Terre est un receveur net, elle dépenddu soleil comme donateur net. Quand le soleil « donne » beaucoup, la Terre devient plus chaude qued’habitude, une période chaude, comme la période chaude romaine. Quand le soleil est « avarice », lestempératures terrestres baissent et on peut faire le patinage sur les rivières et lacs comme au XVèmesiècle à Londres sur le Tamise, à Amsterdam sur les canaux et le Tibère à Rome. C’était le dernier âgeglacemineur – ou LIA Little Ice Age (Solheim, Yndestadt, Scafetta). La radiation solaire est le moteur del’horloge du climat. Les hauts et bas de la radiation – observé par le nombre des taches solaires et leurnombre par période de temps – font la différence des âges terrestres. Le soleil est le commandant duclimat – les Maya et Inca le savaient bien.Complexité, Chaos et ClimatAu XVIème siècle les gens ont brulé des « sorcières » – comme rapporté de Wittenberg en 1540 ouhabitait encore Martin Luther- quand une sècheresse et des «in »-tempéries ont dévasté l’Europe et ontvidé les sources et même les fleuves comme le Rhin et les Lacs comme le Lac de Constance. Les « gens »n’aiment pas le chaos des temps, le chaos du climat, ils l’aiment bien ordonnée la vie, cyclique commetout le reste. Et quand le pire arrive, « ils » aiment « faire » quelque chose au lieu d’attendre leur« sort » ou « l’enfer ». Soit quelqu’un/e doit « payer pour » ou « confesser » ou « brûler ». Les « gens »l’aiment simple et haïssent les choses compliqués en politique et en plein d’autres choses commel’éducation, l’alimentation, les relations, le travail et les loisirs. Personne n’aime la fatalité aujourd’huisans chance de tourner l’affaire, soit cancer ou parkinson ou autres misères (Rieth). C’est le moment des« guérisseurs » et « médicastres » et « gourous ». Le climat est complexe – comme une histoire d’amour– et nous, on l’aime simple. On cherche les recettes simples pour les sacs de nœuds. Qui tombeamoureux pour les maths et les quanta ? Cependant c’est le seul chemin de raconter la vraie histoire duclimat (Essex, Masson, Gervais, Rittaud) Les simples suggestions de faire ceci et d’éviter cela – commed’éviter le CO2 et le méthane, de manger la viande et faire végétarien/ne (opposé par Glatzle), d’arrêterd’inspirer (si c’était possible), payer une compensation afin de voler à Bali, confesser la consomptiond’énergie privé … fait partie des messages « simples » « d’un trip-gourou », le mec roulant au Rolls et lesadeptes « vénérant » comme folle « Pére » .La conférence de Porto avait comme but tout cela – trouver un message sobre et basé sur évidence pourun question de climat complexe. Recherche honnête scientifique rencontre dénigration balourde autemps dans lequel un climat d’esprit moyen-âge semble de redominer la recherche marquée par l’âgede-lumière.Ventre contre sang-froid, terreur contre souveraineté, panique contre « coolness ».Le message de la seconde conférence sur le climat à Porto cette année – après celle qui avait Obamacomme orateur star, c’est : Restez calme, pas de peur. Le climat va bien, pas besoin de le sauver et pasmoyen de le faire non plus. Il se peut même qu’il devienne plus froid – l’histoire des cycles solaires lesuggère.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/19/the-clean-growth-hallucination/,songhees ,The “Clean Growth” Hallucination," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, a former public servant of 27 years experience; a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.SUMMARY – Full report linked belowMinister of the Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna recently published an article in which she argued that the economy and the environment go “hand in hand”. As evidence, she wrote that the “clean technology sector’ related to renewable energy is an immense growth opportunity for Canadian business, and that the federal government’s policy of imposing carbon taxes will contribute to economic growth. Throughout the article, she referred to carbon dioxide as “pollution”. Statistics Canada does not include in its breakdown of Canada’s GDP any reference to “clean technology”. The notion that some energy sources are clean, and others not ignores the fact that all energy sources have both positive and negative environmental effects. StatsCan does however, report on two separate groups of economic activities: “clean energy and environmental goods and services” and “the environmental and clean technology products account”. However, most of the former category has to do with municipal sewage treatment, site remediation and environmental audits; less than $2 billion of the $14 billion annual income in this group is related to GHG emissions reduction. Of the latter category, which amounts to $59.3 billion per year, again only a small portion relates to GHG emissions reduction. When one examines the data, the environmental and clean technology products account actually has held a shrinking share of Canada’s economy over the last decade. What opportunity? The international market for renewable energy technologies is not doing much better. Global new investment in renewable energy generation has been essentially flat since 2010. In Germany, the foremost European market for renewables, the megawatts of solar and wind generation capacity added annually dropped 90% in five years, and the largest German solar equipment manufacturer has gone bankrupt.  China, the world’s largest market for renewable energy, has just ended all subsidies for utility-scale solar projects; Forbes projects a 40% reduction in utility demand. In a global market suffering from massive oversupply, solar and wind equipment manufacture is perhaps the last market Canadian companies should be trying to compete in. In Budget 2017, the federal government announced that it will spend $1.7 billion over four years on renewable energy research and development and another $2.4 billion over four years to promote the production and use of “clean energy”. This, along with the billions of dollars in past subsidies from provincial taxpayers and ratepayers, is not a guarantee of success, but rather a measure of this industry’s dependency on government handouts for its survival. The notion that carbon dioxide, critical for existence of life on earth, is a “pollutant” is nonsense. Treating an odorless, colourless, benign gas that people exhale as a toxic “pollutant” would be the ultimate extension of intrusive environmental regulation. Carbon tax rates in Canada are still relatively low – in the range of $20 to $30 per tonne. At this level they punish consumers but do not yet seriously affect the economy. To achieve the government’s climate targets for 2030 and 2050, however, will require carbon taxes as high as $200 to $300 per tonne, and destroy the economic viability of many of our energy-intensive industries in the resources and manufacturing areas. Proponents claim that the revenues will all be recycled by reducing the rates of other generally-applied taxes, but that has never been done consistently in Canada. International studies show that, in all the countries that have introduced carbon taxes, only 29% of the revenues were recycled back into the economy in the form of tax reductions. Taxing the most productive Canadian sectors and raising energy costs for Canadian consumers and firms to subsidize politically-favoured industries can never be considered as benefitting the economy. Full report:   The “Clean Growth” Hallucination – Link below:The Clean Growth Hallucination FINAL Sept 19 2018 Robert Lyman: “Climate Change Policy – A Threat to Canada” Regarding extreme weather claims by the Minister in the same article:Dr. Madhav Khandekar on Extreme Weather: Cold snaps have noticeably increased worldwide:Ray Garnett and Madhav Khandekar: “Increasing Cold Weather Extremes since the NewMillennium: An Assessment with a Focus on Worldwide Economic Impacts”A Garnett-MLK 2018 Cold extremesDr. Khandekar:  “What Global Warming?

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/09/19/the-recent-mckitrick-christy-paper-in-plain-english/,,The Recent McKitrick/Christy Paper in Plain English," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who was a public servant for 27 years; a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.Dr. Ross McKitrick of the University of Guelph and Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville have jointly published an important paper that assesses the validity of the global warming rate that is predicted by climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The paper, while extremely well written, uses several technical terms that may be confusing to the non-specialist. It is possible that people who read only short summaries will draw incorrect conclusions. Due to the paper’s importance, I thought I would take the risk of furthering that confusion by offering one person’s interpretation of what the paper says and does not say. Some background is necessary. The IPCC uses 102 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) runs to assess the probable impact on the global climate of rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.  A GCM employs a mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean. GCMs are extremely complex, involving hundreds of equations and thousands of hypotheses about the relationship between the atmosphere, the oceans, and climate. One of the most important hypotheses concerns the representation of thermodynamics in the troposphere (the lowest region of the atmosphere, extending from the earth’s surface to a height of about 3.7–6.2 miles (6–10 km) in the tropics. The McKitrick/Christy paper is mostly devoted to explanation of its methodology, and why it selected the tropical troposphere as the variable that most clearly serves as an indicator of whether GCMs are producing results that match experience. The period used to assess this is 1958 to 2017. To be clear, the paper does not challenge or test the hypothesis that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes or will cause increased global warming. It does not attempt to distinguish the comparative influence of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations and of other factors (e.g. the sun) on global temperatures.  It, rather, uses data from actual experience to test whether the results of GCMs are broadly correct. It measures temperature rises in terms of degrees Celsius per decade. According to the models, the average warming rate based on increased carbon dioxide concentrations is 0.33 degrees per decade (i.e. 3.3 degrees C. per century). Based on this rate, the warming experienced over the period 1958-2017 should have been about 2.0 degrees C. Actual observations, however, show an average decadal warming of 0.17 degrees C, about half the rate projected by the models. All 102 models have projections that run warmer than the observations.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/08/31/the-law-versus-logic-a-review-of-the-federal-court-of-appeal-decision-on-the-trans-mountain-expansion-project/,Dave Hassan ,The Law Versus Logic – A Review of the Federal Court of Appeal Decision on the Trans Mountain Expansion Project," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant.  He worked as a public servant for 27 years; prior to that he spent 10 years as a diplomat.On August 29, 2018, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal issued its decision on applications by a number of aboriginal groups, the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby and two non-governmental organizations to set aside the report of the National Energy Board and the federal government Order-in-Council approving the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. The court granted the application challenging the Order-in-Council, thereby potentially terminating a pipeline project that has been undergoing regulatory analysis and review since 2013. The court’s reason for decision document is over 200 pages long and contains closely argued legal considerations. In the summary released by the court, it stated that one of the main reasons for its judgment was that the National Energy Board’s process and findings “were so flawed that the Governor in Council could not reasonably rely on the Board’s report”. Specifically, the Board allegedly did not examine the environmental effects of the marine tanker movement associated with the project, including the “significant adverse effects on the Southern resident killer whale”. The purpose of this note is to show that, whatever the legal merits of the decision (which I am not qualified to determine), the decision is false with respect to marine environmental effects. Some Background Facts The Trans Mountain Expansion project involves the expansion of an existing oil pipeline system that runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, at which point some of the crude oil would be loaded onto tankers at the Westridge Marine Terminal where it would be delivered to markets throughout the west coast of North America and the Pacific Rim. This pipeline system has operated for 65 years, since 1953. The project would result in the looping (or twinning) of the existing 1,147 km Trans Mountain Pipeline (TMPL) system with about 987 km of new buried pipeline. The older pipeline would be designated Line 1. The proposed new pipeline segments, along with two currently active segments, would become Line 2. Currently, the Westridge Terminal loads about five oil tankers per month with crude oil delivered by TMPL; this has been occurring for decades. The National Energy Board conducted an extensive review of every aspect of the project in accordance with its requirements under the National Energy Board Act, which requires it to conduct a review based on the Canadian public interest. These subjects included an evaluation of the potential benefits and burdens of the project throughout its entire life cycle, from pre-construction through construction and operation to eventual decommissioning. The topics covered included the need for the pipeline, the safety and engineering integrity of the facilities, the approach to be taken to land acquisition and construction, the economic and financial issues, the impacts on communities and on aboriginal people, and the effects of shipping, among others. The National Energy Board was also responsible to evaluate the project under the Canadian Environment Assessment Act and so it examined the effects of the pipeline on a host of environmental aspects, including air, land and water as well as wildlife; it also reviewed the TMPL plans to avoid accidents that might cause spills and to take rapid action to clean up and remediate any spills that do occur. The NEB collected a large amount of written and oral evidence concerning the marine portion of the project and devoted a number of sections of its final report to these. Chapter 14 of the Board’s report, from pages 323 to 406, addresses the consequences of the project-related increase in shipping activities. Chapter 10 of the report assesses the environmental effects on air, land and water, and specifically, in section10.2.15, addresses the environmental effects on marine mammals, including whales, of the expansion of the Westridge Marine Terminal. The NEB reasons for decision can be read here: https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p80061/114562E.pdf The British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office on January 11, 2017, issued an Environmental Assessment Certificate for the project, subject to an additional 37 conditions. The B.C. announcement of this can be read here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2017ENV0001-000047 What will be the Effect of the Project on Shipping Traffic?To understand the claims that the marine portion of the project poses an unacceptable risk, it is necessary to place it in context. The project would result in an increase in tanker traffic from 60 per year to about 408 per year (720 additional movements including in and out). The tanker traffic associated with the project would use the Westridge Terminal, which is near the port of Vancouver. The port of Vancouver now has about 23,000 ship movements a year and is engaged in public consultations about plans to significantly increase its size. The increase would add more than 5,000 ship movements per year if all the future upgrades were included. This dwarfs the 720 additional ship movements associated with the project.  The TERMPOL Process The marine portion of the TMPL project was reviewed under the Technical Review Process of Marine Terminal and Transshipment Sites (TERMPOL). A TERMPOL Review Committee, whose members include experts from federal departments and authorities with responsibilities related to safe marine transportation, reviews submissions. The purpose of the TERMPOL review process is to: Objectively appraise operational vessel safety, route safety and cargo transfer operations associated with a proposed marine terminal system or transshipment siteFocus on improving, where possible, those elements of a proposal which could, in certain circumstances, pose a risk to the integrity of a vessel’s hull while navigating and/or the cargo transfer operations alongside the terminal The TERMPOL review takes place within the context of Canada’s marine safety regulatory regime, which is one of the most stringent in the world. Under this regime, oil tankers and their operations must comply with a long list of environmental protection requirements of both Canada’s domestic laws and international conventions. These requirements address such areas as safe vessel design and construction, including requirements for double-hulled tankers; safe manning; crew qualifications and training; working conditions; safety management systems, radio communication equipment and equipment for safe navigation including Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems and automatic identification systems (AIS); voyage planning; vessel reporting; and rules to prevent collisions. Det Norske Veritas Review of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project Trans Mountain commissioned the consultant Det Norske Veritas, a marine classification society recognized internationally for its marine risk assessment, to conduct a marine transport Quantitative Risk Analysis to determine the impact of the project on oil cargo spill risk, and identify mitigation measures necessary if required. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) performed a thorough review of all the factors that might affect the likelihood of a shipping incident, the possibility and volume of an oil spill, and the likely effects of a spill given all the precautionary and response measures in place. DNR analyzed the risks associated with tanker traffic under three scenarios, one in 2018 without the project, one in 2018 with the project (i.e. assuming it was completed by then), and one in 2028 with the project. Measured in terms of sailed nautical miles, in the first case Trans Mountain tankers would constitute 0.5% of the total 3.8 million miles by all vessels in the Salish Sea and Juan de Fuca Straight. Under the third scenario, in 2018, Trans Mountain tankers would constitute 3.0% of the 4.3 million miles by all vessels in the area.The assessment considered the effect on incident risk of traffic growth from Trans Mountain tanker traffic as well as from overall growth in the area. Here are the main conclusions as stated in the risk analysis submitted to the TERMPOL process: The increase in traffic resulting from the Project is found to have a negligible effect on the total incident frequency for the region. With or without the Project, tanker traffic remains a small part of the total traffic in the region. Without the Project, the frequency of accidents resulting in an oil cargo spill of any size is estimated to be one in every 309 years. Post implementation of the Project, if no additional risk reducing measures are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 46 years. If all the risk reducing measures discussed in this report are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 237 years. Without the Project, the risk of a credible worst-case oil spill (estimated by modeling to be 16,500 cubic metres) is estimated to be one in every 3093 years. Once the Project is implemented, if no additional risk reducing measures are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 456 years. If all the risk reducing measures discussed in this report are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 2366 years. Spill response in the region is currently the subject of review by the Federal and Provincial governments of Canada. Based on the information from the risk assessment, enhanced planning standards for spill response describe a regime that will be able to deliver 20,000 tonnes of capacity within 36 hours from dedicated resources staged within the study area. This represents a response capacity that is double and a delivery time that is half the existing planning standards. These enhancements will reduce times for initiating a response to two hours for the harbor and six hours for the remainder of the study area and parts of the west coast of Vancouver Island. The standard for cleaning of oiled shoreline is also improved significantly from 500 metres per day to 3,000 metres per day. DNV concludes that the regional increase in oil spill risk caused by the expected increase in oil tanker traffic to Trans Mountain Westridge Marine Terminal is low, and that the region is capable of safely accommodating the additional one laden crude oil tanker per day increase that will result from the Project.  The DNV report also concluded that the increase in vessel traffic resulting from the project would have “a negligible effect on the total incident frequency for the region.” The Det Norske Veritas report can be read here:https://transmountain.s3.amazonaws.com/application14/V8C_TERMPOL_REPORTS/1142.htmlBased largely on this analysis and the views received from the participating federal government departments and authorities, the TERMPOL committee concluded: “While there will always be some risk in any project, after reviewing Trans Mountain’s studies and taking into account its commitments, the TRC has identified no regulatory concerns for the tankers, tanker operations, the proposed routes, navigability, other waterway users and the marine terminal operations associated with the Project tankers. The TRC has identified several findings and recommendations in response to Trans Mountain’s submission and has proposed actions for Trans Mountain to undertake that, in conjunction with Trans Mountain’s commitments, will provide for a higher level of safety for tanker operations commensurate with the increase in traffic.” The report of the TERMPOL review panel can be read here: TERMPOL Review Process Report on the Trans Mountain …https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/2584073  The National Energy Board, in issuing a permit to the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, included the TERMPOL recommendations as binding conditions. The Impact on Orca Whales Blair King, a professional chemist and biologist who specializes in environmental risk assessment, writes a frequent blog on energy and environmental issues under the title of “A Chemist in Langley”. One of his articles dealt with claims that the Trans Mountain Expansion project posed a threat to Orca whales. The following is an excerpt from his blog. “The latest argument against the Trans Mountain has been its purported added risk to the resident Orca population. Originally the argument went: increasing the number of tankers would increase the number of collisions with marine mammals and this could result in the extirpation of the resident Orca community. That trope was quickly demonstrated to simply represent a mis-reading of a single scientific article by someone apparently unaware of BC geography. The paper indicates that the Orcas are at high risk of collision in Johnstone Strait, which would be a problem if tankers were heading in that direction, which they are not. As for the increase in tanker traffic, the TMX tankers would represent an increase of 720 more ship movements in a Strait that sees 23,000 ship movements a year. This at a port that is engaged in a build-out that will expand ship traffic significantly. If acoustics are really a concern for the activists then rather than fighting the TMX, they should be protesting the Port of Vancouver’s expansion plans. Never a group to let a good idea go to waste, once the collision myth was busted the activists turned to the risks to the resident Orca population posed by an oil spill. This myth comes courtesy of the Raincoast Conservation Foundation who prepared a study “Report on Population Viability Analysis model investigations of threats to the Southern Resident Killer Whale population from Trans Mountain Expansion Project. The study represents a modelling exercise to examine the effect of the TMX on the resident Orcas. Now, much like the City of Vancouver modelling, I was a bit surprised by the conclusions of the analysis and so looked a bit deeper into the methodology and like the Vancouver Study I discovered another case of garbage in, garbage out. The model itself seems sound and the statistical methodology was excellent. The problem with the exercise was the data used to generate the results. In this case the authors chose to use a very interesting source for their spill occurrence frequency input value. Specifically they relied on a “report” called Foschi (2014). Except when I go to the references I see that Foschi 2014 is not a peer-reviewed journal article but rather a blog post by an interested engineer. The blog post that serves as the critical data input for this modelling exercise uses values from the Trans Mountain TERMPOL 3.15 General Risk Analysis and Intended Methods of Reducing Risk (caution large file) to generate a likelihood of an incident. But the modelling exercise appears to use the wrong numbers from that blog post. In Foschi he relies on Table 34 (p83 of 454 on the pdf) to get his risk of oil spills. Now looking at the table the TERMPOL 3.15 authors presented several scenarios, a current (Case 0), a Case 1 (expansion with no mitigation) and then Case 1a and Case 1b (expansion with specific mitigations to reduce risk). Now the intention of the TEMPOL 3.15 report is to provide a description of the appropriate and necessary mitigation efforts associated with the increase in tanker traffic that would come with TMX. The conclusion of the report was that Trans Mountain make use of those mitigations. Those mitigations (including tugs etc….) were subsequently written into the TMX proposal as a requirement for the project. Given that the mitigation plans were incorporated into the TMX proposal would anyone care to guess which of Foschi’s numbers were used for this modelling exercise? Yes, you guessed it, the “no mitigations applied” number (Case 1) for spills. They used the very numbers that the authors of TEMPOL 3.15 suggest are not relevant (since the intention of the work is to describe the mitigations). But that is not all. Because “the reports do not clarify the average volumes or the distributions of those small spills” the authors tested the projected effects of frequencies of larger (>16,500 m3) and smaller (>8250 m3) spills that are double those stated above” [highlight mine]. So not only did they use the “no mitigation applied” numbers but they then doubled the likelihood of a spill from the “no mitigations applied” scenario. Let me say that again to make it clear, they took a value that was recognized as being 4-5 times too high and then they doubled the frequency of those spills for conservatism. They then took those inflated numbers and inserted them into their model. This is essentially like looking at the difference between a “no seatbelt” and “mandatory seatbelt” scenario in car crashes. If someone argued that we should ban cars because accidents for passengers without seatbelts is too risky your response would not be to ban cars. Your response would be to point out that seatbelts are mandatory and that modern cars have air bags as well thus any analysis that ignores the existence of seatbelts and air bags is not terribly relevant. Well sadly for the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, their analysis metaphorically argues that people are driving around without access to seatbelts or air bags and therefore driving is too dangerous. The model, which relies on the inflated risk of incidents, thus presents a similarly inflated risk of extirpation of the resident orca population. Sadly, no one with the expertise to catch this bait and switch had read the report prior to it going to the TMX Ministerial Panel. As a consequence, the flawed inputs were used to generate necessarily flawed outputs and those flawed outputs from that modelling made it into the TMX Ministerial Panel final report. So, I suppose the opponents of the TMX Ministerial Panel were correct, maybe we should have been allowed to cross-examine presentations because then someone might have had the opportunity to debunk this flawed modelling exercise before it was broadcast to the world and treated as correct.” Mr. King’s full blog post can be read here: https://achemistinlangley.net/2016/11/30/debunking-activist-myths-about-the-trans-mountain-expansion-project/ ConclusionThe Federal Court of Appeal’s decision rests on two highly dubious claims of fact: first, that the National Energy Board did not examine the marine tanker consequences of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, when it clearly did; and second, that the modest increase in tanker traffic places the Orcas at a much higher risk of collision with shipping. Common sense, however, does not necessarily trump law.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'National Energy Board', 'TransMountain']",2018/08/31
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/08/31/trends-in-global-carbon-dioxide-emissions/,,Trends in Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions," Insights from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2018Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years. The 67th edition of the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy was published in June 2018. This annually-published document is generally regarded as the most accurate and authoritative statistical record of global energy supply, demand and related subjects. For several years now, BP has included statistics on carbon dioxide emissions. The following is the link to this report. Page 49 contains the data on carbon dioxide emissions. They describe emissions by geographic region and country for each of the years 2007 to 2017, an indication of the growth rates over the period 2007 to 2016, and the share that each region or country had of global emissions in 2017. https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html Not everyone likes statistics, especially when they are printed in a small font without explanation or commentary. Nonetheless, the value of statistics is that they constitute factual evidence of what has actually happened in global energy markets, free from the debates that inevitably surround discussions about what the future may hold based on economic models and mathematical equations. Statistics about the past are just the facts. In my comments that follow, I draw attention to the data that I think is especially telling with respect to carbon dioxide emissions in the context of the agreements of the Parties under the Climate Change Convention since 1990 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, including the most recent COP21 Agreement in Paris in December 2015. Broadly, what have the countries of the world actually done over the past eleven years with respect to carbon dioxide emissions? The following points are the highlights: Global emissions are not declining. In fact, carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 were 33.4 gigatonnes (Gt) compared to 30.0 Gt in 2007. So, emissions increased 11.3% over that period. Two parts of the world, as represented by the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the more highly developed economies, and the non-OECD are heading in opposite directions with respect to emissions. OECD emissions declined at the rate of 123 megatonnes (Mt) per year over the period 2007 to 2016, or 0.8% per year. Meanwhile, the non-OECD countries increased their emissions during the same period at the rate of 417 Mt per year, or 2.9% annually. In 2017, the non-OECD countries constituted 63% of global emissions, and the OECD countries constituted 37%. The non-OECD share is steadily increasing year by year, so what happens there is much more important to the global total than what happens in the OECD. The largest country emitter in the world by far is China with 9.3 Gt in 2017, or 28% of the world’s total. The next five largest country emitters in order are the United States (5.1 Gt), India (2.3 Gt), Russia (1.5 Gt), Japan (1.2 Gt) and Germany (0.8 Gt). Emissions declined fastest over the 2007-2016 period in Europe, at the average annual rate of -1.5%, followed by North America at -0.9%. Emissions grew fastest in the Middle East at 3.6% annually, followed by the Asia/Pacific area at 3.1% annually. The largest percentage reductions in emissions over the period by country were in Finland, Greece and Turkey, all at 3.9% per year. The largest percentage increases in emissions over the period by country were in Vietnam, at 10.4% per year, followed by Qatar at 9.4% per year and Bangladesh at 7.7% per year. The annual growth in Asia/Pacific emissions from 2007 to 2017 was 337 Mt, more than the total annual emissions of France in 2017 (320 Mt). Based on their 2017 emissions levels, a group of countries are on track to become carbon dioxide emissions “heavyweights” in the near future: South Korea (680 Mt); Iran (634 Mt); Saudi Arabia (595 Mt); Indonesia (512 Mt); Brazil (467 Mt) and Mexico (473 Mt). The United Nations goal is to reduce emissions to one half of 2005 levels by 2050, or roughly 15 Gt. Today, if one could eliminate all emissions from the western hemisphere, Europe, the former Soviet Union countries, the Middle East and Africa, remaining emissions from the Asia/Pacific region would still exceed that goal.~~~~Related: “The Two-Degree Delusion”  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['GHG reduction targets', 'Paris Agreement']",2018/08/31
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/08/28/electric-vehicles-global-oil-demand-and-emissions/,renewableguy ,"Electric Vehicles, Global Oil Demand And Emissions"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 20018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant. He was formerly a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.SummaryElectric vehicle (EV) sales continue to grow at a healthy pace from a low starting point and have carved out a niche, especially in markets where governments can afford the large subsidies that underpin sales. Proponents of EVs as a way to reduce oil consumption and the related greenhouse gas emissions claim that there will be 20 million EVs on the world’s roads by 2020. The pace of future sales growth, however, remains uncertain. Continuation, or even acceleration, of current trends seems unlikely to increase the size of the total EV stock anywhere close to the 20 million figure globally by 2020.  EVs will remain a small part of the total vehicle stock, and seem likely to have little impact on the growth of oil demand or global carbon emissions for several years to come. IntroductionIt has become commonplace for certain environmental groups, governments and the media that follow climate change issues to claim that sales of all-electric vehicles (EVs) will soon largely displace sales of gasoline and diesel fueled cars, thus significantly reducing oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, the International Energy Agency published a report entitled Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 2017 setting out a scenario in which rising EV use would reduce greenhouse gas emissions at a rate consistent with the United Nations COP21 goals. It projected that the global electric light duty vehicle (i.e. cars and passenger SUVs) stock would increase 28 times from 2017’s two-million-vehicle level to 56 million vehicles by 2030.  This is actually a reduction from the previous ETP report, which projected that EVs would constitute 150 million (10%) of the light duty vehicle stock by 2030 and nearly 1 billion (40%) of the stock by 2050. In an October, 2016 Friends of Science blog item , I proposed a scorecard by which one might measure whether plug-in electric vehicles are on track to meet the lofty expectations of their proponents. I suggested that if, by 2020, the global inventory of EVs is three million or less, this would demonstrate conclusively that the technology is facing serious market barriers that may limit its role in reducing GHG emissions for decades. Continuation of the rate of sales growth experienced through mid-2016 plus some acceleration could yield a global stock of 7.4 to 13 million EVs by 2020. A 2020 EV population of 20 million would align with the more optimistic claims of sources like the ETP. What Has Happened? To find out what has happened since then, I used the best online sources of data available concerning plug-in electric light-duty vehicle sales. These include InsideEVs, which provides data on monthly and annual sales for the United States and the world, the International Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) for national and global sales of all light duty vehicles, and Statista, a commercial statistics portal that provides data on commercial and consumer trends. The following table shows the most recent EV sales.Table 1 Sales of Electric Plug-In Light Duty VehiclesYearU.S.World2014122,938320,7132015116,099550,2972016158,614777,4972017199,8261,227,1172018 (to date)153,666749,729 Source: InsideEVsThe figure for U.S. sales in 2018 is based on data for the first seven months of the year, while the figure for worldwide sales in 2018 is based on data during the first six months of the year. Global sales are a surprising 65% higher than those of the comparable period of 2017 and are on track for an annual total of over 2 million vehicles. The much higher rate of growth globally than in the U.S. is largely due to the heavy subsidization of EV sales in China and, to a lesser extent, Europe. The figures show the continuing growth in EV sales that underlies the optimism expressed by many EV advocates. Sales could be over five times higher in 2018 that they were in 2014. The EV industry sees the remarkable annual rate of growth globally as a norm likely to continue indefinitely. Projecting this forward to 2030, some EV advocates conclude that by then plug-ins will constitute eight out of ten new car sales. This assumes, of course, that governments will continue the very high levels of subsidies that now drive sales in most countries, and that there will be no shortages of materials related to battery components that would limit production. What Does This Mean for the Vehicle Fleet? It helps to place the EV growth in context. First, let us examine electric vehicles sales as a proportion of all light duty, or personal, vehicle sales, as shown in Table 2. Table 2Sales of All Light Duty Vehicles (million)YearU.S.World20147.765.720157.566.320166.969.520176.170.8 Source: OICAAs you will note, light duty vehicle sales in the United States have declined for the past four years, while global sales have increased. In 2018, there were almost 71 million light duty vehicle sales globally. The following graph, also from OICA, shows how global personal vehicle sales have increased since 2005.  Table 3 compares EV sales to total personal vehicle sales globally and in the U.S.Table 3Plug-In EV Sales as a Share of Total Sales (%)YearUSWorld20141.60.4920151.50.8320162.31.1220173.31.73 So EVs are increasing their percentage share of light duty vehicle sales, but worldwide 98 out of every 100 cars sold is still fueled by oil products. The picture is even more striking if one views it in terms of the total vehicle stock (i.e. all the light duty vehicles now on the roads). There are no authoritative estimates of this, but a 2014 study by Navigant Research estimated the total to be almost 1.2 billion then, and more recent vehicle industry reports project that this total will reach 1.3 billion by 2020. OICA’s published figures only go to 2015, and indicate a stock of 947 million personal vehicles then. Inside EV’s estimates of the total plug-in stock of vehicles is shown in Table 4.Table 4Global Stock of EVs 2014 – 2017 YearVehicles (thousand)2014703.620151,239.420161,982.020173,109.0 If we assume that the total personal vehicle stock is now at least one billion vehicles, then EVs constitute three one-thousandths of the present stock. At present rates of growth, a total EV stock in the range of 7.4 to 13 million EVs in the world by 2020 is not impossible, but the high-end of the range looks like a considerable stretch. If EVs attained that milestone, they would constitute 1.3% of the total personal vehicle fleet. Light Duty Vehicles and World Oil Demand   According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the world’s consumers used 98.2 million barrels of crude oil in 2017. While the number varies depending upon the characteristic of the crude oil, on average somewhere between 50% and 55% of a barrel is used to produce gasoline and diesel fuel for light duty vehicles and trucks. Road vehicles are more than 97% dependent on oil for motive power. Road fuel demand is driven by many factors, including notably the total number of vehicles, the fuel efficiency of the vehicles, the market penetration of alternative fuel vehicles, general economic trends and the price of fuels.            There are important regional differences, with gasoline demand recently falling slightly in OECD countries due to increasingly stringent fuel efficiency regulations affecting new vehicles, some changes in travel patterns (e.g. more young people living in urban centres and going without a car), while demand is rising in developing countries supported by a growing middle class. The projections published by major energy forecasting authorities seem more and more influenced by their perception of the role that governments will play in seeking to “manage” demand. European-based forecasters such as the International Energy Agency, BP and Statoil (now renamed: “Equinor”) take it as given that governments will go beyond regulating fuel efficiency and subsidizing EVs to banning sales of oil-fueled cars by some future date, as already has been announced by some European countries. Others, including the North American-based forecasters, are less convinced that the public will support such restrictions and point to increasing motorization rates. The motorization rate measures the number of registered vehicles (personal and commercial) per 1000 inhabitants of a country. For many decades there has been a large gap between the relatively high motorization rates in the more advanced industrialized countries and in the poorer ones. The United States, for example, had a motorization rate of 821 in 2015, compared to 646 in Canada and 581 in the European Union countries. In contrast, Russia had a motorization rate of 281, South America 176, China 118, Indonesia 87, and India 22. Motorization rates are rising everywhere, but the most significant increases are occurring in the less developed countries. From 2005 to 2015, motorization rates increased by 60 % in Russia, Turkey and other formerly less developed European countries; by 60% in Central and South America; and by 141% in Asia, the Middle East and Oceania. It even increased 35% in Africa. Hundreds of millions of people, wanting the benefits of enhanced mobility, are likely to purchase vehicles in the next few decades and they will seek the most economic options available. Stratas Advisors, a well-respected U.S. consulting firm that analyses refined oil product markets, “does not see demand at serious risk in the medium term given the large as-yet-untapped markets in Africa, Asia and parts of Latin America and the infrastructure still necessary for widespread adoption of electric vehicles”. https://stratasadvisors.com/Insights/100217-Global-Gasoline-Demand-To-Grow The reality is that global oil demand is growing at its fastest rate in history. Over the past decade of 2009 to 2018, global crude oil demand has risen from 84.3 million barrels per day to 99.3 million barrels per day, an average of 1.5 million barrels per day per year. It appears that the world’s consumers are not listening to the pundits and forecasters who foresee a decline. https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/ Conclusion In summary, EV sales continue to grow at a healthy pace from a low starting point and have carved out a niche, especially in markets where governments can afford the large subsidies that underpin sales. The pace of future sales growth remains uncertain. Continuation, or even acceleration, of current trends, however, seems unlikely to increase the size of the total EV stock to the 13 million figure globally by 2020. While impressive, this will remain a small part of the total vehicle stock, and seems likely to have little impact on the growth of oil demand, or global carbon emissions, for some years to come.~~~~Related:  A Tale Told By the Numbers, Dec. 2016Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'decarbonization', 'electric vehicles']",2018/08/28

World Energy Use Summarized," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior to that.In June, 2018 British Petroleum (BP) published its absolutely invaluable annual statistical review of world energy. As has been its practice for a few years, BP introduced the document by describing market developments in terms of whether they are good or bad for “the transition”.  The transition in question is the alleged conversion of the world’s energy economy from one dominated by fossil fuels to one in which renewable energy plays the larger role.The numbers presented in the report show that an entirely different kind of transition is underway than that advocated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations. As has been the case for many years, oil, natural gas and coal continue to dominate energy production and consumption, and the fastest growing energy source is natural gas.The numbers I find especially interesting, however, are the ones presented on carbon dioxide emissions. Global emissions grew in 2017 by 1.6%, a trend that will not produce smiles in Brussels. I dug down a bit to see the percentage changes in emissions by country from 2010 to 2017. A list follows:United States  – down 7.6%Canada – up 6.5%Germany – down 2.1%United Kingdom – down 24.8%Japan – down 0.4%China – up 13.9%India – up 41%OECD – down 4.0%Non-OECD – up 16.0%World – up 7.6%So the British are the only ones “transitioning” in the direction to which BP refers. The U.K., however, constitutes just over 1% of global emissions.The Americans, despite all the invective thrown their way, are one of the leaders in emissions reduction.Canada, negating all the claims of our Liberal Government, continues to go in precisely the opposite direction that the government claims it must.China, which now constitutes 28% of global emissions, continues its rapid growth, with India striving mightily to surpass it.The Non-OECD region increased emissions by 2892 megatonnes from 2010 to 2017, while the OECD emissions declined by 523 megatonnes.The United Nations goal set at COP21 and elsewhere is that global emissions decline to around 15 gigatonnes by 2050; the 2017 total stood at 33.4 gigatonnes and rising. I wonder how long these trends must continue before the nature of the public dialogue changes.The BP report can be read here:https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'decarbonization', 'renewables']",2018/08/26
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/08/18/political-risk-and-the-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion/,Trevor Marr ,POLITICAL RISK AND THE TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE EXPANSION," A new report contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018, Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant, who also spent 10 years as a diplomat.POLITICAL RISK AND THE TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE EXPANSIONPERCEPTIONS AND FACTSSummaryThe U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) recently issued a statement that was picked up and repeated in various media in Canada, including the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The statement warned that the U.S. Administration must approve the sale to the government of Canada of the U.S. assets of the Trans Mountain Pipeline system now owned by the Kinder Morgan Corporation and that approval was “not a foregone conclusion”. What was not reported is that the IEEFA is, in fact, an environmental organization funded largely by foundations such as the Rockefellers Brothers Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlitt Foundation. Through her extensive research of U.S. tax records, Vivian Krause has shown these foundations to be major funders of the “Tar Sands Campaign”. The goals of this campaign since the 1990’s have been to stop expansion of the Canadian oil industry, to reduce demand for oil sands crude oil in the U.S. and to stop or stall pipeline and port construction. The apparent objective of the IEEFA statement was to increase the political risk associated with the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project – to undermine investor and public confidence that the Canadian government’s purchase will proceed and that the project will be built. In fact, there are two approvals that may apply to the U.S. portion of the Trans Mountain System – the Puget Sound pipeline that transports crude oil from the Canada-U.S. border to the refineries in the state of Washington. The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) must approve the sale based on a review of its effects on U.S. national security. A Presidential permit of the same kind that is usually required for the construction of a new cross-border pipeline may also be required. The CFIUS is an inter-agency review process led by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that serves the President in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment, and especially the acquisition of foreign control of companies in the U.S. economy. The processes of review, investigation and decision are subject to statutory time limits of up to 90 days in total. CFIUS operates under defined terms of what constitutes “national security” and its procedures entail many internal checks along the way to ensure that it adheres to these terms. In fact, since CFIUS was established in 1975, U.S. Presidents have disallowed only four foreign acquisitions. The requirement to undergo this review is not a likely threat to the Canadian acquisition. Presidential permits are required for the construction of major new cross-border oil pipelines. There are administered by the Department of State which, like the President, has significant discretion in terms of how it assesses projects according to the United States “national interest”. An Interpretive Guidance document issued by the Department of State in 2007 stated that a “change in ownership of a border crossing that is not encompassed within or provided for under an applicable Presidential permit” requires formal “notification” but left it unclear as to whether it would require issuance of a Presidential permit. This appears to be up to the discretion of the State Department and the U.S. President. If, in fact, a presidential permit was required based on a review of the national interests involved, it would be made clear that the existing Trans Mountain pipeline system now transports crude oil that is used by refineries not just in British Columbia but also by those in Washington State to meet the needs of consumers in the Pacific Northwest. Crude oil delivered by the pipeline to the Westridge Terminal is also loaded on to tankers and shipped to export markets, now mainly in California. Much of the additional exports from Canada’s west coast ports will go to California or other parts of PADD 5 rather than Asia. As PADD 5’s existing crude oil supply from Alaska is steadily declining, the additional crude oil from Canada would both increase the region’s security of supply and increase competition in refined product markets, thus benefiting American consumers.For the United States, these are genuine, not speculative, national interest considerations.LINK to Political Risks and Trans Mountain 2 FormattedShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Tar Sands Campaign', 'TransMountain']",2018/08/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/08/14/the-opportunity-that-isnt-knocking/,Kevin T Casey (@Brillopad4Casey) ,The Opportunity That Isn’t Knocking," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years. He was a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.Catherine McKenna, Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, recently said that, if Canada does not impose carbon taxes and proceed with the Liberals climate change plan, it would be missing a “trillion dollar opportunity”. She claimed that there was an enormous global market for non-fossil fuel energy and that accelerating the development and commercialization of Canadian based non-fossil fuel energy services will position industry here to lead in supplying these services internationally. Her implicit thesis was that supplying these renewable energy resources and services will exceed Canada’s current competitive advantages in supplying fossil-fuel-based energy sources.Well, certainly. I mean, today I had a meeting with my provincial counterpart, and it was really disappointing to see that they don’t have a climate plan. And if you don’t have a climate plan, you don’t have a plan for your economy, because we know that there is a trillion-dollar economic opportunity.  CBC Radio, July 19, 2018  Full TranscriptTo use the official parlance of government in Ottawa, the Minister is misinformed. The purpose of this paper is, as briefly but effectively as possible, to demonstrate why. Renewable Energy Does Not Dominate Global Energy MarketsTo understand what is happening in global energy markets, let us first recall the dominant trends over the past fifty years. According to the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy published in 2017, global energy consumption has doubled since 1971, rising from 4,661 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoes) in 1971 to 9,425 Mtoes in 2014. This growth was almost constant, with only three relatively brief periods (1973-75, 1980-84, and 2007-09), corresponding to recessions, when growth stalled. The global energy mix changed considerably over the period, with the share of oil declining from about 48% of the global total in 1974 to 34% by 2016; nonetheless, oil continues to be the largest sources of energy in the world. The share held by coal has gone up and down around 30% over the period but has remained in second place among fuels, and now stands at 28%. Natural gas’s share has steadily increased, despite the fact that until recently there was only limited transportation of gas in liquid form by tanker. Gas now holds about 25% of global demand. Hydroelectricity has held its share in the range of 6% to 8%. Nuclear energy rose from next to nothing to about 7% but recently has declined to 5%. Renewables, as represented mainly by wind and solar energy, have risen from next to nothing before 2000 to about 3% in 2016. In short, after half a century of evolution in global energy markets, fossil fuels continue to constitute 87% of global energy needs.The Pattern of Energy Consumption by Countries and RegionsRenewable energy does not dominate energy use in any single geographic area or country. Table 1, drawn from data in the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017, shows this.TABLE 1               Energy Consumption by Leading Regions and Countries, 2016 Country/RegionFossil FuelsHydro/NuclearRenewablesTotal (Mtoe)China87%11%3%3,053USA85%11%4%2,273European Union75%17%8%1,642Middle East99%1%0%895India93%5%2%724Latin America73%22%4%705Russia87%13%0%674Japan91%5%4%445Africa92%7%1%440World86%11%3%13,276 This table shows three things that are not generally known or highlighted in the media: China is already by far the world’s largest energy consumer, with 34% higher consumption than the United States;With the exception of the European Union and Latin America, all the major regions of the world rely on fossil fuels for more than 85% of their energy consumption. Europe and Latin America rely disproportionately on nuclear and/or hydroelectricityEurope, and Europe alone, has made a significant commitment to renewables, and there it supplies only 8% of consumption after trillions of dollars in investment. Minister McKenna may be mesmerized by developments in Europe, but Europe is not the world. In fact, the European Union represents only 12% of the world energy consumption, and virtually all the growth is occurring elsewhere. Renewable Energy Will Not Dominate Global Energy Use for the Foreseeable Future Proponents of renewable energy point to recent capital investment in it as evidence that its use will grow rapidly in future. This, they say, contrasts with the recent decline in oil and gas investment due to lower commodity prices from 2014 to 2016. According to Bloomberg Energy Finance, an optimistic source of news about renewable energy, global new investment in renewable energy rose from $181.4 billion in 2008 to $279.8 billion in 2017. In fact, while investment rose dramatically in the period 2002 to 2010, it followed a volatile pattern, rising sharply some years and falling in others, and has been close to $280 billion per annum for the past eight years. See Table 2:TABLE 2            Global New Investment in Renewable Energy 2008-2017 ($Billion)YearInvestmentGrowth Rate (%)2008181.4142009176.3-22010243.6372011287,8182012255.5-112013234.4-82014284.3212015323.4142016274.0-152017279.82Source: Bloomberg Energy Finance: Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2018To place this in context, according to the International Energy Agency report entitled World Energy Investment 2017, total worldwide energy investment was around $1.7 trillion in 2016, of which investment in upstream oil and gas represented about $700 billion (after falling 40% from 2014). In other words, even at depressed levels, global investment in upstream oil and gas far exceeds that in renewables. The most authoritative sources of analysis and projections of global energy supply and demand base their work on extensive studies of trends in population and economic growth, technology innovation and commercialization, and other macro-economic factors. These include the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), EXXON/Mobil and British Petroleum (BP). I will use BP’s projections for two reasons. First, of all the major forecasters, BP is the most willing to share the results of its analysis and data for free and in a form that allows clear comparisons of past and present trends. Second, BP’s projections to 2035 are the most “favourable” to renewables. The following graphs show the future trends in comparison to the previously described past trends.In summary: Total energy demand will continue to rise significantly throughout the period to 2035.Oil, coal and natural gas will continue to dominate the energy mixThe share held by renewables will grow but by 2035 will still only reach 10% of global energy demand; this will be almost entirely in the electricity generation sector. To repeat, this is the most favourable outlook for renewables in any of the authoritative energy forecasting organizations. All the others show renewables holding a smaller share of global demand in 2035. No authority projects renewables to constitute even 20% of global energy demand, let alone 100%, in the period to 2050. The German Experience shows that Renewable Energy is a Bad Investment for Western Economies No country has spent more on wind and solar energy generation as a proportion of its total spending than Germany. In 2012, over 7000 megawatts of new solar power capacity were added. However, in that year, the boom ended abruptly as new laws on feed-in-tariffs were enacted in order to keep the solar energy supply from becoming so high that it would pose serious problems in balancing the variations between electricity demand and intermittent electricity supply. In 2017, only 600 megawatts were added. That’s a 90% drop in five years. The drop in investment was the direct result of cutbacks in consumer subsidies. Feed-in-tariff rates fell from 49.2 euro-cents (about 56 cents Canadian) per kilowatt-hour in 2007 to 12.7 euro-cents (about 18 cents Canadian) in 2016. While 19.5 billion euros (CDN $27.3 billion) were invested in solar energy system in 2010, only 1.58 billion euros (CDN $2.2 billion) were invested in 2016. The Germans, like Minister McKenna, thought solar would be a boom for the economy. Instead, the number of jobs in the solar industry went on a roller coaster, rising from 38,600 in 2007 to 110,900 in 2011 and then dropping to 31,600 in 2015. 80,000 people who thought renewables offered a bright green future instead lost their jobs. There are many other disadvantages of wind and solar energy. I described the financial ones in my previous article entitled, “Renewable and Conventional Energy Generation – Comparing the Costs”. I described the adverse net effects of renewable energy on employment (i.e. due to the higher costs imposed on industry) in my previous article entitled, “Green Jobs – Rhetoric or Reality?” COP21 is not working Minister McKenna’s belief that the world economy is changing to a decarbonized one is based, in part, on her support for the Agreement reach a the 21st Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December, 2015 (COP21). Yet, there are already three significant nails in the coffin of that agreement. The first was hammered on the day the agreement was reached, in its provisions governing the actions that the participating governments would take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement contains very few binding legal requirements, there are no formulas for determining what each country’s obligations are, and there are no penalties for non-compliance. Rather, it represents a best-efforts political agreement to keep the level of global GHG emissions below that which, in theory, might produce a two degree Celsius increase in average global temperatures. So, no one knows how much emissions would have to be reduced, and the countries did not agree on individual targets. The COP21 agreement reaffirmed a previous international commitment that countries with more financial resources (identified as the Annex II countries) must provide payments to a Green Climate Fund to assist developing countries in implementing the Convention. The Green Climate Fund will be scaled up to U.S. $100 billion per year by 2020. Each developed country must submit biennial reports on its strategies for doing this. Sometime before 2025, the Parties will set a new collective goal above the U.S. $100 billion a year level. The developing countries made clear during the negotiations that their actions to reduce emissions would be contingent on the Annex II countries meeting their commitments to Green Climate Fund. At COP23, held in Bonn in November 2017, the parties announced the establishment of a number of multilateral funding mechanisms. It was clear, however, that Annex II countries are nowhere close to making contributions of the size required to meet the $100 billion per year commitment. (Canada’s proportional share of that goal would be over $3 billion per year.) Therefore, it is only a matter of a few years before the developing countries drop all pretenses of following their emission reduction plans. As over 90% of the global emissions growth is occurring in the developing countries, the COP21 goals cannot possibly be met. The second nail has been driven by global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission trends. In 1990, according to the U.S. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, global emissions were 22.3 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent. In 2014, emissions were 36.1 Gt. In other words, emissions grew by 62% over the 24-year period. Almost all of this growth occurred in the less developed countries, and especially in Asia. The same point can be illustrated using BP data to show global trends in terms of billion tonnes of oil equivalent (Gtoe). In 1990, global fossil fuel use was 7 Gtoe. It rose to 8 Gtoe in 2000, 10 Gtoe in 2010 and reached 11.4 Gtoe in 2015. In 25 of the 26 years from 1990 to 2016, humanity burned more fossil fuels than the year before. The fossil fuel share of global energy use in 1990 was 88%. In 2015, after two and a half decades of repeated governmental agreements to reduce emissions and trillions of dollars in expenditure on renewable energy and “conservation” programs, the fossil fuel share declined to 86%. It is declining at the rate of one per cent per decade. The third nail was the decision by the Trump Administration in the United States to withdraw from the COP21 Agreement. That decision removed the second largest emitter, and arguably the largest single source of funding for programs that seek to aid emissions reduction in the developing countries. Equally important, it signaled that the United States was not prepared to impose the handicap of expensive emission reduction measures on its industry and general economy, and thereby raised the importance of trade and competitiveness considerations for all other developed countries. There may be many who, because of their personal dislike for President Trump, will see the U.S. lack of enthusiasm for the COP21 agreement as a temporary situation that will change with the U.S. electoral cycle. The polls suggest otherwise. The Gallop organization conducted a poll in July 2018 in which it asked respondents to identify the biggest problem currently facing the United States. Immigration topped the list with 22% of the respondents mentioning it. “Environment/Pollution” was mentioned by two per cent. Not one respondent mentioned “climate change”. While public opinion changes over time, this does not suggest that any future U.S. Administration will have a strong political incentive to support large-scale and expensive emissions reductions. ConclusionGlobal markets for energy will continue for the foreseeable future to be dominated by oil, natural gas and coal, not renewable energy. The market for renewable energy has grown because of immense investments subsidized or imposed by governments. As the failure of the COP21 agreement becomes clearer and public opposition grows, the incentive for such expenditures should decline. Renewable energy represents an opportunity that isn’t knocking.~~~~  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'green climate fund', 'renewables']",2018/08/14

Cette chaleur sèche tarit un grand nombre de ruisseaux que personne n’avait jamais vus à sec, compromit les prés et les semailles printanières, Dans le Midi, les vents du sud, vents chauds, humides et étouffants, se prolongèrent en Provence jusqu’à la fin de l’année. Au midi comme au nord, la chaleur et la sécheresse de 1811 épuisèrent la plupart des sources, desséchèrent les torrents et les fleuves. Les années 1812 à 1818 voient se succéder des périodes de sécheresse catastrophiques sur le bassin méditerranéen.Anno 1815 : Nouveau printemps sec en Alsace.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/07/23/carbon-dioxide-is-a-pollutant/,wkblair ,Carbon Dioxide is a Pollutant?," Contributed by Lindsay Howell ©2018According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “pollutant” is defined as a substance that contaminates an environment. Going further, the definition of “contaminate” is to make said environment unfit for use by the introduction of unwholesome or undesirable elements. So, the question becomes, is CO2 an unwholesome and undesirable molecule that renders our atmosphere “unfit for use”?When I hear the term “CO2 pollution”, I think of the equation for photosynthesis. For billions of years, the vast majority of Earth’s plant life has been completely dependent on CO2. If it weren’t for plants’ amazing ability to create sugars based on this equation, we oxygen-breathers would simply not exist. It strikes me that CO2 is not a contaminant, but rather a desirable molecule that makes our atmosphere “fit for use”.For billions of years, the dominant gases in the atmosphere were N2, CO2, NH3 and CH4. Photosynthesis first appeared ~ 3.5 B years ago, and atmospheric O2 was practically nonexistent until ~ 2.4 B years back. At this point in time, the Great Oxygenation Event occurred, which resulted in one of the most significant mass extinctions in Earth’s history. Though it has become essential to life on our planet, oxygen imposes oxidative stress on all animals, slowly “rusting” them from the inside out. Based on these facts, one could facetiously label O2 as an environmental “pollutant”.Image retrieved from http://elte.prompt.hu/sites/default/files/tananyagok/AtmosphericChemistry/ch01.htmlToday’s atmosphere may be considered “carbon-starved” as the CO2 concentration is currently at a relatively low 400 ppm. This is not an ideal concentration for plant growth, as photosynthesis typically shuts down at 200 to 150 ppm. Compare this to the fact that atmospheric CO2 concentration has ranged much higher in Earth’s history (e.g. over 300,000 ppm when life first appeared, 7,000 ppm 500 M years ago, 1,000 – 2,000 ppm 240 – 65 M years ago). During these periods, life has managed to flourish and evolve into countless species. Studies have confirmed that higher CO2 concentrations lead to increased plant growth, which is supported by the stoichiometry of the photosynthesis process. Consider the monstrous, expansive forests that existed during the time of the dinosaurs, for instance.Recent investigations have determined that increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations have benefited the terrestrial biosphere. Deserts are shrinking, forests are expanding and crop yields are reaching new records. A recent article in Nature Climate Change, summarized by NASA, reports a significant increase in the leaf area (a.k.a. “greening”) of Earth’s vegetation over the past 35 years. This change is largely attributed to increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. A blog post by the esteemed Dr. Judith Curry further explores the topic.Below is a fascinating time-lapse video that documents the effect of elevated CO2 concentration on the growth of a cowpea plant. For peer-reviewed scientific studies that report the growth responses of plants to atmospheric CO2 enrichment, CO2 Science is one place to start.In the field of biology, toxicity is determined by the dose size of the substance in question. For CO2 to be considered toxic to most forms of oxygen-breathing life, the concentration would need to be 60,000 ppm, or 150 times higher than today’s concentration.  It has been billions of years since Earth’s atmosphere contained a similar concentration. And throughout history the Earth has demonstrated a tremendous capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2 in its crust, oceans, and biomass. Considering all this, I reckon we will be safe for a long, long time.Meanwhile, we should be celebrating CO2 as a gas of life.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon dioxide', 'climate change', 'NASA']",2018/07/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/07/20/remarks-on-the-meeting-of-trump-and-putin/,William Kay ,Remarks on the meeting of Trump and Putin," Original text published in French in “Contrepoints” 18 Juillet 2018. English translation by the author.Note: Friends of Science Society is in agreement with the Trump administration’s common sense view on climate and energy policies, particularly the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Consequently, in the interest of continued public debate, we are pleased to present this viewpoint from Drieu Godefridi. Mr. Godefridi is a Belgian philosopher, jurist, and author of “The IPCC: A Scientific Body?” and “La Révolution Trump.” Remarks on the meeting of Trump and Putinby Drieu Godefridi © 2018Given the media mayhem this meeting is causing, it is perhaps somewhat worthwhile trying to contextualize it.Let’s start by reading this statement from the US presidency: “The joint communiqué which we have issued today summarizes the result of our talks. (…) what we have said in that communiqué is not nearly as important as what we will do in the years ahead to build a bridge across 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostility which have divided us in the past. What we have said today is that we shall build that bridge.”These words are not from Trump but from Nixon, just after he met the dictator and tyrant Mao-Zedong, in 1972 , in what is now hailed as the greatest stroke of genius of that particular American President. A strike which restructured the interplay of the superpowers of the time. Was Mao less tyrannical or less bloodthirsty than Putin? Mao presided over, among other abominations, the “Great Leap Forward”, a ferocious fantasy that sacrificed tens of millions of Chinese men, women and children on the altar of communist egalitarianism. In comparison, Putin is a small time player. Did Nixon make less concessions than Trump? Nixon, in a nutshell, abandoned Taiwan to her fate, and recognized the unity of China. In other words, Nixon and Kissinger gave the Chinese exactly what they wanted, because they thought it would buy China’s departure from the Soviet sphere.Let’s get to the bottom of things: what do we want? What do President Trump’s critics propose? That we treat Russia as the perpetual enemy of the West, let the fires and counter-fires of this age-old conflict burn in every corner of the globe until, ultimately, a real war flares up? Is this what we want? When Obama engaged US forces in Syria, he was both weak and irresponsible. Weak, because he drew a “red line” – the use of chemical weapons – which the Syrian regime could transgress without consequence. Irresponsible, because it created, with the anarchic Turkish, Iranian, Russian, European and American interventions, plus the support given to the ‘rebels’ directly affiliated to the Islamists, a crucible from which anything could arise, including a direct and open armed conflict between NATO and Russia. We were very close to such a conflict – open war between Russia and NATO – when the Turkish regime, a member of NATO, shot down a Russian plane (thankfully the Russian regime demonstrated the ability to refrain from a knee-jerk reaction).Let’s not forget that Russia has as many nuclear warheads as the United States, an arsenal they refrained from using throughout the Cold War. A nuclear conflict between Russia and the United States would instantly plunge the whole of humanity into a night from which it would probably never emerge. From the point of view of the management of this nuclear reserve, the fact that the Russians and Americans talk to each other and negotiate is not a problem, but an absolute and constant imperative.What strange conception of diplomacy is it that one should only meet friends? Trump is denounced for simply meeting, shaking hands and smiling for the media. (We would appreciate it if the press were to be as critical when the high and mighty of Europe humiliate themselves in hijab before the Tehran regime!) Is diplomacy a gentlemen’s club? Dedicated to the game of Bridge perhaps? It is a fundamental principle in business, as well as in the “realistic” conception of diplomacy, that one often gains more by meeting adversaries than friends.And then there is the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. This interference is proven; the agreement on this matter is now ‘bi-partisan’. However, as the Special Counsel and the United States Department of Justice themselves admit, there is at present no material evidence of a collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign team; and no evidence that this interference had even the slightest influence on the result (that is to say, the considerable victory of Trump in the electoral college).This modest interference must be compared with the far-reaching interventions of Americans in dozens of countries and hundreds of electoral processes since 1945. There are Russian spies in the United States? Big deal! So there are no US agents in Russia? Espionage is confined by national borders?Certainly, in an ideal world, there would be no such interference. In our less than ideal world, they must be brought to light and tackled. An endeavour for which US intelligence, which has the astronomical budget of seventy billion dollars per year, indeed has the means.When I published “The Trump Revolution” last January, I sensed that this presidency would be ‘architectonic’, structuring the American future and therefore that of the West. North Korea, Iran, China, Russia: it is too early to discern what will be the world of tomorrow. What is certain is that it will be very different from the one we know, more realistic and less European, and that if the Europeans refuse to assert their power, they will be marginalized.Dernières parutions “La révolution Trump”, https://www.amazon.fr/révolution-Trump-Texquis-essais-ebook/dp/B078SPDDNN/  — “Le libéralisme est-il conciliable avec le conservatisme ?”, Arguments — Revue européenne de science, vol. 2, n°3, automne 2017, http://revue-arguments.com/articles/index.php?id=83~~~~Read our new brief:CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES AND CARBON TAXES – A Brief for the Prime Minister of CanadaShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Putin', 'Trump']",2018/07/20
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/07/18/climate-change-policies-and-carbon-taxes-a-brief-for-the-prime-minister-of-canada/,Dave Hassan ,CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES AND CARBON TAXES – A Brief for the Prime Minister of Canada," Climate Change Policies and Carbon TaxesScientific and Economic Evidence as Related to Canadian Domestic and International Policy Concerns   July 18, 2018PDF: lt to PM justin Trudeau july 18 2018 FINALWe would like to express our concerns at the present state of affairs in Canada concerning climate change policies and carbon taxes, and NAFTA.Climate Science – Humans affect climate in many ways, and you have always stated your government would rely on a science-based approach to policy. Natural climate change caused the ice age cycles and it likely accounts for much of the global temperature rise since 1910 (temperatures were falling for 30 years prior to that). Low CO2 levels caused temperatures to rise at the end of the last ice age (Ellis 2015) . Part of the temperature rise of the 20th century was due to the natural recovery from the Little Ice Age caused by long-term ocean cycles and direct and indirect solar forcings. Indirect solar effects include the magnetic field effects which changes cloud cover and changing ozone in the high atmosphere. The sun’s activity has increased over the last 90 years so that by 1992 it was more intense than at anytime in the last 3000 years. (Usoskin et al 2014). Numerous recent studies demonstrate that it is solar cycles, which in turn affect ocean cycles that are the dominant forces in climate change. Dozens of peer-reviewed studies have found a very high degree of correlation (0.5 to 0.8) between solar-magnetic activity and global temperature going back many thousands of years (Examples;  Usoskin 2005, Soon et al 2015, Yamakawa et al 2016 , Adolphi et al 2014, Ahlbeck 2010, Soon Legates 2013, Patterson 2013,  Moffa-Sánchez 2014, Leal-Silva Herrerab 2012, Solheim et al 2012, Bond et al 2001, Neff et al 2001 , Shaviv Veizer et al 2003.) These are key reports upon which the United States has based current climate policies.Dr. John Christy has testified to the US Senate that IPCC results show climate model atmospheric temperature trends with greenhouse gases completely fail to match the measurements in the tropics, but model trends without greenhouse gases best match the measurements.[1] In the tropical bulk atmosphere, the climate model trend is 2.6 times the observations[2]. This is strong evidence that greenhouse gas emissions are not the major cause of climate change. The IPCC has failed to consider natural climate change and has misallocated natural climate change effects to greenhouse gases.Dr. Judith Curry has testified to the US Senate that the IPCC report of 2013 showed that the theory of human-caused global warming due to carbon dioxide was weakened, carbon dioxide emissions was not the control knob on climate and claims that human emissions drove extreme weather causation not supported by the evidence.[3]Dr. Hans von Storch, the German climate scientist who first identified human influence on climate change has stated that “I am not scared,” that there is no climate crisis, and that climate change is just one of many factors to be addressed by society, not the most pressing one.In 2005, climate scientists saw that that radiative forcing (GHG) metric was inadequate to explain climate observations[4] illustrating that climate is more complex than a single small factor.  While the science community was questioning the value of the GHG metric (which underlies the justification for carbon dioxide/GHG targets/reduction/carbon pricing or cap and trade) climate change was vaulted into a public conversation. Foreign influence – In 2006, a group of billionaire foundations embarked on a plan to cause a global sea change in the economy of the world, by instituting cap and trade systems,[5] assisted by a $42.4 million consulting contract with the firm McKinsey.[6] The method of operation was to fund local Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (ENGOs) to effect changes to local policies.[7] Canada has seen the destructive effects of this foreign intrusion in the form of the environmental groups shredding of the reputation of Alberta’s oil sands, attacks on pipeline projects, tanker blockades, demands for coal phase-out along with the promotion of ineffective, weather-dependent wind and solar as alternatives to coal, and demands for even more stringent environmental regulations that make Canada a ‘hostile’ place to invest.[8] Economics – Canada benefits from both greenhouse gas induced warming through the CO2 fertilization effect on crops and forests. CO2 is plant food. The FUND (Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution)[9] integrated assessment model that calculates the economic impact of climate change. It estimates that Canadian’s agriculture sector alone will benefit from greenhouse gas emissions by CDN $14 billion per year by 2050.[10] The beneficial economic impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on Canada continually increase throughout the 21st[11] Societal Priorities – Bjorn Lomborg has found that climate change is only a priority for UN bureaucrats; in his survey of the world, almost everything BUT climate change is a priority for ordinary people. As we even see in this Abacus Data survey of April 2018, the last item on the list of priorities for Canadians is climate change.[12] Carbon taxes/cap and trade and economics – To be a competitive nation, we must work in concert with our trading partners. Our largest trading partner is the United States.[13] The United States of America has abandoned the Paris Agreement, in large part because it would have extorted money from the US with little or no reciprocal action on climate change by any other nation and would have rendered the US uncompetitive.[14] It is absurd to think that the Paris Agreement’s proposed $100 billion Green Climate Fund would have allowed wealthy Saudi Arabia to apply for funding, while bankrupt Greece would have had to contribute.[15] Therefore, it is not in Canada’s interests to adopt carbon taxes or cap and trade as these are uneconomic and do nothing to prevent or reduce climate change. The disparity of policies between the US and Canada on climate change, create significant trade barriers between Canada and the US. Bjorn Lomborg has calculated that if all countries meet the Paris Agreement targets by 2030, the reduction in warming would be only 0.05 degrees C by 2100. However, it is unlikely any will meet such targets.It is impossible for Canada to reach the Paris Agreement GHG reduction targets without shutting down all major industries in Canada. This would be contrary to the purpose of Confederation and contrary to basic principles of the UN Charter itself which is dedicated to socio-economic improvement. (Article 55[16]) No Canadian elected a government to destroy the country. Canada faces extremes of weather and temperature, vast distances and costly infrastructure, unlike any other country but Russia.NAFTA – We are concerned that the NAFTA agreement is being circumvented by the fact that in February, France bluntly told the USA it will block their trade options with the EU.[17] We are concerned that after they said that to our largest trading partner, Canada went to France in the midst of NAFTA negotiations and signed a climate and culture agreement with France.[18] As early as 2017 it was reported that Canada was trying to insert the Paris Agreement into NAFTA.[19]  This cannot be seen as dealing in good faith, sir. Furthermore, in terms of our own nation, it appears that the federal government is favoring the interests of certain major corporations like Bombardier, McCain, and others (as reported on the Finance Canada website),[20] which have headquarters in France and which may now be compromised by France’s unilateral adoption of a 2-degree Celsius rule for all its investees and institutional investors worldwide.[21]  While Quebec and Ontario most benefit from trade with France, we have a whole country to consider.[22] As we understand it, such unilateral measures by France are contrary to World Trade Organization principles. These appear to be coercive tactics designed to isolate the United States of America, and we believe the federal government’s actions, which seem to be protectionist of large Eastern Canadian corporate interests but detrimental to those of Western Canada, are contrary to Canada’s best interests. As we have pointed out, in view of current science, a 2-degree C objective is not in keeping with scientific evidence; reducing human carbon dioxide emissions will not reach climate objectives of changing or controlling earth’s global temperature. The European Union is facing many tests in terms of unity, internal politics, addressing migration issues, and the collapse of the renewables industry due to burdensome subsidies.  We cannot see any justification for continuing down the climate fiasco path of the EU.  Nor does the EU seem a more stable bet as trade partner than that of our longest standing, best ally, the United States, a country with which we share very similar values, cultures, language, business dealings, real estate properties and overall investments.While it is true that Canada also plays a key role in ‘la francophonie’ [23]– holding 4 positions in this a collection of some 84 countries with 54 full members, 26 observer nations, and 4 associates – these countries are geographically far flung from Canada, culturally and linguistically diverse (excepting a common Francophone link) and some, like Qatar, are direct competitors for LNG markets. Material change – In investment circles, when there is a material change in circumstances, such as evidence that human industrial greenhouse gas emissions are ‘not the control knob that can fine tune climate’ corporations are required to advise shareholders of such uncertainties. This in fact means, for Canada, that our oil, gas and coal do not represent a carbon risk of any significance, nor do our industrial emissions.  This is good news.  Approved pipelines and resource development projects can now proceed without further delay.  Environmental charities/ENGOs which have been raising funds based on the presumed climate crisis must stop. Many have been funded from offshore by the ClimateWorks group which is trying to foist global cap and trade systems on the world economy. [24] [25] it is against Canada Revenue Agency rules to raise funds that are based on false information or to raise funds for activities that harm the public benefit. [26] [27] Charities promoting a ‘climate crisis’ have intentionally incited the public against oil, gas and coal industries when these are our major economic drivers, providing the greatest net public benefit. With this good news before us, the recent additional environmental regulations can be repealed, and Canada’s good name can be restored, rather than being identified as a country that is ‘hostile’ to investment.[28] Sovereign government to sovereign government – We note that in recent months, Canadian federal officials have separately negotiated directly with US state and city officials promoting the Paris Agreement; indeed, the Mayor of Edmonton has been travelling US this past month rallying support and signatures for his “Edmonton Declaration” on climate, from various big city mayors in the United States.[29] If this was an innocuous document about cultural or sport exchange, as many cities have done in ‘twinning’ themselves (for instance) it would be one thing. But this appears to be a form of foreign interference in the federal policies of the United States, conducted by a Canadian municipal government official, like those actions of other Canadian government officials dealing with “#ImStillIn” US states and cities.[30] These actions deliberately contravene US national policy. How can we be seen to be negotiating in good faith on NAFTA, or anything, when this is going on? G7-Integrity – In 2017 the G7 adopted these principles: “We acknowledge that a public integrity system that promotes a culture of integrity across the public sector at large is a major requirement in combatting corruption. Leveraging our common values and high standards, we resolve to play a leading role in advocating, at home and abroad, for a culture of public integrity that ensures a proper use of public resources, accountability as well as effective multi-stakeholder initiatives. Preventing corruption and promoting integrity can help shape a more efficient public sector with respect to the allocation and management of financial and human resources, delivery of quality services and the creation of job opportunities, thus contributing also to the reduction of social inequalities. Integrity-based policies to prevent corruption can also improve the public governance system and induce renewed public confidence in government, notably in institutions performing the state’s core administrative and regulatory functions, as well as encourage democratic participation. Strengthening public integrity is also a key issue for the business environment and for sustainable development….. We will promote, in our own systems and through our engagement with other Countries, values of integrity, openness and fairness in order to continue preventing corruption and malfeasance in the public sector…” [31] In the recent events concerning public discussion over the proposed federal carbon tax or provincial equivalents, it does not appear that your government has upheld these principles. Likewise, at the G7 meeting, we find that numerous large institutional investors[32] were represented, but who was there to represent the interests of small, medium-sized and domestic corporations, their customers and the taxpayers? According to the UNPRI’s 2016 Annual Report, institutional investors have been directed to become activist investors, driven by the signing of the UNPRI’s 2014 “Montreal Pledge” to influence corporations and governments to instigate policies to meet the 2-degree Celsius objective of GHG reduction. One example is how NEI Investments affected Alberta’s climate policies.[33] As we have indicated, this 2-degree C objective is not supported by the scientific evidence.  We question the 2015 suggestion by pension fund advocates that ‘climate change denial is not an option.’[34] We do not see that any other business representatives were party to the G7, such as chambers of commerce.  If transnational institutional investors, which are signatory to the transnational, unelected, unaccountable activist United Nations Principles for Responsible investment participate at such events, where they are directing global policies that affect all businesses, then surely there should be representation from business organizations that are elected and accountable to domestic small, medium and large business interests. Institutional investors, like those of the G7 investors group, have vested interests in wind and solar, the premise for which rests upon the claim that wind and solar address climate change. Research shows that wind and solar do not reduce costs nor do they address climate change. Once beyond a small penetration on the grid, wind and solar increase carbon dioxide emissions and they do not achieve the claimed objective.  Since carbon dioxide is not the control knob on climate, these measures are not effective to address climate change or energy needs of modern society. As weather-dependent forms of kinetic capture of energy, wind and solar also require very expensive back-end infrastructure. Canadians are subsidizing wind and solar investors to the detriment of the public purse and the reliability of the power grid.[35] This must stop. Set S.M.A.R.T. goals to address measurable mitigations of human industrial impacts[36] Current climate science evidence shows us that carbon dioxide is not the main driver of recent climate change, and that human impacts on climate are more related to:Urban heat island effectsLand use/water diversion/deforestationUnmitigated noxious pollutants and related aerosolsLack of waste water managementDesertification or degradation of 40% of the world’s arable lands All of these items can be addressed by applying ‘climate’ funds to measurable projects in Canada and around the world. The first priority must be the provision of clean water to First Nations and proper sewage treatment plants for major Canadian cities like Montreal and Victoria. Thus, we call upon you to abandon the Paris Agreement and return to the bargaining table in good faith with President Trump and his administration. Respectfully, Friends of Science Society [1] https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-115-SY-WState-JChristy-20170329.pdf[2] Average of weather balloons, satellites and reanalysis data, 1979 to 2015, Dr. John Christy.[3] https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/curry-senatetestimony-2014-final.pdf[4] https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11175/radiative-forcing-of-climate-change-expanding-the-concept-and-addressing[5] http://climateshiftproject.org/nisbet-m-c-2014-engaging-in-science-policy-controversies-insights-from-the-u-s-debate-over-climate-change-handbook-of-the-public-communication-of-science-and-technology-2nd-edition-london-r/[6] Of the US$57 million spent on consultants between 2008 and 2012, 87 percent were program related.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/07/17/uprooting-the-david-suzuki-fund-corporate-connections/,Warren Blair ,Uprooting the David Suzuki Fund Corporate Connections," Opinion by Michelle Stirling ©2018Michelle Stirling is Communications Manager for Friends of Science SocietyOn July 10, 2018, David Suzuki launched a blistering attack against Friends of Science Society and a handful of other groups, like the tiny Rally4Resources, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and other groups made up of out-of-work oil patch employees and their supporters – most of whom advocate for common sense in support for the Canadian energy industry and rational economic policies. Dr. Suzuki claimed that we and others were a fake front “astroturf”  for oil interests, not grassroots at all and our connections should be ‘uprooted.’This is an absurd claim in context because Friends of Science Society operates as a non-profit on a member-funded budget of about $150,000 a year compared to that of the tax-subsidized David Suzuki Foundation (DSF) charity which has $19 million in assets. Friends of Science has no Ottawa lobbyists – DSF has several. Suzuki Fund also has an endowment fund that earns them some $600,000 a year in interest, and Vivian Krause reports that DSF has reportedly received millions in funding from offshore billionaire philanthropies. If Big Oil is funding us, as Dr. Suzuki claims, they are very cheap.Let’s uproot Suzuki’s corporate roots. They go way back to the days of Elaine Dewar’s 1995 book “Cloak of Green” – a meticulously researched tome that traces the connections between big corporations, big green and big government. Suzuki was saving rainforests at the time while hobnobbing with various large corporate interests, as Dewar reported.  Puzzled, she followed the money. Don’t let me give away the spoiler.By contrast to the David Suzuki Fund, our group started off in 2002 as a self-funded retirement project for several earth, atmospheric and solar scientists. They used to meet in someone’s basement to share thoughts on various peer-reviewed science papers around the time of the Kyoto Accords. Our founders opposed Kyoto on scientific and economic grounds.  As Enron documents ultimately revealed, Kyoto was not about saving the planet – it was all about the money to be made in emissions trading. Today, Enron lives on through ENGOs and the various corporate/institutional investor interests that fund them.As most Canadians know, David Suzuki Foundation and Dr. Suzuki himself have been on the front lines of blocking oil pipelines in Canada.  So, it is certainly curious that one of the board members of the David Suzuki Fund is a senior person with the Desjardins group.  Desjardins is one of the financiers of Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline. Desjardins often does joint ventures with Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec.“Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Canada’s second-largest pension fund, last month disclosed holdings of 10.2 million shares in Kinder Morgan Canada, making it the largest investor outside of its parent company” According to an article in Medium, Caisse de Depot et Placement has invested a lot of money into Power Corporation.Suzuki Fund and Dr. Suzuki himself have been virulent opponents of the pipeline. Why would such organizations continue to fund an ENGO that is vociferously blocking one of their own investments?DSF and Dr. Suzuki himself are loud advocates of wind farms. Power Corporation, listed as the 358th largest corporation in the world by Forbes in 2017, reported in its 2017 CDP report that it had been funding DSF since 2007 and had extended that funding to 2020 (amount unstated). DSF submitted a large wind proposal to the Alberta Climate Panel (#398) in 2015.398. Submission_David Suzuki Foundation (1)Et voila! Power Corporation subsidiaries are building a wind farm in Jenner, Alberta.Another DSF board member is a CEO with a subsidiary of OMERS – Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System – which is one of Canada’s defined benefit pension plans with $95 billion in net assets (Dec. 31, 2017). When recently asked if OMERS might be interested in buying Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline to take it off the federal government’s hands, the answer was maybe.So, why would their sponsored green social influencer, David Suzuki Fund, be blocking a KinderMorgan pipeline when Caisse de Depot is already a major investor in the company and an investee of one of DSF’s long-term funders?  Is this a way to force a ‘saviour’ project for the new Infrastructure Bank of Canada, a bank we believe to be fraught with conflicts of interests.Source: Tweet by Hon. Catherine McKenna, Minister of Climate Change and EnvironmentAt the recent G7 meeting, OMERS and Desjardins were there as sponsors, with five other big pension funds, all pushing gender, opportunities for women in finance, and of course, climate risk disclosure. We see the push for climate risk disclosure as destructive to the Canadian economy and have written the Ontario Securities Commission about it.Was Friends of Science Society represented at the G7?  Canadian Taxpayers Federation? Rally4Resources? Unemployed oil workers? No.  Only the multi-billion-dollar institutional investors who are climate obsessed and driven to foist climate risk reporting on all corporations.  Why? Because this reporting becomes a great lever for also forcing corporations into cap and trade and renewables, the ultimate objective of a global project by ClimateWorks billionaires. Never mind that no one ever authorized these unelected, unaccountable billionaire funds to interfere in national domestic climate and energy policies.  Starting over a decade ago, they just simply funded an assortment of ENGOs to the tune of some $600 million a year world-wide to agitate locally for climate and energy policy changes. It’s all here in these Wikileaks documents and their own plan on line “Design to Win.” ClimateWorks Foundation – WikiLeaksAs ‘eco-pragmatist’ Ted Nordhaus writes in Foreign Affairs, the Paris Agreement 2°C target that David Suzuki is always rattling on about is a delusion. He also puts Suzuki’s notion of Friends of Science as an industry front to bed with this rational thinking.“Climate advocates have persistently blamed the failures of climate policy on the corrupting political power of the fossil fuel industry. Industry-funded “merchants of doubt,” as the historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway originally dubbed them, together with heavy political spending, have stopped climate mitigation efforts in their tracks. But those claims are U.S.-centric. Climate skepticism and denial have not found anywhere close to the same level of political traction outside the United States. Exxon and the Koch brothers have no political franchise in the German Bundestag, the Chinese Central Committee, or most other places outside Washington. And yet those nations have had no more success cutting emissions than has the United States. To the contrary, U.S. emissions have fallen faster than those of almost any other major economy over the last decade.The alternate explanation is rather less dramatic. Decarbonization is hard. Fossil fuels continue to bring substantial benefit to most people around the world, despite the significant environmental consequences.” (bold added)In the meantime, institutional investors like OMERS and corporate bodies like Power Corp,  will continue to rake in guaranteed, subsidized 20-40 year profits and other benefits from wind and solar farms, by backing ENGOs who demand “climate action” through fear-mongering.The following claim by Suzuki is the ultimate in fake news:“The 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) may have been our last chance for a meaningful agreement to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy before ongoing damage to the world’s climate becomes irreversible and devastating.”Recent climate science shows that most of the warming since 1950 has been driven by natural forces.  Carbon dioxide is not the control knob that can control climate.   As Canadian climate scientist Dr. Madhav Khandekar explains, the uncertainties that were evident in greenhouse gas induced climate change in 2000  are still the same today.As Google engineers found out, renewable wind and solar do not address climate change and cannot compete with affordable coal.  As Ireland found out, adding more wind to the grid radically increases costs and does not reduce carbon dioxide – so it’s not a planet-saving solution (if you are one who is convinced that carbon dioxide is the problem). As Prof Michael J. Kelly of Cambridge explains, it is total madness to keep building wind and solar farms because neither can support even basic society.  As the IEA reports, the world runs on fossil fuels and will do so for many decades.  Only Canada is being cut out of the global market.The Competition Bureau just posted on their twitter feed, social media influencers like David Suzuki (ranked #140 in the world) should “clearly disclose material connections, disclose connections in each post, ensure that the representations aren’t false or misleading, verify that influencers aren’t making performance claims – unless based on adequate and proper testing.”   We did the due diligence on David Suzuki Fund’s claims about renewables. As Google engineers found out, renewable is not so doable.Time to uproot the rot at ENGOs astrotufing for corporate, institutional investor and offshore billionaire agendas.  No need for Canadians to become modern-day serfs to large pension funds with gold-plated benefits for everyone but you.~~~~         Our report: “Due Diligence on Renewable Demands by David Suzuki Foundation.”http://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/due-diligence-suzuki-foundation-final-ap-26-2017-r.pdf  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'Paris Agreement', 'Suzuki honorary degree']",2018/07/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/06/26/pourquoi-la-droite-doit-epouser-le-climato-realisme/,arthur henrique de oliveira ,Pourquoi la droite doit épouser le climato-réalisme," Par Grégoire Canlorbe, Vice Président du Parti National-Libéral © 2018« L’accord de la COP 21 de Paris n’a pas été signé pour sauver la planète et pour éviter que nous ne rôtissions avec une augmentation de température imaginaire de +2°C. Derrière toute cette mascarade se cache, comme toujours, le visage hideux du pouvoir, de la cupidité, et du profit : tous les industriels qui sont favorables à cet engagement, qui va ruiner l’Europe et appauvrir immensément ses citoyens, le font pour la bonne raison qu’ils y trouvent une source de revenus énorme et facile. Quant aux ONG, lorsqu’elles ne sont pas simplement motivées par la cupidité, leur mobile tient en une idéologie résolument malthusienne : revenir à une population mondiale très petite, de l’ordre de quelques centaines de millions d’individus ; et pour ce faire, appauvrir le monde, supprimer les énergies fossiles, et faire en sorte d’augmenter le nombre de décès. »Professeur István Markó (1956 – 2017) L’homme de Davos éminent qu’est Emmanuel Macron ne professe pas seulement sa foi dans le cosmopolitisme – à savoir, le refus des nations souveraines, ainsi que des différences génétiques et culturelles (entre les hommes), et des frontières morales (dans le cœur humain).[1] L’activisme climatique, qui lutte pour la baisse des émissions humaines de gaz carbonique – au nom du réchauffement supposément causé par ces mêmes émissions – occupe une place essentielle dans le credo de l’actuel Président français, lequel n’hésite pas à défier Trump sur ce terrain. Qu’il s’agisse de l’activisme climatique ou du cosmopolitisme, les conceptions prônées par Macron se situent dans la droite lignée de la superclasse mondiale dont il est l’émissaire. Par « superclasse mondiale », expression que nous devons à Samuel Huntington, et qui doit sa popularité au commentateur politique David Rothkopf (qui l’a reprise à son compte), il faut entendre un réseau  transnational de personnes déracinées et dénationalisées, dont la gestation remonte au moins au début du XXème siècle et dont la constitution s’est accélérée avec la chute du bloc soviétique. Parmi ses membres, la superclasse mondiale compte tout aussi bien des financiers, et les dirigeants des diverses institutions internationales, que des cadres et chefs d’entreprise, des écrivains, des professeurs d’université, des patrons d’ONG, ou encore des vedettes du cinéma. À titre plus ou moins officieux, le cosmopolitisme constitue l’idéologie par excellence de la superclasse mondiale, mais il est loin d’épuiser l’essentiel de sa vision du monde : l’activisme climatique, dont nous verrons qu’il a partie liée avec le néo-malthusianisme – et avec ce que l’on pourrait appeler le culte de Gaïa – est tout aussi bien ancré parmi les membres de la superclasse mondiale. Nous entendons montrer, ici, que l’activisme climatique, dont il est fâcheux de constater qu’il est très largement endossé, en France, parmi les hommes et femmes (qui se disent) de droite, n’a pas sa place dans un programme de droite digne de ce nom. Autrement dit, nous entendons montrer que la droite doit endosser le climato-réalisme, ce par quoi nous désignons une posture qui reconnaît bien volontiers que les conditions climatiques n’ont jamais été stables mais perpétuellement variables, et tient pour hautement improbable la responsabilité de l’être humain dans le réchauffement « contemporain » [2] ; qui, sans nier la nécessité de préserver l’environnement, voit le CO2 comme un bienfait, et non comme un polluant ; qui, sans perdre de vue les dégâts occasionnellement causés par l’industrie moderne, encourage l’exploitation des ressources fossiles et du nucléaire, et suspecte un complot néo-malthusien d’être à l’œuvre derrière les appels à la sortie hors du nucléaire et du charbon. À cette condition qu’elle épouse le climato-réalisme, la droite mènera une résistance authentique à Emmanuel Macron – et, par extension, à la superclasse mondiale qui l’a mandaté.De la mise en cause du CO2 anthropique à la philosophie de GaïaLa thèse du réchauffement climatique d’origine anthropique, qui fonde l’activisme climatique, soutient que les émissions de gaz carbonique ont augmenté depuis la Révolution Industrielle, et qu’elles ont engendré un réchauffement de la température globale qui est préoccupant pour la planète et l’humanité.[1] Le plus souvent, cette thèse s’inscrit dans une plus large vision de l’homme et de la Nature, que l’on pourrait appeler la doctrine (ou philosophie) de Gaïa ; cette vision est celle de l’être humain comme une entité étrangère à la Nature, et de l’industrie et de l’agriculture modernes comme une activité parasitaire qui vide la Nature de son sang. Cette vision est aussi celle de la Nature comme une mère protectrice et bienveillante, qui ne ferait jamais le moindre mal à ses enfants, et que l’être humain se permet, en retour, de malmener éhontement avec son exploitation des ressources minérales et agricoles, son action sur le climat, ou encore son développement démographique (qui pèse sur les ressources).[2] La vérité sur le gaz carbonique Que les émissions de gaz carbonique aient augmenté depuis le début du XIXème siècle, et que le gaz carbonique ait un effet de serre, cela est avéré ; en revanche, il est pour le moins douteux que ces émissions soient le facteur déterminant du réchauffement, dans la mesure où l’effet de serre du CO2 est tout à fait mineur. En plus de représenter seulement 0.04% de la composition de l’air, le CO2 exerce un effet de serre dont la valeur est de 1 : à titre de comparaison, la vapeur d’eau, qui exerce un effet de serre dix fois plus puissant, représente 2% de la composition de l’air. En ce qui concerne la température enregistrée depuis la fin du Petit Âge glaciaire, et donc la fin du XIXème siècle, il y a effectivement hausse, mais l’augmentation en question est seulement de 0.8 degré centigrade. Dès lors, il n’est pas seulement improbable que les émissions humaines du CO2 soient en cause dans le réchauffement : il est tout simplement faux, du reste, que le réchauffement en question ait grimpé à un niveau alarmant. Le mauvais procès intenté au CO2 ne s’arrête pas là. Dans sa dénonciation de l’industrie, l’écologisme dur – une autre manière de désigner la doctrine de Gaïa – n’est jamais aussi véhément, et aussi aberrant, que lorsqu’il incrimine le gaz carbonique comme un polluant pour la planète. Bien loin de nuire à la Nature, les émissions humaines de gaz carbonique concourent à rendre la planète plus verte, et ce, pour la bonne raison que le CO2 est la nourriture élémentaire des plantes. C’est ainsi qu’en dépit de la déforestation, et à la faveur de la concentration croissante du CO2 dans l’air, la planète a verdi d’environ 20% sur les trente dernière années. L’harmonie avec laquelle le CO2 anthropique s’insère dans les cycles de la Nature est d’autant plus grande que le « poumon de la Terre », autrement dit le phytoplancton – qui produit 70% de l’oxygène présent dans l’atmosphère – assoit également son alimentation sur le gaz carbonique. La végétation, par photosynthèse, transforme le CO2  de l’air, l’eau des sols, et la lumière du soleil en de la matière organique dévorée par les herbivores, les omnivores, les insectes, et nombre de bactéries et de champignons. Plusieurs études, ont, en exploitant des observations de natures fort diverses, trouvé une augmentation de 30% de la productivité de la végétation pendant le XXème siècle ; cette croissance correspond à la nourriture de presque un quart de tous les êtres vivant aujourd’hui sur Terre, immense bienfait d’une plus grande teneur de l’air en gaz carbonique, et de températures très légèrement moins froides, depuis le début, vers 1860 – 1900, de la sortie du Petit Âge glaciaire, qui aura duré de 1300 à 1860 et provoqué en Europe comme en Chine un grand nombre de famines et de détresses bien documentées par les archives écrites de ces pays. Il est bon de garder à l’esprit qu’en dépit de l’affirmation si souvent répétée, comme quoi le taux de CO2 dans l’atmosphère n’a jamais été aussi élevé, le taux en question est, en réalité, extraordinairement bas par rapport aux valeurs de l’ordre de 7000, 8000, 9000 ppm qu’il atteignait il y a des centaines de millions d’années. Le Crétacé, le Jurassique, ou le Trias – périodes au cours desquelles les plantes atteignaient des hauteurs, et affichaient des niveaux de santé, sans comparaison avec la période présente – s’apparentent à l’âge d’or du monde végétal ; et la croisade des partisans de l’écologisme dur pour obtenir la diminution du taux du CO2 actuel, qui n’excède guère 400 ppm, pourrait bien aboutir à un âge des ténèbres pour la végétation. Les ingénieurs qui travaillent dans les serres savent fort bien que les plantes sont plus épanouies, et plus résistantes, en présence d’un taux de CO2 accru ; et qu’inversement, un taux de CO2 décroissant leur est très préjudiciable. En définitive, le cumul des émissions de dioxyde de carbone venant des combustibles pétrole, charbon, gaz naturel et des cimenteries, depuis 1751, ne fait que un pour cent du carbone qui circule naturellement entre les océans, l’atmosphère et la végétation et les sols. De l’aveu même du GIEC (figure 6-1 page 471 du rapport AR5 WG1 de 2013)  un cinquième du dioxyde de carbone de l’atmosphère est, chaque année, absorbé par la végétation et par les océans des moyennes et hautes latitudes dont la surface est relativement froide. Le dioxyde de carbone venant de l’emploi de pétrole, charbon, gaz naturel, et de la production de ciment, ne représente qu’une petite fraction (5% à 6% en 2017) du dioxyde de carbone, qui chaque année entre dans l’atmosphère et vient essentiellement (à presque 95%) du dégazage des océans – surtout la zone entre les Tropiques – et du dégazage des sols où pourrit la matière végétale morte. Ces 5% ou 6% sont fort bien vérifiés par les mesures des quantités des deux isotopes 13 et 12 du carbone  de l’air, mesures faites en routine depuis plus de quarante ans. La vérité sur la planète Certes, les partisans de l’activisme climatique, qu’ils soient, ou non, des « hommes de Davos » – expression consacrée pour désigner, par synecdoque, les membres de la superclasse mondiale – ne se limitent pas à incriminer le CO2 comme un polluant, et comme le facteur décisif du réchauffement. Ils se représentent l’industrie humaine – plus particulièrement, le charbon et le nucléaire – comme un vampire qui suce la malheureuse planète jusqu’à la moelle ; invoquent l’épuisement inéluctable des ressources, pillées sans vergogne par cette même industrie ; pointent du doigt les extinctions dont l’homme s’est rendu coupable avec son empreinte sur l’environnement. En ce qui concerne l’impact délétère des émissions humaines de CO2, on se figure couramment les faits suivants comme autant de preuves que le prétendu réchauffement lié aux émissions humaines du gaz carbonique saccage la Nature : le niveau des mers et des océans monterait année après année, engloutissant des îles entières, tandis que le niveau des glaciers et des calottes polaires diminuerait ; du reste, les températures enregistreraient une augmentation graduelle, tandis que la fréquence des intempéries et la superficie des sécheresses atteindraient, elles aussi, des niveaux de plus en plus élevés. Encore une fois, le CO2 a, dans la troposphère, un effet radiatif complètement négligeable par rapport à celui de la vapeur d’eau ; et comme sa teneur dans l’air est aussi une conséquence des températures qui modulent le dégazage de l’océan, la responsabilité du CO2 dans le réchauffement est d’autant plus improbable. Il y a certes une hausse de la température enregistrée depuis la fin du Petit Âge glaciaire (qui s’étend approximativement du début du XIVème à la fin du XIXème siècle) ; et plus précisément, une augmentation des températures aux hautes et moyennes latitudes avec un maximum dans les années 1940, puis un refroidissement jusque vers 1975, et un nouveau plateau depuis 2000. Comme nous l’avons déjà mentionné, l’ampleur de la hausse en question est tout à fait modeste : en fait, le chiffre souvent avancé de 0.8 degré centigrade doit être pris avec précaution, étant donné que les changements sont bien plus marqués aux hautes latitudes qu’en zone tropicale. Le niveau des mers monte effectivement ; mais, comme le montrent des centaines de marégraphes, d’environ 1 mm/an à 3 mm/an selon les mouvements du sol qui les porte : à titre de comparaison, une tempête amène des variations de un à plusieurs mètres en quelques heures. Dans l’extrême majorité des cas, la montée des eaux n’a donc rien à voir avec les engloutissements qui frappent ci et là (et qui sont le plus souvent dus à un classique effet d’érosion). Pour les glaces, il faut distinguer les banquises dont la surface maximale à la fin de l’hiver, et l’épaisseur, varient d’année en année avec curieusement des fluctuations de sens opposés en Arctique et en Antarctique ; les calottes glaciaires de l’Antarctique et du Groenland, qui semblent continuer à épaissir, les chutes de neige compensant l’écoulement des glaciers ou fleuves de glace qui, à la périphérie de la calotte, amènent la glace à la mer ; et certains glaciers arctiques qui, ces dernières décennies, ont perdu de leur volume. En moyenne, cela fait plus de dix ans que le niveau de la glace, en Arctique, n’a pas diminué ; et ironiquement, comme le rappelle Willie Soon, astrophysicien de Harvard, c’est de moins de glace, et non de davantage, que les ours polaires ont besoin pour leur survie.[3] Il est tout aussi chimérique que les événements extrêmes, en incluant les tornades et les intempéries, soient en augmentation : Richard Lindzen, physicien du MIT spécialiste de l’atmosphère, rappelle que la diminution du différentiel de température entre les hautes latitudes de l’hémisphère nord et la zone entre les Tropiques ne peut que réduire la force de la circulation atmosphérique et donc la fréquence des événements extrêmes. Quant aux déserts, ils sont également en récession depuis vingt ans, comme les plantes, en vertu du taux de CO2 accru dans l’atmosphère, ont moins besoin d’eau, et peuvent donc davantage prospérer en milieu désertique. En définitive, il y a sans doute bien des accidents météorologiques ou industriels dont la planète se passerait volontiers : cependant, la hausse de la température semble fort naturelle, et son ampleur n’est pas du tout anormale. La montée du niveau des eaux n’est guère préoccupante, elle non plus : ce sont les grandes tempêtes qui, tous les dix ou cent ans, causent des dégâts ; tout simplement, les calottes du Groenland et de l’Antarctique épaississent, et l’état des banquises n’a pas d’effet sur le niveau des mers. Quant à la fréquence et la gravité des événements extrêmes, elles diminuent, ainsi que l’étendue des déserts dans le monde. Le CO2 n’est pas un poison, il est même la nourriture essentielle des plantes ; et comme le résume éloquemment Lindzen, « ce que les historiens se demanderont définitivement dans les siècles à venir est comment une logique profondément entachée par une propagande perspicace a permis à une coalition d’intérêts particuliers puissants de convaincre presque tout le monde que le CO2 de l’industrie humaine était une toxine destructrice de la planète. » Certes, on ne saurait nier la réalité de la pollution, que celle-ci soit liée, ou non, à l’industrie : le vortex de déchets plastiques du Pacifique nord témoigne de l’ampleur de la pollution que l’homme est capable d’engendrer. Cependant, il ne va pas de soi de présenter l’être humain, et a fortiori son industrie, comme nécessairement polluants – et donc, nécessairement toxiques pour l’environnement – ; et ce, d’autant que le traitement de la pollution industrielle s’améliore jour après jour. Que l’on songe à l’air de Pékin, dont la toxicité a considérablement diminué, et est désormais sans commune mesure avec le smog qui régnait naguère à Londres. La tour de purification de l’air, de la taille d’un gratte-ciel, que la Chine expérimente à Xi’an témoigne du soin que l’homme est capable de porter à la Création qui est laissée entre ses mains. Par rapport à la pollution associée au nucléaire, souvenons-nous que personne n’est mort des suites de l’accident nucléaire survenu à Fukushima. En ce qui concerne les ressources du globe, les conceptions néo-malthusiennes s’articulent autour de la conviction que, si la croissance économique a excédé la croissance démographique à partir de la Révolution Industrielle, permettant dès lors la propulsion de la croissance démographique, cette situation non seulement n’est pas durable, mais va culminer dans l’épuisement des ressources – en incluant les ressources alimentaires. Nous reviendrons un peu plus loin à ce sujet. En attendant, il est bon de noter que le pic pétrolier est sans cesse repoussé, alors même que les partisans de l’écologisme dur n’ont de cesse de le décrire comme imminent. Selon la formule du regretté István Markó, « ceux qui colportent l’idée que le caractère fini des ressources [fossiles] rend impossible une croissance infinie, font l’impasse sur la capacité de l’être humain à innover dans sa technologie, à enrichir sa connaissance de la Nature, et à actualiser ses stratégies d’extraction. » Les extinctions sont un phénomène indéniable : c’est ainsi que sur les 600 dernières années, ce sont environ 800 espèces qui ont disparu ; mais il est tout à fait faux que seul l’homme soit en cause dans les extinctions. Dans la grande majorité des cas, les espèces qui ont disparu, ou sont mises en péril, doivent leur extinction à la Nature elle-même : avec l’arrivée d’espèces invasives ou de parasites (virus, champignons, bactéries etc. ) nouveaux. S’il arrive à l’être humain d’exercer une empreinte délétère sur son environnement, et les espèces qu’il abrite, il est tout aussi vrai que la Nature n’est pas hospitalière par elle-même ; le confort de vie ne tombe pas du ciel, et c’est bien au prix de ses efforts pour rendre hospitalier son environnement que l’être humain a élevé sa condition. Comme le rappelle, encore une fois, István Markó, l’industrie moderne, pourtant honnie par l’écologisme dur, a joué un rôle décisif sur ce plan : « la victoire de la médecine, que l’on vante si souvent, n’aurait jamais pu voir le jour sans la chimie des ressources fossiles ; et ce sont bien les progrès chimiques et industriels en matière de pesticides, d’insecticides, et de fertilisants, qui nous ont permis de maîtriser notre environnement. »Grégoire Canlorbe en compagnie de l’ancien Président tchèque Václav Klaus, fer de lance du national-libéralisme et du climato-réalisme – Paris, décembre 2017Du souci de la biodiversité à la lutte contre le cosmopolitisme En abordant avec une vue d’ensemble les discours en vogue sur la pollution, l’épuisement des ressources, le réchauffement, force est de constater qu’ils tournent autour de l’idée suivante : la Nature est bonne, mais l’homme est mauvais ; la Nature ne nuirait jamais à ses enfants, l’homme est le seul responsable des extinctions et autres catastrophes ; quoi qu’il entreprenne, l’homme est une créature maléfique dont l’empreinte sur la Nature est nécessairement novice, et au fond, l’homme est un intrus sur Terre. À cette manière d’envisager les rapports de l’homme avec la nature s’oppose la vision développée par Patrick Moore, co-fondateur et ancien dirigeant de Greenpeace – une organisation dont il devait certes se distancier, en raison de son profond désaccord avec l’écologisme dur finalement promu par Greenpeace. « En tant qu’écologiste », déclare Moore, « je vois toute la vie comme un seul et même système sur la Terre. L’écologie concerne les interrelations entre toutes les différentes formes de vie, en incluant les humains bien sûr. Nous sommes venus de la nature, nous avons évolué à partir de la nature, ainsi que toutes les autres espèces. Voir l’humain comme séparé et, en quelque sorte, comme le seul animal maléfique, c’est ainsi qu’il est désormais projeté. » Si la droite, en France et ailleurs, veut fonder sa politique écologique sur une image de la Nature qui fonctionne, une conception saine et exacte de la Nature, elle doit endosser l’écologisme au sens de Patrick Moore – et, par extension, épouser le climato-réalisme. À cette condition, et à cette condition seulement, la droite se montrera un adversaire authentique de la superclasse mondiale, qui endosse non seulement le cosmopolitisme légitimant son existence, mais la philosophie de Gaïa fondant son activisme climatique (et comme nous le verrons, son néo-malthusianisme). Un mot mérite d’être dit sur le panda, dont les stratégies de survie et de reproduction, instinctives, laissent songeur quant à la conception angélique de la Nature comme une mère soucieuse du sort de ses enfants. En plus de se nourrir exclusivement d’un certain type de bambou, dont la capacité énergétique varie au cours de l’année, et se montre très faible lors des chaleurs de la femelle, le panda est un animal solitaire, évitant ses congénères. Dès lors, la reproduction du panda est hautement hasardeuse ; et ce, non seulement parce que, pour un temps de fertilité pourtant très court (à savoir, de trois jours), le mâle et la femelle peinent à se rencontrer, mais parce que le mâle est généralement trop fatigué pour se livrer à une saillie (en raison de la faible qualité énergétique du bambou à ce moment de l’année). Mère Nature n’est pas plus bienveillante envers le panda qu’elle ne l’est envers l’être humain : elle n’étreint pas son enfant qu’est le panda, elle le condamne à l’extinction ; et c’est bel et bien l’être humain qui sauve le panda. Que certaines espèces soient mortes par la faute de l’homme, et que celui-ci ait le devoir, non seulement de ne pas porter atteinte à la biodiversité, mais de secourir les espèces menacées, nous ne le nions certes pas. Nous nous risquerons même à soutenir que la préservation des espèces naturelles, a fortiori la protection des espèces en voie d’extinction – que leur disparition soit liée à l’action de l’être humain ou à la cruauté de Mère Nature en personne – est un but que nous devons poursuivre pour la même raison que le cosmopolitisme doit être combattu : les créatures vivantes, en incluant ces organismes sociaux que sont les nations et ethnies humaines, doivent survivre et s’épanouir dans la richesse de leurs natures respectives ; le foisonnement et la diversité de la vie doivent être reconnus, préservés, sanctifiés. Du culte de Gaïa à la profession de foi néo-malthusienne La superclasse mondiale, qui clame son attachement à la biodiversité,[1] promeut cependant une conception fausse et misanthropique de la Nature, ce à quoi elle associe une profession de foi cosmopolite qui rejette la diversité ethnoculturelle. Parce que le réchauffement passe pour une problématique globale, l’activisme climatique a partie liée avec l’idéal cosmopolite d’un gouvernement mondial qui supplanterait, enfin, les nations souveraines, dissoudrait les identités génétiques et culturelles, dissiperait les frontières politiques – qu’il s’agisse de promouvoir les flux humains ou les flux de marchandises. Cependant, cette alliance va au-delà du pragmatisme : les hommes de Davos ne sont pas moins sincères dans leur adhésion au culte de Gaïa qu’ils ne le sont dans leur vénération du dieu-Humanité – une humanité affranchie des subdivisions nationales, et des spécificités culturelles et génétiques. En plus de la diabolisation du gaz carbonique, un aspect tout aussi décisif de la philosophie de Gaïa tient dans la croyance que la croissance économique contemporaine, qui a dépassé la croissance démographique, et a donc permis le bond en avant de la population mondiale, revient à une trahison envers Mère Nature : une trahison dont le prix à payer est la disparition inéluctable des ressources alimentaires (sous le poids de la croissance démographique). Activisme climatique, néo-malthusianisme, et cosmopolitisme sont donc des idéaux étroitement solidaires ; et l’on peut s’attendre à un agenda résolument néo-malthusien de la part du gouvernement mondial que la superclasse mondiale, qui agit sous le prétexte de la lutte contre le réchauffement anthropique, aspire à développer à partir de l’ONU. Si l’écologisme dur culmine dans le rejet des énergies fossiles et du nucléaire, c’est, en premier lieu, parce que la croissance fondée sur le nucléaire et le charbon revient à une émancipation vis-à-vis de la Nature – une émancipation que le clergé de Gaïa assimile à une transgression et à un viol. Dans les termes de l’historien économique E.A. Wrigley, la Révolution Industrielle, en asseyant la croissance sur les énergies fossiles, a permis l’émergence d’un « monde qui ne suit plus le rythme du soleil et des saisons ; un monde dans lequel la fortune des hommes dépend largement de la façon dont il régule lui-même l’économie, et non des aléas du temps et des récoltes ; un monde dans lequel la pauvreté est devenue un état optionnel plutôt que le reflet du caractère nécessairement limité des pouvoirs productifs humains. » Tel est ce que Deepak Lal, économiste versé dans l’étude comparée des civilisations, a appelé la « croissance prométhéenne », par opposition à la simple « croissance smithienne », qui consiste à accroître l’étendue de la division du travail. Dans une large mesure, l’horizon de l’écologisme dur, pensons-nous, est de revenir à une croissance traditionnelle, donc smithienne, fondée sur la division du travail et associée à une économie de type organique (ou économie agraire) – une croissance bornée par la superficie des terres cultivées et soutenue par le contrôle des naissances. Une version plus modérée, plus pragmatique, de ce programme promeut certes la sortie hors du nucléaire et du charbon, donc l’évacuation de la croissance prométhéenne (au profit du retour à une croissance smithienne) ; mais professe une voie intermédiaire entre le retour à une économie agraire stricto sensu et la poursuite dans la voie des énergies fossiles et du nucléaire. Cette voie intermédiaire tient dans le développement des énergies dites intermittentes – à savoir, l’énergie solaire, l’énergie marémotrice, et l’énergie éolienne. Dans le fond, cela revient au même : le retour à une économie liée servilement aux aléas du soleil, du vent, et des marées – et à une croissance qui ne dépende donc plus de la manière dont l’homme domestique la Nature, une croissance dont le seul espoir réside dans l’extension de la division du travail.[2] En accord avec sa culpabilisation de l’industrie moderne, l’écologisme dur rejette également la croissance prométhéenne pour des raisons proprement néo-malthusiennes. Le néo-malthusianisme tient dans la conviction que l’actuelle croissance démographique, qui s’est vue propulsée par la Révolution Industrielle, et a donc été dépassée par la croissance économique, va inéluctablement engendrer la disparition des ressources alimentaires – et donc, une famine de masse. Dans l’espoir de prévenir cette issue catastrophique pour l’humain et la planète, les hommes de Davos, qui sacrifient à Gaïa, sont prêts à sacrifier le développement économique et démographique – et donc, à appauvrir le monde et augmenter le nombre de décès. À ce titre, la lutte contre les émissions humaines de gaz carbonique ne répond pas seulement à l’objectif de sauver le climat : elle s’inscrit dans une lutte plus fondamentale contre les industries (à savoir, le charbon et le nucléaire) qui ont permis l’explosion démographique de l’humanité. Pourquoi la France devra mener la résistance contre l’activisme climatique En remède aux conjectures toxiques dont la superclasse mondiale est coutumière, il est également bon de lire Patrick Moore sur le néo-malthusianisme. Même si, comme Moore nous le rappelle, Malthus, en son temps, prédisait avec une logique implacable que la famine de masse était inéluctable, compte tenu du caractère linéaire de la production alimentaire, et du caractère exponentiel de la croissance de la population, « la vérité est que cela s’est désormais inversé ». De nos jours, la croissance de la population « s’essouffle en termes d’une courbe exponentielle » ; en revanche, « la production alimentaire est devenue exponentielle dans sa capacité à nourrir toute la population mondiale », ce qui discrédite définitivement le messianisme criminel des hommes de Davos, pour qui seule la réduction de la population – via le renoncement à la croissance prométhéenne – pourra permettre la préservation des ressources alimentaires, et la survie de l’humanité. En définitive, telles sont, selon nous, les trois raisons pour lesquelles une France fièrement droitière devra mener la résistance contre l’activisme climatique. De un, le prétendu réchauffement climatique d’origine anthropique, dont nous avons vu qu’il est loin d’être établi, passe pour une problématique globale ; et à ce titre, tient lieu de cheval de Troie pour la superclasse mondiale : promouvoir la réduction des émissions humaines du gaz carbonique revient très précisément à un prétexte pour promouvoir le développement d’un gouvernement global à partir de l’ONU. De deux, le CO2 est loin d’être un poison, et tient même lieu, comme nous l’avons vu, de nourriture fondamentale des plantes (et des espèces du phytoplancton). La France étant un jardin, elle doit devenir le jardin d’Éden des idéaux droitiers – liberté, territoire, et aristocratie – ; et pour ce faire, les émissions du CO2 devront être vivement encouragées. La France, fer de lance d’un monde plus libre, mais aussi plus vert, plus territorial, plus aristocratique – un monde plus beau, en somme ! De trois, la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique dissimule une lutte plus fondamentale contre ce que nous avons appelé, faisant nôtre la formule de Deepak Lal, la « croissance prométhéenne » : à savoir, la croissance assise sur les ressources fossiles et le nucléaire, celle qui domestique la Nature, et qui ne requiert plus le contrôle de la population pour ajuster la démographie à la limite des terres cultivables. L’activisme climatique est un génocide par désindustrialisation : motivé par une idéologie néo-malthusienne (qui ne tient pas compte des progrès de l’agriculture, devenus exponentiels, et du caractère désormais linéaire de la croissance démographique), il entend réduire la population mondiale en la privant de l’exploitation des énergies fossiles et du nucléaire. En menant la résistance contre l’activisme climatique, la France mènera la résistance contre les velléités génocidaires de la superclasse mondiale.[3] L’auteur de l’article, M. Grégoire Canlorbe, est Vice Président du Parti National-Libéral, fondé et présidé par M. Henry de Lesquen. Grégoire Canlorbe est aussi sympathisant de l’Association des Climato-réalistes – la seule organisation climato-réaliste en France.   Cet article est dédié à la mémoire du Professeur István Markó, qui avait accordé sa toute dernière entrevue à Grégoire Canlorbe (relatée sur Breitbart News Network). L’auteur tient à remercier, du reste, M. Camille Veyres, expert scientifique sur le climat ; M. Deepak Lal, économiste, et ancien Président de la Société du Mont Pèlerin ; M. Patrick Moore, co-fondateur et ancien Président de Greenpeace ; M. Václav Klaus, ancien Président tchèque, et fer de lance du national-libéralisme climato-réaliste ; M. Willie Soon, astrophysicien de Harvard ; et M. Richard Lindzen, physicien du MIT spécialiste de l’atmosphère, pour les précieuses discussions qui ont nourri cet article.  [1] La « Décennie des Nations unies pour la biodiversité » (2011-2020) témoigne de l’importance du thème de la biodiversité pour l’ONU – et plus fondamentalement, la superclasse mondiale. Néanmoins, la biodiversité qu’il s’agit ici de préserver est toute relative : ainsi ne s’étend-elle pas à la diversité ethnoculturelle, alors même qu’il y a toute légitimité à inclure parmi les êtres vivants les ethnies et nations humaines, qui sont à proprement parler des organismes sociaux (ou super-organismes).[2] Parmi les partisans de l’écologisme dur, d’aucuns vont encore plus loin : en rejetant non seulement la croissance prométhéenne, donc l’industrie moderne, mais la division internationale du travail qu’appelle la croissance smithienne. Produire « localement » est supposé permettre une moindre émission des taux de CO2, d’où le rejet de la mondialisation capitaliste par cette version extrême de la doctrine de Gaia. Cela dit, la superclasse mondiale, qui encourage la mondialisation au nom du cosmopolitisme, ne peut pas rejeter la croissance smithienne – et la division du travail internationale qu’elle implique.[3] Trois génocides se jouent en Europe de l’Ouest. Un génocide par substitution – le remplacement des populations indigènes par les allogènes arrivant en masse. Un génocide par désindustrialisation – le démantèlement du nucléaire et des industries fossiles au profit de l’appauvrissement de la population (et de l’augmentation du nombre de décès). Et un génocide par malnutrition – la prolifération du cancer en raison du sucre qui a envahi l’alimentation.[1] Plus précisément, la thèse du réchauffement anthropique soutient que les émissions humaines de CO2 ont engendré un réchauffement d’une fraction de degré Celsius d’une quantité inobservable, appelée température moyenne globale, et que dans trente ou quarante ans, il y aura un accroissement de cette température qui sera préoccupant pour l’humain et la planète.[2] Le prétendu consensus scientifique sur le rôle décisif des émissions humaines du CO2 dans le réchauffement – et sur le caractère préoccupant, anormalement élevé, de ce même réchauffement – n’existe pas. Il y a bel et bien consensus, mais ce consensus est « idéologique » et religieux : il est motivé par la religion de Gaïa, et non par des considérations logico-expérimentales. L’on peut dire la même chose du prétendu consensus scientifique sur la non-existence des races humaines : la science n’est aucunement unanime sur le sujet, et les scientifiques qui prétendent le contraire le font en tant que religieux, non en tant que savants. En l’occurrence, c’est la religion du cosmopolitisme qui les pousse à mentir.[3] Dans les termes de Willie Soon, « Les ours polaires ont besoin de moins de glace de mer pour être bien nourris et se reproduire. Pourquoi ? Pensez-y une minute : les ours polaires mangent beaucoup. Toute grande colonie aura besoin de beaucoup de nourriture. Le régime de base des ours est la graisse de phoque. Mais les phoques sont très loin dans la chaîne alimentaire. Un écosystème entièrement fonctionnel et sain est donc nécessaire. Et cela signifie que les océans doivent être suffisamment chauds pour soutenir les maillons inférieurs dans la chaîne alimentaire, du plancton jusqu’aux phoques. »[1] Rejeter le cosmopolitisme ne signifie pas rejeter le libre-échange, le capitalisme mondialisé, ou le « dialogue culturel » entre les nations. Le cosmopolitisme attaque les nations et leurs frontières, appelle à dissoudre les identités raciales et culturelles, prêche le relativisme moral : rejeter le cosmopolitisme signifie rejeter ce programme mortifère, et non refuser la mondialisation.[2] Le réchauffement prétendument contemporain est observé de 1975 à 1997, mais ni avant (refroidissement de 1945 à  1975), ni après (stagnation des températures de 1999 à 2015).Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['changement climatique', 'climate change', 'francais', 'French']",2018/06/26
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/06/22/oil-pipelines-and-water-addressing-the-myths/,Alan Collett ,Oil Pipelines and Water – Addressing the Myths," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.  He is a frequent contributor to the Friends of Science blog.Every major new oil pipeline project proposed in Canada over the last decade has encountered significant opposition from environmentalist and aboriginal groups, with many of them parading signs declaring that “Water is Life”.  These groups have claimed incessantly that the construction and operation of pipelines creates unacceptable risks for rivers, lakes, wetlands and underground aquifers. Seldom, if ever, does the mainstream news media ever examine the facts behind these claims or dare to challenge them. Thus is born a whole new set of myths, destined to be repeated at each new demonstration. This note will examine the general background to these claims and then the specific issues that were raised during the National Energy Board’s three-year review of the planned Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMPL). Oil Pipelines in the United States and CanadaIf one were completely unaware of the energy infrastructure in North America and listened only to the protests being made, one might suppose that there are very few oil pipelines now operating and that the technology for building and operating them safely was in its infancy. In fact, oil pipelines have been operating in North America since the 1870’s, for almost 150 years. There was a significant expansion of the existing systems in the early part of the 20th century, then again after the Second World War, and most recently in the last decade. In fact, in the United States, the crude oil pipeline system expanded from about 51,000 miles in 2008 to 75,700 miles in 2016, a 48% increase in less than a decade.  In addition, 62,400 miles of pipelines transport refined petroleum products. In Canada, there were 48,500 kilometres of oil pipelines operating in 2016, 27,600 km of them gathering lines and 20,900 km of trunk lines. Virtually every one of the trunk lines in both countries crosses dozens, if not hundreds, of waterways and areas where there are underground aquifers. For its entire history, the pipeline industry has been coping with the engineering problems of how to build and operate pipelines so as to minimize the potential adverse effects on waterways. The Canadian Oil Pipeline Industry’s Safety RecordThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) is responsible for maintaining statistics on the operation of oil and natural gas pipelines in Canada, including records of any “accidents” or “incidents” that occur, and for preparing in-depth reports on major accidents, especially where these involve a release into the environment. According to TSB data, in 2016 federally regulated oil pipelines in Canada (i.e. those that cross interprovincial or international boundaries) transported 1.2 billion barrels to market. 1.2 billion (i.e. 1,200,000,000) is a very large number. To get some sense of what that means, a barrel is almost a yard high, so 1.2 billion barrels laid end-to-end would be close to 680,000 miles, or almost three times the distance from the earth to the moon. The TSB counts as an accident any event that results in a severe injury or loss of life, or a rupture, explosion or other event that causes a pipeline to be inoperative.It counts as an incident any event that is a reportable occurrence, ranging from minor threats to the operation of the pipeline to an unintended or uncontrolled release of a product. In 2016, the number of accidents involving federally regulated pipelines was a nice round number – zero, exactly the same as the number of accidents in 2015. In fact, the number of accidents on oil and natural gas pipelines combined has averaged only four per year over the last five years. The number of incidents involving oil and gas pipelines in 2016 was about 100, half of which occurred on transmission lines. Fifty-seven of these involved no release of product. One incident involved the release of one to 25 cubic meters of petroleum. That’s one. The Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) often publicizes the fact that 99.999% of the petroleum transported arrives safety with no incident. That is an exaggeration. It is more like 99.99999 % arrives safely with no incident. The spill avoidance issue, about which so much news is made, is all about avoiding that last 0.00001%. The Trans Mountain Expansion Project – Basic FactsThe project involves the expansion of an existing oil pipeline system that runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, at which point some of the crude oil would be loaded onto tankers at the Westridge Marine Terminal, where it would be delivered to markets throughout the west coast of North America and the Pacific Rim. This pipeline system has operated for 65 years, since 1953. The expansion project would result in the looping (or twinning) of the existing 1,147 km Trans Mountain Pipeline (TMPL) system with about 987 km of new buried pipeline. The older pipeline would be designated Line 1. The proposed new pipeline segments, along with two currently active segments, would become Line 2. Most of the expansion would occur along existing rights of way that have been used since 1953 – the same watersheds, rivers and wetlands that have been close to the pipeline for 65 years! The existing pipeline now transports both crude oil and refined petroleum products to British Columbia and export markets in the Puget Sound area as well as California. Today, British Columbia receives over half of its motor gasoline supplies from Alberta via TMPL; the dedication of Line 1 exclusively to refined oil products would increase the security and flexibility of refined oil product supply to British Columbia consumers. In total, the project would increase the capacity of the TMPL system from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined products. The Water-Related Issues Considered During National Energy Board ReviewThere were three main onshore water-related issues addressed during the environmental review of the TMPL project. These concerned the anticipated effects of the construction and operation of the project, and the potential for mitigation, in three specific aspects: Surface water quality and quantityGroundwater quality and quantityWetlands Surface Water It is well known, and was acknowledged by Trans Mountain during the NEB review, that pipeline construction can have a number of potential residual effects on surface water quality and quantity, primarily due to reduced water quality (i.e. suspended sediments) during construction activities. Trans Mountain identified a number of watersheds crossed by the proposed pipeline corridor, including the Sturgeon River, Lower and Upper North Saskatchewan River, Lower MacLeod River, Athabaska River, Lower North Thompson River, Thompson River, South Thompson River, Lower Nicola River and Similkameen watersheds. It committed, however, to implement both general and site-specific mitigation, monitoring and reclamation measures either to reduce any adverse effects or avoid them altogether. A key concern raised by some participants in the review was the potential alteration or loss of riparian habitat resulting from construction or operation of the pipeline. Riparian habitat is the soil and vegetation along river margins and banks. There could be a temporary effect, but Trans Mountain pointed out that maximum riparian area that might be disturbed was 334.6 hectares, or 0.05% of the total riparian habitat within the Regional Study Area. Trans Mountain committed to: Limit riparian vegetation clearing to trench areas and any required workspace within the pipeline corridor;Adhere to the Forest Practice Code and the Riparian Management Area Guidebook in B.C. during clearing activities;Adopt riparian buffer setbacks to temporary workspaces based on provincial and federal guidelines;Revegitate any disturbed riparian habitat; andMonitor these areas upon completion of construction to ensure that they return to similar pre-construction condition. The NEB considered that the Environmental Protection Plans Trans Mountain submitted would effectively reduce the extent of any effects on surface water quality and quantity. The Board, however, imposed four conditions as part of the pipeline certificate (Conditions 72, 78, 151 and 154) requiring Trans Mountain to submit additional plans and to commit to additional management of riparian habitat. Groundwater Trans Mountain conducted extensive studies of the proposed pipeline corridor to identify the aquifers along the proposed route, the facilities overlying mapped aquifers, and potential groundwater quality effects. It established groundwater monitoring programs at selected facilities, including the Burnaby Terminal, to identify impacts on groundwater. It testified that, should a release from the pipeline or related facilities occur and groundwater impacts be suspected, it would undertake a hydrogeological investigation to assess site conditions and the magnitude and extent of any impacts. Trans Mountain proposed mitigation measures to address the Project’s potential effects on groundwater quality and quantity. It followed recommendations from several industry and federal and provincial regulatory guidelines in designing construction activities to avoid diversion and unnatural retention of water along the right-of-way. The NEB accepted Trans Mountain’s commitments to identify areas of high risk and to implement additional risk mitigation measures where needed. However, it added certificate condition 130 requiring Trans Mountain to develop a groundwater monitoring program for any vulnerable aquifers that may be present along the pipeline route. Overall, given these commitments and conditions, the Board concluded that the construction and operation of the pipeline was “not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.” Wetlands Trans Mountain testified that 538 wetlands would potentially be crossed by the proposed pipeline corridor. Not all of these wetlands would be disturbed because the pipeline right-of-way would be routed within the corridor to avoid wetlands to the extent practical. Trans Mountain reviewed aerial surveys and satellite imagery of the wetlands encountered by the Project, and during the pre-construction field program ground surveyed 413 of the 538 wetlands crossed. It committed to ground survey all the remaining wetlands before construction began. The pipeline will follow existing linear infrastructure where feasible. Past studies of other projects indicate that, with the mitigation measures proposed, along with supplemental remediation measures where warranted and the passage of time, wetlands habitat function generally returns successfully within two to three years following construction. The adverse effects, if any, are temporary. Trans Mountain stated that its goal was to return all wetlands to the same “functional condition category” post-construction. Trans Mountain further committed that, at the last year of post-construction monitoring (i.e. year five after construction), if any wetland is not on the way to recovering its pre-construction functional condition, and additional remedial measures are not enough, it would provide financial compensation, and provided a Preliminary Wetland Compensation Plan. The NEB found these commitments acceptable. ConclusionThe risks of oil pipeline spills in Canada are already extremely low. If they do occur, the pipeline company is required by law to pay the costs of clean-up, and it must have services available that ensure that clean-up will be rapid and effective. There are potentially some temporary adverse effects of pipeline construction on surface water, groundwater and wetlands during and immediately after construction. These are generally small and temporary. In Trans Mountain’s case, the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to anticipate, prepare for and mitigate any adverse effects that might occur. These actions have been reviewed by the pipeline engineers, biologists and other professional staff of the National Energy Board and been subject to lengthy public regulatory review and approval by experts. It is fair to say that the Trans Mountain Project has been subjected to an unprecedented level of regulatory and scientific scrutiny on all aspects of its construction and operation, including perhaps especially its potential impact on water.  If this level of review and requirements for mitigation and remediation were imposed on any other transportation infrastructure, we would never build another highway, port, rail line or electricity transmission line in Canada. Demanding that no infrastructure project or building proceed unless there is zero risk of even the smallest environmental impact would mean that modern economies would cease to function because there it would not be possible to build and operate the businesses that serve society’s needs. Those who shout slogans and carry posters saying, “Water is Life” are proclaiming a truth, but a half truth. By opposing beneficial infrastructure, they are denying the possibility of prosperous life in the modern world.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2018/06/22
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/06/18/prof-richard-lindzen-in-conversation-with-gregoire-canlorbe/,Warren Blair ,Prof. Richard Lindzen – in Conversation with Grégoire Canlorbe," Contributed by Grégoire Canlorbe(Originally published on Watts Up With That)Prof. Richard Lindzen (in the middle), and his wife Nadine, in the company of Grégoire Canlorbe, in Paris in May 2018Richard Siegmund Lindzen is an American atmospheric physicist known for his work in the dynamics of the atmosphere, atmospheric tides, and ozone photochemistry. He has published more than 200 scientific papers and books. From 1983 until his retirement in 2013, he was Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was a lead author of Chapter 7, “Physical Climate Processes and Feedbacks,” of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Third Assessment Report on climate change. He has criticized the scientific consensus about climate change and what he has called “climate alarmism.”A short while ago, Prof. Lindzen had a conversation with Mr. Grégoire Canlorbe, who interviewed him on behalf on the French Association des climato-réalistes—the only climate-realist organization in France.Grégoire Canlorbe: Your early work dealt with ozone photochemistry, the aerodynamics of the middle atmosphere, the theory of atmospheric tides, and planetary waves. How do you present to the layman the several scientific discoveries you were responsible for in these areas?Richard Lindzen: My work is mostly about ‘explaining’ rather than ‘discovering’, and I doubt that my achievements would mean much to laymen. With respect to my early work, I provided the explanation for the Quasi-biennial Oscillation of the tropical stratosphere. This phenomenon refers to the fact that the wind between 16 and about 30 km in the tropics blows from east to west for approximately a year, and then reverses and blows from west to east for about another year.I also provided the solution to an old question about tidal oscillations in surface pressure. For tides that are forced by the gravitational force of the moon, it has been known since Newton that the dominant period should be 12 lunar hours. However, at the surface, the pressure oscillates primarily at 12 solar hours though solar forcing is primarily thermal in origin and dominated by 24 hours. The question was why the observed tide was semidiurnal rather than diurnal. I showed that diurnal tides were trapped over much of the earth and suppressed.There was also the interesting fact that at the mesopause (ca 85 km) the winter pole is the warmest place and the summer pole is the coldest place. I showed that this was caused by the breaking of small-scale waves from below. The behavior of the atmosphere and oceans provides many interesting puzzles and I always enjoyed these puzzles.Grégoire Canlorbe: You have sparked vehement reactions, in highlighting how futile the popular claims on increasing droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, sea level rise, and other extremes. Even modest warming, you say, should not be considered a genuine threat to human health and agriculture. Could you remind us of the data invalidating climate doomsday scenarios?Richard Lindzen: I should point out that I don’t personally do much work in these areas, nor do I think that the ‘vehement’ reaction is primarily to my statements concerning extreme events. The time history of such matters as droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and temperature extremes is well recorded by official bodies like NOAA, and display no systematic increase. Indeed, some, like hurricanes, appear to be decreasing. These trends have been documented by R. Pielke, Jr. (https://www.amazon.com/Rightful-Place-Science-Disasters-Climate/dp/0692297510/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1492721355&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=pielke+jr+in+books), and even the IPCC has acknowledged the absence of significant associations with warming.I have occasionally noted that theoretically, warmer climates should be characterized by reduced temperature extremes. The attempt to associate present weather extremes and other matters ranging from obesity to the Syrian Civil War, with climate change is frequently hilarious (http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/warmlist.htm). The mostly non-scientist proponents of climate hysteria realize that distant forecasts of remote problems by inadequate models are unlikely to motivate people to shut down modern industrial society. They, therefore, attempt to claim that we are seeing the problems right now. Of course, the warming that has occurred over the past 200 years or so, has been too small to have been a major factor. However, objective reality matters little when it comes to propaganda – where repetition can effectively counter reality.The issue of sea level rise is slightly different. The proponents of climate alarm have for almost 40 years recognized that massive sea level rise and coastal flooding provide excellent graphic examples of dangers that people can react to. Such things as a couple of degrees of warming are much less effective in frightening people. Of course, carefully analyzed tide gauge data shows sea-level increasing about 20 cm per century for at least 2 centuries – with no sign of acceleration to the present. The claim that this increase is accelerating is very peculiar. Tide gauges don’t actually measure sea-level. Rather, they measure the difference between land level and sea level. At many stations, the former is much more important. In order to estimate sea level, one has to restrict oneself to tectonically stable sites.Since 1979 we have been able to measure sea level itself with satellites. However, the accuracy of such measurements depends critically on such factors as the precise shape of the earth. While the satellites show slightly greater rates of sea level rise, the inaccuracy of the measurement renders the difference uncertain. What the proponents of alarm have done is to accept the tide gauge data until 1979, but assume that the satellite data is correct after that date, and that the difference in rates constitutes ‘acceleration.’ They then assume acceleration will continue leading to large sea level rises by the end of this century. It is hard to imagine that such illogical arguments would be tolerated in other fields.Grégoire Canlorbe: It is commonly admitted that temperature increases follow the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels—and not the other way around. In this regard, fossil fuels emissions are easily believed to be the most plausible origin of contemporary increasing CO2 levels. Do you question this dogma?Richard Lindzen: I’m not sure what you are saying. In point of fact, increasing CO2 should cause some warming, but increasing temperature can also increase CO2 (for example CO2follows temperature during the cycles of glaciation). That said, it is not unreasonable to claim that the observed increases in CO2 over the past two centuries are mostly due to fossil fuel emissions, cement production, and land use changes (i.e., man’s activities).The question is can this increase in CO2 produce much in the way of climate change. Increases in CO2 have produced about a 1% perturbation in the earth’s energy budget. This impact was so much smaller before around 1960, that almost no one (including the IPCC) claims the impact was significant before that date. Even a 1% change is no greater than what is normally produced by relatively small changes in cloud cover or ocean circulations which are always carrying heat to and from the surface.Observationally, one would have to see changes since 1960 that could not otherwise be expected. According to the IPCC, models find that there is nothing competitive with man-made climate change, but observations contradict this. The warming from 1919-1939 was almost identical to the warming from 1978-1998. Moreover, there was an almost total slowdown of warming since 1998. Both imply that there is something at least as strong as man-made warming going on.Grégoire Canlorbe: You have been spearheading the iris hypothesis, according to which increased sea surface temperature in the tropics does result in reduced cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation leakage from Earth’s atmosphere. After nearly two decades of polemics, how do you assess your theory?Richard Lindzen: I’m not sure what you mean by ‘spearheading.’ In 2000 I published a study of upper level cirrus behavior in the tropics as a function of surface temperature (together with two colleagues at NASA). As you note, we found that the areal coverage of tropical cirrus (which result from the detrainment from deep cumulus clouds) does decrease with temperature, and that this effect was sufficient to more than cancel the commonly assumed water vapor feedback which is essential to predictions of high climate sensitivity.There immediately followed a series of papers that criticized our work. Each of these criticisms was easy to dismiss, and we did so in published responses. However, subsequent papers inevitably referred to our paper as ‘discredited,’ and never referred to our responses to the criticism. However, the fact that upper level tropical cirrus shrinks with increasing surface temperature has been confirmed in several subsequent papers. Moreover, since the water vapor feedback is only relevant in the absence of upper level cirrus, one cannot actually separate the iris effect from the water vapor feedback. The combined feedback is more accurately referred to as the long-wave (i.e., infrared) feedback, and direct measurements confirm that this feedback is zero or even negative.Interestingly, there is a problem called the ‘Early Faint Sun Paradox’. This refers to the fact that about 2.5 billion years ago, the solar constant was about 30% less than it is today, but the evidence is that the climate was not greatly different from today’s climate. My student, Roberto Rondanelli and I showed that the simplest explanation was the iris effect. In summary, the iris effect still seems eminently viable.Grégoire Canlorbe: In the field of the sociology of scientific knowledge, an intriguing claim on your part is that eugenics offers the closest historical parallel to the anthropogenic global warming theory. Could you expand?Richard Lindzen: Whether this is the closest parallel, I don’t know. However, there certainly are parallels, and I’ve described these in detail in a paper comparing the two issues with respect to the issue as it unfolded in the United States during the 1920’s and 30’s. ((1996) Science and politics: global warming and eugenics. in Risks, Costs, and Lives Saved, R. Hahn, editor, Oxford University Press, New York, 267pp (Chapter 5, 85-103).)Underlying both issues were political aims: control of the energy sector for AGW and immigration for eugenics. In the early 1920’s, it was argued in the US that America was undergoing an epidemic of feeblemindedness due to immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. With respect to AGW, a highly oversimplified description of the greenhouse effect was put forward as the scientific basis; with respect to eugenics, a comparably oversimplified picture of single gene heredity was employed.In both examples, numerous prominent individuals endorsed the issue, claiming that the science was obvious, and, in both cases, the scientific community failed to object. The panic over the ‘genetic’ implications of the ‘epidemic of feeble-mindedness’ led to the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924 that closed America’s doors to many people fleeing the Nazi’s.Grégoire Canlorbe: In a mediatized letter you wrote to President Trump, you urged him to withdraw from the UN convention on climate change. Do you think the hype around man-caused climate change has turned out to be a mere propaganda tool to develop the UN into a global government with a Malthusian agenda—as many voices on the Right seem to worry about it?Richard Lindzen: Actually, the hype around man-caused climate change serves many agendas – of which global governance is but one. As I pointed out many years ago, almost every interest except that of the general public has figured out how to profit from this issue. The interests, ironically, include the fossil fuel industry.Grégoire Canlorbe: French President Emmanuel Macron has steadily pushed for climate change action, anxious to lead the resistance against Trump’s climate-realist policy—as well as his economic nationalism and his foreign policy positions. Do you envision a rollback of the Trump era for the world?Richard Lindzen: Once again, I’m not sure what you are asking. The silly support for this issue by people like Macron, Merkel, and Pope Francis has little impact in the US. I suspect that most ordinary people realize that this is a phony issue, and it has been clear in the US that Trump’s lack of concern for this issue has not been a political problem for him.Grégoire Canlorbe: The belief in regulating carbon emissions (to prevent global warming) is often thought of as a secular revivification of Paganism. Yet the surviving nations of the classical pagan world are generally those disbelieving in man’s sin towards nature—and escaping this totalitarian religion that is hard ecologism. Neither China nor India substantially endorse climate alarmism, let alone denuclearization and green energy. How do you make sense of this?Richard Lindzen: It is probably inaccurate to refer to China and India as Pagan. However, such factors as the breakdown in the prominence of Christianity in the West has provided an opening for other bases for belief and virtue. I have to admit that I don’t think replacing the Ten Commandments with ‘watching one’s carbon footprint’ has much long term potential.Grégoire Canlorbe: An ancestral debate focuses on the question to know whether mathematics is just a tool to know the physical reality, or refers to a suprasensible dimension beyond atoms and the void. As a lifelong atmospheric physicist, and a past master in elucidating the flaws of mathematical climate models, what is your feeling on the issue?Richard Lindzen: While mathematics is the language of the physical sciences, mathematics is not simply the use of arbitrary algorithms. This is currently pretty much the situation with climate modeling. Algorithms are used, but they do not represent valid solutions of underlying equations. The models lack the resolution to deal with fundamental aspects of nature – some of which are insufficiently understood to even know what equations to use.Grégoire Canlorbe: Thank you for your time. Is there anything you would like to add?Richard Lindzen: There are many things I would like to add, but your readers can easily find them in my publications. (link below)http://www-eaps.mit.edu/faculty/lindzen/PublicationsRSL.htmlThis conversation of Prof. Richard Lindzen with Mr. Grégoire Canlorbe took place in Paris, in May 2018.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/06/07/the-trans-mountain-expansion-projects-facts-not-lies/,Warren Blair ,"The Trans Mountain Expansion Projects – Facts, Not Lies"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.  He is a frequent contributor to the Friends of Science blog.The purpose of this document is to set out verifiable facts concerning the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, the proposed oil pipeline expansion in British Columbia that has given rise to so much controversy. Because we live in an age of media deception, so-called “fake news”, and attacks on the integrity of people rather than on the coherence and credibility of the arguments they make, I will declare at the outset that I have no connection whatsoever with the sponsors of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project or of any firm in the petroleum industry whose products will be transported by the pipeline. Further, I am receiving and will receive not one penny of financial or other material benefit from the project proceeding. I am a resident of Ontario, not of either of the two provinces most directly affected by the pipeline. My interest is in good public policy, and in decisions that will benefit the Canadian public interest. What does this project entail? The project involves the expansion of an existing oil pipeline system that runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, at which point some of the crude oil would be loaded onto tankers at the Westridge Marine Terminal where it would be delivered to markets throughout the west coast of North America and the Pacific Rim. This pipeline system has operated for 65 years, since 1953. The project would result in the looping (or twinning) of the existing 1,147 km Trans Mountain Pipeline (TMPL) system with about 987 km of new buried pipeline. The older pipeline would be designated Line 1. The proposed new pipeline segments, along with two currently active segments, would become Line 2. The existing pipeline now transports both crude oil and refined petroleum products to British Columbia and export markets in the Puget Sound area as well as California. Today, British Columbia receives over half of its motor gasoline supplies from Alberta via TMPL; the dedication of Line 1 exclusively to refined oil products would increase the security and flexibility of refined oil product supply to British Columbia consumers. In total, the project would increase the capacity of the TMPL system from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined products. Currently, the Westridge Terminal loads about five oil tankers per month with crude oil delivered by TMPL; this has been occurring for decades. The proposed expanded system would increase the number of tanker loads to about 34 per month, or just over one per day.   Which organizations reviewed the proposal? The project has been reviewed and approved by the National Energy Board (NEB) and the marine portion has been reviewed and approved by the Transport Canada-led TERMPOL Review Process. Based on the recommendation by the NEB, the federal Cabinet approved the project, and on May 19 2016 the NEB issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity, confirming the project is in Canada’s national interest and is authorized to proceed to construction. The NEB reasons for decision can be read here: https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p80061/114562E.pdf The British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office on January 11 2017 issued an Environmental Assessment Certificate for the project, subject to an additional 37 conditions. The B.C. announcement of this can be read here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2017ENV0001-000047 What did the National Energy Board do? The National Energy Board conducted an extensive review of every aspect of the project in accordance with its requirements under the National Energy Board Act, which requires it to conduct a review based on the Canadian public interest. These subjects included an evaluation of the potential benefits and burdens of the project throughout its entire life cycle, from pre-construction through construction and operation to eventual decommissioning. The topics covered included the need for the pipeline, the safety and engineering integrity of the facilities, the approach to be taken to land acquisition and construction, the economic and financial issues, the impacts on communities and on aboriginal people, and the effects of shipping, among others. The National Energy Board was also responsible to evaluate the project under the Canadian Environment Assessment Act and so it examined the effects of the pipeline on a host of environmental aspects, including air, land and water as well as wildlife; it also reviewed the TMPL plans to avoid accidents that might cause spills and to take rapid action to clean up and remediate any spills that do occur. How was the public engaged in this process? Before applying to the National Energy Board, TMPL held many meetings with communities, landowners and aboriginal people who lived along the route and who might be affected by the project. After the application was filed, the NEB then took many steps to ensure that those who could be potentially affected by the project were aware of it and knew how they could get involved in the review. Over the course of its three and a half years of proceedings, the Board provided over $3 million in participant funding to eligible interveners; 79% of this funding was offered to Aboriginal groups.There were 400 interveners in the review process. In addition, over 1,600 people participated in hearings and 1,250 submitted comments. The Board held public hearing sessions in Edmonton, Calgary, Chilliwack, Kamloops and Victoria. From 2012 to the end of the review process, TMPL had tens of thousands of exchanges with stakeholders through face-to-face meetings, presentations, public forums, technical meetings, community meetings, social media and other means. It held 159 open houses along the pipeline and marine corridors, more than 1,700 meetings with stakeholder groups, and responded to 1,500 emails, 950 media inquiries and 430 media interviews. How many conditions did the NEB attach? The NEB approved the certificate subject to 157 conditions covering the environment, people and lands, engineering and safety, marine traffic, emergency preparedness and regulatory oversight. These conditions are intended to ensure that TMPL’s commitments, plans and programs discussed during the regulatory review are in place so that the Board can assure compliance in future. What are the economic benefits of the project? The capital cost of the project when originally proposed was $5.5 billion (2012 dollars), but due to delays in beginning construction that cost is estimated to have increased to about $7.4 billion. The bulk of the spending is expected to take place over a seven-year construction period. The Conference Board of Canada prepared a report quantifying four economic effects of the project, including direct, indirect, induced and fiscal effects. According to these studies, the construction phase would support 58,000 person-years of direct and indirect employment across Canada, with approximately 36,000 person years in B.C. and 15,000 in Alberta. During construction, the equivalent of 15,000 people will be working on the pipeline expansion. Over the operations phase of its life, which could easily exceed 30 years, the project would directly support 443 jobs, 313 of which would be in B.C. The combined impact of government revenue for construction and the first 20 years of expanded operations is $46.7 billion. That includes the increased revenues to government from taxation of the oil producers that will supply the line. The current shortage of pipeline capacity to move western Canadian crude oil to export markets has resulted in significant discounts from the benchmark price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. In a study published in February 2018 Scotiabank economists calculated that the discounts could cost the Canadian economy $10.8 billion in 2018 and another $7 billion in 2019. Construction of the Expansion would go a long distance to reduce this discount. See the article about the Scotiabank study here: Pipeline shortage to cost the economy $15.6 billion this year: report What are the Burdens of the Project? The NEB identified three areas in which the burdens associated with he project could be “significant’. One was the effect of project-related marine vessels on the Southern resident killer whale population. This entails an increase in the cumulative effects of the relatively high vessel traffic in the region, of which the added tanker traffic would be a small part. The second was the derived effect on “Aboriginal cultural use” associated with the killer whale population. The third was the greenhouse gas emissions from project-related marine vessels, which the NEB found would be “significant”, although they constitute a very small percentage relative to total Canadian greenhouse gas emissions (0.06 %, or six ten thousandths). What will be the Effect of the Project on Shipping Traffic? The project would result in in an increase in tanker traffic from 60 per year to about 408 per year (720 additional movements including in and out). Opponents have presented this as an enormous increase, but it needs to be viewed in context. The tanker traffic associated with the project would use the Westridge Terminal, which is near the port of Vancouver. The port of Vancouver now has about 23,000 ship movements a year, and is engaged in public consultations about plans to significantly increase its size. The increase would add more than 5,000 ship movements per year if all the future upgrades were included. This dwarfs the 720 additional ship movements associated with the project. For the TERMPOL Review, the international consulting firm Det Norske Veritas (DNV) performed a thorough review of all the factors that might affect the likelihood of a shipping incident, the possibility and volume of an oil spill, and the likely effects of a spill given all the precautionary and response measures in place. DNR analyzed the risks associated with tanker traffic under three scenarios, one in 2018 without the project, one in 2018 with the project (i.e. assuming it was completed by then), and one in 2028 with the project. Measured in terms of sailed nautical miles, in the first case Trans Mountain tankers would constitute 0.5% of the total 3.8 million miles by all vessels in the Salish Sea and Juan de Fuca Straight. Under the third scenario, in 2018, Trans Mountain tankers would constitute 3.0% of the 4.3 million miles by all vessels in the area. The DNV report concluded that the increase in vessel traffic resulting from the project would have “a negligible effect on the total incident frequency for the region.” The Det Norske Veritas report can be read here:https://transmountain.s3.amazonaws.com/application14/V8C_TERMPOL_REPORTS/1142.html What would be the effects on the risks of a marine oil spill? The TERMPOL Panel found that “the increase in large vessel transits is unlikely to pose a significant safety issue.” It further found that, if all the risk-reducing measures recommended were taken (they were subsequently made mandatory conditions of the NEB certificate), the risk of a worst-case oil spill (estimated to be 16,500 cubic metres) would be one in every 2,366 years. Today, oil transported as cargo in Canadian waters annually totals 192 million tonnes (MT) to the Atlantic coast, 67 MT to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 24 MT to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway and 6 MT to the Pacific coast. So, only 2% of the oil shipped as cargo in Canadian waters goes to the Pacific coast. The largest oil spill off Canada’s east coast was in 1970. The M/V Arrow spilled over 10,000 tonnes off the coast of Nova Scotia, before the era when tankers were required to be double-hulled. The largest oil spill off the British Columbia coast resulted from the sinking of the ferry M/V Queen of the North in 2006; that was only 240 tonnes, 2% of the size of the largest spill off the east coast. Yet the industry and government resources held by the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation and the Canadian Coast Guard on the B.C. coast are already more than 30% larger than what would be needed to deal with a spill of the Arrow size. Does Canada have a world-class regime for avoiding and, if necessary, cleaning up oil spills? In a single word, yes. That applies both in the case of potential spills from onshore oil pipelines and offshore tanker movements. I provided a comprehensive factual description of the pipeline safety regime here: http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/11/27/moving-oil-by-pipeline-examining-the-facts/ Then, I provided a comprehensive factual description of the tanker safety regime here: http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/11/18/moving-oil-by-tanker-in-canada-the-facts/ That’s not all. Transport Canada provided an even more comprehensive and updated response to the issues raised by British Columbia after the province claimed that an expanded marine spill response regime was required. The Transport Canada response refutes almost every claim made by the provincial government and TMPL expansion opponents. You can read it here: https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/our-response-bc-policy-intentions-paper-activities-spill-management.html What about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change? Those who are faced with the facts about the benefits of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project and the minimal risks that it poses to the land and marine environment often fall back onto the position that nothing that increases greenhouse gas emissions should be approved. It is usually useless to challenge the scientific basis of the belief that human carbon dioxide emissions will cause catastrophic global warming a century hence. It has become an article of non-debatable faith for many. Instead, let us examine the position that Canada should not build the TMPL expansion because of its GHG emissions. The harm that greenhouse gas emissions are alleged to cause is not due to the emissions per se, but rather to the accumulated concentrations of carbon dioxide and equivalent gases in the atmosphere. Those accumulations are due to global emissions that have occurred since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution over 150 years ago. It is virtually impossible to attribute any single incremental emission to the changes in cumulative emissions over time, as the cumulative emissions growth is immense and world wide in nature. The total greenhouse gas emissions generated by the expansion project in British Columbia and Alberta were reported to the NEB as just over one million tonnes during the construction phase and 407,000 tonnes per year during the operating phase. The National Energy Board imposed a condition that Trans Mountain develop a plan to offset the entire one million tonnes of construction-period emissions by reductions elsewhere, so that there are no net emissions increases from the construction. This is an unprecedented and onerous condition to place on a pipeline sponsor, but Trans Mountain agreed. The 407,000 tonnes of emissions per year during the operating phase are the equivalent of 0.058% of Canada’s annual emissions, as mentioned previously, barely a rounding error. Is it really credible that Canada should forego tens of thousands of person years of employment and almost $47 billion in revenues for governments that could be spent on public services in order to reduce annual emissions by next to nothing?~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'oil sands', 'TransMountain']",2018/06/07
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/06/05/finding-canadas-energy-policy/,,Finding Canada’s Energy Policy," Contributed by Paul Gagnon © 2018The U. of C’s School of Public Policy group is sponsoring a forum on June 06, 2018, entitled “Bridging Divides: In Search of Sound Public Policies for Energy and Environment in Canada,” to discuss what Canada’s energy policy should be. Energy allows us the standard of life we enjoy, mass production or import of fresh vegetables and heated homes in the winter, air conditioning during the summer, and mobility – driving or flying. And energy abounds in many forms, fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline, and electrical – produced by hydro power, nuclear, solar, wind, or fossil fuels. Before deciding on a public policy, we should try to agree on certain principles. Availability – energy, in all its forms, must be available to satisfy our needs. Canada is a vast country, sparsely populated, with an unforgiving climate. Lack of energy at a critical time could be life threatening.“To obtain in one year the amount of energy contained in one cubic mile of oil, each year for 50 years we would need to have produced the numbers of dams, nuclear power plants, coal plants, windmills, or solar panels shown here.” The world uses 3 Cubic Miles of Oil (CMO) Equivalent Energy every year. One of those Cubic Miles is Oil. The balance of energy supply comes from about 0.8 CMO coal, 0.6 CMO natural gas, 0.2 CMO each nuclear, hydro, biomass/wood, and 0.01 CMO of wind/solar. Affordable – energy is of little value if one cannot afford to buy it. Our standard of living, jobs and industry needs energy at the lowest possible cost – if other countries can supply their needs for less, industry will migrate there. Some Germans have been forced to decide between food and heat because of their rising energy costs. Equality – the rules for one form should be equal to others. For instance, emission standards for imported fuels should equate to domestic sourced. And to tax or subsidize one differently than an alternate must meet a defined need and goal. Safety – production, transmission, and use of energy must be done as safely as possible. We’ve had past disasters such as the Ocean Ranger (1982 oil exploration – 84 dead) and the Springhill (1958 coal mine – 39 dead), but eternal vigilance is in order. It was but 5 years ago that 47 were killed at Lac Magantic P.Q. with a runaway train carrying American crude oil. And safety encompasses emissions harmful to human health, such as sulphur-dioxide, nitrous oxide, and particulates. Regulated – the field of energy is very complicated, in science, in risk, and in costing. Both new and existing facilities need close scrutiny by the best possible minds solely dedicated to that task. Any over-ride of their expert decisions must be done only in the rarest circumstances. Canadian –supplying and transporting energy creates jobs, taxes and wealth. With everything being equal, Canada should be supplying our energy – which means equal rules for foreign and domestic. We’ve recently had different emission regulations for oil supplied by the proposed Energy East than that imported, and a tanker ban for the Pacific Northwest, but not the St. Lawrence!Views on the Influence of CO2 on Climate by Prof. Em. Dr. Dick Thoenes, Eindhoven University The contentious issue is that of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a greenhouse gas (GHG). The theory, proposed by a United Nations committee, is that the burning of fossil fuels which creates CO2, causes a buildup in the atmosphere and traps heat, ultimately causing the earth to warm, and the effects are dire. Think of the earth as a house, the CO2 is extra insulation, and the sun is the furnace. Inherent in this theory are a number of assumptions: grappling with the actions of water vapor, the sun’s heat being constant, the bad effects are greater than the benefits, and past climate changes, caused by nature, can be ignored. Dr. Dick Thones “Views on the Influence of CO2 on Climate” C02 is a trace gas in the atmosphere, but one molecule out of 2500. Another GHG is water vapor, which acts like CO2, but varies immensely in quantity from the humid tropics do the dry deserts and poles – as high as 4 percent (100 times as much CO2) to less than one percent. Both capture heat from the sun with, in part, over-lapping portions of the electro-magnetic wave. Hence, the theory that CO2 will cause the earth to heat, requires assuming both the effects and volumes of water vapor in a changing climate. Svante Arrhenius, father of the ‘hot-house’ theory amended his view in 1906. Warming would be nominal and beneficial.Svante Arrhenius 1906 paper. Also implicit is the assumption that the sun heat is constant. Recent studies have noted that the sun’s heat varies with the number of sun spots, and the sun now has fewer and is less active – hence less heat. The third assumption of this theory is that more CO2 and a warmer planet is bad. CO2 is a plant food, and increased CO2 makes plants, not only grow faster, but requiring less water. Are the recent record grain crops only due to more fertilizer and genetic modifications? The fourth assumption of this theory is the current climate is the ideal, and one that we must fight to maintain. Geology tells us the earth has been much warmer, and much colder in the past. Both science (ice cores) and history tell us that we were much warmer 1000 years ago, when the Vikings settled Greenland, only to be chased out during the “little ice age” (1300 – 1850) – long before industrialization yielded CO2. The atmosphere is global and any solution must also be global. Some of the nations, including Canada, agreed to cut their CO2 emissions with the Paris Agreement. Both China and India, two huge emitters, are exempt until 2030, and the USA has announced withdrawal. So, no matter what Canada does to cut its CO2, the world will continue to add it to the atmosphere.  See: International Energy Agency 2017 – Summary of Global Energy and CO2 Status With Canada imposing a “carbon” tax, and its biggest trading partner (USA) rejecting hurting their economy with a carbon tax, our peoples and our industry have an unfair handicap in paying higher prices for energy – electricity, gasoline and natural gas. The end result will be a much lower standard of living for Canadians. The current public policy is one to accede to the Paris Accord, cutting our CO2 emissions drastically, much to our detriment, and not succeeding in the task of lowering global CO2.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/29/two-coasts-two-solitudes/,Graydon Tranquilla ,"Two Coasts, Two Solitudes"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years. For anyone who thinks that Canada’s regional “diversity” rests mainly on the historic difference between the language, culture and elites of French and English in the central part of the country, the disparities in conditions and beliefs about oil transportation on the east and west coasts offers a new perspective. Consider the facts about the tankers that transfer crude oil to and from Canada. Oil tankers have been used to transport large quantities of oil across the oceans for over 100 years. Today, roughly 60% of all oil transported around the world travels by tanker. An oil tanker’s capacity is measured by its size in deadweight tonnes (DWT). The capacities range from a few thousand DWT to Ultra-Large Crude Carriers (ULCCs) of up 550,000 DWT. Ports in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec receive tankers up to ULCC size on a regular basis. Almost all tankers operating off the British Columbia coast are Aframax size, with a maximum of 120,000 DWT. Thus, the tankers serving east coast ports are often four times larger that those serving west coast ports. Transport Canada estimates that there are about 20,000 oil tanker movements off the coasts of Canada each year. Of these, approximately 17,000 (85%) are on the Atlantic coast. Oil transported as cargo in Canadian waters annually totals 192 million tonnes (MT) to the Atlantic coast, 67 MT to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 24 MT to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway and 6MT to the Pacific coast. So, only 2% of the oil shipped as cargo in Canadian waters goes to the Pacific coast. Tankers currently represent about 2% of total ship traffic visiting the Port of Vancouver (out of 250 total vessels per month, about 5 are tankers). The largest oil spill off Canada’s coast was in 1970. The M/V Arrow spilled over 10,000 tonnes off the coast of Nova Scotia, before the era when tankers were required to be double-hulled. The west coast’s largest spill was 240 tonnes caused by the sinking of the M/V The Queen of the North in 2006; that was a fuel oil spill. The largest west coast spill was thus 2.4% of the largest east coast spill. Over the last decade, marine oil spills in Canada have been so small that they are measured not in tonnes or in barrels, but in litres. Yet, virtually all of the public controversy and demands for reduced tanker traffic is on the west coast. Does this have to do with reality or politics?Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Crude Oil', 'oil', 'oil sands', 'TransMountain']",2018/05/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/24/being-honest-about-alberta-oil-sands-and-trans-mountain/,,Being Honest About Alberta Oil Sands and Trans Mountain," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and was a public servant for 27 years, and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.On May 20, 2016 the Globe and Mail published an opinion piece by Wal Van Lierop, President and CEO of Chrysalix Venture Capital, in which he likened the history of energy markets to a baseball game. He compared the present phase to the fourth inning, in which new abundant sources of energy will win out against higher cost sources of supply, including oil sands. He then went on to question the rationale for Kinder Morgan’s proposed (and federal government-certificated) Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion on the grounds that there will not be enough demand for the crude oil and refined products it will transport. He concluded that Alberta must get into “a better game”.Reference screenshot of the story Robert Lyman is rebutting.There are many clouds on the horizon for the Trans Mountain Expansion project, but it is not helpful to imagine some that are not there.Let us address Mr. Van Lierop’s points one at a time.As to the assurance of markets for the crude oil, Kinder Morgan would never have invested over $1 billion in promoting the pipeline so far and gone through a draconian regulatory approval review system if it were not persuaded that the producers would sell and the Pacific Rim refiners would buy. What would make one think that an investment analyst outside the company would know better? After all, whose money is on the line? It sure isn’t his.Second, during the three and a half years of detailed regulatory review and public hearings on the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, the National Energy Board delved deeply into the market for the crude oil and the refined oil products that the expansion would carry, as part of its due diligence on whether there was a “need” for the project. The documentary evidence is there in spades for anyone who wishes to read it, and the NEB addressed it in detail in its report, which one can read here.https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p80061/114562E.pdf Why would we have an independent, expert, professional regulatory body do that and then have the government review its findings if we were prepared to succumb to the second-guessing of external investment analysts?Third, most of the crude oil that the project would transport is either already in production or soon will be from project expansions whose construction has been underway for years. The production is economic at current prices, in fact even at the heavily discounted current prices because of pipeline bottlenecks. That will not change.Fourth, what are this analyst’s qualifications to assess future international crude oil prices? I spent about a decade of my career trying to play in that game and I certainly never got it right. I do know that global oil demand has been growing at the annual rate of 1.2 million barrels per day since 2012 and that trend shows no sign of abating. That is the fastest and most prolonged rate of oil demand growth in history. Add in geopolitical factors (Iran, Venezuela, Russia, etc.) and what does that suggest about near-term oil prices?Fifth, China is not the only Pacific market for oil sands production. It is the entire Pacific Rim. A recent report by Stratas Advisors estimated that crude oil distillation capacity in the Asia-Pacific region was 34.5 million b/d as of January 1, 2017 and that announced refinery expansion projects will add about 6 million b/d over the period 2017-2020 and another 6 million b/d over the period 2020-2025. A summary of the Stratus report can be read here:https://stratasadvisors.com/Insights/062117-Asia-Pacific-Refinery-CapacityThe only pitchers that may take Trans Mountain out of the ball game are the governments that have to date mismanaged the review, certification and permitting of this important strategic infrastructure. The markets will not do so.~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'KinderMorgan', 'TransMountain']",2018/05/24
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/13/the-trans-mountain-expansion-project-too-much-shipping/,,The Trans Mountain Expansion Project – Too Much Shipping?," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant. He was a public servant for 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years.The Trans Mountain Expansion Project involves a pipeline and marine component that has operated from around Edmonton, Alberta to the Vancouver and Puget Sound regions for 65 years. The project, if approved, would result in an increase of oil tanker traffic from 60 to 408 tankers per year (720 additional movements including in and out), in an area in which tanker traffic represents a small portion of the overall vessel traffic. The opponents to the project have attempted to focus attention on any and all aspects that might increase public alarm about the potential environmental impacts. The purpose of this article is to provide a “checklist” of points that counter the claim that the increase in oil tanker traffic resulting from the project poses an unacceptable risk. While the port of Vancouver is one of Canada’s largest, by world standards it is not that busy. The port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands handles eight times the volume of vessel traffic and tanker traffic of Vancouver. The volume of shipping traffic in the area of the project is only one of dozens of factors that affect the likelihood of a shipping incident, the possibility and volume of an oil spill, and the likely effects of a spill given all the precautionary and response measures in place. A thorough review of all these factors was conducted by the Transport Canada-led TERMPOL Review Process, using data and analysis from many sources including notably a study carried out by Det Norske Veritas (DNV). Readers interested in seeing all the technical details should consult the report of the TERMPOL Panel and the DNV report available online. The tanker traffic associated with the project would use the Westridge Terminal, which is near the Port of Vancouver. The port of Vancouver now has about 23,000 ship movements a year, and is engaged in public consultations about plans to increase its size. This would add an estimated 5,000+ more ship movements a year if all the future upgrades were included. This dwarfs the 700 additional ship movements associated with the project. DVR analyzed the risks associated with tanker traffic under three scenarios, one in 2018 without the project, one in 2018 with the project (i.e. assuming it was completed by then), and one in 2028 with the project. Measured in terms of sailed nautical miles, in the first case Trans Mountain tankers would constitute 0.5% of the total 3.8 million miles by all vessels in the Salish Sea and Juan de Fuca Straight. Under the third scenario, in 2028, Trans Mountain tankers would constitute 3.0% of the 4.3 million miles by all vessels in this area. All oil tankers, including those associated with the project and others transporting crude oil and refined oil products would constitute 8.3% of the miles. The DNV report concluded that the increase in vessel traffic resulting from the project would have “a negligible effect on the total incident frequency for the region”. The TERMPOL Panel found that “the increase in large vessel transits is unlikely to pose a significant safety issue”. The maximum size of the tankers calling at the Westridge Terminal will, as now, be Aframax class (80,000 deadweight tonnes to 120,000 deadweight tonnes), all double-hulled as required by international and Canadian standards. The Termpol report found that, if all the risk reducing measures recommended were taken (they were subsequently made mandatory conditions of the National Energy Board certificate), the risk of a worst case oil spill (estimated to be 16,500 cubic metres) would be one in every 2,366 years. This is 30% higher than if the project did not take place. One should not make too much of this. Thirty per cent of almost zero is still almost zero.~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'British Columbia', 'climate change', 'KinderMorgan', 'TransMountain', 'Uncategorized']",2018/05/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/13/ending-secret-science-at-epa/,,Ending secret science at EPA," Administrator Pruitt initiates overdue changes to bring transparency, integrity to rulemakingContributed by Paul Driessen © 2018Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has proposed to end the longstanding EPA practice of using secretive, often questionable, even deceptive science to support agency policy and regulatory initiatives. His proposed rules will ensure that any science underlying agency actions is transparent and publicly available for independent experts to examine and validate – or point out its flaws.It also responds to growing concerns that extensive scientific research in environmental, medical and other arenas cannot be replicated by other scientists, or is compromised by cherry-picked data, poor research design, sloppy analysis or biased researchers. The situation has led to calls for increased sharing of data and methodologies, more independent peer review and other actions to weed out problems. There is no excuse for hiding data when studies are funded by taxpayers or used to justify regulations.The situation has been especially acute at EPA. As Mr. Pruitt observed, “The ability to test, authenticate and reproduce scientific findings is vital for the integrity of the rule making process. Americans deserve to assess the legitimacy of the science underpinning EPA decisions that may impact their lives.”That is particularly true for regulations that exact millions or billions in compliance costs, affect thousands of jobs, target industries and coal-fired electricity generators that regulators want to close down, or seek to replace all fossil fuel use with “renewable” energy. With the cumulative economic impact of federal regulations reaching nearly $2 trillion per year, research reform is absolutely essential.We need regulation and pollution control – but it must be based on solid, replicable, honest science.Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) has held hearings and championed multiple bills to address the problem. Several have been passed by the House of Representatives, only to languish in the Senate. With courts offering little or no help, Executive Branch action may be the only remaining solution.Deceptive, faulty science on fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) was the bedrock of the Obama EPA’s war on coal. Particulates don’t just make you sick; they are directly related “to dying sooner than you should,” EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson falsely told Congress. There is no level “at which premature mortality effects do not occur,” Mr. Obama’s next Administrator Gina McCarthy dishonestly testified.At the same time they made these claims, they were presiding over illegal experiments on humans – including people with asthma, diabetes and heart disease – who were subjected to eight, 30 or even 60 times more particulates per volume, for up to two hours, than what EPA claimed are dangerous or lethal. None of them got sick, proving that EPA’s claims were false. The agency refused to correct its claims.EPA took a similar stance on mercury – asserting that power plant emissions were causing dangerously high mercury levels in American children and pregnant women. In reality, US power plants account for just 0.5% of all the mercury in the air Americans breathe, and blood mercury counts for US women and children are well below even EPA’s excessively safe levels, according to the Centers for Disease Control.How did EPA’s junk science, illegal experiments and heavy-handed regulations pass muster? For one thing, politics too often dictated the science. In addition, the agency paid more than $180 million over a 16-year period to institutions represented by members of its Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), which often rubberstamped studies and conclusions that failed integrity and transparency tests.On global warming, EPA issued an Endangerment Finding, which claimed emissions of (plant-fertilizing) carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels threatened the health and welfare of American citizens.It reached this conclusion by looking only at studies and computer models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, while ignoring volumes of studies by independent scientists who found no such threat. EPA officials even told a senior experts at the agency that his studies would not be shared with agency staff and he was to cease any further work on climate change, because his analyses “do not help the legal or policy case for this decision” that fossil fuel CO2 emissions endanger Americans.EPA was also a principal force behind the “social cost of carbon” scheme that supposedly calculated how much CO2-driven climate change would cost the United States and how those costs would be reduced by slashing fossil fuel use. The alleged cost of damages began at an arbitrary $22 per ton of carbon dioxide released in 2010, then climbed to an equally random $30 per ton in 2013 and $40 per ton in 2016.Incredibly, EPA modelers also claimed they can accurately forecast global temperatures, climate and weather, technological advances, economic development, living standards – and damages to global civilizations and ecosystems from US carbon dioxide emissions – for the next 300 years! Moreover, in the real world, the benefits of using carbon-based fuels and improving crop, forest and grassland growth via higher atmospheric CO2 levels outweigh hypothesized costs by at least 50-to-1 to as much as 500-to-1.Deceptive, politicized, policy-driven “science” like this pervaded EPA regulatory actions for too many years. Reaction to Mr. Pruitt’s corrective actions show how poorly informed his critics can be.* The changes will force researchers to reveal personal or confidential information about participants in health studies. No they won’t. Such information is not needed and can easily be redacted.* EPA can keep us safe from harmful chemicals only if it takes full advantage of all available scientific research. Public health and safety depend on ensuring that research and data purportedly supporting it are made public and carefully reviewed by multiple experts, to ensure accuracy and integrity. EPA will take full advantage of all available research that passes these tests. Tax-funded studies should all be public!* The rules will exclude studies that rely on outside funding sources which limit access to underlying data. Those studies should be excluded. The funders need to revise their policies to ensure integrity.* The rules will exclude so much research that they will endanger public health. Not so. The only studies EPA will likely not see is what researchers know will not pass muster, and thus do not submit. The real danger comes from research that is based on shoddy data, algorithms, models and analyses that past researchers have been able to keep secret. That is precisely what the rules will ferret out and correct.* Pruitt has removed scientists who receive EPA funding from participating in advisory committees. As noted above, those scientists had received millions of dollars in exchange for supporting EPA analyses, initiatives and regulations. Pruitt wants input from experts whose views can be trusted.* Pruitt has criticized the peer review process. Too many peer reviews have been conducted by closed circles of associated scientists who rely on government grants and support regulatory decisions to maintain funding. Some refused to share data with experts who might critique their work – or worked to keep contrarian research out of scientific journals. The fact that some journals rarely require access to or review of underlying data further demonstrates why the peer review process also needs to be reformed.Too many past EPA policies, policy-driven research and regulations have been employed to force the nation to abandon fossil fuels that still supply 80% of US and global energy – and switch to expensive, intermittent, unreliable wind and solar energy installations that will require unsustainable amounts of land and raw materials, while destroying wildlife habitats and slaughtering birds and bats by the millions.Those actions also killed numerous jobs and left many communities impoverished. Simply put, the danger to Americans’ health and welfare, livelihoods and living standards is regulations imposed in response to secretive, sloppy, substandard science that has ill-served EPA and the nation.“Ethics” charges against Mr. Pruitt should be evaluated with all this in mind – and while acknowledging that members of Congress who are railing against him never complained about Lisa Jackson or Gina McCarthy’s CASAC payment abuses, illegal experiments on human test subjects, false testimony about particulates, EPA-orchestrated sue-and-settle lawsuits that imposed billions in regulations while enriching environmentalist groups … and junk-science regulations that cost the United States incalculable billions of dollars, brought no environmental benefits, and impaired the welfare of millions of people.Pruitt’s reforms are long overdue. Honest politicians, journalists and voters will applaud him and them. Other government agencies should initiate similar science and rulemaking reforms.Paul Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (www.CFACT.org) and author of books and articles on energy and environmental policy.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Uncategorized', 'US EPA']",2018/05/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/13/how-reliant-on-fossils-fuels-are-people-in-ontario/,,How Reliant on Fossils Fuels are People In Ontario?," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant.  He was a public servant for 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years.Blair King is a professional chemist and consultant who conducts risk analysis, as well as remediation analysis, of environmental hazards in British Columbia. He is also the author of several articles that have appeared on his blog, “A Chemist in Langley” and in print media such as the Huffington Post. Reading his articles is a pleasure for those who value sound, objective analysis based on facts. While he cares deeply about environmental quality, he courageously challenges the claims of environmental organizations and politicians when they depart from sound science and economics. I greatly admire his writing and his demonstrated integrity in the face of severe criticism from powerful advocates. Thus, I hope that Mr. King will not object if I borrow an idea of his and apply it to a different context. In September 2016, Mr. King wrote a blog article in which he figuratively asked how reliant people in British Columbia are on fossil fuels. He invited his readers to follow along with him in thinking through a scenario in which some “mystical power” arrived on earth and, using some unknown technology, eliminated all fossil fuels from the planet instantaneously. As a thought experiment, he tried to answer the question, “What would happen?” with special reference to British Columbia. In what follows, I will repeat his thought experiment, but with reference to Ontario, where I live. The National Energy Board occasionally publishes provincial and territorial energy profiles, in which it analyzes the energy supply and demand conditions in each Canadian jurisdiction. In its most recent profile of Ontario, it noted that, while most of the province’s electricity generation is based on non-fossil fuel sources (mainly nuclear and hydroelectric energy), in 2016 the breakdown of end-use demand by fuel was: refined petroleum products, 1,402 petajoules (PJ), or 46%; natural gas 919 PJ, or 30%; electricity, 494 PJ, or 16%; biofuels, 130 PJ, or 4%; and other, 104 PJ, or 3%. Including the share of natural gas as a source of electricity generation, fossil fuels thus accounted for about 77% of Ontario’s energy demand. On day one without fossil fuels, all transportation systems (except a few electrically powered streetcars and a few thousand electric vehicles) would immediately stop. Stores would stop receiving supplies, as all supplies are transported from warehouses by gasoline or diesel-powered transport trucks. No new supplies would get to the warehouses, as the semi trucks that transport them depend on diesel fuel, as do railway systems.  Transport aircraft rely on aviation and jet fuel, and container ships rely on bunker fuel or diesel. Soon, the people living in urban areas like Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, London and Windsor would be first bidding for, and then fighting over, the remaining scraps in the stores. Once those supplies were gone, there would be nothing to replace them. There simply are not enough horses or horse-drawn wagons to move goods and food from the rural areas into the cities. Someone may argue that electric vehicles would save the day. In 2017, electric vehicles represented less than 1% of new vehicle sales in Canada. Ontario has exactly zero electric transport trucks that can carry long-haul freight. The number of electric freight trains is just like that of electric trucks – zero. The same for ships or cargo planes – zero anywhere in the world. After a few weeks, people would have exhausted their supplies of canned goods. General hunger, then starvation, would begin to set in. That would not necessarily be the worst problem. Potable water supplies and electricity supplied depend on diesel for pumps, and people with trucks maintain the electrical system. Without those pumps and trucks, the electricity supply would end and people would have to get water from rivers and lakes, if any were nearby. This assumes that the ending of fossil fuels happens during the warmer weather months. If it happened in winter, people would have to cut down local trees and forests to burn for warmth and chop through the ice on rivers and lakes to get water supplies. Getting wood and ice back to one’s home would be a perilous experience. Within a couple of months (weeks if in winter), the city-centres would look like a scene from an apocalyptic science fiction movie, with corpses everywhere as the weakest lost out in battle for the quickly diminishing supplies of food, water and wood. Without working toilets and sewer systems, those still alive would be fighting dysentery, as human waste polluted the limited freshwater supplies. Anyone who could would move away from the city centres as quickly as possible to forage as far as they could roam on foot and on the remaining bicycles (the horses having been eaten). The Greater Toronto area would be most savagely affected, as the large number of people there would stream out in every direction. There, they would discover that everything edible (from plant to animal) had long since been eaten by the people who live in the surrounding urban areas, who themselves would be streaming out into the Niagara peninsula and the areas east, west and north of the metropolis. Few would survive. The remaining settlements, if any, in the rural areas would be forced to hoard food supplies behind barricaded walls to keep the marauding survivors from the larger cities at bay. Within a few months, or by the end of the winter, over 95 per cent of today’s Ontario urban population would have died from the lack of clean water and food, leaving a small minority fighting it out for the remaining crops. In the developing countries, the 7.5 billion people now alive would be reduced to a few hundred thousand, who would be living in subsistence-level communities that were sufficiently isolated that they avoided the attention and attacks of the refugees from the cities. Survivors would eat most of the animals and much of the plant life. These would take hundreds of years to regenerate their populations. This is the point of this thought-experiment. We remain extraordinarily dependent on oil, natural gas and coal for the energy services upon which modern life depends. When advocates claim that we can soon do away with fossil fuels, or that a transition away from fossil fuels would be quick and low–cost, be very skeptical.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Ontario', 'Uncategorized']",2018/05/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/13/climate-adaptation-reparation-and-restoration/,,"Climate adaptation, reparation and restoration"," Boulder, CO wants oil companies to restore snowy winters of an idyllic past – and pay it billionsContributed by Paul Driessen © 2018This Earth Day (April 22) we need to ask whether environmentalism has gone completely bonkers.Back in the 1970s, I skied Colorado’s cross-country and downhill slopes pretty regularly. Some years were incredible: many feet of snow as glorious to behold as to ski on. Other years, like 1977, I’d come around a bend on my XC skis, see nothing but rock in front of me, and just ditch.Who knew the industry I worked for in the later 70s was causing these climate and weather mood swings – even then, long before carbon dioxide levels hit the cataclysmic 400 ppm mark? Who knew profit-hungry oil companies were already preventing the Centennial State from having endless seasons of perfect ski conditions, followed by ample spring meltwater for cities, agriculture and trout streams?I ask this because the People’s Republic of Boulder, CO has joined Oakland, San Francisco, New York and other liberal enclaves in suing for “climate relief.” Boulder doesn’t share the CA/NY worries about rising seas. Even Al Gore doesn’t claim the Pacific Ocean will reach the Mile High City anytime soon.Boulderites want the courts to force ExxonMobil and Suncor to pay treble damages for causing too much snow and thus floods in some years, too little snow and thus droughts and poor ski conditions in other years; multiple heat waves in some years, bitter cold in others. They seek unspecified cash for climate adaptation, repair and reparation expenses – and restoration of idyllic conditions of selected past years.Their 106-page, 478-paragraph complaint (with scores of sub-paragraphs) alleges that oil companies have committed public and private nuisance, trespass, continued sales of “huge amounts of fossil fuels,” and willful concealment of known harm from those sales – all to the great detriment of Boulder citizens.These are the same fuels that saved whales from imminent extinction and gave Boulder and humanity prosperity, technology, health and longevity no one could even imagine when Colorado became a state in 1876. But now they’re suing the companies that have provided reliable, affordable fuels and raw materials that have brought them lights, heat, livelihoods, living standards, and countless products from paints, plastics, pharmaceuticals and fertilizers to skis, ski parkas, and vehicle fuel and asphalt roads to ski areas.No wonder Para. 476 pointedly says “plaintiffs do not seek to enjoin any oil and gas operations or sales in Colorado.” To paraphrase Para. 453: plaintiffs received immense benefits from defendants’ products and actions, and it would be unconscionable and contrary to equity for plaintiffs to retain those benefits. Before collecting a dime, plaintiffs should reject future benefits and pay Exxon for past benefits received.As to alleged fossil fuel damages in the form of wildfires and beetle kills, perhaps Boulder and its Sierra Club allies could employ better forest management – such as thinning trees, removing dead and diseased trees, and spraying to control pine bark beetles. It would be equally salubrious if they would stop abusing gullible children – by having little Sequoia berate Exxon for causing floods, fires and less snow.As to the allegation that Exxon and Suncor have deprived Boulder of its once-snowy climate, the area’s annual snowfall records demonstrate how ludicrous the claim is. Then there’s this snow, and this record!Its heaviest calendar year snow was 159 inches in 1997; the worst was 36 inches in 1904. It had over 100 inches 20 times since 1897, including 11 times since 1970 and four times over 125 inches since 1985. It had under 50 inches 11 times since 1897: six times 1904 to1943, just three since 1970, and none under 61 inches since 1982. Anyone who sees a rising CO2/lower snowfall connection is smoking too much ganja.So where does Boulder get the evidence to back up its allegations? As Alfonso Bedoya might have told Humphrey Bogart in a climate change version of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, “We don’t have to show you any stinking evidence!” Instead of evidence, the city has assertions, a phony 97% consensus that fossil fuels are causing dangerous manmade climate change, a report saying Boulder will have more heat waves and less snow by 2050, and computer models that supposedly back up the report.In the real world, the 20-year temperature “pause” is back, the sun’s “quiet phase” may be reaching a “grand solar minimum,” and actual temperature, hurricane and other data contradict climate model predictions and scenarios. In fact, the models are little more than high-tech circular reasoning.Since they are based on the assertion that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels drive global warming, Garbage In-Garbage Out models will always generate the calamities that alarmist researchers and Boulder lawyers are blaming on Big Oil. Where reality contradicts models, reality must be wrong – and actual temperature measurements must be adjusted to reflect model outputs and dominant climate theory.When did the sun and other natural forces cease being a factor? What caused the ice ages, interglacial periods, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age and Anasazi drought? Questions like these are off limits.Indeed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and dominant, government-funded climate research have gone from seeking to identify human influences on Earth’s climate … to decreeing that only human influences matter, natural forces no longer play a meaningful role, and humans can control climate and weather by eliminating fossil fuels and regulating atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.Those assertions now have the unwavering support of an entire industry – the $1.5-trillion-per-year Climate Industrial Complex: politicians, regulators, researchers, industrialists and activists, who protect and advance alarmist claims, promote allegedly “renewable” energy, resist examination and reform, and denounce anyone who questions climate chaos orthodoxy as “planet-threatening climate change deniers.”Arrayed against the contingency fee seeking Boulder legal team is an oil industry whose spokesmen offer timid tripe: “Lawsuits like this do not solve the global problem of climate change.” It should be up to “appropriate regulatory agencies,” instead of judges, to decide how much CO2 a company may emit. Oil companies “should not be subject to liability for engaging in acts of commerce while adhering to our already stringent state and federal laws.” Can’t we have a more robust defense on the merits?Boulder and its allied cities and counties have little reason to worry that their absurd assertions will be challenged on the merits in court. But they don’t even care about winning their case. They just hope Exxon and Suncor will pay them a few hundred million bucks – and pave the way for more lawsuits.In fact, a 2016 “Lawyers for Better Business” report said climate lawsuits will soon “dwarf all other litigation in terms of the number of plaintiffs and the timeframe in which it can happen.” It’s likely to become a global industry, “with much bigger damages than seen with tobacco and asbestos.”How else will profligate progressive politicians pay for all the welfare programs that keep them in power?Such is the sorry state of US and international politics, education, science and jurisprudence.What alternatives do these litigants and activists offer for the fossil fuel, nuclear and hydroelectric energy they want to ban? They seem to think the billions of tons of lithium, cobalt, iron, copper, manganese, rare earth metals, concrete and other raw materials needed for millions of wind turbines and solar panels are somehow “renewable” – and blanketing the planet with wind and solar installations is eco-friendly.They seem convinced that it’s better for Planet Earth to ban drilling, and instead convert another billion acres of crop and habitat land into gigantic biofuel plantations. In fact, this year’s Earth Day organizers want future plastics to come from non-hydrocarbon sources – which would mean plowing under hundreds of millions more acres to grow crops for petrochemical feed stocks.This is sheer lunacy. It’s the product of the fear, loathing, despair, intolerance and groupthink that pervade Big Green environmentalism today.Will the Scott Pruitt EPA finally reverse the ridiculous Endangerment Finding that is yet another foundation for this climate nonsense? Will Neil Gorsuch be the deciding vote that brings a modicum of sanity back to our Supreme Court and legal system?

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/13/andrew-sheers-flawed-climate-policy/,Ken ,Andrew Sheer’s Flawed Climate Policy," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years. Executive SummaryIn a recent interview, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Sheer promised that before the next national election his party will publish a ‘detailed and comprehensive plan” to attain Canada’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, and this plan will not include carbon taxes. These comments demonstrate a shallow understanding of the “global warming” issues and of the dangers to Canada of the radical environmentalism that encourages the adoption of such targets. The Conservative Party has long opposed the imposition of carbon taxes (or “carbon pricing”, the term referring to emissions trading systems) because it recognizes that Canadians generally oppose higher taxes as a solution to any problem and that new, onerous taxes will severely impair the competitiveness of Canadian firms, especially when our major trading partner, the United States, is reducing taxes. Some economists favour carbon taxes on theoretical grounds as potentially more efficient and fair than the wide scale use of regulations, subsidies and other government measures that seek to engineer changes in Canadians’ energy consumption habits. They also argue that a “revenue-neutral” carbon tax regime, in which all the revenues collected were reinjected back into the economy through reductions in other tax rates, could actually promote economic development. Governments, however, have no plans to eliminate all the other intrusive measures or to forego the opportunity to spend a carbon tax revenue windfall on new programs that benefit their supporters. The real question that the Conservative Party should focus its policy attentions on is whether the costs of emissions reduction, at the levels implied by Canada’s current targets, match the benefits. In fact, contrary to the general perception, Canada is not bound by the COP21 Agreement signed in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions by any specific amount. The present targets are entirely political, and there is no legal penalty for not meeting them. This is fortunate, as none of the international emissions reduction targets that have been set since global warming first became a prominent issue in 1988 have ever been met. In fact, global GHG emissions in 2016 were 55% higher than they were in 1990 when the first targets were adopted. The present Canadian political commitments are that Canada will reduce emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. There are two ways to achieve cuts of this magnitude. One is through a severe economic recession as serious as that experienced from 2007 to 2009, only extended for the next decade. The other is by eliminating almost all energy consumption, and therefore economic activity, in one or more of the following sectors – oil and gas production, industrial activity, transportation, agriculture or buildings. To give some sense of how major and costly is the transformation involved, eliminating every single car, SUV and pick-up truck used for personal transportation would reduce emissions by only 11.5%, taking us only slightly more than one-third of the way to the 2030 target. The reality is that there are no options that are technically and economically feasible, and likely to be politically acceptable to the Canadian public, to meet the 2030 target. There also would be no environmental benefits in doing so. Canada constitutes only 1.6% of global emissions, and all of the world’s emissions growth is taking place in the developing countries, and especially in Asia. While the United Nations claims that global emissions must decline to 16 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050, all of the authoritative sources on global energy supply and demand trends project emissions to rise sharply from today’s level of 32 Gt, driven by the desire of the world’s population for economic development. Andrew Sheer may believe that his party will gain more votes by aligning itself with those who believe that emissions growth will lead to environmental problems a century hence than it will lose by betraying those, especially in western Canada, who today experience firsthand the effects of global warming alarmism. In fact, he may be seriously under-estimating the long-term political fallout of such cynicism. Worse, embracing emissions targets that will not, indeed cannot, be met will earn the Conservatives no friends among the radical environmentalists, simply lock the party forever into trying to appease their new but unforgiving allies.A full discussion of Robert Lyman’s analysis follows. This short video clip interview with Robert Lyman outlines the challenges of reducing greenhouse gases to meet Paris targets. Andrew Sheer’s Flawed Climate PolicyIn a recent interview on CTV, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Sheer expressed his party’s strong opposition to a federal carbon tax but promised that before the next election the Conservatives will publish a “detailed and comprehensive plan” to attain Canada’s existing emissions reduction targets because “Canada has to be part of the solution”. He is quoted as saying that “We all have an obligation to pass on a better environment to our kids. I’ve got five kids, I want them to have a cleaner environment.” These comments demonstrate a shallow understanding of the “global warming” issue and of the dangers to Canada of the radical environmentalism associated with it. They constitute bad policy and even worse politics. Carbon Taxes Are Not the IssueThe Conservative Party has long publicly opposed the imposition of carbon taxes on Canadian residents, whether in the form of direct taxes or carbon prices resulting from the use of “cap and trade” (i.e. Emission Trading Systems). This opposition appeals both to Canadians’ contempt for higher taxes as a solution to any problem and to the genuine risks posed by higher taxes on the competitiveness of Canadian firms when our major trading partner, the United States, is reducing taxes. There is a vigorous debate among economists about the use of carbon taxes to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Supporters argue that, by raising taxes on fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal), governments will provide an incentive to reduce energy use and emissions; this incentive will affect all fossil fuel users and be transparent in its effects. Doing so through the price mechanism is more economically efficient and fair than doing so through the use of subsidy programs, regulations, and other government intrusions into the economy that have to be operated by large numbers of public servants and end up treating every industry and every person differently. This assumes, of course, that in introducing carbon taxes a government would eliminate all or most of the existing subsidies, programs and regulations. Governments have no intention of doing this. Proponents also argue that the revenues received from carbon taxes, if “recycled” back into the economy through reductions in other broadly based taxes like sales taxes or income taxes, may actually stimulate economic growth. According to a recent worldwide survey of the use of carbon taxes, over 70% of the revenues were used to fund other new programs, not reduce the tax burden on citizens. In practice, carbon taxes have been a revenue grab. (1) Andrew Scheer, in rejecting carbon taxes and prices as means to reduce GHG emissions but endorsing the attainment of the targets, has implicitly chosen to use a vague collection of regulations, subsidies and government programs to alter the Canadian energy economy. This amounts to “more of the same” of the hundreds of government regulations and programs now in place. The result is a massive, expensive and intrusive set of government interventions into the energy marketplace based on the presumption that governments know better than their citizens which energy sources should be used and that reducing GHG emissions is more important than anything else. No one has ever even attempted to estimate the cost of this because the interventions are so pervasive; they surely run to several billion dollars per year. Worse, they are almost certainly more expensive than carbon taxes. (2) The real question to which the Conservative Party should turn its attention is whether the costs of emissions reduction, at the levels implied by Canada’s current emission reduction targets, match the benefits of doing so. Canada is Not Legally Committed to Reduce Emissions Andrew Scheer appears to be under the impression, widely promoted in the media, that the 2015 U.N. Conference of the Parties Agreement (COP21) requires Canada to reduce GHG emissions. This is not true. COP21 actually has very few legally binding provisions, and reducing emissions is not one of them. The COP21 agreement also contains no penalties for non-compliance. (3) It is largely a hollow agreement masquerading as a treaty. There are only two significant political commitments embedded in the agreement. One is to submit an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (IDNC) plan for emissions reduction every five years.  The other is that “Annex 2” countries, including Canada, must make contributions to the Green Climate Fund. The latter fund is intended to help finance emissions reductions and climate adaptation measures in developing countries. The level of contribution to the fund is supposed to be at least $100 billion per year starting in 2020, but there is no agreement either on the allocation of contribution obligations among donors or the distribution of the funds among recipient developing countries. Many of the developing countries have stated that their INDC emissions reduction plans were contingent on receiving their desired levels of funds from the Green Climate Fund. The decision of the United States to withdraw from the COP21 Agreement, and thus from funding the Green Climate Fund, made it virtually certain that the Fund would not meet the developing countries demands. It helps to place in historical context the claims that Canada must abide by international targets. In 1990, global carbon dioxide emissions were 21.5 gigatonnes (GT). Since that time, there have been a series of multilateral agreements to reduce emissions. In 1990 it was agreed to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels by 2000; in 1997, it was agreed to reduce emissions by at least 5% from 1990 levels by 2010; at the 2010 U.N. Climate Conference in Cancun, several countries agreed to deeper emissions cuts. Canada, for example, agreed politically to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. Some European countries have agreed to reduce emissions by 40% below 2010 levels by 2030. The IPCC and several environmental groups are arguing that it will be necessary to reduce emissions by at least 50% below 2010 levels by 2050, and to eliminate emissions entirely by 2100 if “catastrophic warming” is to be avoided. Every multilateral target set to date has been missed. By 2000, emissions were 23.0 gigatonnes (GT), by 2010 they were 31.5 GT and by 2016 they were 33.4 GT. (4) So, between 1990 and 2016, global emissions increased by 11.9 GT, or about 55%. Based on the experience of the last 28 years, emissions reduction targets adopted at international conferences can be regarded as political statements aimed at local “green” voters and not as serious commitments. What would it take to meet the Canadian Emissions Targets?According to statistics from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Canada’s GHG emissions were 611 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt) in 1990. They rose to 638 Mt in 2005 and 722 Mt in 2015. The emission reduction goals are therefore 530 Mt by 2020, 447 Mt by 2030 and (using the 80% reduction target) 122 Mt by 2050.The following table shows the most recent sectorial breakdown.Canada’s GHG Emissions by Sector in 2015Sector Emissions (Mt)PercentageOil and Gas189.526.2Transportation173.024.0Buildings 85.611.9Electricity78.710.9Heavy Industry74.610.3Agriculture72.810.1Waste and others47.66.6Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada (5) To attain the 2020 target of 530 Mt, emissions would have to decline by 192 Mt from 722 Mt in 2015, an average of 38.4 Mt per year. The only years since 1990 when emissions dropped by anything comparable to that was during the worldwide economic crisis period 2007-2009, when emissions declined by 61 Mt, or an average of 30.5 Mt per year. We would need to have a far more serious economic crisis extending from 2015 to 2020 to place us on the path to meeting the 2020 target. Fortunately, this is not happening. Looking further out to the 2030 Canadian target of 447 Mt, this would require a reduction of 275 Mt, or an average of 18.3 Mt per year from 2015. Apart from the worst recession years, that has not happened in the past. In the absence of a prolonged recession, from where might emission reductions of that magnitude come? Let us examine the possibilities. There has been a sharp reduction in coal-fired electricity generation. Consequently, emissions from coal declined from a peak of 106.4 Mt in 2000 to 61 Mt in 2015. Continuation of the same policies would result in the phasing out of all remaining coal–fired generation by 2030; that would eliminate the remaining 61 Mt.  Such a change may be partially offset by an increase in natural gas-fired generation needed to provide the backup capacity for intermittent solar and wind energy power generation.  However, a net reduction in electricity emissions of 50 Mt is certainly possible by 2030. Reducing, and eventually eliminating, coal-fired electricity generation is very expensive and has eliminated one of our most economic and reliable generation sources. Coal, of course, is very carbon-intensive, so the emissions reductions were disproportionately high; it represented the “low hanging fruit”. From here on, the choices for emissions reduction become more expensive and disruptive. No doubt, environmental groups will make every effort to prevent any growth in oil and natural production and exports, and they will continue to urge that industry “leave it in the ground”. Eliminating absolutely all oil and natural gas production in Canada, if that were possible, would subtract 2015’s 189.5 Mt. Added to the 50 Mt net reduction from electricity generation would reduce emissions by 239.5 Mt, and take us 87% of the way to the 2030 target, leaving only 35.5 Mt to reduce in other sectors. More likely, with increasing production resulting from past investments, it seems that oil and gas emissions will grow, not decline. That would mean that about 225 Mt (275-50) in reductions would have to be found in the others sectors. The other sectors include transportation, buildings, heavy industry, agriculture, and waste. They produced a collective 453.6 Mt in emissions in 2015. If one were to reduce emissions proportionately across all of them, it would mean cutting emissions in each sector almost in half. That would certainly spread the pain around, but the opportunities for reductions are not equally distributed. Alternatively, governments could focus their efforts almost entirely on reducing emissions from transportation. Many people think that transportation-related GHG emissions come almost entirely from passenger transportation in cars and light duty trucks. In fact, the total of these two categories in 2015 was 83 Mt, less than half of the transportation total. So one could eliminate every single car, SUV and pick up truck in Canada, and you would only cut Canada’s emissions by 11.5%. Despite the dreams of some, it would not be remotely possible to electrify a substantial portion of the transportation system by 2030, and people will still insist on moving regardless of how high the carbon taxes and fees become. So the chances of completely eliminating the 173 Mt of emissions from transportation by 2030 are, in practical terms, nil. Even if one could, it would still leave Canada 52 Mt short of the target. Every other combination of ways to achieve a 225 Mt emissions reduction by 2030 presents enormous quandaries. How about shutting down all heavy industry (auto and parts plants, refineries, mines and smelters, petrochemical plants, cement, aluminum and steel plants, etc.)? If one did that, and eliminated all emissions from agriculture, that would reduce emissions by 147.4 Mt, leaving only 77.6 Mt to be eliminated from transportation. Of course, the employment, income and population effects would be severe. The reality is that there are no options that are technically and economically feasible, and likely to be politically acceptable to the Canadian public. This does not even take into account the likelihood that Canada’s economy and population will grow between now and 2030, thus stimulating higher emissions. At the Global Level, There are No BenefitsWhatever else it is, global warming is indeed a global issue. The emissions are occurring everywhere in the world and the benefits of emissions reductions, if any, will only occur if global emissions decline. How do present trends compare to the IPCC’s proposed targets? Reducing global emissions by 50% from 2010 levels by 2050 would mean reducing them to about 16 GT. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, one of the most authoritative sources of energy supply and demand analysis, projects that global emissions will be 43 GT in 2040 and go on increasing after that. (6) While they disagree on the details, the other authoritative sources of global energy supply and demand projections (i.e. the International Energy Agency, ExxonMobil and British Petroleum) project a substantial increase in emissions to 2040. In other words, according to every authoritative source, global emissions will be much higher, and probably close to three times as high, as the current targets that the IPCC and environmental groups are calling for. Virtually all of the emissions growth is occurring in the developing countries and especially in Asia (China, India and Southeast Asia lead the way). (7) (8) Emissions in Canada and the other countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are projected to remain roughly stable over the next 25 years. The “bottom line” is that the multilateral emission reduction goals simply will not be met. In fact, they will almost certainly be significantly exceeded, regardless of anything Canada does. It should be possible to make a convincing case in this regard by simply referring to the arithmetic. Canada’s GHG emissions constitute 1.6% of the global total. All of the emissions growth is occurring in the developing countries. According to the most authoritative sources of global energy supply and demand forecasts, GHG emissions will continue to grow, not decline, for the foreseeable future. So, Canada could disappear completely, and produce not one ounce of emissions, and global emissions would continue to grow.  The Political Consequences of Accepting the Alarmist PositionAndrew Sheer may be calculating that the Conservatives stand to gain more votes in the next election by catering to claims about alleged catastrophic global warming, even if they lose the support of those who see the real-world adverse economic effects of the emissions reductions policies. Perhaps he perceives this as a simple electoral tactic that can be safely ignored once in office. However, such a political strategy has some decided disadvantages. It will leave without a national political voice those whose livelihoods depend upon resource development or who are skeptical about global warming catastrophe claims. Who else can they vote for?   This cynical betrayal of those who have experienced first hand the effects of global warming alarmism, largely in western Canada, can only further stimulate secessionist groups and encourage the formation of populist parties that will cut into future Conservative support. Further, continuing to pretend that taxing or regulating to reduce emissions is desirable even when they threaten the economic viability of Canada’s resource and manufacturing industries simply plays into the hands of radical environmentalists. These groups have shown themselves to be single-minded and extreme in their view that reducing emissions is a goal that overrides all other public policy objectives. As the political battles over new oil pipelines have shown, radical environmentalists are unreservedly committed to shutting down the Canadian oil industry. They do not accept the results of independent, professional regulation, they reject the rule of law, and they ignore the jurisdiction of the courts, even while using the courts and the public hearings processes as weapons. In simple terms, they cannot be trusted to support the goals of economic development to which most Canadians are committed. Embracing their climate goals leaves any future Conservative government hostage to never-ending criticism about targets that will not, indeed cannot, be met. ConclusionSimply opposing carbon taxes has some merits because of the potential future damage that carbon taxes could impose on the Canadian economy. The present federal government policy is that taxes in all provincial and territorial jurisdictions must rise to the equivalent of $50 per tonne of carbon dioxide by 2022. In pursuit of the 2030 and later targets, governments could raise carbon taxes to $300 per tonne and more after 2025, as recommended by the former National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy in 2009. (9) The result of that would be an economic catastrophe far more certain than the global warming catastrophe environmentalists warn about a century hence. Nonetheless, opposing carbon taxes without acknowledging that the alternative could be worse is not credible. It betrays a failure to think through the real nature of the problem and to move towards a more viable solution. A credible climate policy is one that properly weighs costs and benefits for Canada, that implements the most cost effective emissions measures first, that applies a consistent and credible methodology for evaluating the benefits of emissions reductions, and that places far more emphasis on research and development. Above all, Canadian climate policy must recognize that our climate policies must not fall far out of alignment with those of the United States, with whose economy we are closely integrated. Scheer’s comment that he wants to leave a better world for his children is understandable. He errs by thinking this can be achieved by Canadians cutting emissions. Driving Canadians into energy poverty by raising energy prices and destroying the economic backbone of the country, while paying tribute to environmental catastrophism, will not assure a better future for any Canadian child. Notes“Global Panorama of Carbon Prices in 2017”, The Institute for Climate Economics, 2017.McKitrick, Ross. “A Practical Guide to the Economics of Carbon Pricing”, University of Calgary School of Public Policy Research Paper, September, 2016.Paris Agreement, United Nations, 2015British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy, 2017, page 47.“Canadian Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Economic Sector”, Environment and Climate Change Canada, April 2017“International Energy Outlook 2017”, U.S. Energy Information Administration, September 2017Lyman, Robert. “China, India and COP21”, Friends of Science blog, October 2016Robert. “India – The Next Greenhouse Gas Emissions Giant”, Friends of Science blog, August 2017“Achieving 2050: Carbon Pricing Policy for Canada”, National Roundtable on the Environment and Economy, 2009Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Andrew Scheer', 'climate change', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes', 'GHG reduction targets', 'Paris Agreement']",2018/05/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/13/solar-panels-on-the-prairies-hope-and-disappointment/,Tom Green ,Solar Panels on the Prairies – Hope and Disappointment," A Guest Blog SubmissionCanadians are being told that solar panels are a worthwhile investment and that they provide energy independence and a return on investment – sometimes even a return on power generation if the system is hooked up to the grid. Presently, Prairie Climate Centre is running a video claiming that wind turbines and solar panels on a farm will take you from ‘risk to resiliency’ – presumably touting industrial scale installations which are highly subsidized by taxpayers.   So, if the public are paying for these adventures in alternative energy, we should know how well they work.  Here’s a small scale example for consideration. A Canadian farmer living in a remote prairie location installed a solar system hoping to benefit from the claims many government officials make about solar panels – that they provide suitable back-up power, potential return on the grid and that there is a positive cost-benefit on investment. We received the following unsolicited commentary and photos from the individual who preferred to remain anonymous, but they did agree to share their experience for the benefit of others. The following has been nominally edited for clarification. I decided to embark on this journey for two reasons….I suppose the first was for convenience.  Because of continued interruptions of electric service in my region, I wanted to have a backup system to protect my appliances and not be compromised during electric outages.  Secondly, I have been interested in solar power for decades and do believe in harnessing energy that is provided to us every day to use as efficiently as possible. I have an array of eight panels that are connected to batteries and then an inverter to supplement my consumption and provide electricity to select parts of my house during power outages.  I also have an array of 10 panels that connects directly into the power grid and operates on a bi-directional power meter with the utility company.  Both arrays are ground mounted. The second array is also monitored through the internet by a company called Enphase Energy and provides me with up to the minute energy production reports.Photo 1 – Installed solar system technical details Photo 2 – Solar panel array The system has been operating now for 14 months and works reasonably well. Since October 2016 to January 2018 inclusive I have consumed 33894 kwh and sent 2394 kwh back into the grid from the 10-panel array.  The 8-panel array is 12 volt and is tied to the system and batteries with an inverter Performance Challenges – Clouds and SnowThe first thing I became aware of is the reduced production even when thin layers of clouds block the sun.  If I do not have direct sunlight on the panels, there is very reduced production as observed from the enphase reports..  The next thing I observed was that even a light skiff of snow on the panels will prevent electric production. Even if tilted at an angle of 60 degrees or more to the ground, the panels seem to magically attract snow sometimes to a significant depth of 10 cm or more. It will slowly melt off when the sun appears but typically our winters have consecutive days of cloud cover.  If the sky does clear, it is usually late in the afternoon and left to nature, there is not enough heat in the sun to clear the panels.  I manually clear the snow with a broom so as to capture as much energy as possible.Photo 3 – Dec. 15, 2017Photo 3, taken on Dec 15, 2017, is rather unique as it shows an overnight snow shower – the thickness of the snow as it slides off the array tilted at 45 degrees – as it heats up from the midday sun.The above photo shows very little snowfall on the surrounding area but already a significant pile on the ground in front of the array, snow that I have swept off the panels.  I have a broom that I use to clean the panels almost every morning in the winter time and we have been known to have snow in this area typically eight months of the year. This makes me wonder what happens in large commercial units.  The snow does eventually melt off but depending on the depth and with only intermittent sun during most days, it can take several days for the panels to clean themselves which means lost production opportunity. Also, with the added weight of snow, I wonder how many roof installations will damage the structure underneath. Summer offers best production – But you most need power in WinterI can tell you that my best month of production in 2017 was July of course and the bank of 10 panels produced 432 kw hours. Monthly production in 2017 starting with January – 201, 234, 252, 398, 414, 369, 432, 383, 266, 261,162, and 160.  Needless to say, I am disappointed especially when considering the investment.  I would like to see our Minister McKenna install a system on her own home at her own cost and try to live off the grid as she suggests the citizens of this country should. I built my own support structure and as such I am able to tilt it as the sun’s declination angle changes.  I do not know if that has any benefit though.  It’s kind of like the analogy of checking the pressure in your car tirePhoto 4 – March 7, 2017s to make sure they are at optimum so as to get better gas mileage when even small breeze head on or a tail wind affects your mileage a hundred times more.  A skiff of cloud greatly decreases production and overcast sky limits production.  This I can prove by watching the bar graphs from my Enlighten monitor which is updated every few minutes A photo of the arrays in the middle of a blizzard on March 7 2017.  Even with strong winds, the panels are covered in snow.  Does it Pay?I have invested about $25000.00 in my system but that includes having to upgrade the power panel in my house but does not include the cost of the structure to hold the arrays as that was built from my own material. Anyway, to answer your questions – I have a bidirectional meter in my yard that measures electricity that I consume from the grid and it also measures excess electricity produced by the panels when my consumption is low that I send back into the grid on an ongoing basis. Do I get paid for that?  The short answer is yes – it shows up as a credit on my power bill.  Unfortunately, I consume way more than I send back so my power bills have not decreased significantly. I designed the system based on my previous power consumption but then added some high energy fixtures before I had the system up and running making it difficult to compare current to previous costs. Objectively, most of my energy consumption occurs outside of daylight hours for light and heat so logically the panels are not producing when I need them most. Other Concerns My last huge concern is the disposal of these panels at the end of their lifespan which I am told is about 30 years.  I live in a very sparsely populated area and can predict that the panels with all their contaminants (mercury)  will end up in a local landfill instead of being recycled because of the cost and availability of  a recycling service. At my age, I don’t expect to be around to worry about it but somebody someday will have to deal with it. The cost of disposal is a very real cost that needs to be added if you are trying to calculate efficiency of solar production. ~~~~ Additional Reading:Cambridge Prof. Michael J.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/11/the-trans-mountain-expansion-project-and-regional-oil-markets/,,The Trans Mountain Expansion Project and Regional Oil Markets," Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultantRobert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and frequent contributor.  Mr. Lyman was a public servant for 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years. IntroductionThe governments of Canada, British Columbia and Alberta are currently locked into a major political dispute over the future of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, a proposed expansion to the facilities of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline that has served the British Columbia and Washington state oil markets since 1953. The public controversy over the issues involved has been affected by a lack of information, and perhaps some deliberate misinformation, about the role that the expansion would play and why it is needed. The purpose of this commentary is to place the proposed project into the context of the energy supply and demand systems that now meet the needs of consumers in British Columbia and Washington State.Demand for oil, natural gas and coal continue to rise world-wide. Oil Markets in the “Pacific Northwest”In this paper, I will use the term “Pacific Northwest” to refer to the region that includes British Columbia and the states of Washington and Oregon. Oil markets are driven by the demands of consumers for a wide range of refined oil products – gasoline, diesel fuels, distillates, aviation and jet fuel, asphalt and other products used for transportation and other energy services. The international petroleum industry is extremely flexible and inventive in finding ways, within the constraints of existing infrastructure, of allocating supplies of crude oil and refined petroleum products so as to meet these demands. When one source of supply is constrained, or a proposed piece of infrastructure blocked, the industry finds ways to reallocate, although the result may be higher prices. British Columbia ‘s end-use energy demand by fuel in 2015, according to the National Energy Board, was satisfied by 431 petajoules, or PJ, refined petroleum products (37%), 355 PJ of natural gas (30%), 193 PJ of electricity (17%), 182 PJ of biofuels (16%), and 8 PJ of others (less than 1%). Thus, 67% of the province’s energy supply was provided by fossil fuels.See British Columbia’s energy profile here:https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/nrgsstmprfls/bc-eng.html To meet the demand for refined petroleum products, British Columbia has two refineries with a combined capacity of 70 thousand barrels per day (Mb/d): Husky in Prince George and Parkland in Burnaby. Husky has a capacity of 13 Mb/d and mostly consumes light and synthetic crude oil from Alberta. Parkland has a capacity of 57 Mb/d and mostly consumes heavier Alberta and Saskatchewan crude oil transported via the Trans Mountain Pipeline. These refineries are too small to meet all of the province’s needs so additional refined products are supplied by refineries in Alberta and Washington. In fact, most of the gasoline consumed in B.C. comes from Alberta, delivered primarily via the Trans Mountain Pipeline. Less than 10% of the gasoline consumed in B.C. is imported via ship or barge from Washington State. The absence of adequate refining capacity within B.C. to meet its needs makes the province vulnerable to swings in refined product supply, thus increasing the volatility of prices. The existing Trans Mountain pipeline system now serves many different requirements. It transports crude oil that is used by refineries in B.C. and by those in Washington state to meet the needs of consumers in the Pacific Northwest, and it supplies refined oil products to meet the needs of people in B.C. Less well known is that crude oil delivered by the pipeline to the Westridge Terminal is also loaded on to tankers and shipped to export markets, now mainly in California. Within the United States, most of the west coast is included in the region defined by the U.S. government as the Petroleum Administration for Defense (PADD) 5. PADD 5 is geographically isolated from other U.S. refining centres, notably the Gulf Coast, where 52% of U.S. refining capacity is located, and from global refining centres that can efficiently supply products by tanker to other regions. There are no pipelines that cross the Rocky Mountains in the United States to move products to central and northern PADD 5 from the Midwest, and only limited pipelines that deliver from the Gulf Coast to California. The U.S. west coast is 10 days travel by tanker from the U.S. Gulf Coast, three weeks from Asia, and more than four weeks from Europe. Pipeline and marine infrastructure (i.e. ports and tanker loading and unloading facilities) to move products into and out of the area are also limited. According to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report on west coast transportation fuels markets in 2015, refinery production within PADD 5 is sufficient to meet about 91% of in-region gasoline demand, 96% of jet fuel demand, and 113 % of distillate demand. See the EIA report here:https://www.eia.gov/analysis/transportationfuels/padd5/ Because of heavy reliance on in-region refinery production, any disruptions tend to quickly limit short-term supplies and cause prices to increase and remain higher for a longer period than would be typical in other North American markets. As in B.C., consumers end up paying more.  Much of the crude oil needs of PADD 5 have been met since the 1980s by Alaskan production, but that has declined from about two million barrels per day (b/d) at its peak to about 550,000 b/d today. (Remarkably, it seems to be a little-known fact that millions of barrels of Alaskan oil have been shipped down the B.C. coast in tankers from Alaska to the Puget Sound for the last 30 years.) As a result, PADD 5 imports of crude oil rose from about 300,000 b/d in the 1980’s to about 1.3 million b/d today. In 2016, 226,000 b/d was supplied by Canada. The Trans Mountain Expansion ProjectThe proposed expansion project would add a second “twinned” pipeline alongside the existing pipeline and increase the capacity of both the pipeline and the Westridge Terminal near Vancouver. There is a persistent myth that the additional facilities would only move crude oil and then only to Asian markets. In fact, as explained in the Trans Mountain application to the National Energy Board, once the expansion was finished, Line 1 (the existing system) would be used primarily to transport refined products and light crude oil. This would add to the product supply sources available and reduce the vulnerability of B.C. drivers to spikes in gasoline prices when even minor disruptions occur. The proposed Line 2 would transport heavy crude and bitumen to Vancouver for export, but “export” includes the oil that will be supplying the Puget Sound pipeline via the Sumas delivery point to serve the four refineries in Washington State. This will reduce the amount of crude oil that has to travel to the Puget Sound by rail or by tanker. Some of the oil refined in Washington will then be imported back into B.C. to meet its refined product needs. The expansion project will result in increased exports of crude oil via tanker from the Westridge Terminal. Opponents have questioned whether there will be markets in Asia for this additional supply. Identifying the trends in refinery configurations and in overall refined product demand is very complex, so it is difficult to project exactly where future sales of Canadian heavy crude oil and bitumen will go. Global oil demand growth is now running at the annual rate of 1.5 million barrels per day, and it is heavily concentrated in Asia. A recent report by Stratas Advisors estimated that crude oil distillation capacity in the Asia-Pacific region was 34.5 million b/d as of January 1, 2017 and that announced refinery expansion projects will add about 6 million b/d over the period 2017-2020 and another 6 million b/d over the period 2020-2025. A summary of the Stratus report can be read here:https://stratasadvisors.com/Insights/062117-Asia-Pacific-Refinery-Capacity It is certainly possible, however, that much of the additional exports from Canada’s west coast ports will go to California or other parts of PADD 5, rather than Asia. The lower shipping costs to U.S. markets would, in fact, make that more appealing to Canadian producers. There is absolutely no question that competitively priced Canadian heavy crudes and bitumen will find willing markets in the Pacific Rim. Consequences if the TMPL Expansion is not builtThe shortage of pipeline capacity to move crude oil and refined products into and out of the Pacific Northwest will probably increase without the additional facilities offered by the TMPL expansion. The alternative ways to move crude oil into the region are by tanker or by rail. The Washington state government issues quarterly reports on oil transport within the state, including rail shipments. The most recent report, published in January 2018 and covering the final quarter of 2017, can be read here:https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/documents/1808004.pdf The report shows that an increasing amount of crude oil is being delivered by rail, and that the total by-rail deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 13.1 million barrels, transported by about 1,480 rail cars per week. Most (85%) of the crude oil moved by rail was light crude from North Dakota, with the rest being light and heavy crudes from Alberta and Saskatchewan. There is a possibility of increased rail delivery within B.C. as well, on either the CN or CP rail lines. Despite some high-profile accidents in recent years, shipment of crude oil by rail has had a very good safety record. If one compares the movement of oil by rail to that by pipeline, however, the risks are significantly higher. Blair King, an expert in the detection and remediation of contaminated sites who writes a blog as “A Chemist in Langley”, explained the differences well in a recent entry. “One of the big benefits of pipelines is their routing. … The CN and CP rail lines took advantage of natural terrain features (rivers) when going through mountains. The Trans Mountain pipeline, however, was built over a century later and was built after the Trans-Canada highway and many of the rural highways had already been constructed. As a consequence, it runs far less of its length along river edges. Consider the pipeline in communities in the lower mainland. The current pipeline pretty much avoids the rivers and runs straight down the valley; the rail lines, meanwhile, run pretty much right along the river for much of the length of the valley…” King estimates that oil-by-rail has a 4.5 times higher risk of incident than oil-by-pipeline. See his blog post here:https://achemistinlangley.net/2016/07/25/on-pipelines-oil-by-rail-and-the-relative-risk-of-catastrophic-spills-in-the-aquatic-environment/ This is not to suggest that increased shipment of oil by rail should not happen or that the risks always exceed the benefits. It does indicate that TMPL expansion is a far safer way of moving oil into the Pacific Northwest than the rail alternative. ConclusionThe construction of the TMPL Expansion project would increase the supply of refined oil products to B.C., thus improving the security and flexibility of the supply system. It would increase the supply of crude oil to refineries in B.C., with the same result. Both of these actions would reduce prices of refined oil products for B.C. residents, other things equal. The TMPL Expansion would also allow more Canadian crude oil to flow by pipeline into Washington State, which the Puget Sound refiners would use to supply the product needs of both the PADD 5 region and, via marine transport, consumers in B.C. This would help to offset the decline in Alaskan crude deliveries and avoid the necessity for increased shipment of crude by rail from other areas. Finally, it would increase the access for western Canadian producers to domestic and export markets, including markets throughout the Pacific Rim. Oil markets operate to serve consumers of refined oil products. The needs of Pacific Northwest consumers will not end any time soon. Those in the B.C. government and in the environmentalist movement working to stop the construction of the TMPL Expansion project should perhaps value more the needs of B.C. residents. Robert Lyman video interview: “No Pipeline” is a Problem – A Challenge to DemocracyShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['British Columbia', 'climate change', 'Crude Oil', 'oil', 'oil sands', 'TransMountain']",2018/05/11

We would like to address your published statement[1] justifying your choice of Dr. David Suzuki as a recipient of an Honorary Degree for this year’s University of Alberta Convocation.In your statement, you write that universities must not be afraid of controversy, “that we must allow our people and honour others who pursue ideas that sometimes trouble us…”You may or may not be aware that many Friends of Science Society members are graduates of the University of Alberta in the sciences, engineering and management. Our Canadian scientific advisor is a former professor at the University of Alberta. We have been hearing from our members and they are very upset.In the first place, most graduates abide by the University of Alberta Statement of Ethical Conduct concerning Integrity, Respect and Accountability. [2] On Sept. 4, 2015, Dr. Suzuki authored a widely distributed op-ed wherein he mocked Friends of Science Society as ‘deniers’ – despite the fact that he is not a climate scientist nor trained in our relevant fields earth, atmospheric, solar science, economics or engineering.  This is not emblematic of academic integrity or collegial respect.This is one of many times that Dr. Suzuki has attacked our organization’s reputation.  In consequence, though we have issued a number of reports rebutting the various claims that his organization and related activist colleagues have made against the oil and coal industries, due to his high media profile, our scientific and evidence-based rebuttals have been ignored by the media, who are enamoured by the ‘cult of the personality.’ [3] [4] [5]  Where open public debate, thoughtful economic analysis and careful planning might have prevailed, governments have been pressured to agree with activist views instead of evidence.In your statement, you also defend freedom of speech as a justification for granting the honorary degree.In 2014, we ran some billboards, hoping to stimulate fruitful public debate on the science of climate change. On December 3, 2015, a group called Ecojustice filed a public call for inquiry into Friends of Science Society, saying that our billboards constituted a threat of some kind, that we should be silenced and if found guilty, the Competition Bureau should fine us thousands of dollars and throw us in jail, for a few words on a billboard. Dr. Suzuki is an honorary board member of Ecojustice.  He did not speak up in defence of our freedom of speech.Several other academics signed that call for inquiry. No university spoke up on our behalf, especially not the University of Alberta; none spoke up for us in the name of freedom of speech or honoring others – like us –  who ‘pursue ideas that sometimes trouble us.’As Dr. Suzuki had done in his Sept. 2015 article, Ecojustice claimed that we were a proxy for ‘Big Oil.’  (The Competition Bureau closed its inquiry on June 29, 2017.)In an interview in Australia on Sept. 22, 2013, Dr. Suzuki went on at length about the fossil fuel industry has funded ‘denier’ groups and how industry controls the media.[6]And yet, the David Suzuki Foundation itself has been funded by Power Corporation since 2007, according to Power Corp’s CDP filing.[7]  Power Corporation is rated as the #358 largest corporation in the world by Forbes in 2017.  According to their CDP (2016) report Power owns an effective interest of 0.22% of the French based oil and gas company Total SA, LaFarge cement and aggregates (0.86%), Imerys minerals (4.91%), Engie (0.21%), Pernod Ricard (0.86%) and SGS SA testing and certification (1.37%) (via European affiliates). In Canada, they own media entities La Presse and Square Victoria Communications Group. In the world of finance and insurance they own Great West Lifeco Inc., IGM Financial Inc. and entities which operate globally. And Power Corporation has a wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to renewables.Dr. Suzuki and the David Suzuki Foundation have been agitating against the oil sands and for coal phase-out and pushing for wind farms in Alberta (Submission #398 to the Alberta Climate Panel).  398. Submission_David Suzuki Foundation (1) Now Power Corporation subsidiaries are building a wind farm in Jenner, Alberta.Many of the Suzuki Foundation claims against coal-fired power in Alberta rest on computer simulations found in studies by the Pembina Institute.Allegations of health impacts and deaths were made against coal-fired electrical power generation plants in Alberta by Dr. David Suzuki and the David Suzuki Foundation and ENGO associates, but empirical evidence in at least four studies by University of Alberta scientists shows these claims are false.Dr. Suzuki’s ongoing anti-oil sands claims regarding air and water quality have been refuted by University of Alberta scientists who are also Royal Society of Canada members – again with empirical evidence and careful review of the facts.Power generation claims by Dr Suzuki on wind power potential could be easily refuted by all University of Alberta engineering grads.  All power generation engineers are aware that wind is weather-dependant and in the context of a modern-day grid, wind requires equivalent natural gas back-up power generation capacity and infrastructure, costing billions of dollars.Most of the claims by Dr. Suzuki and the David Suzuki Foundation rely on climate change as the apparent rationale for reducing emissions.  However, since 2005, the scientific community has acknowledged that the radiative forcing theory of climate change may be an outdated metric for evaluating climate change,[8] it is “well understood, but its magnitude is highly uncertain.”[9] The IPCC acknowledged in 2013 that there had been a hiatus in warming for the 15 years prior. In 2017, the WMO stated that 2016 was the “hottest year ever.” But such warming only measured 0.02°C, and based on the margin of error of 0.1°C; that means 2016 may have been 0.12°C warmer or 0.08°C cooler.[10] Ordinary citizens who cannot discern what a margin of error means are deceived, and most activist ENGOs capitalise on the public’s scientific and energy illiteracy. It should be the role of responsible scientists and universities to clarify these details and calm down the crisis rhetoric.More recently, scientists have expressed the view that natural factors are responsible for recent warming, not human emissions of greenhouse gases.[11]  Whether or not one entirely agrees, on the point of academic integrity, one must be open to the view that the earlier scientific theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming is not supported by current evidence.The scientific community might have continued its internal debate on warming or cooling cycles and causes, but in 2006, Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” launched the notion of climate change into the minds of the public in a frightening way.  About the same time, according to Nisbet (2014) a group of billionaire philanthropies got together to cause a ‘sea change that washes over the entire global economy”[12] – and as “Climateworks” they began a strategy of funding local environmental non-governmental groups (ENGOs) and charities around the world.Leading the report was the recommendation that “tempering climate change” required a strong cap and trade policy in the U.S. and the European Union, and a binding international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. The report predicted that passage of cap and trade legislation would “prompt a sea change that washes over the entire global economy.” The report included little to no discussion of the role of government in directly sponsoring the creation of new energy technologies. The report was additionally notable for the absence of any meaningful discussion of social, political or technological barriers. (bold emphasis added) Instead, the authors offered a decidedly optimistic outlook: “The good news is that we already have the technology and know-how to achieve these carbon reductions—often at a cost savings.”As reported by Vivian Krause and others, millions of dollars flowed into Canadian ENGOs and environmental charities, which in turn magnified the theme of impending climate crisis in the public’s mind, when few practising scientists hold such a view.  The David Suzuki Foundation has been identified as a recipient of funding from some of these groups.The result has been a breach in the sovereign rights of Canada and a skewing of climate and energy policies by activist rhetoric, not evidence.At the peak of oil sands industrial activity in the period of about 2005, Alberta’s oil sands were driving about 1/3 of the Canadian economy.[13]  Since then, particularly since the production of the documentary, “The Tipping Point: Age of the Oil Sands” in 2011, which was hosted by Dr. Suzuki, Alberta’s and Canada’s economies have lost billions of dollars due to the incessant, unsupported, emotional rhetoric of Dr. Suzuki, the David Suzuki Foundation and the many other environmental groups with whom they collaborate.The human and economic impacts are devastating.Alberta coal phase-out:7,000 coal industry jobs lost30 coal communities devastedEstimated cost to the public – $30-50 billionAlberta Oil/Gas and Oil Sands/Pipeline Construction:175,000 in oil and gas and oil sands$19 billion in projects delayed according to activistsLosses of $50 million a day (Canadian Chamber of Commerce)$15.8 billion reduction in revenues to Canadian energy firms in 2018 (Fraser Institute[14])To be clear, many of the grants handed out by these foundations to various Canadian and International ENGOs, appear to have had specific objectives to shut down industry in Canada and drive off investment.  Here are three relevant examples from the Oak Foundation.Grant: From Oak Foundation to Tides Canada“To conduct research to determine whether tar sands mining is adversely impacting the Athabasca River of Canada and its tributaties, and to report the findings. A second goal is to raise the visibility of the tar sands issue and slow exapnsion of tar sands by stopping new infrastructure development, supporting policy reform in the US and Canada and reducing future demand for oil sands oil.”$700,000. Granted in 2009 over 24 months Sept 1, 2009-Aug 31, 2011.Grant from Oak Foundation to Greenpeace Canada:“To create awareness of the financial, regulatory and political uncertainty that surrounds investments in the tar sands so that prominent financial analysts, media, opinion leaders and Members of Parliament will publically (sic) express concern about the lack of government regulation of the tar sands industry. Greenpeace Canada aims to publicise the controversy around the tar sands both within and outside Canada. This will encourage the withdrawal of major institutional investors from the tar sands by 2012; the end of France’s tar sands subsidies; and the passage of a feed-in-tariff in Alberta utilised by farmers, ranchers, landowners and investors to develop the province’s huge wind power potential.”$424,373.

Dec. 1, 2010-Nov. 30, 2013Grant from Oak Foundation to Greenpeace Canada:“To initiate three distinct but interrelated efforts concerning tar sands in Alberta, to enhance the ability of Greenpeace Canada to more effectively launch and deliver its “Phase Out Tar Sands Campaign”; secondly to leverage the growing interest of ranchers and landowners in limiting unbridled oil and gas exploration and production in Southern Alberta; and thirdly to conduct specialised opinion research and media work to identify messaging for these and other efforts that will generate maximum information value among Albertans. “$436,675.  Granted in 2007 for 24 months.

The outcomes include personal catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of people, many of them University of Alberta alumni.  How is that for the public good?In our opinion, based on the foregoing evidence, Dr. Suzuki’s actions and words are not congruent with the skills learned in the physical sciences, environmental or business management at the University of Alberta. They are not in keeping with the expectations of its graduates or faculty members, nor with its own Code of Ethics, nor with the values you express in your statement meant to validate your decision to honor Dr. Suzuki.We ask that you rescind the offer of the honorary degree to Dr. David Suzuki.Sincerely,Ken GregoryPresident COMMENTS and OPINIONS FROM FRIENDS OF SCIENCE MEMBERS:The proposed bestowing of an honorary degree to David Suzuki is very troubling to me.  It is insulting a school, its alumni, its benefactors, and the province’s most important industry that has the world’s best record of environmental stewardship in energy extraction.  It is also a most blatant insult to the engineering profession, my family, and to me personally.I recently attended and participated as a presenter in the Iron Ring Ceremony for my grandson and another 914 hopeful graduating engineers of the University of Alberta.  This is a ceremony that is most profound, solemn and moving – The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer.  Although the Obligation composed by Rudyard Kipling over 90 years ago does not explicitly mention the environment, the text by Kipling can be readily interpreted that it is also a duty today for those engineers taking the obligation to also respect and protect the environment.  The choice of Suzuki for an honorary degree, because of his hypocritical practices (The Two Suzuki’s), would leave this group of young engineers confused and bewildered. Suzuki certainly does not exemplify the ethics and values advocated in the Kipling Obligation.For a good part of my career I was employed as an engineer with a federal agency followed by several years as “Environmental Engineer” with the province of Alberta.  I was made aware of many environmental issues and learned that the solutions may require policy and regulation. However, it is invariably an engineer and the scientific community together who solve them for the betterment of all concerned.  I think I can speak with some knowledge and experience that I too can only conclude that the choice of David Suzuki for an honorary degree is a most deplorable choice.  Surely there are others who could have been chosen – someone who also exemplifies the values of the engineering profession and who would better serve as a model for our graduating class.David Suzuki is well known for his personal activities and their contradiction to what he preaches and implores us to practise.  He is also one who speaks half truths and ignores the facts.  His views will add little or nothing to the present debate and resolution of issues that are presently facing this province.   Why is the U of A honouring this man – one who actively participates in Kinder Morgan protests along with Elizabeth May who was arrested at the same event?  Why is the university giving this man – a TV personality – yet another venue?  What message of enlightenment are you hoping he might convey to his audience?     Because he is controversial is not a satisfactory explanation for his selection.  Should the U of A still move forward with their intended bestowment then we will from this day onward withhold our financial support.Respectfully submitted,XX, B.Sc., M.Sc.XX, B.Ed.————————Sent from my iPadDavid Suzuki’s starts his blog describing two oil spills, the associated fatalities and damage to the environment, there is no doubt these were both terrible accidents.  His strategy is clear, use people’s emotion to support his illogical eco extremism agenda.  David Suzuki fails to mention the millions of lives fossil fuels have saved in the past 75 years and that by all measures the standard of living for human beings has steadily increased for the entire period of time fossil fuels have been used and will continue to do so.  A large percentage of his blog goes on about how climate change will have devasting consequences and if “those in positions of power, truly understood the severity and urgency of the climate change crisis” but this shows his lack of knowledge in this area, almost all real world empirical evidence does not support this speculation.  Yes, you can find a lot of literature claiming predicated consequences of predicted climate change will be disastrous for human beings and the environment, but this is not supported by historical evidence or studies based on empirical evidence.  It is not the people in power that should decide public policy it is the majority of Canadians and David Suzuki and the other foreign funded groups do not represent the majority of Canadians.  Most Canadian’s have a deep respect and love for the environment and David Suzuki should stop implying that we do not just because we do not share his extreme opinions.P.Eng, University of Alberta [1] http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/david-turpin-responds-to-honorary-degree-for-david-suzuki-1.4633529[2] “Acting with integrity, we are committed to truth, fair dealing, honesty and sincerity.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/29/nouvelle-france-la-conquete-du-carbone/,,Nouvelle-France: la conquête du carbone?," Traduction: “New France: The Carbon Conquest?”Le Premier ministre du Canada, Justin Trudeau, s’est adressé à l’Assemblée nationale française le 17 avril, 2018.Au cours de son allocution, il a affirmé que le Canada respectera les accords de Paris du COP21 pour la réduction des gaz à effet de serre (GES) – malgré que le Canada soit en ce moment dans une impasse sur la construction de l’oléoduc Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain qui transporterait les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta vers un port maritime de la Colombie Britannique. De plus, il semblait présenter ses excuses auprès des français du fait que le Canada continuait de dépendre du pétrole.Depuis la crise pétrolière des années 70, la France avançait sa devise : « Nous n’avons pas de pétrole, nous avons des idées. » Il apparaît que leur idée la plus récente fut l’accord sur le changement climatique et la culture, signé le jour avant. Le Canada est au troisième rang des réserves de pétrole au monde. Peut-être que ce traité était une bonne idée pour la France, mais l’était-il pour le Canada ?Les anglo-saxons canadiens ne sont pas très conscients du fait que le Canada français constitue un groupe puissant. La plupart des sociétés importantes du Canada sont domiciliées au Québec, et selon Finance Canada, plus de 200 de ces sociétés ont leurs sièges en France.Le commerce canadien avec la France remonte aux années 1700 et la Bataille de Québec. De fait, le Premier ministre Trudeau mentionne ses racines françaises, qu’il est le descendant d’un charpentier qui s’expatria vers un avenir meilleur. En effet, les temps du début de la colonisation de la Nouvellle France étaient très durs. Rappelons que c’était l’époque du Petit Âge Glaciaire (Little Ice Age), quand les températures mondiales étaient plus froides et les conditions météorologiques imprévisibles. Comme Gordon Donaldson nous le raconte dans son livre « Battle for Quebec », les élites gouvernantes françaises prenaient en pitié les paysans-fermiers québecois, les invitant à s’assoir aux balcons pour assister aux festins du gouverneur et ses élites.La paysannerie canadienne-française manifestait sa colére contre ce comportement élitiste en griffonant des graffiti sur les murs les enjoignant de repartir chez eux. Ce mépris pour le canadien-français ordinaire fût la raison principale de n’avoir pas réussi à s’implanter en Nouvelle France : corruption des élites et indifférence cruelle envers ces pauvres charpentiers, comme pour l’ancêtre de notre Premier ministre.Je me suis intéressé à cette période de l’histoire du Canada quand je travaillais au Québec dans les années 1980 avec les cinéastes Marie-José Raymond et Claude Fournier. Nous produisions un téléfilm sur Louisbourg, cette magnifique forteresse édifiée par Vauban, réputée imprenable par les britanniques… malheureusement la forteresse et la Nouvelle France furent perdues aux mains des britanniques, les soldats français complètement démoralisés. Ces pauvres gens vivaient à une époque de grande corruption des élites françaises ; tout ce que nous cinéastes pouvions faire était d’en faire une comédie…Mais, revenons au présent. Est-ce que la France tenterait de réhabiliter son passé en imposant la taxe carbone ? En 2016, la France a unilatéralement imposé une loi requérant que les investisseurs étrangers établissent un plan « 2°C » – et il y a des billions de dollars investis au Canada.Selon Robert Lyman, conseillé en énergie d’Ottawa, si le Canada devait remplir ses obligations de réduction de GES suivant l’accord de Paris, en réduisant les émissions, notre économie tomberait en poussière, ressemblant à celles de l’Irak, Bolivie, ou Soudan.Bien évidemment, la seule façon de prétendre remplir ces obligations implique le commerce du carbone, et ainsi insister sur un prix du carbone.Bruno Wiskel nous rappelle dans son livre “The Emperor’s New Climate” :en février 2005, les députés du Bloc Québecois prétendaient que, parce que le Québec ne dépend que de son hydroélectricité, source d’énergie « propre », ils ne devraient être responsables que de 5% des réductions du tout le pays, tandis que l’Alberta devrait contribuer 40%. En théorie, l’Alberta pourrait accomplir cet exploit en achetant des crédits de carbone du Québec. Une telle combine n’entrainerait pas de différence dans le montant d’argent circulant d’ouest en est, seulement un changement de formule. Au lieu que le Québec reçoive la « charité » de l’Alberta par le biais des paiements de transfert fédéraux, le Québec « gagnerait »  cet argent par crédits de carbone issus de Kyoto. La France aurait-elle la même idée ? La principale source d’énergie employée en France est le nucléaire, et la France planifie les transports uniquement avec l’électricité, ceci étant possible dans un pays au climat tempéré possédant tant de centrales nucléaires. Pensez aux revenus qui pourraient être générés au Canada… surtout en Alberta !De plus, ceci nous semble être un coup génial de géopolitique par le président Macron pour isoler les Etats-Unis encore plus, en les coinçant ainsi à entrer dans des accords de marché carbone et aussi se conformer aux accords de Paris.Cependant, la PPHB, banque américaine d’investissements énergétiques, publiait leurs réflexions le même jour que le discours du Premier ministre Trudeau à l’Assemblée nationale. PPHB nous parla du gouvernement canadien et de l’oléoduc Kinder Morgan bloqué:le gouvernement fédéral, par son soutien de certains projets énergétiques tandis qu’il en rejette d’autres, s’est mis dans une position à la fois pro-énergie et anti-énergie. Ce dédoublement de personnalité politique est interprété par l’industrie énergétique mondiale comme un signe que le Canada a évolué en un pays hostile aux affaires. Pour une industrie qui opère en termes de décennies pour planifier et développer des projets à très longue haleine, cette hostilité affichée pourrait endommager l’économie canadienne à long terme, en particulier les provinces de l’ouest, là où l’industrie énergétique est axée. De plus, cette hostilité pourrait s’étendre à d’autres ressources, les mines, le bois et d’autres industries d’extraction, et ainsi les mettre en garde que leur croissance pourrait être bientôt contestée.Le Premier ministre n’est peut-être pas au courant que la demande mondiale de pétrole a augmenté de 1,6% (soit 1,5 million de barils par jour) en 2017, un taux qui a plus que doubler par rapport à la moyenne de la dernière décennie. IEA 2017Total SA of France a abandonné les sables bitumineux de l’Alberta pour investir $5 milliards en Iran…L’usage du pétrole ne diminue pas dans le monde. Sa demande croît, et le Canada devrait construire des oléoducs et adhérer à l’économie globale.Devrions-nous rappeler au Premier ministre que son aïeul, comme la plupart de nos ancêtres, sont venus au Canada pour une vie meilleure – et ne retournant pas à une vie de servitude.Le dioxyde de carbone n’est pas la commande de réglage du climat.Les taxes sur le carbone et les marchés du carbone ne contribuent en rien à se prononcer sur le climat. Ces taxes ne font que rendre les gens libres pauvres, et les pauvres ont faim.  Réfutation: EcofiscalSantayana ne disait-il pas que ceux qui ne se souviennent pas de l’Histoire sont condamnés à la répéter…William Kay – Post-Paris trilogy~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change', 'COP21', 'France']",2018/04/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/29/new-france-the-carbon-conquest/,Ron Little ,New France: The Carbon Conquest?," Opinion: by Michelle Stirling © 2018Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed the French National Assembly on April 17, 2018.As part of his address he claimed that Canada will meet its COP21 Paris Agreement greenhouse gas reduction targets – despite the fact that Canada is presently in a deadlock over the construction of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta’s oil sands to the ocean port in British Columbia. As part of his message to the National Assembly, he appeared to apologize to the French people for Canada’s continued reliance on oil.Image licensed from Shutterstock – see Post-Paris trilogy on the blogSince the 1970’s oil crisis, France has had a motto of: “We have no oil, we have ideas.” It seems their latest idea is the Canada-France agreement on climate change and culture, which was signed the day before the address.  Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world.  Maybe that deal was a good idea for France – the question is, was it a good deal for Canada?Anglo Canadians are largely oblivious to the eastern French Canadian power bloc. Most of the largest companies in Canada are headquartered in Quebec, and according to Finance Canada, more than 200 of them have head offices in France.Canadian trade with France goes back to the 1700’s and the Battle for Quebec.  In fact, Prime Minister Trudeau mentioned his roots are in France, that he is descended from a carpenter who left France for a better life.  Indeed, early times in the colony of New France were very difficult.  This was the time of the Little Ice Age – when temperatures world-wide were cooler than today and weather patterns very erratic.  As Gordon Donaldson recounts in his book, the “Battle for Quebec” – the elite French governors took pity on the peasant farmers of Quebec by inviting them to sit in the balcony, to watch the governor and his elites dine on a multi-course meal.The French-Canadian peasants were incensed by the elitist behaviour – scrawling graffiti on the walls telling the French to go home. This lack of regard for the ordinary French-Canadian person was the main reason France lost its foothold in New France. It was due to corruption by the elites and brutal disregard for poor carpenters like our Prime Minister’s ancestor.I became fascinated with this period of Canadian history when I worked in Quebec in the 1980’s with filmmakers Marie Jose Raymond and Claude Fournier.  We were working on a telefilm about Louisbourg, the magnificent Vaubon-style fortress which was supposed to keep the Brits out… but the fortress and New France were lost to the Brits by the demoralized French soldiers. Those poor people were living in a time when corruption of the French elites was so great, the only thing we as filmmakers could do, was to turn the film script into a comedy.So – back to the present.  Is France attempting to reclaim its past through carbon taxes?  In 2016, France unilaterally passed a law requiring all of its foreign investees to create a 2 degree Celsius plan – and there are billions of dollars of investment in Canada. France has exceptional geopolitical power through La Francophonie.According to Ottawa energy consultant, Robert Lyman, if Canada was to meet its Paris Agreement GHG reductions, by reducing emissions, our economy would be reduced to ashes – we would have the economy of Iraq, Bolivia, or Sudan.So, obviously the only way to pretend to meet those commitments is to engage in carbon trading – and thus the push for a price on carbon.As Bruno Wiskel recalls in his book “The Emperor’s New Climate”:February 2005, Bloc Quebecois MPs argued that because of Quebec’s reliance on ‘clean’ hydroelectricity, it should only have to make 5% of the country’s overall reductions, while Alberta should make 40%. Theoretically, Alberta would be able to accomplish this feat by buying carbon credits from Quebec. Such a scheme would not likely change the amount of money flowing from west to east, only the wording. Instead of Quebec receiving ‘charity’ from Alberta through federal transfer payments, they would then be ‘earning’ the money from the Kyoto-motivated trading of carbon credits.Seems like France may have a similar idea.  France is largely powered by nuclear and plans to make all its transportation electric – which one can do in a temperate climate and with so many nuclear reactors.  Imagine the money it could make from Canada…especially Alberta!And this appears to be a magnificent geopolitical move on the part of President Macron to further isolate the US – creating a kind of pincer move to try and force them into carbon markets and Paris Agreement compliance as well.However, energy investment banker PPHB of the US issued their musings the same day as Prime Minister Trudeau’s address to the French National Assembly.  PPHB said of the Canadian government and Kinder Morgan’s blockaded pipeline:For the federal government, its support of certain energy projects, while fighting others, has allowed itself to be positioned as both pro energy and anti-energy. This split political personality is seen by the global energy industry as a sign Canada has evolved into a hostile location to do business. For an industry that operates with decades long planning and development timetables, this hostile attitude could cause long-term damage for Canada’s economy, and especially its western provinces where the energy industry is centred. Energy hostility will also put the mining, timber and other extractive industries on notice that their growth may soon become challenged.The Prime Minister is perhaps not aware that world oil demand rose by 1.6% (or 1.5 million barrels per day) in 2017, a rate that was more than twice the annual average of the past decade. (Summary of IEA 2017 report)Or that France’s oil company, Total SA which has recently abandoned much of the Alberta oil sands, to invest $5 billion in Iranian oil…..Because oil is not declining anywhere in the world. Demand is growing and Canada should build pipelines and join the world economy.Must we remind the Prime Minister that his forefather, like most of our ancestors, came here to Canada for a better life – not to return to the life of serfdom.Carbon dioxide is not the knob that can control climate.Carbon taxes and carbon trading do nothing to address climate change; they do nothing for the environment.  They make free people poor, and poor people hungry.

Choices. 38 times in 36 pages.Ecofiscal Commission’s April 2018 report entitled: “Clearing the Air: How Carbon Pricing Helps Canada Fight Climate Change” is filled with lofty claims about how Canada could take moral leadership on climate change, if only the public better understood the issues.  Ecofiscal authors claim that carbon taxes are the optimal solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) which have been thought to drive human-caused global warming.[1] They claim a ‘price on carbon’ helps Canada ‘fight climate change’ and gives people ‘choices.’ Ecofiscal supports their pitch with an Abacus Data survey (above, pg. 15).[1]   Interestingly, unlike the EU survey on the cover of Friends of Science Society’s rebuttal document, climate change does not even make it into the top ten of priorities for Canadians That makes us wonder – why the fuss, then? Canadians care about more important things than climate change. If we do have a choice, we need a strong economy in the here and now to adapt and develop innovative technologies. We cannot ‘fight’ or ‘solve’ climate change; we can respond to it.Ecofiscal authors claim that in other jurisdictions like the UK, Ontario, BC, and California, carbon pricing, climate policies and cap and trade have had beneficial or no negative impacts on society.We dispute those claims. We will offer evidence from international jurisdictions and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead authors and expert reviewers, to indisputably show that carbon pricing, in all its forms damages the economy. It disadvantages the poorest, destroys competitiveness, puts a dead weight on the economy[2] and does not reduce emissions by much, if at all. As well, it creates another layer of government, and a tantalizing pot of money that rarely stays ‘revenue neutral’ for long.Canada and especially the province of Alberta have significantly reduced noxious emissions from human industry over the past 30 years and have greatly improved the environment; all without a carbon tax on the little people.Carbon taxes are a noble way to poverty and fewer choices. They don’t fight climate change.  So, let’s clear the air with facts and evidence.LINK TO NEW REPORT “Let Them Eat Carbon” :  Let Them Eat Carbon FINAL R-1 April 18 2018    [1] Also known as “Anthropogenic Global Warming” or AGW. This view has been widely promoted by Al Gore. In 2005, the GHG theory was deemed, by scientists, to have outlived its usefulness as a metric for assessing climate change, but a year later Mr. Gore released his movie, it won an Oscar in 2006 and he won a Nobel peace prize in 2007, launching his catastrophic view of climate change into the public’s mind.  Only a handful of scientists foresee any catastrophic outcome from human effects on climate, though most agree we should take care of reducing noxious emissions and better manage human activities to properly adapt as climate also changes naturally, often drastically.[1] https://ecofiscal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ecosfiscal_Polling_February2018_FINAL_RELEASE.pdf[2] “deadweight loss” to the Canadian economy, in the sense that the indirect costs to the economy as a result of reduced funds to reinvest and reduced funds to pay workers exceeds the direct costs of funds paid to governments.    Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['cap and trade', 'carbon dioxide', 'carbon tax', 'climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Ecofiscal Commission', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes', 'GHG reduction targets']",2018/04/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/18/spilling-best-kept-secrets-on-the-west-coast/,,Spilling Best Kept Secrets on the West Coast," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.Here is an interesting tidbit relevant to the current British Columbia position that the resources are not available to deal with a potential oil spill off the west coast. The standard for response capability related to a potential marine oil spill is 10,000 tonnes across Canada. Why 10,000 tonnes? Because that is equivalent to the largest oil spill in Canadian history, which occurred about 50 years ago. No spill in the last 40 years comes anywhere close to that total, and the Canadian and international requirement of double-hulled tankers makes it extremely unlikely that it will ever happen again. Yet, the environmentalists on the west coast whine constantly that the response standard is not high enough. In its submission to the Tanker Safety Expert Panel (TSEP) in 2013, the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation provided information on several topics, including the present capacity of its equipment to deal with west coast spills. It stated that, even though the standard is 10,000 tonnes, it has a present capacity (i.e. in 2013) of about 26,000 tonnes and is continuing to grow! This is an extremely important counterpoint to the claims of the B.C government, only discovered if one trolls the depths of technical detail. So, the present private sector capacity for dealing with an oil spill off the west coast is two and a half times higher than anywhere else in Canada, and that does not even count the resources of the Canadian Coast Guard, which is the main federal government response organization. No one ever raises this in response to the B.C. government’s claims because it is never publicized.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['British Columbia', 'KinderMorgan', 'oil', 'TransMountain']",2018/04/18

A year later, I thought that it would be a good time to take stock.Robert Lyman’s presentation “Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?” from the 2017 Friends of Science Society’s Annual Event.  Tickets now on sale for this year’s event “Extreme Climate Uncertainty.”   The announcement by Kinder Morgan on April 8 that it has suspended all “non-essential” spending on its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion due to opposition from the British Columbia government has brought to a head the controversy over oil pipeline construction in Canada. Kinder Morgan warned that it will not commit any more dollars to the $7.4-billion project unless it can get agreement from the province to stand aside by the end of May. The pipeline expansion would increase the flow of crude oil from Alberta to British Columbia and on to Asian markets.  Despite being approved by the federal government after lengthy review by the National Energy Board and other agencies, the pipeline’s progress continues to be threatened by provincial regulations, legal challenges and popular demonstrations. As they say in the disaster movies, “How did it ever come to this?” The Trans Mountain Expansion has thus found itself right at the nexus between national climate policies, environmental radicalism, the Alberta oil industry’s desperate need for more access to markets, and regional politics.  The Issue Objectively, and despite the claims of environmentalist opponents, the case in favour of the pipeline expansion is overwhelming. The expanded capacity would remove many of the infrastructure constraints that now limit market access and force Canadian oil producers to sell their production at deeply discounted prices.   Scotiabank recently estimated that these discounts will cost Canada more than $30 billion over the 2017 to 2019 period. That is $30 billion that would otherwise go not just to industry but also to governments in the form of taxes and royalties. The National Energy Board probed every conceivable environmental effect of the project in depth during three and a half years of hearings and quasi-judicial review. The Transport Canada TERMPOL Review similarly examined all aspects of the potential for oil spills during the marine transport of oil from the Westridge Terminal, as well as the capability of industry and the Canadian Coast Guard to quickly and effectively deal with any spill; it found the current regime to be world-class. The federal government has issued a certificate for pipeline construction to proceed, and there is virtually no doubt that this matter falls exclusively under federal government jurisdiction. Federal ministers, including the Prime Minister, have repeatedly declared in public that they will ensure that the pipeline is built. In its essence, therefore, the issue at stake is not climate change, the adequacy of present regimes to deal with pipeline or tanker spills, or the sharing of economic benefits from the project. The issue is whether the rule of law will be respected, and whether the federal government will defend its jurisdictional authority and override one province’s efforts to block interprovincial trade. So, why has the federal government not taken the actions necessary to do this? The answer is, sadly, quite clear. There is no political “downside” to promising that the pipeline will proceed, only to actually ensuring that it does. Retrospect To be fair, the Trudeau government’s freedom for maneuver at this stage is very limited. It has spent its first two and a half years in office implementing a “progressive” agenda that places top priority on reducing emissions to meet global climate change goals, on promoting a feminist agenda, and on “reconciliation” with indigenous people, by which it means giving aboriginal groups significantly more authority and influence in public policy decisions. Its attitude towards the hydrocarbons industry and pipelines has been made clear through a series of decisions: In December 2016 the Trudeau government imposed a five-year moratorium on all oil and gas drilling in Canada’s Arctic regions, and shortly thereafter announced that it would not allow companies with existing exploration licenses to extend them. Aboriginals and environmentalists cheered this as a victory for the government’s climate change policies.In May 2017, with no empirical evidence to support its claim that increased oil tanker traffic unduly threatened the environment (indeed, with well-documented evidence from the National Energy Board’s examination of the proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline that no such threat exists), the government imposed a complete tanker ban off the coast of northern British Columbia. This lead to the cancellation of the Northern Gateway project.When some municipalities in the Montreal region and a few rowdy demonstrators opposed the proposed Energy East Pipeline project, the Trudeau government announced in September 2017 that, for the first time, the scope of the NEB’s review would be broadened to examine not just the direct environmental effects of the pipeline but also the upstream (i.e. production-related) and downstream (i.e. refining and consumption-related) greenhouse gas emissions. In short, the already long environmental assessment process would be greatly expanded in scope. Trans-Canada Pipelines, the sponsor of Energy East, saw the writing on the wall, and abandoned the project. Perhaps the most telling blow to the prospects for new hydrocarbon development and pipeline construction in Canada came from the 2017 report of the government’s National Energy Board Modernization Review Panel.  The report set out a number of recommendations for major institutional change, including the elimination of the National Energy Board. The alleged justification for this departure from long-standing Canadian regulatory practice is that the National Energy Board does not now provide an authoritative, independent and expert review of the public interest considerations that apply to energy transmission systems. Various parties, including several environmental and aboriginal representatives who provided comments to the panel, claimed this was so. In fact, the panel appears to have accepted all of this testimony as truth, without making any effort to check the factual accuracy of the allegations. The Panel report presented a “vision” of a new policy and regulatory regime that would be a bureaucratic nightmare for any company that sought approval for new hydrocarbon energy infrastructure. The regime would have two stages. The first stage would entail a policy review and approval by federal officials and the Canadian Cabinet; as described in the panel report, it would be a thinly disguised screening process to test for acceptability to climate change considerations. The second stage would be a more technical review by a panel dominated by environmental and aboriginal interests. The process would, in theory, take one to four years, but as most projects would be denied after policy review, it can be presented as “more efficient”. Any project that made it through the entire process would almost certainly be wrapped up in regulatory reviews and public consultations for many years. The delay itself would probably make most projects unfeasible. The Expert Panel recommended that the entire NEB organization and process be overturned in order to “align NEB activities with national policy goals”. What are the national energy policy goals? The NEB already undertakes extensive analysis and review of the economic, environmental, social, engineering, financial, and safety issues. Does that not offer a comprehensive list of all the non-political issues that a government might wish to consider on the record and with full public input? Yes, it does, with one large exception that the Expert Panel considers pre-eminent – climate change. The Expert Panel’s report makes clear that it sees the public interest, the “strategic energy policy” consideration, as the need to constrain the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. It finds it intolerable that the “federal government (in partnership with the provinces) is exploring the creation of large pipeline projects which inherently signal planned increases in our overall production and continued global and domestic use of fossil fuels, an objective that is seemingly at irreconcilable odds with Canada’s stated goal of reducing emissions and moving away from fossil fuels.” It thus favoured the introduction of an initial energy strategy stage at which federal government departments, followed by the federal Cabinet, would make a decision on a project’s alignment with the national interest, meaning primarily with the government climate change policy. The panel’s report, in short, stated that Canada has already decided to phase out the production and use of fossil fuels as part of its climate change policy and that all decisions on new energy infrastructure must be taken based upon this over-riding policy goal.  In fact, at no time has the federal government publicly accepted the premise that meeting Canada’s international climate change-related obligations requires us to shut down one of our most important industries or to deprive Canadians of access to low cost, efficient fossil fuels. Nonetheless, the Trudeau government accepted the panel’s recommendations and they are now being implemented. Having done this, it has undercut its own argument that the judgment of the NEB with respect to the Trans Mountain Pipeline Project can be relied on. Apart from the policy issues, the Trudeau government has performed a delicate balancing act in terms of how it manages the politics of these issues. Ministers spoke of the need for major hydrocarbon projects to obtain a “social licence”, or general public acceptance that they are in the public interest, with again only one test of what constitutes the public interest – consistency with GHG emission reduction goals. Many leaders in Canada’s petroleum industry and in the Alberta government appear to have accepted on faith that the Trudeau government’s support, along with that of the major environmental organizations, could be secured if they acquiesced in the implementation of a series of climate change-inspired measures. These included the setting of caps on oil sands emissions, adoption of stringent emission reduction plans, and the imposition of carbon taxes at rates equal to or above the federal Canada-wide carbon tax regime. It is clear in retrospect that the environmentalist organizations never accepted such a tradeoff. Indeed, the very idea that a company that had secured approval from a well-qualified, independent regulatory body that its project was in the public interest should be further required to overcome a political hurdle undermines traditional standards of public governance. It was naïve of the industry to trust in such a compromise and scandalously cynical of the Trudeau government to have demanded it. ProspectsAt the present juncture, the Trudeau government still has a number of legal and policy instruments that it can call upon to persuade the British Columbia government to stop throwing up roadblocks and using delaying tactics in the hopes of pushing Kinder Morgan beyond the limits of the company’s patience. The meeting among the Prime Minister and the Premiers on April 15 resulted in no agreement, simply a signal that Canada and Alberta are prepared to take fiscal measures, presumably including taxpayer guarantees to Kinder Morgan, to reduce or eliminate the company’s risks. The federal government has provided large taxpayer guarantees to other large projects in the past, notably to ensure the building of the Lower Churchill hydro project in Newfoundland and Labrador. In this case, however, such assistance, even if warranted, does not address the central problem – the determined intransigence of the British Columbia government and the willingness of protesters in B.C. to physically block construction at every opportunity. Nothing less than a strong demonstration of the federal government’s willingness to address the security, as well as the legal and political issues will really eliminate the risks to Kinder Morgan or the rule of law. Some will criticize Kinder Morgan if it backs away in the absence of a clear resolution. However, to date the company has done all that is asked of it in terms of due diligence and compliance with regulatory requirements. It is reasonable for it to demand, on behalf of its shareholders, that governments provide regulatory certainty. At the same time, it is a major company with interests and investment opportunities all over North America; it will make its choices based on what best serves the company’s interests, not necessarily those of Canada or the Canadian petroleum industry. The political dynamic for the Trudeau government does not favour a punitive response, in terms of legal actions or withholding of federal funds, to B.C.’s intransigence.  Its chances for re-election certainly do not rest on gaining seats in Alberta; the entire 21 seats in the province can probably be written off in any case, whereas there are potentially 28 seats in British Columbia. Implications for Confederation If, as seems likely, British Columbia maintains its opposition and Kinder Morgan withdraws its application to build the pipeline expansion, the environmentalists in British Columbia and those inside and outside of Canada who fund them will be much encouraged to take on the next challenge. One can only speculate at the political consequences for the Trudeau government. It will have further validated its “climate change credentials”. To understand what that will mean for the rest of Canada, one has to recall the magnitude of the emissions reductions goals that the Trudeau government and several provincial governments have voluntarily imposed on Canada. The present federal targets are to achieve a 17% emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2020 and a 30% emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. I previously posted an article that examined the implications for Canada of seeking to attain these goals. It can be read here: http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/30/the-storyline-that-does-not-add-up/ In essence, Canada seems very unlikely to meet the 2020 emission reduction goal even if we experienced a recession similar to that during the 2007-2009 period. Meeting the 2030 target would require that emissions decline from a 2015 level of 722 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt) to 447 Mt, a reduction of 275 Mt. The Canadian public and the media seem to have no idea of how large and costly such a change would be. To illustrate, completely stopping emissions from oil and gas production everywhere in Canada and shutting down all heavy industry would only achieve a reduction of 264 Mt, not meet the target. Cuts of that magnitude seem beyond belief, but who would have imagined ten years ago that a radical minority of environmentalists could bring the Canadian oil sands industry to its knees and ride roughshod over the economic ambitions of an entire province?  Even going half way to such an emissions reduction goal would mean severe cuts to industries like auto and parts manufacturing, refineries and petrochemicals, mining and metals fabrication, cement, aluminum and steel. Whatever benefits Canadian industry would hope to attain from a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement would be eliminated. The cost in terms of lost revenues for the federal and provincial governments would compel an unprecedented austerity program that would entail cuts to almost every area of expenditure. Even the vaunted carbon tax revenues would not be sufficient to avoid this. The advocates of deep emissions cuts will claim that they can all be achieved by the construction of more wind and solar energy generation. This conveniently ignores that even if this were possible, wind and solar are useful only for electricity generation, and all the electricity generation in Canada only accounts for 79 Mt of emissions per year. Given this, try to envision scenarios in which Canada’s energy consumption and related emissions can be cut by 275 Mt in twelve years without wrenching changes and high costs. We are only at the beginning of a period in which climate policy causes strains in federal-provincial relations. The impact of carbon taxes, now scheduled to rise to $50 per tonne in 2022 but probably much higher after that, will fall most heavily on Alberta and Saskatchewan but also on all industries than must compete with foreign suppliers. The differences in charges imposed on consumers in provinces that use cap and trade programs and those that use carbon taxes may give rise to more inter-provincial trade disputes and battles between the federal and provincial governments. The ever-increasing burden of regulations and restrictions on resource development will stress the provinces without strong industrial or service sectors. The cumulative effects of these measures will strain Confederation more than any other issue. If, as now appears possible, new provincial governments opposed to federal climate measures are elected, there will be a continuation and expansion of the profoundly divisive national debate on this subject.Trans Mountain Expansion Project-TERMPOL Assessment of Oil Spill RiskMOVING OIL BY TANKER IN CANADA: The Facts.MOVING OIL BY TANKER IN CANADA: The Facts.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'British Columbia', 'carbon dioxide', 'climate change', 'energy', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes', 'Justin Trudeau', 'KinderMorgan', 'National Energy Board', 'oil sands', 'Paris Agreement', 'TransMountain']",2018/04/15

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/12/science-philosophy-and-inquiry-on-a-galactic-scale-a-conversation-with-dr-willie-soon/,Pierre Bouteille ,"Science, Philosophy and Inquiry on a Galactic Scale: A conversation with Dr. Willie Soon"," Contributed by Grégoire Canlorbe © 2017     These are the opinions of the author and interviewee. Updated with additional citations/links April 12, 2018 at 11:14 AM MST.Dr. Willie Soon is an independent solar physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has been studying the Sun and its influence on the Earth’s climate for more than a quarter of a century. A short while ago, he had a conversation with Mr. Grégoire Canlorbe, an independent journalist who is also vice president of the French Parti National-Libéral (“National-Liberal Party,” conservative, nationalist, and free-marketist). Here Dr. Soon speaks for himself. Canlorbe: You say polar bears are far less endangered by global warming than by environmentalists dreading ice melt. Could you expand?Dr. Soon: Yes, indeed. I have argued that too much ice will be the ultimate enemy for polar bears. Polar bears need less sea ice to be well fed and to reproduce. Why? Think about this for a minute: Polar bears eat a lot. Any large colony will need a great deal of food. The bears’ staple diet is seal blubber. But seals are a long way up the food chain. So a fully functional and healthy eco-system is required. And that means oceans warm enough to support the lower links in the food chain from plankton all the way up to seals.Indeed, a good puzzle for polar-bear science is to answer the question how polar bears survived during the ice ages, when ice covered coastal zones and large parts of the global ocean. Ice was piled miles deep on land, making it extremely difficult for eco-systems to provide enough food. Of course, areas of relative warmth, which population biologists call refugia, always exist. They may well be the key to explaining how polar bears survived the Last Glacial Maximum about 21,000 years ago. The so-called “environmentalists”, who seem to allow unreasoning emotion and political prejudice to stand in place of rational thought and sound science, became very angry when I asked them whether they would prefer to see a billion polar bears instead of the 20,000–30,000 living now. The real threat to polar bears was unregulated hunting, which reduced the population to perhaps as few as 5,000 bears in the early 1970s.After the November 1973 agreement to regulate hunting and outlaw hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, the polar bear population rebounded. By 2017 it was approaching 30,000. In 2016 a survey by the Nunavut government found a vulnerable population in the western Hudson Bay region to have been stable for at least five years.I should say categorically that this polar bear fear-mongering is evidence of mass delusion promoted by group think. As a physical scientist rather than a biologist, I am generally reluctant to get involved in such topics as the influence of climate on polar-bear population, health and biology. But in 2002, Markus Dyck asked me to examine independently these strange and insupportable claims by environmental extremists that polar bears are threatened with extinction by global warming.Consider the facts. From 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, the Earth was considerably warmer than today. Yet the polar bears survived. In fact, they had evolved from land-based brown bears some 150,000 to 200,000 years ago, and to this day they rear their cubs in land-based dens burrowed into the snow.Four dead bears found in an aerial survey of the Beaufort Sea (Monnett & Gleason, 2006)  Readers curious about Al Gore’s false statement that a scientific survey had found polar bears drowning because they could not find ice should see my talk on how environmentalists are the real threat to polar bears: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmoKRz5VcbI. The survey cited by Gore in his sci-fi comedy horror movie in fact found that just four polar bears had drowned, three of them very close to land, and they had died because of high winds and high waves in an exceptional Arctic storm. The authors of the paper were later victimized by their academic colleagues at the instigation of environmental extremists because they had stated – correctly – that it was the storm, and not global warming, that had killed the bears.What is more, in the dozen years before the survey, the sea ice extent in the Beaufort Sea, where the survey took place, had actually increased slightly. At no point was Al Gore’s story true. In 2007 the High Court in London condemned Gore for his false statements about polar bears, whose Linnaean classification is ursus maritimus – the Bear of the Sea. It is now known that they can swim for more than 100 miles over periods of several days. Al Gore could not even ride a pushbike that far.One positive aspect of my work in science is that I have befriended many seekers after truth. A polar bear expert, Professor Mitch Taylor of Lakehead University, told me late in 2017:Just finished up in Davis Strait with 275 DNA samples. The bears were in better condition this year than they were during the 2005–2007 study years. The Wrangel Island bears in the photo are in good condition, but the Davis Strait bears were even fatter. Markus [Dyck] has found the same in the Cape Dyer area. Local people confirm the bears are very fat this year and are also reporting a big increase in ringed seals (immigration, not local productivity). Keen readers who may want solid information and frequent scientific updates about the overall health and trends of all 19 subpopulations of polar bears should visit the website of another friend of mine, Dr. Susan Crockford: http://polarbearscience.com.Is climate change naturally cyclical?Canlorbe: Climate change is surely nothing new. It is a long-established, cyclical behavior of our planet, which has long been oscillating between glaciations and interglacial warm periods. Should we diagnose Mother Nature with a bipolar disorder?Dr. Soon: Earth’s climate system dynamically oscillates between icehouse and hothouse conditions in geological time or, to a lesser degree, between the glacial and interglacial climates of the last 1–2 million years. But, as with many interesting questions about the Earth’s climate, there is no certain answer. The data do not support over-simplistic accounts.Sea level rise – mother of all scaresI was fascinated to discover that changing sea levels, including extremely high global sea levels 65–250 feet (20–75 m) above today’s mean, occurred during the “hothouse Earth” era. One does not need an enormous ice sheet for sea level to be high, chiefly because the Earth’s coastal zones and ocean basins may be more porous and capacious than one would imagine. Indeed, deep geological studies proffer good evidence to support my position. I included this empirical evidence in an essay I recently co-wrote with Viscount (Christopher) Monckton of Brenchley.In addition to the ever-changing shape and depth of the ocean basins and coastal zone boundaries, one must also bear in mind the “leaky Earth”: There appears to be a continuous exchange of water between the ocean bottom and the Earth’s crust, as Professor Shige Maruyama of Tokyo Institute of Technology has shown.Sea level has risen by 400 feet over the past 10,000 years. For the past 200 years it has been rising at about 8 inches per century, and that rate may well continue. It has very little to do with global warming and much more to do with long-term climate cycles. In fact, so slowly has sea level been rising that environmental-extremist scientists have tampered with the raw data by adding an imagined (and imaginary) “global isostatic adjustment”, torturing the data until they show a rate of sea-level rise that has not in reality occurred.The Earth in the solar system in the galaxy in the universeMy own examination of the Earth’s climate system extends beyond the solar system to include our place in the galaxy. When the solar system was born, we were 1–3 kiloparsecs closer to the galactic center than today. We are now 8 kiloparsecs from the galactic center.The solar system drifts along the spiral density wave that orbits the center of the galaxy about every quarter of a billion years. Sometimes, the solar system has lain above or below the plane of the galactic disk. Also, we need to consider the evolution of the Sun from its thermonuclear-burning core to its outer thermosphere. Furthermore, for 4.5 billion years the planets have continued to push and pull the Sun around the barycenter of the solar system.It was 13.82 billion years ago that, at the moment of creation that we now call the Big Bang, God said, Let there be light, and there was light. The solar system, including our planet, is thus one-third as old as the known universe. Our place and time in the universe cannot be ignored in assessing the climate. The original proposition to resolve the Faint Young Sun Paradox by WeiJia Zhang of Peking University concerned the relevance of Hubble expansion flow in affecting the mean distance between the Sun and the Earth over geological time. One must even consider our galaxy’s interaction with passing stellar systems, especially the coming merger (in a few billion years) between the Milky Way and the M31 Andromeda galaxy to form the Milkomeda cluster. This very likely event will occur within the next five billion years of the Sun’s lifetime. Gravity rules even over very large distances.Screenshot of representational images of coming merger of galaxiesThese are just a few of the considerations that lead me to insist on being open-minded in pursuing my scientific study. I study the Sun mainly to improve my own understanding. As A.E. Housman’s Greek chorus used to put it, “I only ask because I want to know.”It’s the Sun, stupid!On August 31, 2012 a long filament of solar material that had been hovering in the sun’s atmosphere, the corona, erupted out into space at 4:36 p.m. EDT. The coronal mass ejection, or CME, traveled at over 900 miles per second. The CME did not travel directly toward Earth, but did connect with Earth’s magnetic environment, or magnetosphere, causing aurora to appear on the night of Monday, September 3.Picuted here is a lighten blended version of the 304 and 171 angstrom wavelengths.

Would you like to remind us of the keystones of your hypothesis?Dr. Soon: For a quarter of a century I have studied the hypothesis that solar radiation is causing or at lest modulating climatic variations over periods of several decades. The most up-to-date report of my sun-climate connection research is in a chapter I and my colleague Dr. Sallie Baliunas contributed to a book in honor of my late colleague Professor Bob Carter of Australia (1942–2016). For the more serious science geeks, a fuller paper, with my two excellent colleagues from Ireland, the Connollys pere et fils, is worth reading. If your readers have any difficulty in finding these works, just contact me.I have sought the best empirical evidence to show how changes in incoming solar radiation, accounted for by intrinsic solar magnetic modulation of the irradiance output as well as planetary modulation of the seasonal distribution of sunlight, affects the thermal properties of land and sea, including temperatures. In turn, temperature change affects atmospheric water vapor as well as the more dynamical components of equator-to-pole insolation and of temperature gradients that vary on timescales of decades to hundreds of years.Readers may like to follow the original hypothesis of a connection between the Sun and climate advanced by the team led by my excellent colleague Professor Hong Yan of the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences at Xi’an, China. Our paper examines how the incoming solar radiation modulates the expansion and shrinkage of the rain-belts in dynamically active regions such as the Western Pacific Warm Pool. A second example shows how the Indian summer monsoonal rainfall is correlated with a specific metric for incoming solar radiation.A third example would be the research on how incoming solar irradiance influences China’s thermometer temperature records, showing that over periods of many decades the variations in total solar irradiance in the upper atmosphere are matched by variations at the surface.I regard this empirical result, detectable notwithstanding the complexities of cloud fields within the atmospheric column, as of the highest importance. We are on the right track after all in investigating solar radiation (rather than something else) as the driver and modulator of most things climatic.The Maunder MinimumCanlorbe: The Maunder Minimum, also known as the “prolonged sunspot minimum”, was the subject of a book you co-authored with Steven H. Yaskell in 2003. For the layman, would you like to explain the stellar phenomena observed during this period?Dr. Soon: The Maunder Minimum was indeed a very notable period in the study of sunspot activity or, more specifically, of the Sun’s magnetism. It lasted from 1645–1715, covering most of the reign of the Sun King (Louis XIV, 1638–1715; regnavit May 14, 1643 to September 1, 1715). Indeed, the late Jack Eddy (1931–2009) was fond of popularizing this fact by saying that “the Sun King’s reign appears to have been a time of real anomaly in the behavior of the Sun”.Another interesting coincidence is the fact that Saint-Gobain, makers of the glass for the Hall of Mirrors of Versailles, also made the mirrors for the 60-inch telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory where my colleagues (especially Dr. Sallie Baliunas) and I used to study the variations in the activity of solar-type stars. From these observations, we were able to confirm the general Maunder-Minimum-like phase of solar-stellar magnetism.I worked with Steve Yaskell in writing this book as a labor of love. Our first purpose was to honor the insights of the two dedicated observers of our Star, E. Walter Maunder (1851–1928) and Annie Maunder (1868–1947). I also wanted to dismiss the arrogance and poor scholarship I had noticed among climate scientists. Professors Raymond Bradley and Philip Jones, for instance, had said with great certainty in one of their books that the geologist Francois Emile Matthes (1874–1948) had originated the term “Little Ice Age” which is roughly coincidental with the period of the Maunder Minimum. However, a little research (see pp. 208–209 of our book) shows that Matthes had attributed the phrase not to himself but to “a clever journalist”.Only a few decades before Louis XIV came to the throne of France, Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) and others had first observed sunspots. During more modern times, the Maunders, re-examining sunspot records kept at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, established the famous butterfly diagram that shows the quasi-symmetrical distribution of sunspots between about 40 °N and 40 °S over the 11-year solar cycle – one butterfly per cycle.What is special about the Maunder Minimum is the fact that during that period sunspots barely appeared on the Sun’s northern hemisphere and, when they appeared in the Southern portion, the dark spots were very narrowly crowded within a narrow band 20 degrees off the solar equator. This information is uniquely available thanks to the impeccable telescopic observations from L’Observatoire de Paris. My late colleague, Elisabeth Nesme-Ribes (1942–1996), very poetically described this period as that of the “broken butterfly wings”.The butterfly diagrams of sunspot activity from 1666–1719 (left) contrasted with 1945–1990 (right). From J.C. Ribes and E. Nesme-Ribes (1993) The sunspot cycle in the Maunder Minimum, 1645–1715, Astronomy & Astrophysics 276:549, fig. 6.It is sometimes said that the Maunder Minimum was merely an illusion or a confusion. However, several colleagues and I, led by Professor Ilya Usoskin of the University of Oulu, Finland, were able to affirm the reality of the Maunder Minimum by summarizing all available evidence, including confirmation from the broader phenomenon of Grand Minima as deduced from cosmogenic isotopes and other proxies for pre-instrumental solar activity.Astrology vs. AstronomyCanlorbe: In the view of many, IPCC’s predictions based on computer models are little better than Tarot cards and astrological predictions. Given your expertise in solar and stellar physics, do you see solid reasons not to regard astrology as reliable?Dr. Soon: I am confused by the question. As a scientist, I do not see either evidence or any mechanism by which the relative positions of very distant heavenly objects can assist us in predicting whether any of us will “meet a tall, dark stranger” or win the lottery. However, an active area of scientific enquiry asks why and how the Sun’s magnetism varies. It may be that it is modulated by inertial oscillations within the plasma body of the Sun owing to perturbations caused by the planets, and chiefly by the gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. But that is astronomy, not astrology. Astronomy is clearly within the scientific realm, but divination by means of astrology, just as clearly, is not.The Sun card from the Tarot of MarseilleAt this point, I wish to say something about the misuse of computer climate models by the United Nations’ IPCC as a supposed “scientific” mode of divining the Earth’s climate over the next 20, 50, 100, 1,000 or even 100,000 years. Dr. Dallas Kennedy has coined the phrase “uncontrolled numerical approximations” for all climate model simulations inconsistent with the observed climate and insufficiently scrutinized.The current state of our understanding of the dynamical evolution and variability of the Earth’s climate, in the observational as much as in the theoretical domain, is so immature that, as prudent and careful scientists, we should stop and think. I am confident that, even if we were able to find some “agreement” between the outputs of the current generation of climate models and the available measurements and observations, we ought to be cautious, because we can be almost 100% certain that the apparent agreement is fundamentally incorrect.Let us heed the caution raised by the world’s most knowledgeable atmospheric physicist, Professor Richard Siegmund Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology:What historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that CO2, the life of plants, was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.The Philosophy of ScienceCanlorbe: The Sun has inspired a famous analogy in Plato’s theory of forms: namely, that the Sun, as the sixth book of The Republic says, allows us to see material things in the visible world, just as the Idea of the Good allows us to comprehend incorporeal or abstract concepts in the intelligible realm. Any entity existing in the visible world is intelligible only by virtue of a corresponding Idea that gives it an order, a sense, and an identity. And the Idea of the Good is the divine Sun that allows us, once it is grasped, to know all existing Ideas in the intelligible world. As a debunker of “scientism”, do you recognize some relevance to this Platonic concept of scientific inquiry?Dr. Soon: I agree with the claim made by Justice Louis Brandeis (1856–1941) that “if the broad light of day could be let in upon men’s actions, it would purify them as the Sun disinfects”. Transparency in all human affairs, including our scientific endeavors, is essential.Honestly, I am less of an epistemological philosopher than a natural philosopher – a mere humble scientist, or, if you like, a Shakespearean “rude mechanical”. I subscribe to David Mermin’s principle: “Shut up and calculate!” Science starts with quantitatively expressible evidence and applies to that evidence the honest, careful, disciplined manipulation of numbers that we call mathematics. Mathematics, then, is at once the language of science and its currency. In scientific inquiry, fully open and objective transparency (especially concerning the methodology and openness of datasets) is the most important requirement. Unfortunately, after more than a quarter of a century working in climate science, I have seen at first hand that these simple rules of science are too often honoured more in the breach than in the observance.To bear witness to how damaging the flawed processes have been in climate science, I strongly recommend reading the refined essay by Professor Lindzen titled “Climate science – is it currently designed to answer questions?”Lindzen12-March-ClimateScienceNOTansweringQFor more detail on the level of corruption and dishonesty that prevails in global warming science, I recommend my recent talk given at the 2017 meeting of Doctors for Disaster Preparedness: https://youtu.be/aYAy871w9t8. For debunking the popular “scientism”, I recommend a serious article that I wrote with my late friend, Professor István Markó (1956–2017) for Breitbart.There are scientists and there are mere propagandists. For instance, Bill Nye, the soi-disant “science guy”, is in truth Bill Nye the totalitarian propaganda guy. In telling it like it is about Bill Nye, Luke Barnes said this:In an age when a number of prominent scientists have said profoundly idiotic things about philosophy, Bill Nye, the “science guy” has produced the Gettysburg Address of philosophical ignorance. It would be hard to write a parody that compressed more stupidity and shallowness into 4 minutes.Let me close this reply on the philosophy of science by quoting Professor Chris Essex of the University of Western Ontario, from his review of the book The Climate Caper by Garth Paltridge:Anti-skepticism isn’t science. At best it’s a kind of para-science, because skepticism is inherent to the scientific process. This para-science is the unprecedented, powerful, well-funded force, not the much-maligned skeptics. Even the oil companies go against the cliché and fund it. It’s the skepticism inherent to science that is embattled. Everything else is delusion and lies. That is how the science has been damaged. … Many scientists, including me, are worried that humanity has been paying too high a price in subordinating science to these agendas. Years from now, historians will look back on this period as extraordinary. The great social fervour was over something that only seems like science. It’s of science but lacks the heart of science. It will take generations to pick through the detritus, but this period will ultimately tell us far more about ourselves than Nature. Soon it will be over. If doom has not ensued, the climate science tourists will leave for other errands.Canlorbe: If I may somewhat reformulate Rudolf Clausius’ statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the total entropy of a sufficiently isolated system, no matter where it be in the universe, tends to a maximum. It is not uncommon to hear that the Second Law is proven wrong by the imagined history of the cosmos, given the universe, from the very first particles and atoms to the most advanced human civilizations, appears to have been evolving steadily towards higher degrees of order and complexity. Another opinion is that the Second Law remains true, although life on Earth, which receives energy continuously from the Sun and which is not, therefore, an isolated system, seems at first sight to violate the Law. As an astrophysicist who specializes in solar activity, how do you react to the arguments against the universality and truth of the Second Law?Dr Soon: Before I reply, it is interesting that you raise the name of Rudolf Clausius (1822–1888), because Clausius’ derivation, together with Emile Clapeyron (1799–1864), of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation between the temperature of the atmospheric space and the capacity of that space to carry water vapor is critical to the construction of a proper theory of climate.As to the reformulation of the Second Law following its original formulation by Sadi Carnot (1796–1832), Clausius, of all the citizens of the universe, understood that life on Earth is made possible owing to the energy from the Sun. Low-entropy photons begin their journey to Earth at a temperature of about 6,000 K. By the time they reach the upper atmosphere, entropy has already done its work and they keep the Earth at a temperature 20 times less than that at which they began their eight-minute journey.To bring this reply down to Earth (pun intended) and to return the focus to climate, it has long been realized that strict application of conservation of energy alone may not yield to the full understanding of climatic variations. Starting in the 1980s, an active field of scientific research was developed by the gurus of the maximum-entropy principle in climate models, such as imaginative scientists like Garth Paltridge, whose book I mentioned earlier. If one is interested in this esoteric subject, there is a recent paper treating entropy as the emergent primary quantity for describing the nature of couplings and interactions in the climate system.I should also point out that the theory of greenhouse gas warming does not, as is sometimes thought, in any way violate the Second Law. It is not the theory that is wrong, but the incorrect modeling that leads official climatology greatly to overstate the warming that will occur as we return to the atmosphere some small fraction of the carbon dioxide that came from the atmosphere in the first place.As you will have gathered, I am a natural philosopher and not an epistemological or moral philosopher. My language is not that of theology or of ideology but of science. I conclude my answer to your query by saying that I am simply happy to be alive, following the strictly unidirectional arrow of time, as proof that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is sound.Notwithstanding the crazy and highly corrupt atmosphere that exists in the climate science theatre, sensible, solid and active scientists such as Bjarne Andresen and Christopher Essex ask meaningful questions and reach for reasonable answers. I am content to search for topics in which I can add to the scientific understanding of the complex fluid dynamics of the Earth’s climate.Hotheads and hot weatherCanlorbe: People from South America, Africa, Italy and the Middle East are sometimes thought of as having elevated testosterone levels and, consequently, a propensity to solve political conflicts through violence. These populations are thought of as being warm-blooded, or even hot-headed, owing to the hot climates in which they live. Do you warmly welcome this hypothesis or hotly deny it?Dr Soon: I am very happy to receive such a question, for I am always trying to understand the extent to which life is dependent upon and influenced by the Sun.Professor John Todd of the University of Cambridge has recently published a paper that focuses on how some 5,135 out of 22,822 human genes studied for immunity and general physiology exhibited seasonal dependence on incoming sunlight. This finding that the Sun directly influences about a quarter of our genome adds a profound insight and possibly legitimacy to the broad statements you list above. But far more importantly, it proffers a proper and scientific approach to such a question.  This is why it is not a complete surprise that the 2017 Nobel Prize in Medicine  was given for the discovery of “molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm.”Indeed, for what is worth, in 1927 Sir Arthur Eddington (1882–1944), on page 9 of his book Stars and Atoms, remarked that the height of a man (2 m) is about halfway between the diameter of an atom (2 x 10–10 m) and that of the Sun (2 x 109 m): “Nearly midway in scale between the atom and the star there is another structure no less marvellous: the human body”.Recent statistics from 380 sites in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and the USA show that cold weather kills 20 times more people than warm weather. What is more, 90% of the world’s species thrive in the tropics, and less than 1% exist at the Poles.We must distill the question to a solvable core and examine it properly through scientific methodology. I recently gave a talk about the powerful relationships among various co- factors including seasonal sunlight, seasonal temperature change, sea level, and even tectonic activity that extends back to the bipolar Quaternary ice-ages and interglacial warm periods of last 2.6 million years.Are environmentalists Fascist?Canlorbe: Although environmentalist and self-proclaimed antifascist movements obviously share the totalitarian dimension of Italian Fascism – at least, in its final version – they may not share the anthropology and the view of nature that were at the heart of Fascist ideology. As Benito Mussolini wrote in The Doctrine of Fascism, published in 1932, “Fascism wants man to be active and to engage in action with all his energies; it wants him to be manfully aware of the difficulties besetting him and ready to face them. … Hence the high value of culture in all its forms (artistic, religious, scientific) and the outstanding importance of education. Hence also the essential value of work, by which man subjugates nature and creates the human world (economic, political, ethical, and intellectual).” Does Trumpian conservatism or green socialism come closest to the spirit of historical Fascism as expressed above?Dr. Soon (with help from Christopher Monckton of Brenchley): Fascism, National Socialism, International Socialism and Communism are all disfiguring and mutually indistinguishable instances of the totalitarianism that the political philosophers of early imperial China excoriated as “legalism” and the French philosophers as étatisme, intégrisme and dirigisme. The contrasting political theory was and is known to Chinese thinkers as Confucianism and to us as libertarianism and democracy.Mussolini no more acted upon the fine-sounding sermons he preached than did Hitler, Lenin, Stalin or Mao Tse-Tung. Each of these monsters, whatever they may have preached about the importance of science, showed the same propensity to interfere with it, to politicize it and to wrench it into conformity with some dull but dangerous, ingenious but ignorant, marketable but murderous Party Line as environmentalist International Socialism does today.A bust of Mussolini in an antique shop in VeniceSome 250 million people have been killed by totalitarian regimes of the extreme Left – the Communists, the Nazis and the Fascists – over the century since the dismal October Revolution of 1917. You will understand, therefore, that I disagree with your apparent attempt to assert that President Trump is a fascist: for his supporters would no doubt argue that he has spoken and acted for those working people whom the totalitarian “Democrats”, with their pointlessly costly regime of taxes, charges and regulations intended to destroy the coal, oil and gas industries and the many other industries depending on them, had wantonly abandoned. And it should never be forgotten that modern environmentalist socialism was invented by Hitler in Mein Kampf as a method of exercising that fingertip control over every aspect of people’s lives and work that all totalitarians crave.Such questions, however, are more political than scientific. Beyond saying that science tends to be corrupted by cruel notions such as eugenicism or Lysenkoism under totalitarian regimes, and to prosper in a climate of freedom, I respectfully decline to address your question. I do not do politics, as the environmentalist socialists do. I do science. As Lucretius put it, Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas – happy is he who finds the why of things. Science is my be-all and end-all.EnvoiCanlorbe: Thank you for your time. Is there anything you would like to add?Dr. Soon: I wish to thank you for your excellent questions. You have given me the opportunity to pause and reflect on concepts I have not contemplated in quite some time. I have simply shared my humble but sincere premise that the search for the truth in science must prevail.

How much will it cost?  Will it be effective?  To what extent? Where is the cost-benefit analysis of proposed ‘action’?Further, instead of asking the general public questions about climate change and their perceptions, let’s look at what experts in the sciences think, whose responses are based on the evidence and on scientific principles they deal with every day.  Albertans were identified as ‘laggards’ in the survey – ironically Alberta has some 70,000 registered Professional Geoscientists and Professional Engineers – one of the highest per capita concentrations of scientific experts in Canada.  Likewise, until recently, many such experts were also commonly found in Alberta politics, bringing their significant expertise to matters of energy and climate change. This 2012 Lefsrud and Meyer survey gives some insight into the views of such professionals on climate change and potential for mitigation.The COP-21 Paris Agreement is always presented as the reason that Canada ‘must’ meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets; thus Ecofiscal’s idea is that a price on carbon or carbon tax/cap and trade will cause people to use less fossil fuel based energy, and so reach our targets, but that is a fantasy.First of all, individual emissions are nominal compared to those of industry (see Robert Lyman’s video below). Secondly, the Paris agreement is non-binding. Thirdly, no signatory is expected to meet their targets. Fourthly,  the reduction in warming if all signatory nations met all targeted commitments would be only 0.17 degree C (seventeen one hundredths of a degree Celsius).  Lastly, in Canada, where distances are great and winters are long, dark and cold, there is no viable alternative to fossil fuels.This is why a carbon tax in Canada will impose undue hardship on everyone. (except the green crony capitalists who play the carbon trading markets – they will have a field day on your dimes and dollars.)Read: Just the Facts on Paris AgreementRobert Lyman explains why turning down the thermostat and putting on the sweater won’t save the world (though you may personally benefit slightly from being more energy efficient where it makes sense).     Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'cap and trade', 'carbon dioxide', 'carbon tax', 'climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Paris Agreement']",2018/04/11
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/09/the-international-energy-agency-global-energy-and-co2-status-report-2017/,,The International Energy Agency: Global Energy and CO2 Status Report 2017," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and former diplomat of 10 years. In March 2018, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a special report on the changes in global energy supply, demand and related carbon dioxide emissions in 2017. The full text of the report can be read here:https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/GECO2017.pdf The IEA was founded in the early 1970’s as a response of the major western oil consuming countries to the security threat that they considered was posed by the 1973-74 oil embargo of the Organization of Arab Oil Producing States (OAPEC). In the late 1980’s, in keeping with the political changes taking place in Europe, and especially the rise in influence of the European Green Parties, the IEA changed its focus and much of its rationale for existence from promoting collective security to supporting the claims that humans are causing potentially catastrophic global warming and that stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction measures were required to address this. The IEA has continued to be one of the world’s most authoritative sources of information and analysis on global energy supply and demand trends, but it has increasingly posed its reports within the framework of climate policy and promotion of “green” energy supply options. The new report states, in almost apologetic terms, that the energy situation is not unfolding as it should. Thus, the “highlights” of the report include an almost unrelenting series of updates filled with news about increasing economic activity, expanding trade, growth in energy consumption and the resulting increasing emissions: The world economy continues to grow, at a annual rate of 3.7%, with the result that global primary energy demand increased by 2.1% in 2017, compared with 0.9% on average over the previous five years.More than 72% of this growth in demand was met by fossil fuels, meaning that the proportion of global oil demand met by fossil fuels continues to increase its lead over the shares held by all other energy sources.World oil demand rose by 1.6% (or 1.5 million barrels per day) in 2017, a rate that was more than twice the annual average of the past decade. Indeed, 2017 marked the sixth consecutive year during which the global consumption of oil increased by more than one million barrels of oil per year.Global natural gas demand grew even faster, by 3%, due in large part to abundant and relatively low cost supplies. While, over the past decade, half of global natural gas demand growth came from the power sector, in 2017 over 80% of the rise came from industry and buildings.Coal refuses to die. In fact, after coal demand declined from 2013 to 2016, it grew about 1% in 2017, almost entirely due to increased coal use for electricity generation in Asia.World electricity demand increased by 3.1%, with China and India accounting for 70% of this growth. Output from nuclear power plants rose by 26 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2017.Renewables continued a high rate of growth, but with substantial differences between the additions to generation capacity and to actual generation. It should be noted that the IEA definition of renewables includes power produced by hydroelectricity. By the end of 2017, global solar power generation capacity, according to the IEA, had increased to almost 400 GW, and that of onshore and offshore industrial wind generators to about 510 GW. Of the actual electricity generation of 25,570 TWh in 2017, coal-fired generation was 35%, natural gas-fired 23%, hydro 16%, nuclear 10%, wind and solar 9%, and oil 4%.The reduction in energy intensity that has been going on for over two decades continued in 2017, but at a slower rate than in recent years. Globally, energy intensity in 2017 fell by 1.7%, which the IEA noted with sadness is only half what is required to remain “on track” with the Paris Agreement’s goals. The consequence of all this is that global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 1.4% in 2017, an increase of 460 million tonnes, to reach a historic high of 32.5 gigatonnes (Gt).  Most major economies experienced a rise in emissions, with the ironic exception of the United States, which experienced a 25 million tonne decline in emissions (the largest of any country), the United Kingdom, Mexico and Japan. Overall, Asian countries accounted for two-thirds of the increase in emissions. For the IEA, sometimes the truth hurts.  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'energy']",2018/04/09
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/09/chris-ragan-your-livelihood-depends-on-oil/,Ron Little ,Chris Ragan -Your Livelihood Depends on Oil," One of the more amusing notes in the Ecofiscal Commission’s April 2018 report, “Clearing the Air: How Carbon Pricing Helps Canada Fight Climate Change,” relates to comments on Alberta and how ‘exposed’ the province is, due to its oil and gas industry base.  Chris Ragan, Ecofiscal’s chair was rather condescendingly lamenting Alberta’s carbon/GHG exposure in the Edmonton Journal apparently without realizing that Quebec’s economic strength is reliant on … oil.And Alberta.“It’s pretty obvious that oil is an important part of the Alberta economy,” said Christopher Ragan, a McGill University economist who chairs the commission, a national economics organization that promotes reducing pollution by putting a price on it.“Some people, if they hear greenhouse gas emissions related to oil are a problem, but their livelihood is related to oil, it’s a pretty difficult thing to process.” Oily Alberta and ‘Les grands petroliers” vs Hydro-based squeaky “clean” Quebec? Hardly.The most recent data on federal government revenues collected from taxpayers in each province compared to federal government payments to governments as part of the equalization program is quite revealing. It indicates that, in 2008-2009, the federal government collected $35,990 million from Alberta taxpayers and paid zero in equalization to Alberta. In contrast, Canada collected $39,677 million from Quebec taxpayers while paying $8,028 million in equalization. A study by the Fraser Institute in 2017, found that Alberta taxpayers contributed more money to the federal government’s revenues from 2007 to 2015 than any other province. Indeed, over that period, Alberta taxpayers paid $221.4 billion more in revenue than the province received in federal transfer payments and other services in those years. That works out to $5,000 per Albertan per year. Quebec receives about 26% of its revenues in federal transfer payments. If Quebec were a company, people would be calling it Canada’s largest corporate welfare junkie. As Alberta’s prosperity wanes from the incessant global warming policy-inspired attacks on its resource industries, one of the largest external losers will be Quebec.That is the one silver lining in a very dark cloud.~~~~(As we post this, here are two oil tankers in port at Montreal.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/30/the-storyline-that-does-not-add-up/,,The Storyline That Does Not Add Up," Contributed by Robert Lyman©2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years. From time to time Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) publishes updated statistics on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada. The most recent report includes the data for 2015, as well as some historical figures going back to 1990, the base year for many of the emissions reduction targets that have been set by the federal and provincial governments. The federal government’s basic “storyline”, or policy rationale, to justify the targets is that the emissions reductions can be achieved at modest costs and without wrenching changes to living standards or the availability of energy services that citizens demand. The targets are set in relation to different baselines; some use 1990, some 2005, and some 2010, but they all entail emissions reductions of significantly increasing impact as time goes on. Thus, the federal government aims to achieve a 17% reduction from 2005 levels by 2020 and a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2050, while various provinces, including Ontario and Quebec, have more ambitious short-term reduction targets and targets for 2050 that involve reductions varying from 80% to 95% below 1990 levels. What would it actually mean, in numerical terms, if these targets were met?According to ECCC statistics, Canada’s GHG emissions were 611 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt) in 1990. They rose to 638 Mt in 2005 and 722 Mt in 2015. The emission reduction goals are therefore 530 Mt by 2020, 447 Mt by 2030 and (using the 80% reduction target) 122 Mt by 2050. Progressively more stringent targets have been set since 1990. In view of this, one might have expected that Canada’s emissions would have declined steadily from 1990 to the present. In fact, emissions rose steadily from 1990 to 2000, declined slightly in 2001 and 2002 and then rose again, peaking in 2007 before the worldwide financial crisis.  With the significant reduction in economic activity following the crisis, emissions declined to 2009, after which they have risen slightly or stayed roughly stable. The following graph shows greenhouse gas emissions by Canadian economic sector from 1990 to 2015. Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada Note how the sectorial composition of emissions has changed over the period. Emissions from oil and gas have risen steadily, both in total and comparative terms, and are now the largest sector source. From 1990 to 2015, crude oil production more than doubled. Transportation emissions have also generally risen, rising 42% from 1990 to 2015, and constitute the second largest source. Emissions from buildings, agriculture and waste have remained essentially flat. The largest emissions reductions have occurred in electricity (from a peak of 128 Mt in 2001 to 79 Mt in 2015, a 38% reduction) and in heavy industry (from a peak of 102 Mt in 1996 to 75 Mt in 2015, a 26% reduction. The following table shows the most recent sectorial breakdown. Canada’s GHG Emissions by Sector in 2015Sector Emissions (Mt)PercentageOil and Gas189.526.2Transportation173.024.0Buildings85.611.9Electricity78.710.9Heavy Industry74.610.3Agriculture72.810.1Waste and others47.66.6 To attain the 2020 target of 530 Mt, emissions would have to decline by 192 Mt from 722 Mt in 2015, an average of 38.4 Mt per year. The only years since 1990 when emissions dropped by anything comparable to that was during the worldwide economic crisis period 2007-2009, when emissions declined by 61 Mt, or an average of 30.5 Mt per year. We would need to have a far more serious economic crisis extending from 2015 to 2020 to place us on the path to meeting the 2020 target. Fortunately, this is not happening. Looking further out to the 2030 target of 447 Mt, this would require a reduction of 275 Mt, or an average of 18.3 Mt per year from 2015. Apart from the worst recession years, that has not happened in the past. In the absence of a prolonged recession, from where might emission reductions of that magnitude come? Let us examine the possibilities. Due to policies adopted in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Alberta, there has been a sharp reduction in coal-fired electricity generation. Consequently, emissions from coal declined from a peak of 106.4 Mt in 2000 to 61 Mt in 2015. If policies remain the same, as seems likely, and all remaining coal–fired generation is phased out by 2030, that would eliminate the remaining 61 Mt.  Such a change may be partially offset by an increase in natural gas-fired generation needed to provide the backup capacity for intermittent solar and wind energy power generation.  However, a net reduction in electricity emissions of 50 Mt is certainly possible by 2030. No doubt, environmental groups will make every effort to prevent any growth in oil and natural production and exports, and they will continue to urge that industry “leave it in the ground”. Eliminating absolutely all oil and natural gas production in Canada, if that were possible, would subtract 2015’s 189.5 Mt. Added to the 50 Mt net reduction from electricity generation would reduce emissions by 239.5 Mt, and take us 87% of the way to the 2030 target, leaving only 35.5 Mt to reduce in other sectors. This would not be well received in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador. In fact, of course, it is highly unlikely that federal or provincial governments would impose such draconian controls on production and pipeline movement. More likely, with increasing production resulting from past investments, it seems that oil and gas emissions will grow, not decline. That would mean that about 225 Mt (275-50) in reductions would have to be found in the others sectors. The other sectors include transportation, buildings, heavy industry, agriculture, and waste. They produced a collective 453.6 Mt in emissions in 2015. If one were to reduce emissions proportionately across all of them, it would mean cutting emissions in each sector almost in half. That would certainly spread the pain around, but the opportunities for reductions are not equally distributed. Alternatively, governments could focus their efforts almost entirely on reducing emissions from transportation. Many people think that transportation-related GHG emissions come almost entirely from passenger transportation in cars and light duty trucks. In fact, the total of these two categories in 2015 was 83 Mt, less than half of the transportation total. So one could eliminate every single car, SUV and pick up truck in Canada, and you would only cut Canada’s emissions by 11.5%. The fastest growing component of transportation emissions are freight trucks, which tripled from 1990 to 2015 and produced 63.2 Mt in 2015. The trends in freight transportation are closely tied to the overall level of economic activity and trade. Passenger and freight transportation by aviation, rail, bus, marine vessel or motorcycle added another 20.3 MT, and there were “other” sources (presumably off-road vehicles) that produced 6.4 Mt. Despite the dreams of some, it would not be remotely possible to electrify a substantial portion of the transportation system by 2030, and people will still insist on moving regardless of how high the carbon taxes and fees become. So the chances of completely eliminating the 173 Mt of emissions from transportation by 2030 are, in practical terms, nil. Even if one could, it would still leave Canada 52 Mt short of the target. Every other combination of ways to achieve a 225 Mt emissions reduction by 2030 presents enormous quandaries. How about shutting down all heavy industry (auto and parts plants, refineries, mines and smelters, petrochemical plants, cement, aluminum and steel plants, etc.)? If one did that, and eliminated all emissions from agriculture, that would reduce emissions by 147.4 Mt, leaving only 77.6 Mt to be eliminated from transportation. Of course, the employment, income and population effects would be severe. The reality is that there are no options that are technically and economically feasible, and likely to be politically acceptable to the Canadian public. This does not even take into account the likelihood that Canada’s economy and population will grow between now and 2030, thus stimulating higher emissions. If the 2030 target presents difficult, perhaps impossible choices, how can we really believe that, in 32 years, Canada will be able to reduce emissions to 122 megatonnes? The numbers just do not add up.    Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'GHG reduction targets']",2018/03/30
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/29/prospects-for-meeting-emission-reduction-goals-the-case-of-newfoundland-and-labrador/,,Prospects for Meeting Emission Reduction Goals: The Case of Newfoundland and Labrador," Contributed by Robert Lyman©2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years. Video interview “Environment over Economy?” with Robert Lyman follows this post.IntroductionMuch of the controversy in Canada concerning climate change issues takes place at a very general level. People discuss first whether one should believe those scientists and modelers who predict catastrophic global warming, and second what are the implications of this for the emissions reductions measures, if any, we should take in Canada. A lively debate still takes place on both questions. We might gain more insights by asking, “What if”. What if, for example, Canadians in each province tried actually to meet the official greenhouse gas emission reduction targets already set by governments? The purpose of this note is to explore the possible implications if the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador actually had to meet the targets that have been set for them by the federal and provincial governments over the next thirty-two years (i.e. to 2050) and beyond. A thorough analysis of this would require the use of sophisticated econometric models and an enormous amount of data, which I lack. The comments that follow should thus be considered as attempts to offer qualitative insights into the analysis that must be done and the choices that lie ahead.InterInteractive map of Newfoundland and Labrador available at this link: http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/getting-here-and-around/interactive-map  The TargetsThe Government of Canada formally has committed to the United Nations to reduce GHG emissions from current levels (722 megatonnes, or Mt, of carbon dioxide equivalent, in 2015) to 622 Mt in 2020 and 525 Mt in 2030. In 2008, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a political commitment that Canada would reduce its emissions by 50% or more from 2005 levels by 2050; that would mean a reduction to 369 Mt. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has made a political commitment to reduce provincial GHG emissions to 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As provincial emissions in 1990 were 9,750 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kt CO2e), this implies a 2020 target of 8,775 kt CO2e. Newfoundland and Labrador has also committed to reduce emissions by 75% to 85% below 2001 levels by 2050. That implies emissions levels in a range of 1,394 kt CO2e to 2,323 kt CO2e by mid-century. Neither the federal nor provincial commitments include any condition concerning future increases in population or economic activity. The goals are based upon the expectation, one can only assume, that somehow emissions reductions can be achieved at rates that will offset economic and population growth and, in addition, achieve very significant reductions in the emissions intensity of the economy. There is also no official connection between the goals articulated by the two different orders of government. Clearly, for example, Newfoundland and Labrador’s 2050 target far exceeds what would be required for the province if the emissions reduction measures contemplated to achieve the federal goal was to be applied proportionately across all provinces and territories. The Current SituationThe most recent data on GHG emissions in Newfoundland and Labrador are for 2013. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador emitted 8,640 kt CO2e in that year.Table 1 indicates the breakdown of those emissions.Table 1Newfoundland and Labrador GHG Emissions by Source in 2015SourceEmissions (kt)PercentageStationary Combustion383044.3Transport327037.8Fugitive Emissions5606.5Industrial Processes1571.8Agriculture1401.6Waste6807.9Total8,637100Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada National Inventory Report, 2015It may be useful to clarify what is included in each of the above categories of emissions. “Stationary combustion” refers to the emissions from large energy consuming plants, such as that from public electricity and heat production, petroleum refining, mining and oil and natural gas production, manufacturing, construction and large institutional uses. Transportation emissions are those from road transportation, railways, marine uses and aviation. Fugitive sources are emissions of gases or vapours from pressurized equipment due to leaks and other unintended or irregular releases of gases, mostly from industrial activities. Agriculture includes emissions mainly from manure management and fertilizers. Waste includes emissions from solid waste disposal on land, waste incineration and wastewater handling. The province’s pattern of emissions differs considerably from that of other provinces, mainly because stationary combustion holds such a large share, while industrial and agricultural emissions are relatively low. In most provinces other than Alberta and Saskatchewan, transportation typically accounts for 25% to 30% of emissions, so the share held in Newfoundland and Labrador is again fairly high. This has important implications for the cost of emissions reduction. Newfoundland and Labrador’s emissions declined from 1990 to 2000, but then rose by 2010 to just above the 1990 level, and have declined continuously since then. They are already below the 2020 target. The provincial government’s climate plans place heavy emphasis on two types of measures – continuing improvements in energy efficiency and the development of Muskrat Falls, the immense hydroelectric project in Labrador. It counts on the electricity produced by Muskrat Falls and delivered to the island to allow the displacement of an estimated 1.3 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually from the oil-fired generating station at Holyrood and probably more from closing smaller thermal generation plants. That would cut provincial emissions overall by about 10% of what they would otherwise have been by 2030.Muskrat Falls aerial from Nalcor Energy site: https://muskratfalls.nalcorenergy.com/project-overview/muskrat-falls-hydroelectric-generation-facility/The Potential Implications of the 2050 TargetsOn a per capita basis, Newfoundland and Labrador’s emissions will be about 17.1 tonnes of CO2e per capita, about the same as the other Atlantic provinces, but higher than Quebec at 8.9 tonnes per capita. Transforming the electricity generation in the province and making some additional improvements in energy efficiency may reduce emissions by a combined 15% to 20% to somewhere in the range of 6900 kt CO2e. The provincial government acknowledges that this will be “challenging”. Moving beyond that to the emissions levels required by the 2050 targets will be exceedingly difficult. Logically, most of the cuts will have to come from the largest sources of emissions, stationary sources and transportation. Let us explore what that would entail. Stationary Combustion Sources  As in other sectors, there are opportunities to improve energy efficiency and thereby reduce GHG emissions in Newfoundland and Labrador’s emissions-intensive plants. Energy efficiency, however, will not cut emissions to a fifth or sixth of their previous levels. Several of the existing economic activities and plants would have to be eliminated. Environment and Climate Change Canada publishes the names of the large facility GHG emitters in Canada. There are eight in Newfoundland and Labrador. The following table shows their emissions in 2016. NL Reporting Industrial Facility Emissions in 2016FacilityLocationGHG Emissions(kt CO2e)Holyrood Generating StationHolyrood1352NARL RefiningCome by Chance1266Iron Ore Co. of CanadaLabrador City962Holyrood Gas TurbineHolyrood115Voisey’s Bay MineVoisey’s Bay85Corner Brook Pulp And PaperCorner Brook51Long Harbour OperationsLong Harbour31Hardwoods Gas TurbineMount Pearl16 Closing all, or even half, of these plants to achieve the emissions reduction target would have dire employment and income effects. This would eliminate resource-based opportunities that simply could not be replaced, leading to the creation of near-ghost towns in Labrador City and Voisey’s Bay. Mining and oil and gas production accounted for 1,370 kt CO2e of the stationary combustion sources in 2013. Any significant expansion of offshore oil production would threaten the attainment of the emission reduction targets, so presumably the province would have to follow Alberta’s lead and place a cap on future oil development. Transportation Reducing emissions in transportation is far more complex than the general public believes. The complexity arises from the differences among the surface, marine and aviation modes of transport and from the many ways in which emissions can be affected, including efficiency improvements in existing vehicle technologies, development and market penetration of new technologies, changes in the behaviour of vehicle operators, inter-modal shifts and use of alternative fuels. The academic literature and the media are full of positive expectations about the emissions reduction potential of new technologies, but many of these technologies have not yet been developed, and may not be developed for decades. Most Canadian transport-related emissions come from surface vehicles. About half come from cars and light passenger trucks (SUVs), a quarter from commercial trucks, 10% from aircraft, 4 % from rail and the remainder from buses, motorcycles, and off-road vehicles, including those used for farming and construction. The recent and near-term trends in passenger vehicle emissions are almost entirely due to the effects of regulation. In October 2010, Environment Canada issued the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations, which prescribed progressively more stringent annual emissions standards for new vehicles in model years 2011 to 2016. In 2014, Environment Canada introduced even more stringent standards for the 2017 to 2025 model years. Under both phases of light-duty vehicle regulation, the fuel efficiency of new cars will increase by 41% and the fuel efficiency of new passenger light trucks will increase by 37%. In addition, new emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles (buses and trucks) are expected to reduce Canada’s emissions by about 2 Mt by 2020. These emission reductions will come at a high cost to vehicle manufacturers, a cost that will be passed on to consumers via the prices of the vehicles. The vehicle industry argues that, after more than 30 years of increasingly stringent regulations, it is reaching the limits of current technology. Certainly, the regulations are changing the types of vehicles available to consumers. Newfoundland and Labrador cannot do anything on its own that would change the fuel efficiency and emissions of North American vehicles beyond what is agreed jointly by the U.S. and Canadian governments. Increasing carbon taxes on gasoline will make driving more expensive for drivers, but experience in Europe has shown that even very high prices will not substantially reduce fuel use. In Norway, for example, gasoline prices were CDN $2.46 per liter in the first quarter of 2017, the highest in Europe, and yet gasoline demand there continues to rise. We would need a carbon tax of $600 per tonne to raise average Canadian prices to that level. The “bottom line” is that the combined effect of regulations and higher fuel taxes will increase fuel efficiency and reduce per vehicle emissions, but as has happened to date, the increasing number of cars on the roads will probably leave emissions stable or very slightly declining. It is extremely unlikely that regulation and taxes will force consumers to abandon their cars altogether, as would be required by an emissions reduction of 75 to 85%.  This is especially the case in the rural areas. What about electric vehicles? Electric vehicles are the beneficiaries of both large government subsidies and pervasive media hype. However, a 2010 report by J.D Power and Associates that offered a pessimistic view of EV market prospects has proved prophetic. The study concluded that the combined global sales of hybrids and all-electric plug-in vehicles might total 5.2 million units in 2020, just 7.3% of the 70.9 million passenger vehicles to be sold worldwide in that year. At the end of 2016, global sales just passed the 2-million-vehicle mark, well below the J.D. Power estimate for 2020. This is also far less than the numbers projected by the former Obama Administration in the U.S. and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. EVs constitute less than 1% of new vehicle sales in Canada. While sales grow every year, they are unlikely to become a significant portion of the total vehicle fleet for at least 20 years, and perhaps much longer.Insight:   EV performance in cold weather conditions. There are even more limited prospects for massive reductions in freight transportation through inter-modal shifts. Trucks are the fastest growing source of GHG emissions in transportation. Shifting 10% of freight from trucks to rail is considered a significant goal, as businesses prefer trucks for their flexibility; unlike rail, trucks can pick up and deliver freight to many destinations. If a 10% shift from large trucks could be achieved, this would only reduce emissions in all of Canada by 0.42 Mt in 2020. Environmentalists celebrated when a two-seater all-electric aircraft won a race in Europe, beating conventional piston-driven models, and a solar-powered plane flew around the world. The subsequent media coverage rarely mentioned that in both cases most of the aircraft’s weight was the battery, or that it took the solar plane a year to make the trip because of problems with its battery. There are a number of ways to improve the fuel economy of commercial aircraft and these are now being pursued by the international civil aviation industry. The idea that long-distance commercial jetliners could be powered by battery packs, however, lies more in the realm of Jules Verne than in serious aviation planning. The only way to drastically reduce GHG emissions from commercial passenger and freight aircraft is to restrict, indeed possibly ration, their use. This was actually proposed in an early version of the Canadian Green Party’s Platform posted online prior to the federal election of 2015, but it was wisely dropped in the final version. Severely limiting commercial flights in Newfoundland to meet the 2050 target, of course, would certainly reduce emissions in the hotel and restaurant industries. ConclusionNewfoundland and Labrador likely will meet its 2020 emissions reduction target. It is far less likely to be able to meet its 2050 goal. Reducing total emissions to the range of 1394 to 2323 kt CO2e would lower Newfoundland and Labrador’s per capita emissions to a level similar to that of African countries like Zambia or Sudan today. There seems no way to so completely transform the provincial economy in 32 years, or perhaps even in 60 years. It is difficult to imagine a transformation of this magnitude being achieved through the imposition of carbon taxes. The tax regime currently being implemented by the federal government would only raise carbon taxes to $50 per tonne (equivalent to 11.5 cents per liter of gasoline) by 2022. A tax sufficient to achieve the goal of a 75% to 85% emissions reduction would have to be much higher – high enough to ward off the possibility that Newfoundland and Labrador’s population and economic growth, and resulting emissions, might increase well above current levels. Achieving the emissions target thus would require a level of government involvement in and direct control of the economy far higher than the province has ever experienced. Whether Newfoundlanders would vote for such policies remains to be seen.Labrador City –Newfoundland and Labrador Film Development Corporation (NLFDC)– http://www.nlfdc.ca/Celebrate Canada – things to see and do in Newfoundland and Labrador.https://www.flightcentre.ca/blog/canada-150-celebrate-newfoundland-labrador/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'electric vehicles', 'Newfoundland and Labrador']",2018/03/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/25/interglacial-or-not-interglacial-that-is-the-question/,Warren Blair ,"Interglacial, or not interglacial? That is the question."," 2.6 million years ago our planet decided that after about 300 million years of warm temperatures it was time to cool things down.  The following chart shows historic temperatures normalized to the average from 1960 to 1990.  When mother Earth decides to cool things down she doesn’t kid around.  The thermostat from 300 to 3 million years ago was set at a significant 2 to 14°C (4-25°F) warmer than today.adapted from  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EemianThus started a period of time geoscientists refer to as the Pleistocene.  The Pleistocene encompasses the most recent long term Earthly temperature reduction colloquially called the “Ice Age”.  An ice age by definition consists of many periods of cold climate called “glacial periods” which are broken up by short lived warm spells we call “interglacials”.  The last interglacial is the Eemian shown above.The beginning of the end for the Pleistocene is defined as the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) all the way to the end of the Younger Dryas (YD).  The LGM is the last glacial period with mile thick ice sheets covering most of North America as well as large tracts of Europe and Asia.  It was a 15,000 year long stretch of serious climate upheaval causing global cold snaps, droughts, desertification and frequent dramatic dust laden storms.  The coldest 5,000 year period reached temperatures 5°C (10°F) colder than today and sea levels were up to a 100 metres (328 feet) lower than present day.  Then, 16,000 years ago, temperatures started to dramatically warm.  The warming trend was temporarily interrupted for a 1,000 year break, during the Younger Dryas event which returned the climate to glacial conditions but then the warming returned until about 11,650 years ago when the rapid warming slowed.  The end of this rapid exit from the latest cold period is the marker used to name a new geological epoch called the Holocene.  Since many refer to the Pleistocene as the ice age, the Holocene is inferred to be post ice age.The temperature chart at the top provides a good presentation of historic temperatures.  However, due to the varying time scales, one may be deceived in perceiving that we have been in a steady temperature plateau that is much longer than any past warm period.adapted from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interglacialThis chart, which covers the last 450 thousand years, has a constant time scale which provides a correct comparison of the temperature record.  The recent Holocene warming is clearly an event which is very similar to past interglacial periods.  The red values describe the length of the past four interglacials and show how short lived these warming cycles essentially are.  We can also examine the relative temperature of each interglacial pulse and see that we are experiencing similar and possibly slightly cooler temperatures than past interglacials.  The reality is that the Holocene is not post ice age but is likely just another interglacial warming pulse.  Going forward it is more reasonable to expect climate to change as much as it has during the great Pleistocene Ice Age. adapted from www.clim-past-discuss.net/cp-2017-39/cp-2017-39.pdf & en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoloceneDuring the Holocene we see that temperatures 8,000 years ago were warmer than present and the variabilities we are experiencing are in line with the past 12,000 years.  There are two significant temperature events that mark the most recent 2,000 years.  The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) from 950 to 1250 AD and the ~550 year Little Ice Age (LIA) from 1300 to 1850 AD are clearly seen.  The MWP with temperatures similar to present day is the reason the Vikings named Greenland as they did and easily colonised much of the North Atlantic including Newfoundland.  The LIA is misnamed; with temperatures approximately 0.6°C (1°F) colder than now it should have been called the Long Cold Snap as it did not drop the ~5° C (9°F) of a true ice age.  No matter how it is named, the prolonged cold caused droughts through much of the Northern Hemisphere with crop failures, famine, social unrest, wars, mass migrations and major disease outbreaks; not a happy time.from timescavengers.blog/introductory-material/geologic-time/In 1976, Hays published the landmark observation that climate records contained the same cycles as are found in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.  Specifically, they found a dominant ~100,000 year cycle similar to Earth’s orbital eccentricity, a 42,000 year cycle similar to the Earth’s obliquity and a 23,000 year cycle similar to the precession index.  Eccentricity describes the shape of the orbit, obliquity is the tilt of the axis of rotation with respect to the orbital plane and precession refers to the rotational change over time of both the Earth’s rotational axis and orbital path.  They concluded that changes in the orbital geometry are the fundamental cause of ice ages.In 2010, Akasofu discusses the temperature recovery from the end of the LIA in 1850 AD.  He states that “temperature changes during the 20th century can be approximated by a linear change at the rate of about 0.5°C/100 years”.  Furthermore, he says that solar activity was relatively low during the LIA, but began to recover from about 1800-1850 AD.adapted from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Sunspot_Numbers.png The solar activity Akasofu refers to is the energy ultimately felt here on Earth which is best represented by this Sunspot chart.  We see that during 1300 to 1850 AD the Sun experienced two low stands in activity, the Maunder and Dalton Minimums.  Solar cycle 24 will soon come to an end in early 2019, but we already have enough data to see that it represents the lowest solar activity we have experienced since the early 1900s.Several scientists have been predicting for some time that our Sun is cooling.  Since 2003 and most recently in 2016 the notable astrophysicist Dr. Abdussamatov, Head of Space Research Laboratory at the Pulkovo Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has found that the total solar irradiance absorbed by the Earth since 1990 has decreased creating a negative average annual energy balance which will cause long-term adverse thermal condition.  He concludes that “the quasi-centennial epoch of the new Little Ice Age has started at the end of 2015 after the maximum phase of solar cycle 24”.from file.scirp.org/Html/2-8302656_61284.htmFurthermore, in 2015 Mörner presented his modelled cooling forecast and predicts that by about 2030 the Sun will experience a new grand solar minimum.  He further says that predictions have extended low activity up to 2160.  In 2015, the science of solar activity prediction took a huge step forward.  Prof. Zharkova’s team from Northumbria University, U.K., have discovered a new modelling approach to capture the dynamo effects found in two layers of the Sun.  Their new technique, when compared to real solar cycle data, found predictions with an accuracy of 97%.  Furthermore, their models also confirm that solar activity will fall by 60% during the 2030s to conditions last seen in the Maunder Minimum.There is much written by the warming camp that disputes the effect of solar radiance with global temperature fluctuations.  The climate establishment bases these interpretations on an unshakeable faith in their climatic model outputs which tend to discount solar influences.The IPCC in 2014 forecasted as much as 4.8°C (8.6°F) of warming up to 2100.  They also report: “it is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas as global mean surface temperature increases.  It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a higher frequency and longer duration” and they don’t stop there, as they claim that climate warming will continue well beyond 2100.However, the winter of 2018 has been one of the harshest cold snowy winters to hit the Northern Hemisphere for several years.  Is this the beginning of a 100+ year cold snap?  The next decade will be telling.The scientific method requires that we compare all theories with measured data.  The theory of human caused climate change is failing this requirement.In science often people refer to Occam’s Razor which simply states that the simplest solution is almost always the best.  In my experience as a geophysicist, I have found that although we look for the simplest solution, more often than not, we discover that the science of the earth is much more complex than we were expecting.  In Mörner’s paper he presents the following chart to explain the “Planetary beat processes and the spectrum of terrestrial variables affected”.  I think it beautifully captures the complexity of our big blue spaceship as we hurtle through the expanse of space.Climate is changing; let’s stop arguing that anything said here is denying that.  We do need to realize that vilifying CO2 and carbon based energy just to push an agenda of extreme temperature rise without also considering the possible impacts of a cooling world is bad science and poor public policy.  We must evaluate what strategies might best be used in adapting to an under heated planet because cold kills 20 times more people than heat.In conclusion, if the Holocene is just another interglacial period what are we doing to get ready for the disruption caused by an extended cold snap on the breadbaskets of our planet?…that clearly is the question!Andrew Bonvicini, P.Geoph.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Uncategorized']",2018/03/25
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/22/examining-the-claim-that-renewable-energy-will-soon-replace-fossil-fuels/,,Examining the Claim That Renewable Energy Will Soon Replace Fossil Fuels," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and prior to that, a diplomat for 10 years.At virtually every public discussion of the issues surrounding global warming, there will inevitably be someone who will state, with absolute conviction, that the “solution” is already at hand because the global demand for fossil fuels is quickly declining, the costs of renewable energy are falling dramatically, and investment in renewables is increasing. Let us briefly examine each of these contentions using the facts and authoritative assessments available to us. Where Are We Now?Context is always important, but never more so than when one is asked to believe future projections. In this case, we must be aware of how the global pattern of energy demand has changed in the past, and especially in the recent past. The most reliable authority on this is British Petroleum, which for many years has published annual “statistical reviews of world energy”. The latest review, published in 2017, includes data and graphics that present the trends in global supply and demand for each of the major energy sources, as well as summaries of how the relative shares of each energy source, in terms of primary energy consumption, has changed over time. The following graph illustrates how the shares of primary energy consumption met by different energy sources have changed over the period from 1966 to 2016.There are several notable points about this background.  First, the share of oil has declined steadily since the OAPEC oil embargo of 1973-74; nonetheless, oil continues to be the largest source of energy in the world, at about 34% of the total. The share held by coal has wavered up and down around 30% over the period but has remained in second place, and is now about 28%. Natural gas’s share has steadily increased, despite the fact that until recently there was only limited transportation of gas in liquid form by tanker. Gas now holds about 25% of demand. Hydroelectricity has held its share in the range of 6% to 8%. Nuclear energy rose from next to nothing to about 7% but recently has declined to about 5%. Renewables, as represented mainly by wind and solar energy, has risen from next to nothing before 2000 to about 3% in 2016. In short, after half a century evolution of global energy markets, fossil fuels continue to provide 88% of global energy needs, while renewables play a rising but still very small part. The following graph shows what that means in terms of the total level of energy consumption over time.The graph shows how world energy consumption, as measured in terms of primary energy, rose from about 9,000 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in 1991 to 13,300 MTOE in 2016, an increase of 47% over 25 years. The small dark orange part of the trend lines is renewable energy’s share. What Will Happen In Future?The reality is that no one knows what will happen to energy supply and demand in future. We can say with quite a lot of confidence that people’s demands for energy services will lead developments, as various energy suppliers are motivated to respond to those needs. Supply and demand will also be affected by the prices of competing energy sources, and these in turn will be affected by resource availability, technological developments and other supply factors. The key demand factors are probably the trends in global population and in economic development in different regions. There is a fairly small number of organizations in the world that have the information at hand and the capability to use advanced econometric modeling techniques to formulate projections of future energy supply, demand and emissions. The four most authoritative are the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), ExxonMobil and British Petroleum BP). I will use BP’s projections for two reasons. First, of all the major forecasters, BP is the most willing to share the results of its analysis and data for free and in a form that allows clear comparisons of past and present trends. Second, BP’s projections to 2035 are the most “favourable” to renewables. The following graphs show the future trends in comparison to the previously described past trends. In summary: Total energy demand will continue to rise significantly throughout the period to 2035.Oil, coal and natural gas will continue to dominate the energy mixThe share held by renewables will grow but by 2035 will still only reach 10% of global energy demand; this will be almost entirely in the electricity generation sector. To repeat, this is the most favourable outlook for renewables in any of the authoritative energy forecasting organizations. All the others show renewables holding a smaller share of global demand in 2035. No authority projects renewables to constitute even 20% of global energy demand, let alone 100%, in the period to 2050. The Costs of Renewable EnergyAdvocates of wind and solar energy constantly refer to how low the prices of these energy sources will be in future, while ignoring the costs that have been imposed on electricity ratepayers and on taxpayers up to now. Those historic costs, however, are enormous. They were essentially caused by the actions of several European and North American governments, in the name of addressing global warming, to accelerate the purchase and penetration in the electrical energy systems of renewable energy technologies that were not yet mature and far from competitive with existing generation sources. Typically, governments (in Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Canada to name a few) offered wind and solar suppliers several advantages over conventional electricity supply; these included: Feed-in-tariffs far above market rates in contracts that were guaranteed for 15 to 20 years;Priority access (“first-to-the-grid”) rights that required the electricity system operators to use the production from wind and solar generation when it was available, and to back out, or “curtail”, alternative sources of supply;Requiring the construction of other transmission and distribution systems expansions and upgrades (e.g. “smart meters” and other “smart” systems) to accommodate the additional renewable generation capacity;Requiring other suppliers and ratepayers to pay for the cost of additional balancing and flexibility (e.g. backup generation) to deal with situations when demand was high but the sun was not shining or the wind blowing;Similarly, requiring ratepayers to pay the costs of dumping surplus power supplies on export markets when the renewables plants produced electricity but the demand was low; andGranting renewable energy generators various tax benefits, principally in the form of accelerated capital cost depreciation and low realty taxes. The countries of the European Union have made the largest expenditures on renewable energy generation. The main source of data on generation costs there is the European Observer, an organization that actively promotes increased use of renewable energy. According to data from this source, to the end of 2014 European Union countries spent about 1.1 trillion EUR (CDN $1.68 trillion) on large-scale renewable energy installations. This provided a nominal nameplate generating capacity of about 216 gigawatts (GW), or nominally about 22% of the total European generation needs of about 1000 GW. The actual measured output by 2014 supplied by the renewables industry was 38 gigawatts, or 3.8% of Europe’s electricity requirements, at a capacity factor of about 18% overall. Accounting for capacity factors, the capital cost of these renewable energy plants has been about 29 billion EUR (CDN $44.4 billion) per gigawatt. The following table from the European Observer indicates the capital costs per GW of wind and solar energy technologies actually built through 2014.Thus, the capital costs per unit of generation have ranged from 16 billion EUR (CDN $24.4 billion) per gigawatt for onshore wind to 63 billion EUR (CDN $96.1 billion) per gigawatt for solar PV on the grid, or an average of 30 billion EUR (CDN $45.8 billion) per gigawatt for the three main sources of renewable energy. The capacity factors actually achieved are important in determining these costs. No wonder renewables advocates do not refer to these costs. Instead, they refer to the rates that have resulted from countries finally terminating the FIT contracting system and requiring renewables producers to sell their services through competitive bidding. The result has been a sharp reduction in the bids received. The future costs of renewable energy depend not only on the current bids but also on the projected costs over the life of the systems. In the United States, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports on the comparative costs of different generation sources on a “levelized” basis. The levelized cost is essentially the expected real total cost (capital plus operating costs), in terms of dollars per megawatt/hour of different new generation technologies over the lives of the plants. The EIA updates these figures every few years. In the EIA’s 2017 updated version of the levelized cost of new generation sources, it estimates the U.S. national average costs for generation entering service in 2022. The EIA report can be read here: https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf The following table shows the 2017 estimates.  U.S. Average LCOE (2016$/MWh) for Plants Entering Service in 2022Plant TypeCapital CostO+MTransmissionTotalDispatchableGas Combined Cycle      13.942.2          1.257.3Gas Advanced CC15.839.41.256.5Advanced Nuclear73.624.31.199.1Non-dispatchableWind – Onshore47.213.7         2.863.7Wind – Offshore133.019.64.8157.4Solar PV70.210.54.485.0Solar Thermal191.944.06.1242.0Hydroelectric56.28.21.866.2Note that, partly because of lower natural gas prices, the natural gas-fired plants are projected to have the lowest LCOE, followed by onshore wind. The surprising change from the 2016 figures is the projected reduction in the LCOE of solar PV to U.S. $85 per MWh. These figures are the bases for the claims by renewables advocates that wind and solar energy are now at or approaching “grid parity” with conventional generation sources. The Systemic, or Grid-Wide, Costs of Intermittent Energy The LCOE approach measures mainly the projected direct costs of the generation plant technologies that will be built in the near future. It does not address the broader, or indirect, costs that the addition of renewable energy imposes on the electricity system. A number of analysts have examined further the differences between the costs of intermittent and dispatchable electricity generating technologies. A seminal paper was written by Paul Joskow of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and MIT in 2011. The paper can be found here. https://economics.mit.edu/files/6317 In his abstract, Professor Joskow wrote, “the standard life-cycle cost metric utilized is the ‘levelized cost’ per MWh supplied. This paper demonstrates that this metric is inappropriate for comparing intermittent generating technologies like wind and solar with dispatchable generating technologies like nuclear, gas combined cycle, and coal. Levelized cost comparisons are a misleading metric for comparing intermittent and dispatchable generating technologies because they fail to take into account differences in the production profiles of intermittent and dispatchable generating technologies and the associated large variations in the market value of the electricity they supply. Levelized cost comparisons overvalue intermittent technologies compared to dispatchable base load generating technologies. Integrating differences in production profiles, the associated variations in the market value of the electricity at the times it is supplied, and the expected life cycle costs associated with different generating technologies is necessary to provide meaningful economic comparisons between them.” To be more specific, the Joskow paper makes these points: The LCOE approach is flawed because it treats all megawatt hours supplied as a homogeneous product governed by the law of one price, and thus does not account for the fact that the value (wholesale market price) of electricity supplied varies widely over the course of a typical year.Different intermittent generating technologies (e.g. wind versus solar) also can have very different hourly production and market value profiles, and indeed, specific intermittent generating units using the same technology (e.g. wind) may have very different production profiles depending on where they are located.Electricity that can be supplied by a wind generator at a levelized cost of 6 cents per kilowatt hour (KWh) is not “cheap” if the output is available primarily at night when the market value of electricity is only 2.5 cents per KWh. Similarly, a combustion turbine with a low expected capacity factor and a levelized cost of 25 cents per KWh is not necessarily “expensive” if it can be called upon reliably to supply electricity during all hours when the market price is higher than 25 cents per KWh.In effect, the electricity supplied by conventional plants and by renewable energy plants is not the same product. LCOE analysis ignores the costs of backing up intermittent renewables and of the networks required to integrate them. Usually in North America, a large number of natural gas plants are required to stand ready, operating at very low capacity factors, to be available when demand is high and renewables generation is not available. Silvia Pariente-David, writing in the IAEE Forum in 2016, summarized the grid integration costs. “The system operator and the ratepayers pay twice for generation capacity. Integrating wind and solar variable energy into power systems causes costs elsewhere in the system. Examples include distribution and transmission networks, short-term balancing services, provision of firm reserve capacity, a different temporal structure of net electricity demand and more cycling and ramping of conventional plants. Typically, these “integration costs” are of three types: grid costs, balancing costs and the “adequacy costs”, or “utilization effect on conventional power plants”. She went on to describe a less well known but important consideration, the “merit order” effect of renewable energy (RE). “RE penetration affects the revenues and margins of conventional power plants by lowering wholesale electricity prices and peak prices and by reducing the volume of electricity produced by thermal plants. Wholesale prices fluctuate between zero when renewables are at the margin (or even negative when low demand coincides with a very high level of wind for instance) and the variable cost of fossil fuel-fired plants when the latter are at the margin. In a merit order based on marginal cost, RE plants will be dispatched first, as they have a zero marginal cost. As the RE capacity increases, conventional fossil fuel power plants move to the right of the merit order curve and their utilization is substantially reduced. In Spain, effective operations of CCGT fell from over 4000 hours in 2008 to 1000 hours in 2014. Not only do they not cover their fixed investment costs, but they also risk being decommissioned if they run too few hours to cover their fixed O&M. However, these plants are needed to provide the system flexibility to integrate a high level of RE. An issue for electricity systems is how to provide adequate compensation for this flexibility. Capacity mechanisms have been introduced in some European countries to remunerate that flexibility and avoid conventional power plant closure. However, capacity payments tend to create an oversupply of power generating capacity, further depressing prices. This affects negatively both the value of RE and conventional plants.” The article can be found here: http://www.iaee.org/en/publications/fullnewsletter.aspx?id=39 In other words, as the prices of renewable energy decrease and its role increases, it imposes ever-higher costs on the rest of the generation and transmission system. Advocates for renewable energy ignore these costs. Questions About Future Investment in Wind and Solar Due to the significant costs of wind and solar generation to date, governments are increasingly facing opposition from the affected industries and residential consumers to reduce power rates. Some governments have initiated reviews of the design of the regulatory regime and the use of policy and fiscal instruments to attain certain predetermined levels of emissions reduction. The October 2017 Cost of Energy Review, led by Professor Dieter Helm in the United Kingdom, for example, pointed the way to a more economical approach to reducing GHG emissions. The report made two central recommendations. The first was that the UK government should eliminate the vast array of subsidies, regulations, and programs by which it is now seeking to alter energy supply and demand patterns and instead replace them with one single, universally applied carbon price that would rise in accordance with the emissions reduction target.Second, it recommended that, once the carbon price was in place, renewables suppliers should be required to bid on an “equivalent firm power basis”; in other words, they must be required to contract with a generator or a storage company able to provide electricity when there is no sun or wind. This would go a long way to removing the current system in which each additional producer of renewable energy shifts more of the system-wide costs of providing balancing and flexibility on to other energy suppliers or ratepayers. In addition to the ending of FIT rates and requiring that all procurement be done on the basis of competitive bidding, it would substantially reduce the pace of new renewables development. The Helm Report can be seen here: http://www.biee.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/Cost_of_Energy_Review.pdf Indeed, that process has already begun to some extent. After rising at the average annual rate of almost 20% per year from 2000 to 2011, global investment in renewable energy generation essentially flat-lined and has barely increased since then. This followed sharp reductions in the use of FIT contracting practices. The Energy Institute at Haas recently reported that 48 countries have replaced feed-in-tariffs with competitive auction systems, and another 27 are seriously considering do so. This has probably been the key factor in driving down the prices negotiated in new contracts. The European Union is now studying a proposal by the Council of European Energy Regulators to remove grid priority for renewable energy and reduce the compensation when renewable energy is curtailed. These two changes, if approved, would severely cut back investment in renewable energy in Europe. The next bar chart plots investments in renewable generation over the period since 2000. Between 2001 and 2011 investment grew at almost 20% a year, but after 2011 it flattened outSource: Carbon Brief/International Energy Agency data Euan Mearns, writing on the blog Energy Matters, analyzed the reasons for this stabilization in spending. “It’s been claimed that investment flattened out after 2011 because decreasing prices for wind turbines and solar panels allowed developers to build more for less money, but this explanation does not hold water because prices had been decreasing steadily for years without having any effect on investment growth. The true explanation is that 2011 was the year in which cash-strapped governments began to water down renewables targets and cut back on subsidies. “Investment in renewable energy fell in 2012 as governments cut subsidies” as the Guardian put it in 2013. A year later in 2014 Bloomberg New Energy Finance had much the same to say about the 2013 results:Looking at the reasons for the decline in overall investment in 2013, worries about future policy support for renewables delayed investment decisions in countries such as the US, Germany, India, the UK, France, Sweden, Romania and Poland. In some other countries, such as Spain and Bulgaria, retroactive subsidy cuts for existing projects almost killed off investment entirely, while in Italy, the amount of PV capacity eligible for support quickly ran up against a government-set cap.In short, the rapid growth in renewables investment between 2001 and 2011 came to a halt as soon as the subsidy bubble began to burst.”Mearns also pointed out that the reduction in the prices bid for renewable energy supplied is not entirely beneficial to the renewables industry.“These cost reductions, however, are a double-edged sword. As governments save money the wind and solar industries make less. This makes wind and solar projects less attractive to investors, which in turn makes it less likely that governments will fill their auction quotas and meet their renewables targets. There are also questions as to whether some of the bidders will make any money at all at the prices they bid, even though they will get paid for all of their intermittent output without having to pay anything for the backup generation and storage services necessary to match it to demand – a chicken which at some point is going to come home to roost.”Mearns’ article can be read here:http://euanmearns.com/worldwide-investment-in-renewable-energy-reaches-us-4-trillion-with-little-to-show-for-it/The journal Renewables Now published an analysis of the region-by-region breakdown in global renewables investment. According to it, European renewables investment has been in decline since the second quarter of 2011 and shows no sign of a recovery. Investment in the USA has remained essentially flat. Investment in China grew before the second quarter of 2015 but has fallen off. Investment in the rest of the world has also failed to increase. The post-2011 flattening, in short, is a worldwide phenomenon.ConclusionNo authoritative source of energy supply and demand projections sees renewable energy rising above 10% of global energy consumption by 2035. In fact, they all foresee fossil fuels continuing to supply by far the majority of the world’s energy needs.The extremely large costs incurred by the countries that have given preferential contracts and system access to wind and solar energy from 2000 to 2015 have raised electricity prices sharply in those countries and provoked strong opposition to the continuation of such policies. The movement away from feed-in-tariffs towards procurement by competitive bidding has led to much lower prices, but also flattened the growth in investments. If, as some European countries are now considering, intermittent energy supplies are required to bear a larger share of the system costs previously imposed on other generators and electricity ratepayers, the incentive to invest in wind and solar may decline further.There is no evidence that wind and solar energy will soon fully replace fossil fuels even in the power generation industry, let alone in the entire economy. It is important that the public be better informed about this, so that the wrong policy choices will not be made.  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'energy', 'renewables', 'Uncategorized']",2018/03/22

Eight of the worst floods in Calgary’s history were before 1933, two of them with higher flows than that of 2013.Weather Network says Calgary flooding could happen again.Of course, most climate change scientists know that no one will experience climate change in their lifetimes to any extent because climate is measured in 30, 50, 100 and millennial timescales.   Dr. John D. Harper, FGSA,FGAC, PGeol., former director of the Geological Survey of Canada,  explains that people don’t live long enough to experience climate change, and that our active planet drives climate change; humans cannot control that.Hayhoe and Marshall’s presentation was the platform for a new program they announced that night called “Alberta Narratives.” The project appears to be part of the portfolio of Upaya Consulting.“A key focus of this community-based initiative is openness and the inclusion of a diversity of Albertans. We are seeking the involvement of a spectrum of organizations and individuals from business, energy, civil society, Indigenous communities, education, faith, youth, government, agriculture and people whose lives are invested in fossil fuels. …Communications specialist George Marshall and the organization he co-founded, Climate Outreach, will lead this work.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/18/the-global-panorama-of-carbon-prices-in-2017/,,The Global Panorama of Carbon Prices in 2017," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.The Institute for Climate Economics (I4CE) is a think tank based in Paris that is funded by the French Caisse de Depots, the French Development Agency and Morocco’s Caisse de Depots et Gestion.  In October 2017, it published an article summarizing the results of its study of the use of carbon prices in the world. The article, entitled Global panorama of carbon prices in 2017, can be found here: https://www.i4ce.org/wp-core/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Global-Panorama-Carbon-prices-2017_FINAL_5p-2.pdf What Are Carbon Prices? Carbon prices are the extra charges imposed on users of fossil fuels as disincentives to use these fuels, in theory to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigate the effects of (allegedly) human induced global warming.  Carbon pricing results usually from either the imposition by governments of carbon taxes with specified rates per tonne of carbon dioxide or from the implementation of regulatory caps on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the establishment of markets through which the value of permits to emit can be determined through commercial trading. The latter are referred to as Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS). What did the article cover? The  I4CE article provided a world survey indicating which countries and sub-national jurisdictions had implemented carbon pricing regimes, the type of regimes chosen, the sectors covered, the pricing levels, the revenues collected and the use of the revenues. The results are quite informative for those who study and debate the use of carbon pricing in Canada. Here are some of the highlights of the article: As of September 1 2017, more than 40 countries and 25 provinces or cities had adopted carbon pricing policies. These jurisdictions account for around 25% of global GHG emissions. A world map showing which countries and regions have implemented carbon pricing makes it clear that the vast majority of the current regimes are in Europe and North America. While China has implemented various regimes in its provinces, the carbon values there are very low (typically Cdn $3.50 to $8.00 per tonne) and are primarily intended to improve local air quality by reducing coal consumption. The revenues received by governments from carbon pricing totaled about U.S. $26 billion (Cdn $33.3 billion) in 2015 and declined to U.S. $22 billion (Cdn $28 billion) in 2016. The decline was due to the reduction in prices in jurisdictions using ETS schemes in Europe, California and Quebec. In 2016, two thirds of carbon pricing revenues come from carbon taxes. The range in carbon prices is very wide, with the lowest noted being less than one euro per tonne in Poland and two euros (Cdn $3.20) per tonne in some Chinese provinces and the highest being 96 euros (Cdn $154) per tonne in Sweden. More than 75% of emissions regulated are covered by a carbon price below 10 euros (Cdn $16) per tonne. The article lamented the fact that the carbon prices in 2017 were “not aligned with the costs of necessary climate action in order to stay on the 2 degree C. trajectory” blessed by the United Nations at the COP21 conference in December 2015. It referred to the recommendations of a commission led by Stern and Stiglitz that carbon prices be raised to U.S. $40 (Cdn $63) and U.S. $80 (Cdn $102) per tonne by 2020, and between U.S. $50 (Cdn $64) and U.S. $100 (Cdn $128) per tonne by 2030. The Uses of Carbon Revenues One of the central controversies in Canada concerning the use of carbon pricing concerns how the governments receiving the revenues will use them.  If the purpose is primarily or entirely to use market-based incentives as a more economically efficient way to stimulate reduced GHG emissions, theory suggests that revenues should all be recycled back into the economy through some reduction in the rates of other generally applied taxes like income taxes or sales taxes. Environmentalists (and the industries that benefit) may argue that some portion of the revenues should go directly to subsidizing emission reduction measures. Carbon tax opponents, in contrast, cite the risk that governments will, in fact, simply add the revenues from carbon prices to the general budget and use them to fund various political initiatives that have little or nothing to do with environmental objectives. The I4CE article contains some interesting information using data for fiscal year 2013-2014. More than 60% of the revenues received by governments from carbon pricing went to members of the European Union.On the global scale, only 29% of revenues were recycled into the economy in the form of tax exemptions.34% of the revenues were used to subsidize projects that would reduce GHG emissions.37%, the largest share, were allocated to the general budget.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change']",2018/03/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/08/the-world-loves-oil/,,The World Loves Oil," Just before Christmas, 2017, I posted an article on the Friends of Science blog entitled, “Global Oil Demand – Up, UP and Away!” In it, I contrasted the claims of environmental activists in Canada that the world is “getting off oil” with the reality of rapidly increasing world oil demand, as documented in the statistics and projections of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Less than three months later, the trends I saw documented then are even more pronounced. World oil consumption grew from 85 million barrels per day in 2008 to 97 million barrels per day in 2016; over that period the growth in consumption averaged about 1.2 million barrels per day. This extraordinary increase occurred during a period when many of the world’s governments were claiming that climate policies would reduce demand. In the last few years, the increases in demand have been accelerating. The IEA estimated in its late 2017 Oil Market Report that demand would grow by 1.5 million barrels by day in 2017. 2018 would add another 1.3 million barrels per day to take total world consumption to almost 102 million barrels per day, by far the highest total in world history. As recently as last year, British Petroleum, one of the foremost forecasters of global energy supply and demand, projected that oil demand would not reach 110 million barrels per day until 2035. On March 5, 2018 the IEA released its most recent Medium Term Oil Market Report projecting oil supply and demand to 2023. Based on strong economic growth estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 3.9% per year in the next few years, the IEA projects oil demand to continue growing at the average rate of 1.2 million barrels per day. By 2023, oil demand would reach 104.7 million barrels per day, up 6.9 million barrels per day from 2017. The IEA acknowledged, “there is no peak oil demand in sight”. As has been the case for some years, China and India together will contribute almost 50% of the increase in demand. Interestingly, however, the fastest growing source of demand growth is projected to be petrochemicals, especially in the United States and China. “Global economic growth is lifting more people into the middle class in developing countries and higher incomes mean sharply rising demand for consumer goods and services. A large group of chemicals derived from oil and natural gas are crucial to the manufacture of many products that satisfy this rising demand.”  In other words, a rising income and standard of living is causing the people in the developing countries to seek the same kinds of energy goods and services that are enjoyed by people in the more industrialized countries. The IEA report was received coolly by some in the investment community for a perhaps surprising reason. The IEA has developed a longstanding reputation for consistently under-estimating the trends in oil demand. For example, the IEA’s 2013 projection of 2018 oil demand was 96.68 million barrels per day, 2.42 million barrels per day below what is now expected. If the IEA adheres to its past track record, global oil demand could be significantly higher than its new projections. As Yogi Berra once quipped, “Forecasting is difficult. Especially about the future”. While the IEA projects global oil supply to continue growing to meet demand based largely on new oil shale production in the U.S., the low levels of oil industry capital investment over the past four years may have adverse effects on production capacity in the 2021 to 2023 period. A tighter match between supply and demand, resulting in higher crude prices, could dampen demand even as they provide the revenues for a later surge in production. For the time being, however, it is clear that the world loves oil, even if the environmental activists don’t. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'oil']",2018/03/08
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/03/08/lessons-from-the-u-k-cost-of-energy-review/,,Lessons From The U.K Cost Of Energy Review," Contributed by Robert Lyman  © 2017The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to set a long-term, legally binding target for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The Climate Change Act CCA) commits the U.K. to reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050, and sets a framework for the setting of rolling five-year carbon “budgets”. Parliament approved the Fifth Carbon Budget in 2017, for the period 2028-32 at a 57% reduction on 1990 levels. According to the U.K Committee on Climate Change (CCC), U.K. emissions were 42% below 1990 levels in 2016. The first carbon budget (2008-2012) has been met and the country is on track to meet the goals of the second (2013 to 2017), and the third (2018 to 2022). It is not on track to meet the goals of the fourth, from 2023 to 2027. Most of the reductions have occurred in the industry and power sectors. The U.K. government has come increasingly under pressure from both industry and consumers because of the high costs of the emissions reduction efforts. Accordingly, it commissioned a review led by Professor Dieter Helm of Oxford University with a mandate to review and report on how to meet four competing objectives: To continue making emissions reduction in line with the carbon budgets;To ensure security of electricity supply;To attain the lowest electricity costs in Europe for households and businesses; andTo do this at minimum cost and without imposing further costs on the exchequer (i.e. on taxpayers). The Helm Report was finalized and published in October, 2017, and can be seen here: http://www.biee.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/Cost_of_Energy_Review.pdf Dieter Helm is an economist specializing in utilities, infrastructure, regulation and the environment. He has a reputation as a skeptic about renewable energy, but his recent book, The Endgame for Fossil Fuels, makes it clear that he is even more skeptical concerning the benefits of oil, natural gas and coal. From reading the report, one can conclude that he also is extremely optimistic concerning the pace at which new energy technologies will be proven in research, quickly commercialized and disseminated at much lower costs than current energy technologies. Main Findings and Recommendations Professor Helm’s main findings and conclusions and recommendations are these: “The cost of energy is too high, and higher than necessary to meet the Climate Change Act (CCA) target and the carbon budgets… Prices should be falling, and they should go on falling into the medium and longer terms. The scale of the multiple (government) interventions in the electricity market is now so great that few if any could even list them all, and their interactions are poorly understood. Complexity is itself a major cause of rising costs, and tinkering with policies and regulations is unlikely to reduce costs. Indeed, each successive intervention layers on new costs and unintended consequences. It should be the central aim of government to radically simplify the interventions and to get government back out of many of its current detailed roles. The legacy costs from the Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), the feed-in-tariffs and low carbon contracts for difference (CfDs) are a major contributor to rising final prices, and should be separated out, ring-fenced, and placed in a “legacy bank”. They should be charged separately and explicitly on customer bills. Industrial customers should be exempt.  The most efficient way to meet the CCA target and the carbon budget is to set a universal carbon price on a common basis across the whole economy, harmonizing the multiple carbon taxes and prices currently in place. This price should vary so as to meet the carbon targets. It would be significantly lower than the cost of the current multiple interventions. There should be a border carbon price (i.e. an import tariff equal in effect to the domestic carbon price) to address the consequences of the UK adopting a unilateral carbon production target. The FITs and other low carbon CfDs should be phased out and merged into a unified equivalent firm power (EFP) auction. The costs of intermittency will then rest with those who cause them, and there will be a major incentive for the intermittent generators to contract with and invest in the demand side, storage and back-up plants. The balancing and flexibility of markets should be significantly encouraged.”  He goes on to recommend major changes in the institutions (i.e. utilities, system operators, and regulatory bodies) that now manage the UK electrical energy system. In the body of his report and in the Executive Summary, Professor Helm offers strong criticism of the way past and present British governments have managed the electricity system, criticism that will sound familiar to those who have witnessed recent “Green Energy” policies in Canada. “In the current decade, the government has moved from mainly market-determined investments to a new context in which almost all new electricity investments are determined by the state through direct and often technology-specific contracts. Government has got into the business of ‘picking winners’. Unfortunately, losers are good at picking governments, and inevitably – as in most such picking-winners strategies – the results end up being vulnerable to lobbying, to the general detriment of household and industrial customers.  In determining not just the level of new capacity, but also the composition of the low-carbon portfolio, the government started out with some of the most expensive technologies first, and it could be argued that since then it has at times been exploring even more expensive options. The result is that British households and businesses are locked into higher renewables and other low-carbon generation costs than they need to be to achieve the decarbonization objectives for the decades to come.” Comments In effect, what British governments have done through their complex schemes of subsidizing solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies for electricity generation has been to finance the large scale deployment of largely immature technologies. They did so by awarding each technology a price for the electricity it generates high enough to make it profitable, then guaranteeing that price, indexed to inflation, usually for 15 years (Ontario has followed a similar practice only for 20-year contracts). The people advising the civil servants on the price required to make each technology profitable were often the businesses backing that technology. The standard excuse for going straight to full-scale deployment of immature wind and solar technologies is that it was necessary to bring down costs. Yet, as Peter Lilley of the Global Warming Policy Foundation in the UK pointed out, “most new technologies – computers, mobile phones, gas turbines and, perhaps most telling, fracking – have rapidly reduced their costs without government subsidizing large-scale deployment. Making it profitable to deploy immature forms of wind and solar may have slowed, rather than accelerated, cost reduction.” One of the most interesting of Helms’ recommendations is that in future renewables suppliers be required to go through a competitive bidding process in which they are not given an unfair competitive advantage over suppliers of firm electricity supplies. He proposes that they be required to bid on an “equivalent firm power basis” – in other words, they must contract with a generator or storage company able to provide electricity when there is no wind or sun. The “system costs” imposed by intermittent energy sources would be removed from other suppliers and ratepayers and placed squarely on their own shoulders. That would impose a true test of “grid parity” pricing. Those skeptical about the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming will find much to disagree with in Professor Helm’s approach. Given his mandate, he did not question the underlying science. He accepted without question that the UK government should make a unilateral commitment to massively reduce emissions at great cost with no assurance that the developing countries, where all of the global emissions growth is occurring, will do the same. He offered a means a protect British businesses from competition from foreign suppliers that do not face carbon taxes, but ignored the effect of carbon taxes and other climate policy-related costs on the British firms that must export to survive. He took as given that several new technologies that would radically reduce emissions or solve the intermittency problem – like system scale battery storage – are just around the corner and will be rapidly developed and disseminated. He implicitly trusts governments to make good use of the hundreds of billions of pounds that they would take in through carbon taxes rather than spending it on politically favoured causes, groups and industries. For all that, his clear articulation of an alternative approach to managing energy transitions in the power sector should be welcomed. He offers a market-based approach that would be far superior to the one currently followed in the UK (and in Ontario and Alberta for that matter). His preference for simpler policy approaches using fewer policy instruments with less likelihood of duplication and unintended effects should be welcomed by all who value greater transparency and less waste in public administration.  His attacks on the special favours and privileges granted to the wind and solar industries, part of the “climate industrial complex”, were on target but certainly not welcomed by the firms in those industries. It may come as no surprise, then, that the Helm report has met with deafening silence in the media and in the UK Parliament. The status quo, while far from cost-effective, has far too many defenders. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['climate change'],2018/03/08

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/02/13/the-british-columbia-what-about-spilled-bitumen-ruse/,,The British Columbia “What About Spilled Bitumen” Ruse," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, former diplomat for 10 years.Last week, British Columbia Minister of Environment and Climate Change George Heyman announced proposed new regulations to limit “the increase of diluted bitumen transportation until the behavior of spilled bitumen can be better understood and there is certainty regarding the ability to adequately mitigate spills”. To that end, B.C will establish an independent scientific advisory panel to make recommendations on if and how heavy oils can be safely transported and, if spilled, cleaned up. The only people who could cheer this action are those who know little or nothing about the major reviews that have already been conducted by the Canadian federal government of precisely these subjects, or those whose goal is to limit the market access of Canadian oil production. The purpose of this note is to examine what the previous reviews have done, in order to determine whether the proposed British Columbia regulation is justified based on the evidence. B.C.’s actions must be seen in the context of the federal government’s approval of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. Trans Mountain Pipeline submitted an application to the National Energy Board (NEB) for approval of this project in December 2013. This project would entail the twinning of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline that has operated in British Columbia for over 60 years, the addition of new pump stations and tanks for the onshore pipeline, and the expansion of the Westridge Terminal in Burnaby. The result of this expansion is that crude oil flow in the pipeline would increase from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day and the number of tankers departing the Westridge Terminal would increase from 60 to 400 per year (a bit more than one per day). After almost three and a half years of regulatory review and public hearings, in May 2016 the NEB panel that examined the application issued a report recommending conditional approval. The NEB is an independent, expert regulatory tribunal that since 1959 has served Canada well in performing reviews of proposed projects in terms of their engineering, safety, financial, economic, social and environmental considerations and how these may be appropriately balanced in the Canadian public interest. The marine portion of the transportation system was reviewed under the federal government’s TERMPOL Review process, which brings together experts from six different federal departments and authorities to examine the marine safety and environmental issues associated with the port and tanker operations. Opponents of this project have done everything possible to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the longstanding federal government regulatory process. They have challenged the NEB’s objectivity and integrity, used public hearings as a stalling mechanism rather than an opportunity for provision of advice and views, and tried every means available to move the decisions out of the hands of the professional regulators and into those of politicians whom they could more easily influence. One of their effective tactics has been to focus in on technical issues about the project that are subject to legitimate and vigorous discussion among experts and to present these to the public as simple issues for which the merits rest only on one side – the side that opposes the project. Some of the most high profile, but poorly-understood, sets of issues concerns the potential effects of an oil spill from the marine, or tanker, portion of the transportation system. There are several related questions:How likely is it that there would be an oil spill from the Westridge terminal or a tanker?Would the effects of a spill involving diluted bitumen (from the oil sands) be worse than that of other types of oil spills and is that manageable?How probable is a worst case spill?How good are present and future governmental systems for avoiding, responding to and cleaning up oil spills in Canada? andWhere the scientific evidence is not yet complete, what is the best way to proceed? Every single one of these questions was considered and thoroughly addressed by the federal government regulatory processes. In a November 2016 article, I described the current regime for the prevention of and response to marine oil spills in Canada. It can be read here: Click to access moving-oil-by-tanker-in-canada-final.pdf Opponents, it appears, decided that what they really needed was an issue so arcane and unfamiliar to the public that fewer than one in ten thousand people would understand what it was about. The one that the B.C government chose to focus on in announcing its new rules is the effect of a possible spill involving diluted bitumen. What Is This Really About? The oil sands yield bitumen, a highly viscous (i.e. resistant to flow) form of petroleum. After extraction, bitumen must be modified for transport. Commonly, it is combined with lower-density hydrocarbon mixtures (condensates, synthetic crude oil, or a mixture of both) to obtain a product that will flow more easily and has a density suitable for transport to refineries by pipeline. This “engineered” fluid is referred to as diluted bitumen. Diluted bitumen has been transported by pipeline in Canada and the United States for more than 40 years. In other words, this is not a new issue – transport of bitumen by pipeline across bodies of water has been going on for a long time already.  Bitumen, however, has important differences from certain other types of oil products. In comparison to other commonly transported crude oils, many of the chemical and physical properties of diluted bitumen, especially relevant to environmental impacts, differ substantially from those of other crude oils. The key differences are in the exceptionally high density (i.e. low proportion of lighter petroleum products like gasoline or kerosene), viscosity (resistance to flow) and adhesion (tendency to cling to other substances) properties of the bitumen component of the blended bitumen that are increased when the diluted bitumen is subjected to weathering (a term that refers to the physical and chemical changes of spilled oil). Immediately after a spill into water, the behavior of diluted bitumen is similar to that of most other crude oils. Prolonged exposure to the environment, however, can cause the diluted product to revert toward the properties of the original bitumen. In some cases, the spilled bitumen may adhere to the surfaces it contacts as a residue; in others, the residues may submerge or sink to the bottom of the water body. These factors are important to consider for spill response planning and implementation. Spill response is most effective when it is fast – ideally within two days, but certainly within ten. Mechanical means of cleanup, like the use of booms and skimming, remain effective, but the period of time in which other techniques like the use of dispersants and in situ burning can be used are shorter than in the case of other crude oil spills. Chapter 8.0 of the National Energy Board’s May 2016 report on the Trans Mountain Expansion Project contains a lengthy summary of the evidence submitted concerning the environmental behavior of spilled oil and of the Board panel’s conclusions based on what it heard. To properly understand the issues, one should read both that chapter and the verbatim transcript of the verbal testimony and cross-examination that followed it. Trans Mountain’s testimony included some key points that are rarely, if ever, included in press accounts. Diluted bitumen and other crude oils and fuel oils with similar physical properties (like heavy crude oil and products like Bunker C fuel oil) are transported throughout the world. The general behavior of these oils is similar with respect to weathering and to spill counter-measures. The Joint Review Panel for the Northern Gateway Project found that, although there is some uncertainty regarding the behavior of diluted bitumen spilled in water, the weight of evidence indicated that it is no more likely to sink to the bottom than any other heavier oils with similar physical and chemical properties. “The Panel found that diluted bitumen is unlikely to sink due to natural weathering processes alone, within the timeframe in which initial, on-water response may occur, or in the absence of sediment or other particulate matter interactions.”As determined through the “Gainford Study” conducted by Trans Mountain and the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation (the main regional response organization for dealing with spills on the west coast), emergency response procedures and cleanup techniques for diluted bitumen would be similar to other heavy crude oil products for which emergency responders have developed procedures and techniques to respond to accidental spills.The results of the Gainford study are similar to a study conducted by the government of Canada (Environment and Climate Change Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Canada, and Natural Resources Canada). The Government of Canada study concluded that more research is needed and will be conducted.The Canadian Coast Guard said that, as part of the package of World Class Tanker Safety Initiatives, the federal government is examining the characteristics of how various blends of oil react in the marine environment. Scientists from DFO, ECCC and NRCan are conducting this research on how it may affect the sensitivities of the environment, including marine habitats and the fisheries resources they support. The Views of the Board The views of the NEB, as stated in the May 2016 report, address the same issues as the British Columbia regulation now wishes to address. “The Board is satisfied that sufficient evidence has been placed on the record regarding the fate and behavior of an oil spill to support assessment of potential spill-related effects and spill-response planning.” “Evidence filed by parties, such as Trans Mountain and the Government of Canada, and past spill examples indicated that bitumen will not typically sink in large quantities, or as a continuous mat in both freshwater and marine environments. Included in this evidence were the results of research conducted by Trans Mountain, the Government of Canada, and Alberta innovates. Trans Mountain also referred to the findings of the Joint Review Panel for the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project with regard to the potential for diluted bitumen to sink in an aquatic environment. The weight of the evidence indicates that any sinking would likely be in limited quantities and only after sufficient weathering over a period of days or interaction with sediment or other organic matter under the right environmental conditions” “The Board is of the view that depending on weathering state and environmental conditions, spilled diluted bitumen could be prone to submergence in an aquatic environment. A number of parties filed evidence confirming this view. The potential for submergence must be considered in response planning.” “The Board is of the view that weathered diluted bitumen could pose particular challenges in response and cleanup due to its potential for submergence and emulsion formation, persistent chemical and physical properties and potential for shoreline stranding. Environmental conditions and spill-specific factors would influence the use of such response tactics. The Board is of the view that these response challenges are not unique to diluted bitumen spills, but can be associated with heavier oil products in general.” “Parties such as Trans Mountain and ECCC noted the need for additional research on the fate and behavior of spilled oils. The Board acknowledges that there is ongoing research on the fate and behavior of spilled oils, including diluted bitumen products. This research is being conducted by the Royal Society of Canada, the United States Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration, and the Government of Canada. The Board is of the view that the results of this research could continue to inform the potential fate and behavior of spilled oils and assist companies and oil spill response agencies in spill response planning.” Heavy Oils in the Context of the Global Oil Market So the challenge of safely transporting diluted bitumen is not significantly different from that of transporting heavy crude oil and heavy fuel oil. Plenty is known, based on over 40 years of experience, but there is more to learn through research and planning, and those efforts are underway in Canada and other countries. None of this, and none of the evidence presented over years to the NEB, makes a compelling case for seeking to block all pipeline or marine transport of diluted bitumen. How important are heavy oils generally? According to several sources, including the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, global crude oil demand has been increasing at the rate of over 1.2 million barrels per day since 2012. Global oil resources are variously estimated at 9-13 trillion barrels. Of this, 70% is present in the form of heavy oil, extra-heavy oil, and oil sands or bitumen. The global crude oil reserve (supply available to be produced under current economic and technological conditions) at the end of 2015 was about 1.7 trillion barrels; more than 50% of this is heavy oil and bitumen. For reasons of cost, today conventional crude oils constitute over 85% of global crude oil production. Still, in 2015, 9.6 million barrels per day of production was heavy crude oil (including bitumen). The following graphs from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2015 show the past and projected trends. As you will note from the bar chart, in 2015 British Petroleum (one of the foremost analysts of global energy supply and demand conditions) projected heavy crude oil production to increase steadily to about 10.1 million barrels per day by 2035. Since then, projections of total crude oil production and consumption have increased considerably and are now in the range of 100 million to 120 million barrels per day by 2035. Heavy oil will constitute a large, and possibly growing share, of that total, and much of it will move to markets by tanker. Heavy fuel oil has been used as the main source of fuel in large marine vessels for many decades, especially since the 1960’s. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017, world consumption of fuel oil, mainly for shipping, declined from 9.7 million barrels per day in 2006 to 8.0 million barrels per day in 2016. In other words, it is a large and well known aspect of marine vessel transport. Conclusion To fully understand all the issues that might be raised about the Trans Mountain Expansion Project’ pipeline and marine transportation components, one would need to have significant expertise in engineering, economics, physics, chemistry, biology, and finances, not to mention public policy and regulation. The average person, even with above-average knowledge, cannot possibly hope to form a sound judgment on the merits of such projects based on press reports, politicians’ comments, or social media debates. This is true not only in general but also on specific topics like the chemical properties of diluted bitumen, the risks that oil might spill, and the adequacy of spill response measures. The opponents of the Trans Mountain Project depend upon people not knowing, and yet believing that those who oppose all oil development are more credible than the longstanding Government of Canada departments and regulatory bodies with enormous expertise (and a commitment to the public interest) that have already spent years studying these issues. The British Columbia use of a new regulatory process to examine the implications of transporting diluted bitumen by tankers is not justified based on the evidence already received and reviewed by the competent governmental authorities. The Government of Canada has the constitutional authority to review and decide on inter-provincial pipeline projects and their related effects and public interest considerations, and it has spent many years and millions of dollars exercising due diligence. No additional review of ground already well tread is needed. The obstruction must end.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'British Columbia', 'climate change', 'KinderMorgan', 'National Energy Board', 'oil sands', 'TransMountain', 'Uncategorized']",2018/02/13

Robert Lyman spent 27 years as a public servant; 10 years as a diplomat. He is a frequent contributor to Friends of Science with commentaries and reports. (See links at the bottom of the page for past topics relevant to this issue.)He said:As far as I can tell from a quick reading, the proposed legislations exactly fits the proposals in the previous working paper. In other words, none of the comments that I and, I assume, others made had the slightest effect in changing the path the Liberals are on.Consequently, all the criticisms that I posted on the Friends of Science blog previously still stand. The “sustainable development” assessment structure clearly leads and prejudges the changes intended for the National Energy Board, so there will be no surprises when those are finally announced.The process henceforth will be hopelessly politicized, complicated and prolonged. The considerations of “indigenous traditional knowledge” will rank with empirical science, consideration of social and gender impacts will rank with environmental effects, the indigenous groups will be granted a stranglehold on the process, and the burden on project sponsor to consult and document (e.g. for the “open science and data platform”) will add significantly to their costs. The most bizarre element of the new regime, in my view, is the “Early Planning Review” stage during which proponents will essentially be tasked to present and defend a project concept to the level at which it can be assessed in public consultations and bureaucratic analysis in terms of its consistency with “sustainable development” goals. There is a long list of these goals (i.e. environment, biodiversity, species at risk, cumulative risks, health, social, gender, indigenous interests and rights, economic, etc.) Notably, from the Friends of Science climate science perspective, climate change considerations will be “systematically integrated throughout the assessment process”. Environment and Climate Change Canada “would conduct a strategic assessment of climate change… to ensure Canada’s action on climate change is reinforced through the impact assessment process”. This is another way of saying that, if the project increases net GHG emissions, it will be deemed inconsistent with Canada’s climate change goals and deemed unacceptable in principle. It is not clear why a project sponsor would spend the hundreds of millions of dollars developing the plans, specifications and proposed siting of a project, only to get to this “approval in principle” stage which it would run the gauntlet of public, indigenous and bureaucratic review so Cabinet could then make a political decision to shut everything down.There is a clear signal to investors. Canada does not want resource development and will make it as difficult as possible for you to get approvals.~~~~National Energy Board (NEB) – A Report on the Implications of Proposed Changeshttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/29/national-energy-board-neb-a-report-on-the-implications-of-proposed-changes/Climate Change Policy and Confederationhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/17/climate-change-policy-and-confederation/Reflections on the Proposed Changes in Canadian Environmental Assessmenthttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/10/reflections-on-the-proposed-changes-in-canadian-environmental-assessment/In Defence of Science – A Commentary on the Use of Aboriginal “Traditional Knowledge” in Regulationhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/07/26/in-defence-of-science-a-commentary-on-the-use-of-aboriginal-traditional-knowledge-in-regulation/Environmental and Regulatory Reviewshttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/07/20/environmental-and-regulatory-reviews/BRITISH COLUMBIA’S CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAWhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/01/british-columbias-challenge-to-the-rule-of-law/~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'British Columbia', 'climate change', 'energy', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes', 'National Energy Board']",2018/02/11
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/02/06/renewable-and-conventional-energy-generation-comparing-the-costs/,,RENEWABLE AND CONVENTIONAL ENERGY GENERATION – COMPARING THE COSTS," EXECUTIVE SUMMARYContributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Link to Full Report:RENEWABLE AND CONVENTIONAL ENERGY GENERATION FINAL Feb 6 2018Proponents of wind and solar electricity generation plants contend that the costs of these plants are now, or soon will be, lower than those of conventional electricity generation plants based on nuclear energy, hydro or the combustion of fossil fuels. Is this true? There are many different cost factors to take into account, including notably the initial capital costs of the plants and their operating, maintenance and repair costs; these ultimately are reflected in the purchasing utility’s total expenditures over the life of the plants and the costs that are passed on to electricity consumers in the form of higher rates. Costs, however, are only one element to consider in determining the economic viability or merits of a plant; others include its capacity utilization (the average power generated as a percentage of the stated capacity, or “nameplate” capacity, of the plant); whether it is “dispatchable” (variable to meet changes in demand) or instead intermittent and unreliable; its ability to supply electricity at peak demand periods when it is most needed; and its effects on the market value (“pool price”) of generation, especially when the electricity generated exceeds the demand Since 2000, the actual costs of newly added wind and solar generation have significantly exceeded the costs of other sources of power generation. This is especially evident in Europe, where the capital costs of onshore wind projects per gigawatt (GW) of generation has been 16 times that of natural gas fired generation and that of solar PV on the grid has been 63 times that of natural gas fired generation. By 2014, the countries of the European Union had spent over 1.1 trillion euros (CDN $1.68 trillion) on wind and solar generation. Over the lives of the contracts existing in 2014, the EU countries made some 3.1 trillion euros (CDN $4.74 trillion) in financial commitments. In the province of Ontario, the government’s granting of above-market feed-in-tariffs – “FIT” (a form of fixed, contracted subsidies) to renewables under 20-year fixed price contracts, with “first-to-the-grid” rights, has provided large subsidies valued by different sources from CDN $6.4 billion to $9.2 billion and left the provincial utility with up to $38 billion in long-term unfunded liabilities The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates the levelized capital and operating costs (LCOE) over the lives of new electricity generation plants that will enter service in the near future. The most recent estimates, for plants entering service in 2022, indicate that new natural gas combined cycle and gas advanced combined cycle will have the lowest cost (U.S. $57/MWh) among the dispatchable sources of generation. Among the non-dispatchable sources of generation, the lowest cost sources will be onshore wind ($64/MWh), hydroelectric($66/MWh) and solar PV ($85/MWh). Other sources challenge the EIA’s LCOE methodology. Notably, the Institute for Energy Research observed that the EIA ignores the comparison between the cost of new generation and the cost of continuing to operate existing fossil fueled (mainly coal-fired) power plants to the end of their economic lives instead of shutting them down prematurely. It also questions the EIA’s assumptions concerning the utilization rates of renewable energy plants and the prices of natural gas. It estimates the LCOE of existing conventional coal plants in 2015 to be U.S. $40/MWh and that of gas combined cycle plants to be U.S. $34/MWh. The most fundamental challenges to the EIA findings are from experts who emphasize the differences in the costs and value of intermittent versus dispatchable electricity generating sources. They argue that the LCOE approach is flawed because it treats all megawatt hours supplied as a homogeneous product governed by the law of one price, and thus does not account for the fact that the value (wholesale market price) of electricity supplied varies widely over the course of a typical year. LCOE also ignores the necessary costs of backing up intermittent sources with conventional power (typically natural gas) and the many additional costs of the power grid operator needed to integrate wind and solar, along with the need for additional transmission lines. Comparing the average household electricity prices in Europe and North America shows clearly that the price of power rises dramatically, as the proportion of photovoltaic and wind capacity per inhabitant rises. Prices in Germany and Denmark are almost three times higher than in the United States. The higher costs quoted for renewable energy do not include most of the taxpayer subsidies provided to renewables. If, as proponents of wind and solar claim, the economic costs of renewable energy generation will soon be less than those of conventional sources, they should have no objection if governments eliminate the present subsidies, above-market tariffs and portfolio mandates establishing minimum utility purchase requirements. It is telling that none of these advocates is proposing this in any jurisdiction.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['renewables'],2018/02/06
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/02/02/trans-mountain-expansion-project-termpol-assessment-of-oil-spill-risk/,,Trans Mountain Expansion Project-TERMPOL Assessment of Oil Spill Risk," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2018 Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant; a former public servant of 27 years and former diplomat for 10 years. In view of the current controversy concerning British Columbia’s efforts to block the completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMPL) because of the oil spill risk allegedly posed by increased tanker traffic, it seems useful to examine the facts of the matter, as determined through review by the Canadian federal government. The TERMPOL Process The marine portion of the TMPL project was reviewed under the Technical Review Process of Marine Terminal and Transshipment Sites (TERMPOL). A TERMPOL Review Committee, whose members include experts from federal departments and authorities with responsibilities related to safe marine transportation, reviews submissions. The purpose of the TERMPOL review process is to: Objectively appraise operational vessel safety, route safety and cargo transfer operations associated with a proposed marine terminal system or transshipment siteFocus on improving, where possible, those elements of a proposal which could, in certain circumstances, pose a risk to the integrity of a vessel’s hull while navigating and/or the cargo transfer operations alongside the terminal The TERMPOL review takes place within the context of Canada’s marine safety regulatory regime, which is one of the most stringent in the world. Under this regime, oil tankers and their operations must comply with a long list of environmental protection requirements of both Canada’s domestic laws and international conventions. These requirements address such areas as safe vessel design and construction, including requirements for double-hulled tankers; safe manning; crew qualifications and training; working conditions; safety management systems, radio communication equipment and equipment for safe navigation including Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems and automatic identification systems (AIS); voyage planning; vessel reporting; and rules to prevent collisions. Det Norske Veritas Review of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project Trans Mountain commissioned the consultant Det Norske Veritas, a marine classification society recognized internationally for its marine risk assessment, to conduct a marine transport Quantitative Risk Analysis to determine the impact of the project on oil cargo spill risk, and identify mitigation measures necessary if required. Det Norske Veritas also completed a general risk analysis for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project in the lower British Columbia Mainland. This project involved the expansion of an existing pipeline that has operated for many years and the consequent expansion of the Westridge Marine Terminal and an increase in existing tanker traffic from 60 to 400 tankers per year. The assessment can be seen here: https://transmountain.s3.amazonaws.com/application14/V8C_TERMPOL_REPORTS/1142.html The assessment considered the effect on incident risk of traffic growth from Trans Mountain tanker traffic as well as from overall growth in the area. Here are the main conclusions as stated in the risk analysis submitted to the TERMPOL process: The increase in traffic resulting from the Project is found to have a negligible effect on the total incident frequency for the region. With or without the Project, tanker traffic remains a small part of the total traffic in the region. Without the Project, the frequency of accidents resulting in an oil cargo spill of any size is estimated to be one in every 309 years. Post implementation of the Project, if no additional risk reducing measures are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 46 years. If all the risk reducing measures discussed in this report are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 237 years. Without the Project, the risk of a credible worst-case oil spill (estimated by modeling to be 16,500 cubic metres) is estimated to be one in every 3093 years. Once the Project is implemented, if no additional risk reducing measures are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 456 years. If all the risk reducing measures discussed in this report are implemented, the frequency will be one in every 2366 years. Spill response in the region is currently the subject of review by the Federal and Provincial governments of Canada. Based on the information from the risk assessment, enhanced planning standards for spill response describe a regime that will be able to deliver 20,000 tonnes of capacity within 36 hours from dedicated resources staged within the study area. This represents a response capacity that is double and a delivery time that is half the existing planning standards. These enhancements will reduce times for initiating a response to two hours for the harbor and six hours for the remainder of the study area and parts of the west coast of Vancouver Island. The standard for cleaning of oiled shoreline is also improved significantly from 500 metres per day to 3,000 metres per day. DNV concludes that the regional increase in oil spill risk caused by the expected increase in oil tanker traffic to Trans Mountain Westridge Marine Terminal is low, and that the region is capable of safely accommodating the additional one laden crude oil tanker per day increase that will result from the Project. The Conclusion Based largely on this analysis and the views received from the participating federal government departments and authorities, the TERMPOL committee concluded: “While there will always be some risk in any project, after reviewing Trans Mountain’s studies and taking into account its commitments, the TRC has identified no regulatory concerns for the tankers, tanker operations, the proposed routes, navigability, other waterway users and the marine terminal operations associated with the Project tankers. The TRC has identified several findings and recommendations in response to Trans Mountain’s submission and has proposed actions for Trans Mountain to undertake that, in conjunction with Trans Mountain’s commitments, will provide for a higher level of safety for tanker operations commensurate with the increase in traffic.” The National Energy Board, in issuing a permit to the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, included the TERMPOL recommendations as binding conditions. One has to wonder what objective, other than obstruction, would be served by a further British Columbia review conducted on a project clearly within federal jurisdiction.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'British Columbia', 'KinderMorgan', 'National Energy Board', 'TransMountain']",2018/02/02

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/01/23/excitement-over-renewables-auction-ignores-infrastructure-costs-and-coal-phase-out-debt/,,Excitement over Renewables Auction Ignores Infrastructure Costs and Coal Phase-out Debt," By Michelle Stirling © Jan. 2018In the Jan. 9th, 2018 edition of the Edmonton Journal, Sarah Hastings-Simon of Pembina Institute recently beat the drum for the low prices of the late 2017 renewables auction in Alberta claiming that these low prices are in line with wind and solar performance world-wide.  Forgotten in all the applause is the fact that even if wind and solar were free, the integration costs could be more than all other forms of generation, once past a certain point.A recent report by Duane Reid-Carlson of EDC Associates indicates that this low-cost auction may be unprofitable for at least one winner; and future auctions will likely be much higher.To get this ‘cheap’ power on the grid, Alberta utilities have had to phase-out coal and be paid compensation.  Compensation will cost Albertans billions “…a total of $97 million annually over 14 years, beginning in 2017 — for a total cost of almost $1.36 billion.” No one talks about the cost of helping coal communities and families whose futures have been destroyed.On top of the coal phase-out compensation, there are the on-going costs associated with the dumping of coal Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs) back into the Balancing Pool.  This occurred as a direct result of the Alberta Climate Plan and carbon tax, as coal is a high emitter of carbon dioxide.  The carbon tax immediately made these contracts unprofitable.  Though described as a ‘secret Enron clause’ by the NDP government, in fact the ‘change of law’ clause that allowed for this dumping has been an integral part of World Bank recommendations for energy contracts since the late 1990’s.According to the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta website “ …the Balancing Pool is losing money every day….losses are being paid by a loan from the Government of Alberta…estimated in the 2017-2018 GoA budget to reach $2.25 billion. The interest alone is estimated at ~$400 million.”National Bank, the AESO and even TransAlta anticipate that power prices will triple in Alberta to $50-60 MW.  Power producers have been granted special permission from Ottawa to convert coal plants to natural gas. This will require additional natural gas supply pipeline infrastructure, cost unknown. Wind/solar integration to the grid is about $1 Million/MW. The coal-to-gas plant conversions will be ‘cheap’ – about $50 million each compared to building a new natural gas plant like Shepard in Calgary ($1.4 billion).  However, these conversions are not as efficient at reducing carbon dioxide – which is what this whole effort was supposed to be about, wasn’t it?Or was it about establishing a foothold in the market for carbon trading – like the cap and trade systems of Quebec, Ontario and California?  After all, you don’t need wind and solar for power – you are really building a natural gas plant as environmentalist Robert Kennedy said.  The wind and solar farms just generate trade-able Renewable Energy Certificates …and peaking plant profits.  (at your expense)Pembina Institute has been funded by the Oak Foundation out of the US which has a stated mandate to push cap and trade systems.Did anyone ask Albertans if they wanted to pay billions of dollars for decades-long contracts for a less efficient, more expensive, tax-subsidized power system that won’t reduce carbon dioxide emissions by much? To create a cap and trade option that will make some corporations and people rich – but will make Albertans poor?Are we really “saving the planet”?Hastings-Simon claims wind is ‘reliable’ – AESO stats show wind had only a 34.6% capacity factor in 2016. Wind is so erratic that if we add the proposed 5,000 MW wind, we would face random ramps of 80% or higher one or more times per week.  That’s like turning 6.5 Shepard Natural Gas plants (800 MW capacity) from off to full and off again.  From a CO2 perspective, this defeats the purpose of adding wind.Wind Aware of Ireland recently issued a report showing that their heavy investment in wind has had little impact on CO2 emissions.  Now they will be fined 600 million euros for missing EU GHG reduction targets. They found no cost-benefit analysis had been done.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/01/03/five-questions-from-students-about-climate-change/,,Five questions from students about climate change," Republished with permission from Ross McKitrick © January 2018. McKitrick is a professor of economics at the University of Guelph and author of numerous papers related to climate change models and economics.  His website: https://www.rossmckitrick.com/In late 2017 I was contacted by a group of students at a high school in Europe asking if I would answer some questions on climate change for a project they were working on.Here are the questions they asked, and the answers I gave them.1. What is behind global warming?Over the last 150 years there have been influences due to strengthening solar output, land-use changes, increased greenhouse gases and natural variability, among other things. The dominant school of thought in climatology is that rising greenhouse gas levels explain most of the overall warming trend since the 1950s. There are good reasons to support this, although the climate system is too complex to assume the matter is settled. The mechanisms by which the sun affects the climate are not well understood, nor are the mechanisms behind clouds, ocean atmosphere interactions and other basic processes. The relative lack of warming in the tropical troposphere and over the South Pole are not easily explained under the theory that greenhouse gas levels dominate the climate system.2. What can we do to prevent global warming?If it is a natural process, nothing. If it is mainly due to rising greenhouse gas levels we need to ask instead whether we would want to prevent it. It would require complete cessation of fossil fuel use, which would cause intolerable economic and social costs and would only yield small changes in the time path of global warming for the next century or more. Even large-scale emission reductions (such as under the Paris and Kyoto treaties) would only cause a small slowdown in the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere by 2100, so any benefits from such policies are likewise tiny, yet the costs would be enormous. The small warming that took place since the early 20thcentury was largely beneficial, and the astonishing social and economic benefits associated with cheap fossil energy far outweighed any problems it might have created. It is likely that this will be true over the next century as well.3. If we don’t do anything about it, how does it affect us and our descendants?Humans flourish in every climate on earth from the tropics to the polar regions. We are very adaptable. The only issue is whether changes take place so quickly that we cannot adapt, but history shows this to be a rare situation. Climate processes are slow, and if the climate models are correct, the changes are gradual and predictable. People can adapt to warming conditions more easily than to cooling conditions. The IPCC predicted that over the next hundred years, changes in economies and technology will have a much larger effect on peoples’ lives than changes in climate.4. What will happen in the future, and what are the alternatives for us, if the Earth becomes unlivable?There is no chance that greenhouse gases will make the Earth unlivable. If an asteroid hits, or another ice age begins, or something like that, then we face catastrophe. But the question essentially asks, what happens if we all die? The answer is, we all die.5. How can we save Earth if it isn’t too late?To ask the question is to reveal that you greatly overestimate your size in relation to the Earth. We could not ruin the Earth even if we tried, nor could we save it if it faced ruin. Our planet is a remarkably adaptable and robust home. We don’t live in a giant china shop where everything is fragile and breakable, it’s more like a playground where everything is made to withstand considerable wear and tear. Over the Earth’s history the amount of CO2 in the air has typically been 2-10 times higher than at present yet the plants, animals and oceans flourished. Much of the past half million years have been ice age conditions which wiped out life on the northern continents, yet it always came back as soon as the ice retreated. If you take the view that the ordinary human pursuit of prosperity and happiness will somehow destroy the planet you will end up adopting an anti-human outlook. This is both a scientific and an ethical error. Set your sights on amore modest scale, by trying to be a good citizen and be helpful to the people around you, and you will make much better decisions than if you are thinking in terms of faraway abstract categories like saving the Earth.Good luck with your studies.Original pdf: https://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/5questions.pdf~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Uncategorized']",2018/01/03
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/12/23/global-oil-demand-up-up-and-away/,,"Global Oil Demand – Up, Up and Away!"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.With all of the claims by activists in Canada and elsewhere that the world is “getting off oil”, it is informative and refreshing to examine the actual data on world oil consumption as published by the most authoritative sources available. There are three organizations that are highly respected for their expertise in world oil supply and demand conditions and trends, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the Secretariat of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Of the three, the only one that publishes free detailed analysis and predictions for the short-term in the EIA. Here is an EIA chart that shows world liquid fuels (oil and natural gas liquids) consumption from 2007 to 2016, with projections for 2017 and 2018. To summarize, world liquids consumption declined from about 87 million barrels per day in 2007 to about 85 million barrels per day during the recessionary year of 2008, and since then rose to 97 million barrels per day in 2016. The EIA projects liquids consumption to continue growing to 101 million barrels per day by the end of 2018. Since 2008, the growth in liquids consumption has averaged about 1.2 million barrels per day, but it has accelerated recently. The International Energy Agency, in its most recent Oil Market Report, gives the same figure for world oil consumption as the EIA does for all liquids (i.e. 97 million barrels per day). Its forecast for oil demand growth is 1.5 million barrels per day in 2017 and 1.3 million barrels per day in 2018. The OPEC Secretariat, in its November 2017 forecast, quotes oil demand as 98.45 million barrels per day in 2017 and projects it to rise by 1.5 million barrels per day in 2018. The various source differ somewhat on what will happen in terms of oil supply, as there are many factors in play. The most important of these are the general pace of world economic growth, the extent to which the OPEC countries will maintain market “discipline”, as represented by their current withholding of about 1.8 million barrels per day in production, and the ever-present risk of supply disruptions, the most important of which may be the risk of economic collapse in Venezuela. The consensus among the government-related forecasters is that oil production will not quite match demand, with a gradual decline in oil stocks, and slightly higher prices over the next year. The International Monetary Fund, in its most recent report on the world economy, foresees continuing improvement in about 75% of the countries, leading to higher employment, expanded manufacturing and trade. Based on this, some private sector investment analysts who follow oil markets are projecting that world oil demand will increase to almost 102 million barrels per day by the end of 2018, moving oil prices substantially higher. If the EIA and private sector projections hold true, by the end of 2018 world oil consumption will have grown over 16 million barrels per day since 2008, almost a 20% increase – a reality activists have failed to grasp.~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'energy', 'Uncategorized']",2017/12/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/12/23/geo-engineering-gone-wild-confusing-correlation-causation-and-solution/,wkblair ,"Geo-Engineering Gone Wild – Confusing Correlation, Causation and Solution"," Opinion Contributed by Andrew Bonvicini, P. GeophHumans have engineered phenomenal solutions to large scale problems.  The Dutch have constructed a landscape of ditches, waterways, canals and culminating in the Delta Works they proved that the fight between man and water can often be addressed by large-scale engineering projects.  About 26% of the Netherlands’ area lies below sea level, the lowest point is at minus 7 meters and Schiphol Airport is also 3 meters below sea level.   The Netherlands has now won that fight and they are safe from the storm surge flooding devastation of past centuries.  We can also cite the Chunnel as a brilliant engineering effort to connect Britain to mainland Europe and the Thames Barrier as another means of addressing storm surges.  These and many other projects can be deemed to be engineering successes.However, the many fantastic engineering victories around the globe have made us think that building something is a solution for any problem.  Humans may very well be able to fix anything given enough funds or time.  However, we must be exceptionally careful to define what problems are real and which ones exist only in theory.The Main Stream Media and the climate alarmists keep saying that human industrial emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) causes global warming, which in turn will cause sea level rise, which will flood all the coastal cities where huge numbers of the world’s population live.  Unfortunately too many people accept these “climate change” statements as fact, when they are conjecture.  They make the mistake of thinking that one thing – global warming – will cause melting of ice and in turn raise sea levels.  When someone says that A is happening at what seems to be the same time that B is also happening they are demonstrating a CORRELATION.  Then from this correlation, if they leap to the conclusion that A causes B they are wrong.  CORRELATION does not imply CAUSATION.One engineering firm in particular that is using the threat of cataclysmic sea level rise to justify its projects is the Spanish firm Presa Puente Estrecho de Gibraltar (PPEG).   On their website presapuente.com they present two projects:A dam to close off the Strait of Gibraltar, andA Caribbean seawall running from Venezuela to FloridaThe presentations are framed as mitigation projects to save the Mediterranean and the Caribbean/Gulf coasts from rising sea levels.  Ironically, both projects fail to safeguard the ecosystems of both bodies of water they are trying to save. But, let’s discuss these projects and the pros and cons.The Gibraltar Project YouTubeThe following is a summary of key points in the YouTube video. This project consists of a basal dam works which is designed to fill in the strait and shrink the passage down to a 2 km opening (1:50).  The dam of “natural rock” will be constructed to a height of 100 meters over present day sea level (1:55).  The dam would be “2 km wide at its base and 1 km on top” (2:05).  1,000 hectares of new land (2:10) would be created on either side of the bridge to be highly commercialized (2:15).Of course the bridge will eventually be replaced by locks to aid passage between the two bodies of water (3:15).  At (3:25) they do state that “this action will affect the seabed and migratory species but the slope of stone is ideal for resettlement of ecosystems and the ecological advantages of saving the Mediterranean coastline will far outweigh the potential harm”.The total budget is set at 4 billion Euros (2:50) with 5% (3:42) to PPEG for management and other fees.  The project is estimated to take three years (4:00) to complete.It seems that an engineering proposal has been filed and can be found here docs.google.com/file.  On their website you will also find several links proposing that the president of PPEG be nominated for the NOBEL Peace Prize and here is the proposed “ratification” of PPEG’s president for the 2017 Prize.What could this do to the Mediterranean?  Simply put, this project would spell the end of the Mediterranean as we know it.  As per Environmental Condition of the Mediterranean Sea the Mediterranean experiences very high evaporation rates of 140 cm per year and without a steady inflow from the Atlantic Ocean the Mediterranean would drop by 1 meter per year.  In 200 to 300 years the Mediterranean would be a salt flat.  This alone should be enough to stop this project but let’s take a closer look at the forecasted budget.Presently, the world’s longest suspension bridge is the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan and it spans a similar length at 1,991 meters.  The bridge opened in 1998 after 10 years of construction with a cost of 500 billion Yen.  The cost converts to 3.75 billion Euros without any adjustments for inflation.Based on these numbers it looks like their 4 billion Euro budget over three years is grossly underestimated.The Caribbean Project YouTubeSpanning 2,400 km (2:20) from Venezuela to Florida this dam will restrict traffic into six 2 km bridges (3:56).  It is also to be constructed of “natural rock” to a height of 10 meters over present day sea level (3:40) and it will be 100 meters wide at the top with sides at a 45 degree angle to the seabed.  Along with dealing with rising sea levels (0:55), the presence of this wall will supposedly reduce hurricane strength by 50% (2:55) and safeguard the entire area from tsunamis (4:10).The construction (5:23) will employ thirty companies working in parallel each constructing an 80 km section of the wall and will “finish the dam in three years” (5:30).  The companies will source the rock from open pit mines (5:55) that will cover about 2 sq km and be 100 meters deep.  The total cost will be US$150 billion as it is estimated to be ten times (5:31) the 15 billion dollars (1:50) the US spent to “protect only the city of New Orleans”.The final project will include 18 lane highways, dual train tracks, oil and gas pipelines (5:08), and 25,000 wind turbines (4:20).  Furthermore, little villages consisting of seaports, heliports, restaurants, hotels, gas stations and medical centres will be constructed every 80 kms (4:48).This project, as well, is a cataclysmic environmental catastrophe in the making.Closing 2400 km of open seaway with six 2 km openings would devastate sea life migration routes.The Gulf Stream current that warms Northern Europe flows through the Gulf of Mexico and the western side of this projected dam as shown in this image of North Atlantic Ocean currents sourced from the Britannica (www.britannica.com/place/Norway-Current).  Completion of this project would alter the Gulf Stream with disastrous consequences to the entire Atlantic Ocean and Europe.The proposal that this 100 m wide wall would reduce hurricane strength by any amount let alone 50% is naive.  Hurricanes are hundreds of kilometres in diameter, and as we saw this past season, entire islands barely affected their destructive force.  Presenting this wall as an effective shield to any Atlantic tsunami is also very suspect.Furthermore, the highway and train traffic will generate “tons” of rubber and lubricant pollution which will destroy the Caribbean Sea.The proposed construction methods and timelines for this project are also very challenging.  The proposed thirty open pit mines will generate about 6 cubic kilometres of rock.  This volume of rock would only allow for a 20 meter tall wall.  Implying they are expecting this to be built in water depths of 10 meters.  The map on the right, adapted from the Britannica (www.britannica.com/place/Caribbean-Sea), shows that water depths along the route are actually hundreds of meters.  A quick calculation shows that to construct a wall with an average height of 110 meters they will consume about 55 cubic kilometres of rock or ~10 times their original estimate.The proposed three year timeline is also questionable.  Conventional construction practices require that adequate settling and compaction time be allowed prior to installing pavement and buildings; this would likely take years and easily overwhelming the timeline.  As per Gibraltar, the six bridges alone will take a decade each to construct.  Furthermore, expecting to build 80 kms of super highways in three years in these conditions would likely be a record as new construction is traditionally limited to a few kilometres per year.Then there is the projected US$150 billion total cost.  As discussed above, the six bridges alone will cost US$26.55 billion (in 1998 dollars).  The 25,000 wind turbines, using a conservative US$3 million installed cost, would be US$75 billion.  This leaves less than US$50 billion to construct the rest of the dam, infrastructure and pay for any management fees to PPEG.But are we missing the point that these projects are to save humanity from rising sea level cataclysms?I could get side tracked into a long discussion about the fact that sea level rise has actually decreased and stabilized since the last ice age but instead I will refer you to this 2016 article at judithcurry.com.  More importantly I want to focus on the credibility of the “future” coastline maps presented in their videos.The following maps are used by PPEG to present the sea level rise they are proposing to defend us from.  The Europe map is from this video youtu.be/iKxuzrF2BWQ at 5:48.The Caribbean map is from the previous video at 1:20.I present these similar maps from a National Geographic 2013 article on their site:The article is clearly titled What the World Would Look Like if All the Ice Melted and is a thought experiment as it portrays maps for when “all the ice on land has melted and drained into the sea” raising sea levels 216 feet or 65.8 meters.  They go on to say that “there are more than five million cubic miles of ice on Earth” and that scientists say it will “take more than 5,000 years to melt it all”.Do you see the patterns here?Underestimating budgets and timelines can “easily” support the approval of projects due to their huge cost to benefit advantage.  Incorrectly using data, like the maps showing a 5,000 year sea level rise, is, in my opinion, an unethical scare mongering trick.  These are the tactics being used to promote geo-engineering projects around the globe to safe guard us from “Climate Change”.  We, as concerned citizens, need to be aware and question projects that in the end are likely being promoted to generate excessive amounts of profits for a few individuals to address speculative problems while draining funds away from real issues like poverty, famine and housing.Nothing like a little scare mongering to get your point across.~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/12/21/the-international-energy-agencys-2017-coal-analysis/,wkblair ,The International Energy Agency’s 2017 Coal Analysis," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017 Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years, prior to that a diplomat for 10 years. A few days ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published a report on international coal markets, including a review of the recent past and projections for the five-year period to the end of 2022. The IEA seems to play a dual role. On the one hand, it is a professional agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and thus staffed by experts who take pride in carrying out objective economic analysis of energy supply and demand trends. At the same time, it has increasingly adopted the political perspective of the European countries that represent the majority of the OECD’s members, and has accepted uncritically their adherence to the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming. The IEA’s reports are thus a blend of the analytical and the politically correct. The IEA earns a significant amount from the sale of its reports, so the full report on coal is only available at a high price. The agency did, however, publish an executive summary report online. It can be read here: https://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/coal2017MRSsum.pdf The following are the main conclusions of the report, with my comments interspersed. Global coal demand has dropped 4.2 % since 2014, and fell 1.6% in 2016 to reach 5,357 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce). This was caused mainly by lower natural gas prices; increased electricity generation by renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements in the developed countries; reduction of coal use for air quality reasons (i.e. to reduce local pollutants, not greenhouse gases) in China; and the effect of carbon taxes in some countries, including notably the United Kingdom. Coal’s share in the global energy mix may decline from 27% in 2016 to 26% in 2022, as reduced demand in the developed countries almost matches increased demand in India, Southeast Asia and other parts of Asia. Total coal consumption is projected to increase to 5,530 Mtce in 2022. “Prospects for coal are bleak throughout most of Europe”, yet Poland and Germany continue to be major coal consumers and likely will remain so until the end the projection period and beyond. Some Asian countries are about to increase their coal consumption sharply. India has a growing fleet of coal power plants and robust power demand growth. Coal demand is projected to increase there at nearly 4% per year through 2022. Pakistan and Bangladesh, extremely poor countries with large coal reserves, are other sources of demand growth. Pakistan’s coal demand will more than quadruple between 2016 and 2022. The interplay of market factors and policy choices makes it very difficult to project what will happen in terms of international coal trade. As a result, the IEA foresees a  period of continued coal price volatility, with prices largely dependent on developments in China, the largest market. The report observes that, despite higher coal prices recently, producers have slowed down investment because of uncertainty and fears of oversupplying the market. The mood in the United States coal industry “brightened” in 2017, as high natural gas prices reduced the switch from coal to natural gas, regulations were reviewed (and removed) and the financial environment for coal mining improved. U.S. coal production is forecast to be around 510 Mtce in 2022, equivalent to current levels, while demand declines to 470 Mtce, a drop of 1% per year on average over the period. The central message of the report concerns coal’s “stagnation”. It downplays the fact that, contrary to the story line preferred by those who claim the world will soon rid itself of fossil fuels, global demand for the most carbon intensive of all the fossil fuels is in fact still growing. The world is not following the “green” playbook. ~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'carbon dioxide', 'climate change', 'coal', 'Uncategorized']",2017/12/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/12/17/are-costly-us-co2-emissions-reductions-regulations-based-on-semantics-or-science/,,Are Costly US CO2 Emissions Reductions Regulations Based on Semantics or Science?," Contributed by Michelle Stirling © Dec. 17, 2017Many people cite the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) ‘endangerment’ finding when talking about Anthropogenic Global Warming and the rationale for instituting carbon taxes. The CO2 Endangerment Finding is fundamental to the institution of the US Clean Power Plan, now under review by the Trump Administration. https://www.epa.gov/energy-independence As reported by ABC News, Oct. 11, 2017, the Clean Power Plan “…called for a 32 per cent decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.The EPA just released a statement saying that after a review of the plan, it “has proposed to determine that the Obama-era regulation exceeds the Agency’s statutory authority.”A recent article in the New Republic by Ross McKitrick, Professor of Economics at the University of Guelph, is exposing serious flaws in the original US EPA decision- making process.Under U.S. Administrative Law, there are some strict guidelines that a government department or agency intending to introduce new regulations must meet. If, for example, the new rules will have an US economic impact that exceeds $500 million per year, the department or agency must conduct a “Highly Influential Scientific Assessment (HISA)”. This includes an independent assessment of the fundamental findings. “…The guidelines do not allow an agency such as the EPA to rely on peer reviews conducted by outside groups such as the IPCC or the National Climate Assessment team.”As Professor McKitrick explained, the EPA avoided this process by claiming the Endangerment Finding was not attached to specific rules, and therefore not highly influential. This semantic dance allowed them to shorten the process and create rules that were highly influential – the Clean Power Plan, now about to be repealed.The endangerment finding essentially allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as thought they were “pollutants” under the Clean Air Act, thus providing a broad range of authorities that otherwise would not have been available, and opening the door to ever-expanding regulation in future.This is relevant to Canadians, and especially in Alberta and Saskatchewan where most of the coal power production and oil and gas exploration, extraction and processing occurs. Our provinces and our nation are following similar plans to cut emissions – at a time when the US is rolling them back and investigating the contrived origins of such policies. When the Alberta government is questioned on the scientific foundation of its policies, people are regularly referred to the US Endangerment Finding.  However, now it is being reviewed for having been instituted in a way that overstepped the agency’s authority and involved a sloppy practice born of haste.Some might say it included a preference for semantics and not science.In Alberta and Saskatchewan, where coal is abundant, high quality and used in modern low emission, high-efficiency coal plants, power generators already face a double whammy – burdensome carbon taxes (also premised on the validity of the US EPA endangerment finding) and federal regulations that will force them to close.Alberta is blessed with an abundant supply of high-quality, low sulphur coal that exists in seams that are near the surface making it easier to mine and reclaim.  Alberta owns the rights to this mineral, unlike competing nations like Denmark and Germany which much import coal at about $60/tonne.  This gives Alberta a tremendous economic advantage, if used to our benefit.Coal is the cheapest source of power available in Alberta, where it is burned in high efficiency power plants that virtually eliminate local air pollutants or older plants with modern mitigation (that were due to go offline by 2030 under previous legislation). Most people don’t realize that over decades, coal is very stable price-wise and thus very predictable for forecasting power prices.Source: US EIAIn Alberta, coal often provides up to 70% of the base load power because it is affordable, abundant, and very predictable price-wise. In Alberta, over 75% of electrical power is consumed by industry and commerce.Source: AESOAbout half of Alberta’s dispatchable (on-demand) electrical power in Alberta comes from coal.Source: AESOAlberta’s ‘renewables’ are presently include biomass, hydro, wind power (1,445 MW), and co-generation. Wind power cannot be ‘dispatched’ because it relies solely on Mother Nature’s whims. By contrast, natural gas is a market commodity and its prices are subject to wild swings. Though there is a glut of natural gas on the market today, so prices are low, but that can rapidly change in future.Phasing out coal-fired plants that still could have decades of useful life costs a fortune. Coal phase-out is creating billions of dollars of damage to the economy because electrical power underwrites our manufacturing and our way of life. This includes billions of dollars in payouts to industry. Some 7,000 people are losing their jobs in Alberta’s coal industry. Thirty coal communities are being destroyed. Heavy industry and all small and medium-sized businesses, especially those that are heavy users of electrical power, are going to take a massive financial hit as wholesale power prices triple in Alberta and carbon taxes kick in.Source: August forecast from National Bank.If the US EPA Endangerment Finding is overturned, it will lay the foundation to phase out or eliminate many other federal regulations and subsidies in the United States. If our largest trading partner and competitor to the south repeals the Endangerment Finding, this will call into question the entire rationale for much of Alberta’s Climate Change Plan, carbon tax and similar federal policies.It is consequential to businesses and individuals in other ways because Alberta and Canada are extremely cold compared to life below the 49th parallel. We must have affordable power for industry to operate in an economically profitable manner; people cannot survive without heat and power in our cold winters with short days and long, dark nights. Heat-or-eat poverty is not an option. And the final, tragic irony? Because of push for rapid coal phase-out, there may be interim demand for power from out of province.  According to a presentation of AESO reps in Calgary on Dec. 11, 2017, one place that power could come from is …. Montana coal-fired power stations.In 2014, just after the fall release of the Intergovernmental Panel (IPCC) on Climate Change AR5 report, Dr. Judith Curry testified to the US Senate that the report showed the evidence reported by the IPCC AR5 weakens the case for human factors as driving recent climate change. She summarized her testimony with the statement that “CO2 is not the control knob that can control climate.” ~~~~Further reading:WUWThttps://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/10/17/60-scientists-call-for-epa-endangerment-finding-to-be-reversed/https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/10/03/the-epa-co2-endangerment-finding-endangers-the-usa/~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Alberta coal phase-out', 'carbon dioxide', 'climate change', 'endangerment finding', 'Uncategorized']",2017/12/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/12/14/alberta-rejoicing-over-renewables-auction-will-be-short-lived/,,Alberta Rejoicing over #Renewables Auction Will be Short-lived," Contributed by Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager © Dec. 14, 2017On Dec. 13, 2017 the government of Alberta made loud proclamations of ‘record-setting success’ on the first renewables auction.  They claim power prices will remain affordable. As usual, only part of the picture is being presented. Presently, coal-fired power is about 2¢ a kWh. Wholesale power prices will triple. Why isn’t that mentioned? In May of 2016, we had asked an Alberta power market expert for a forecast on subsidies to renewables under the Alberta Climate Plan. (that text cut and pasted below; original post here).  Here are updated comments based on the results of the Dec. 13, 2017 Alberta government announcement:“Based on the Dec. 14, 2017 auction results the subsidy would be lower (than the May 2016 forecast). The wind producers will be topped up the $37 MWh from the actual market price which in 2017 has been about $22 MWh or a $15 MWh difference. It still adds up to a lot of money over 20 years.  Keep in mind that the $37 MWh price is only for the 600 MWs from this first auction and these represented the lowest bids.   Given that the Gov’t of Alberta wants to build a 5,000 MW renewable portfolio, there will be several more auctions to come in which the subsidized price could very well be higher than $37.”What is NOT talked about by the Government of Alberta and what is invisible to the average person are the infrastructure costs that go with this kind of drastic power generation and market transition.  Putting wind and solar on the power grid is not just about the wind/solar farms themselves, but all the behind-the-scenes integration and additional natural gas power plant requirements, as well as changes to the way the market works.Power generation experts say:“What makes renewables expensive is integrating these technologies into the grid. Grids can handle small amounts of renewables but the levels proposed by governments with environmental ambitions are overwhelming. These require massive expenditures in transmission, peaking power, and possibly storage. Even if wind and solar were free, the integration expenses could cost more than all other forms of generation once you pass a certain tipping point. Another cost is market reform but this would only apply in areas where there are competitive markets. In Alberta for example, the AESO has decided that renewable subsidies will make our once thriving energy market unsustainable. This has led them to introduce a capacity market which will lead to $10’s or maybe $100’s of millions in transition expenses along with years of uncertainty. Lastly, what gets lost in all this is the actual carbon reductions or lack thereof. The current state of storage technology is insufficient to back large quantities of renewables. This is leading to investments in relatively inefficient natural gas peaking facilities that negate the carbon benefits of renewables. Arguably, we may be better off from both a carbon and economic perspective by just investing in efficient base load natural gas and completely forgetting about renewables. Existing infrastructure could be used and market changes wouldn’t be required. Regardless of the chosen path, we are a long, long way from a 100% renewable energy grid.”There is much evidence from other jurisdictions to support these statements.Ontario Professional Engineers report there will be an increase in CO2 emissions as more wind is added to the grid. (Alberta has no nuclear; coal is also too inflexible to back up erratic wind.)Wind Aware Ireland just published a report showing that despite adding lots of wind to the grid to reduce emissions, those expectations have not been met.https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/59534715/costs-of-wind-energy-report  Here is a typical example of wind output in Alberta under the current capacity.Power generations experts say:“The problem with wind is its randomness, wind is completely uncorrelated with demand. If they add another 5,000 MW then the total would be 6,500 MW. Typically this amount of wind would randomly experience 80% or higher ramps one or more times per week. This would be the equivalent of ramping 6.5 Sheppard plants from off to full to off again. These plants are unable to do this over the long term. They may end up having to put in simple cycle units instead which, from a CO2 perspective, would pretty much defeat the purpose of adding wind. But it’s never really been about reducing CO2, it’s all about building wind. And now solar with the new government statement about going 50% solar. “In the following image, you can see how there are also often long periods of NO WIND WHATSOEVER. In that time, conventional thermal (coal/natural gas) have to do the heavy lifting.Source: AESO – chart shows Jan 2017 and 4 days of no wind generation.The challenge in Alberta phasing out coal and replacing it with natural gas is that natural gas will become the largest single dispatchable (on demand) fuel source (despite there being a number of different suppliers.Natural gas is a market commodity, subject to wild fluctuations.Many people think that if you add more wind and solar, then this will solve the problem of wind dying down from time to time.  This is not true.  Wind is a regional phenomenon.  Euan Mearns discusses how “Wind Blowing Nowhere” is the reality.Also, adding LOTS of wind and solar to the power grid, simply means you must have equivalent conventional power to back it up.  Germany added 90 GigaWatts (GW) combined wind and solar and they are still running on #coal.Above image shows German power generation by source matching the time frame of the image of it. The dark brown and beige represent coal. The amber represents natural gas. Their other baseload supplemented by nuclear, biomass and a small amount of hydro. To appreciate the difference here, Alberta has 16,626 MegaWatts (MW) capacity on the grid.  Germany added 90 GigaWatts (GW) of wind and solar and still relies on coal for most of its baseload power. Why? Because coal is the cheapest, most affordable, most abundant source of power in the world.Amount: 1 gigawatt (GW) of powerEquals: 1,000.00 megawatts (MW) in powerWith this information in mind, have a look at the original forecast from May of 2016. One thing is certain. Albertans will be paying billions of dollars for ineffective, expensive, unreliable wind power generation. And we will be paying it for decades.For up to date market reports of generation by source (updates every 15 mins):http://ets.aeso.ca/ets_web/ip/Market/Reports/CSDReportServlet Alberta Government Subsidies to Wind and Solar Will Cost YOU Billion$By Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager @May 2015 in consultation with power generation industry expertsPembina Institute recently blogged that:“The challenge for renewable energy projects is not securing the fuel, the sun and wind are free. [Bold added]…”Pembina goes on to explain that the Alberta Climate Leadership plans says:“two-thirds of Alberta’s [existing coal-fired power] generating capacity will be replaced by renewable energy, one-third will be replaced by natural gas.”Stop right there. That might be what the Climate Leadership plan says, but practically speaking Alberta’s existing coal-fired capacity will have to be replaced 100% by natural gas, because wind and solar are intermittent forms of power generation.  Sometimes wind and solar can generate 100% power – and sometimes nothing at all. But consumers expect on-demand power 100% of the time – with no power quality issues like surges, drops or brown-outs.Pembina makes a point of saying:“By 2030, renewable sources like wind and solar will account for up to 30 per cent of electricity generation.” That’s what Alberta’s Climate Leadership plan says. “That ‘free’ wind and solar will end up costing YOU billions.Why?  The Pembina blog outlines how low the current power prices are in Alberta. The only way for wind and solar companies to make it in this market is to have government subsidies in the form of “Renewable Energy Certificates.”Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) are subsidies – tradeable certificates of value – rather like printing paper money in return for power generation from wind, solar, geothermal, biomass or other deemed ‘renewable’ source that is not directly from hydrocarbons.We asked industry experts about what this would mean in real dollars from Alberta taxpayers’ pockets. Here’s an example.If the REC value was set at $35/MWh and the Government of Alberta wants to replace 4,500 MWs of existing coal output with 2/3rds renewables, that means 3,000 MWs equivalent.So 3,000 MWs subsidized at $35/MWh = approx. $900 million a year in cost subsidies paid by the Government of Alberta – you, the taxpayer.Based on this very rough calculation, it seems this amount could be over and above the costs included in the Alberta budget released in the spring of 2016. If so, the deficit forecasts would increase by almost another $1 billion per year.And for what? Power that is not clean, green or free. Why would we want to go to power generation systems that increase costs and risks and reduce reliability?~~~Activists call coal and natural gas ‘dirty and polluting’ sources of electricity. They forget to mention to you that wind and solar need 100% back-up from conventional generation.  And remember that every wind or solar device consumes masses of materials and fossil fuel energy, just to make and install each turbine or panel.~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'climate change', 'renewables', 'Uncategorized']",2017/12/14
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/12/11/insights-from-an-energy-flow-chart-of-the-united-states/,Jeff Green ,Insights From An Energy Flow Chart Of The United States," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who has 27 years experience as a public servant and 10 years experience as a diplomat.The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is one of three prestigious energy research institutions funded by the United States Department of Energy. It periodically produces energy “flow charts” that depict and quantify the origins, transformation and uses of different energy sources. Recently, the laboratory published the flow chart for the United States for 2016.Here it is.The left side of the chart lists the various primary energy sources, colour-coded and quantified in terms of quadrillion British Thermal Units (“Quads”). The arrows moving from left to right that show the amounts of these energy sources that are used to supply the energy services in the residential, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors of the U.S. economy and a category of “rejected energy” that is, in effect, lost in the transformation and delivery processes. Many energy sources are used to produce secondary energy in the form of electricity. The flow chart offers many valuable insights that are often ignored by commenters on energy and climate issues today. The first concerns the relative roles of the different energy sources in providing primary energy. Table 1 summarizes these. TABLE 1Primary Energy Sources in the United States in 2016 Source Production (Quads)PercentagePetroleum35.945.6Coal14.218.0Natural gas10.313.1Nuclear8.4210.7Biomass4.756.0Hydro2.463.1Wind2.112.9Solar0.340.4Geothermal0.230.3Total78.71100.0Fossils fuels (petroleum, coal and natural gas) thus accounted for about 77% of U.S. primary energy supply. The so-called “new renewables” of wind, solar and geothermal account for less than 4%. A large proportion of that primary energy goes as fuel for electricity generation. The quantities are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2Primary Energy Used for Electricity GenerationSource QuadsPercentage   Coal13.034.6Natural gas10.327.4Nuclear8.4222.4Hydro2.466.5Wind2.115.6Biomass0.511.4Solar0.340.6Petroleum0.240.6Geothermal0.230.6Total37.61100.0As indicated in this table, the traditional sources of energy for electricity generation (coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydro) account for 91% of supply today. The new renewables (wind, solar and geothermal) account for fewer than 7%. Of the 37.6 Quads of energy that fuels electricity generation (37.5 Quads on the flow chart), a remarkably high proportion (24.9 Quads, or two-thirds) becomes “rejected energy”. Only 12.6 Quads of electricity, moves on to meet the economy’s needs. The next point to note is how the needs of different economic sectors for energy services are met, both by primary energy source and electricity. This is summarized in Table 3.TABLE 3Role of Energy Sources in Meeting Sectoral Needs Consuming SectorEnergy SupplyQuadsPercentageTransportationPetroleum25.792.1 Biomass1.465.2 Natural gas0.742.7 Sector total27.9100.0    IndustrialNatural gas9.6139.2 Petroleum8.1233.1 Electricity3.1913.0 Biomass2.289.3 Coal1.235.0 Sector total24.5100.0    CommercialElectricity4.6451.4 Natural gas3.2435.9 Petroleum0.889.8 Sector total9.02100.0    ResidentialElectricity4.843.6 Natural gas4.5441.3 Petroleum1.029.8 Sector total11.0100.0    This table reveals some interesting points:As of 2016, petroleum and natural gas supplied 93.8 % of the transportation sector’s energy needs. Electricity generated by whatever source provided too little to even register.The transportation sector consumed more energy than any other sectorNatural gas is an important fuel source in all four sectors of the energy economy, but especially in the residential sector.Despite the critical importance of electrical energy, fossil fuels continue to supply over 77% of the industrial sector’s energy needs, not counting transportation.Electricity supplied more than half the energy needs of the commercial sector (with, as previously noted, 91% of the electricity generation provided by traditional sources). These figures offer an important factual context for the ongoing debate about whether modern renewables will soon replace either all other electricity generation sources or all the economy’s energy needs. Governments, including those in the United States, have been actively supporting and subsidizing renewables technology and commercialization for over forty years, since the first OAPEC oil embargo of 1974. Especially in the period since 1990, many billions of taxpayer and electricity ratepayer dollars have been spent through direct and indirect subsidies to promote wind and solar energy. The net result of this extraordinary expenditure is that modern renewables constitute 7% of the primary energy used for electricity generation. For the whole economy, after 43 years of governmental support, modern renewable constitute 4% of supply. Only 96% of the way to go. It may take a while.~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['energy', 'Uncategorized']",2017/12/11
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/12/11/a-starving-polar-bear-on-somerset-island-is-not-evidence-of-climate-change/,,A Starving Polar Bear on Somerset Island is Not Evidence of Climate Change," In the last couple days there have been several articles published claiming that polar bear mortality due to starvation is a result of climate change. This latest burst of articles focuses on a film, shot in August 2017 by SeaLegacy, of a young, emaciated polar bear struggling to survive on Somerset Island, Nunavut, Canada.Despite the statements made in the article, the story itself fails to provide substantive evidence to back up its’ claim that the reason for this bear’s death was caused directly by climate change. In a subsequent interview with CBC Radio,  Cristina Mittermeier, the co-founder of SeaLegacy, elaborated on the reasons for shooting the video. She also openly stated that the exact reason for the bear’s death was “irrelevant.”“Conservation group SeaLegacy has released video of an emaciated polar bear near the Baffin Islands. They say climate change has led the animal to starvation.” (SeaLegacy/Caters News)“We hear from scientists that in the next 100 to 150 years, we’re going to lose polar bears.” – Mittermeier“We wanted the world to see what starvation of a majestic animal like this looks like.” – Mittermeier“It is impossible to tell why he was in that state. Maybe it could’ve been because of an injury or disease.” – MittermeierBased on her statements, Mittermeier has made it clear that in the case of a dying polar bear on Somerset Island, facts are not of importance; hyperbole and emotional manipulation are of greater concern.Dr. Susan Crockford at Polar Bear Science has just published a well-written blog post that challenges this SeaLegacy story. Dr. Crockford is a Canadian zoologist who has studied polar bear ecology and evolution for over 20 years. In her blog post, Dr. Crockford provides substantial references to support her statements.Listed below are additional articles and videos relevant to this topic.Available via the Wiley Online Library is an article published in the journal Ecology and Evolution. This article argues that much of the scientific evidence indicating that polar bear populations are declining due to climate change is likely flawed by poor data sampling and inaccurate population models.York, J., Dowsley, M., Cornwell, A., Kuc, M., Taylor, M. (2016), Demographic and traditional knowledge perspectives on the current status of Canadian polar bear subpopulations. Ecology and Evolution, 6: 2897-2924.Available via the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) is a paper submitted by Friends of Science Society’s Michelle Stirling. The paper deconstructs the framing of climate change in relation to polar bears, addressing influences in financial markets and the value of internet forums. It also specifically addresses the death of Knut the polar bear in the Berlin Zoo.Stirling, M. (2017), Cult of the climate change polar bear: Knut is dead, long live Knut. SSRN.A supplement to the above article is a short video summarizing the cause of Knut’s death while in captivity at the Berlin Zoo. Scientists determined that Knut’s death was related to him suffering from a form of encephalitis.Purely for educational purposes, a clip from BBC Earth of a female polar bear hunting a seal.The plight of a starving polar bear is unfortunately being exploited by activists to advance their agendas and encourage financial donations. These activists can assume to be “experts” in the fields in which they choose to operate, but upon closer scrutiny they can be exposed as uninformed or even contradictory in their statements.As always, Friends of Science Society invites you to take advantage of our balanced, objective and referenced scientific knowledge to make informed decisions on matters that concern you.[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['arctic', 'climate change', 'psychological manipulation']",2017/12/11

Catherine McKenna on #PoweringPastCoal at #COP23," Opinion- Contributed by Michelle Stirling © Nov 2017Part ThreeMinister McKenna ostensibly went to COP23 to defend Canada’s ‘slow start’ in meeting emissions targets. [1]  Certainly, Bonn was an odd place to try and initiate a #PoweringPastCoal campaign as Germany is a vast consumer of coal, oil and natural gas – one of the largest importers of these in the world according to the World Nuclear Association’s country profile.Of course, that is not the place to try and garner support for a coal phase-out, as reported by Spencer Fernando, Germany won’t budge.[2] Fernando reports that: “As noted by Mining.com, “Germany, in turn, which for years has been seen as a world leader in the fight against carbon emissions and pollution, still gets 40% of its energy from coal, a larger share than most other European countries, data from Eurostat show. The reality is so despite the Angela Merkel’s administration has invested billions in renewable energy and it means that Germany will miss its goal of cutting 40% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Currently, official figures show that number is likely to fall to little more than 30%.””Germany is generally seen as the great ‘green’ empire, but what’s behind that ‘clean’ front? Wind and solar are VAST consumers of all fossil fuel products in their development, installation and operation.If they are to be operated on an existing power grid, wind and solar require 24/7 conventional power generation back-up because they are intermittent – wind is at the mercy of Mother Nature’s whims and solar works only by day, and only if not too cloudy, rainy or snowy.  Wind and solar radically surge and dip in energy output – meaning spinning reserves must be ‘at the ready’ to take over when the wind drops off or surges, or night falls – which means fossil fuels (typically natural gas) are being used all the time!Vaclav Smil points out in his book “Energy Myths and Realities” that solar insolation is deceptive and thus solar is not a ‘one size fits all’ solution. “The sun-drenched tropics, for example, turn out to be not that sunny….. Coastal Nigeria, Brazilian Amazon receive less radiation than Georgia or Kansas; …all densely populated regions of South East Asian from China’s southernmost provinces to Sumatra and Kalimantan, have annual insolation comparable to that of northern France and southern England – locales that are not usually perceived as “sun-drenched.””Germany has added some 90 Gigawatts, combined, of wind and solar. This barely dents their peak power demand and they’ve had to add more coal plants to ensure reliable power! Many German industries have suffered severe damage from power intermittencies – some have opted to build their own power generation plants, meaning the burden of cost of the massive infrastructure falls back onto consumers.And Germany still runs on conventional power – principally coal. The above graph shows the lack of wind and solar during peak demand in Germany in January 2017; the graph below shows the actual sources of electrical power generation during that same month. Brown and hard coal make up the bulk of power generation.Source: Live and historical updates at: https://www.energy-charts.de/power.htm (check ‘all sources’ to see a graph similar to that above; select by date in left navigation bar)As more wind and solar is added to the grid, typically above 10% capacity, whatever complementary benefit is lost, and carbon dioxide emissions often go UP! Further, if a country is lucky enough to have hydro for back-up, it is possible to negligently empty hydro reserves while trying to create a “100% renewable” scenario of wind and hydro – leading to economic catastrophe such as that of Tasmania. [1] [2] Or worse…Venezuela.[3]  Why so? Hydro is also highly dependent on Mother Nature.  A dry year combined with dedicated back up of intermittent wind can draw down reserves to dangerous lows.It is curious timing that just prior to COP23, the Minister met with a Canadian company on her UK trip, which has a billion euros invested in renewables.  That makes us think that #PoweringPastCoal is more about green crony capitalists pushing an agenda on poor developing nations.While certainly, the collapse of the renewables subsidies in the EU and UK are going to really hurt those investors…and ultimately hurt Canadians and probably various banks world-wide, it is obvious that such subsidies and proliferation of wind/solar are unsustainable anywhere.Many public groups have reached similar conclusions.  We urge the public and policy-makers to review this information.Not only are “hard things hard to do,” Minister McKenna, they should be preceded by the simpler thing – a full cost-benefit analysis and feasibility study. Without it, #PoweringPastCoal is a recipe for global chaos and economic disaster.To review this three part series:Part 1, Part 2, Part 3________ Additional resources:Wind Aware Ireland just issued a new report. “Ireland is facing serious economic challenges due to their renewables program.  A key point made in this Nov. 2017 report from Wind Aware is that there was a lack of cost-benefit analysis prior to embarking on their renewables campaign, and CO2 reductions are nominal vis a vis the costs.  Please read the full report to appreciate their perspective.” LINK to full report: Costs of Wind Energy in Ireland, Nov. 2017 https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/59534715/costs-of-wind-energy-reportIn 2014, FinAdvice issued “Lessons Learned” which was written by renewables advocates, who were clear thinking enough to outline the faults and challenges of Germany’s energy transition program. http://catskillcitizens.org/learnmore/germany_lessonslearned_final_071014.pdfVaclav Smil has numerous publications on the pitfalls and potential of various energy options.In 2004, J.A.

After the last bad El Niño drought, in 2010, the government did almost nothing to revamp. It commissioned a small number of diesel-fuelled power plants, which were slow to reach completion, and one new natural-gas plant, which can—but doesn’t—churn out four per cent of the country’s electricity.” …” When any single source of fuel accounts for even a third of the power flowing into a grid, the security of that system is difficult to guarantee.

Catherine McKenna on #PoweringPastCoal at #COP23," Opinion – Contributed by Michelle Stirling © Nov. 2017Part TwoMcKenna says she has a climate plan. Even iPolitics says: “She should prove it.” Frankly, we doubt that the Minister has a plan. If she has, we’d also like to see the cost-benefit analysis.The Minister speaks enthusiastically about the “clean” alternatives and spouts about wind, solar and natural gas.  Is she so misinformed that she doesn’t realize changing out coal-fired plants for natural gas costs billions of dollars?  Even if the coal-fired power plant can be converted to natural gas, you need to order these special natural gas turbines to suit your needs.  As Manitoba energy expert and author Vaclav Smil pointed out in a lecture at McGill University for the Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design, there are only a handful of companies in the world that make gas turbines.  These are high precision units that take time to build, test and install.  And they cost millions of dollars.Furthermore, once you have a gas turbine, you need gas pipeline infrastructure – hooked up to a suitable source of natural gas.  More billions of dollars for infrastructure.  If you are not as lucky as natural gas-rich Alberta, you will have to import natural gas.  You may have to order LNG tankers from some distant place like Qatar, like England did during its winter 2013 power crisis (because it had phased-out most coal plants – in fact it had to restart a shuttered coal plant to make it through).Then you need an appropriate LNG terminal, storage…etc, etc, etc.  Billions and billions and billions of dollars.Where will poor countries get this money from?By contrast, if people have a sack of coal and a fireplace or grate, they will be set. Though this is not the optimal use of coal in terms of health, it is the way the West developed and liberated peasants from hours of scavenging for wood and dung.And if your country has a natural gas plant, for Pete’s sake, stop there. Adding wind and solar will only cause carbon dioxide emissions to rise and of course, the more wind and solar you add, the more conventional natural gas plants you will have to add. As you can see from this short discussion, the Minister’s ‘plan’ faces enormous challenges. I don’t think any critical thinking has gone into it.  Poor countries cannot adopt such measures unless the West finances them to the hilt – even then – there will not be sufficient natural gas infrastructure to go around for years and years. Not to mention, this is a case of transferring massive amounts of Western funds to developing nations on a scale that would bankrupt the West and in the meantime, would not address the desperate needs of sufficient food, basic sanitation, pumped well water – many of which can be met with simpler local solutions.Certainly, wind and solar, except in selective applications, are not the answer. Why not? Isn’t wind and solar ‘free’?  Haven’t prices come down? Aren’t they on a par with coal?No. No. And no.See Part ThreePart 1, Part 2, Part 3~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'coal', 'decarbonization', 'Ontario', 'Uncategorized']",2017/11/29

Catherine McKenna on #PoweringPastCoal at #COP23," Opinion – Contributed by Michelle Stirling © Nov. 2017Part OneAt the recent #COP23 Conference of the Parties (to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), the Hon. Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change for Canada, took the lead to announce the development of an alliance called #PoweringPastCoal – saying to CBC The National that: “hard things are hard” …to do, but she declared there are viable alternatives now and that “the market has moved on.”  It’s so funny with CBC, hard to know when they are reporting or just repeating. Whatever the case, Rosemary Barton asked no hard questions about how hard it would be to reach this quest for the “Holy Grail” of coal-less-ness world-wide. Not to mention that most of the members of the #PoweringPastCoal alliance are countries that already use very little coal.http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1095255619950Embed Code:<iframe src=”//www.cbc.ca/i/caffeine/syndicate/?mediaId=1095255619950″ width=”1143″ height=”” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe> We reject the Minister’s statements on several grounds, some of which are addressed in our responsive video.  This blog will provide more detail and references supporting our position.It is concerning that the Minister seems to want to pick a fight with dozens of other countries that rely on coal for industry, economy, power and light. Many of these countries have millions of people who are desperately poor. Coal has given them industry, jobs and source of heat and light, albeit with air pollution concerns in places that use old coal technology or if coal is burned on open grates.  But ground level pollution in these countries is more caused by the open flame burning of biomass – dung, wood, garbage. People do this due to the lack of central power for cooking, as well as the lack of home heating, water and sanitation systems.https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/EG.ELC.COAL.ZSAnd some of these coal-burning countries are extremely large and powerful players – several are trade partners of Canada. Is it really our place to tell other countries what their energy policies should be?  Especially when such sovereign rights are protected under the UN Charter and WTO.  And, is it even technically feasible to consider phasing out Terawatts of coal power?  BOE reports that there are line-ups of loaded coal trucks, 80 miles long, waiting to deliver their load from Mongolia to China.In her CBC and CTV interviews, McKenna said: “The market has moved on” meaning that one way the West is trying to block coal use as affordable, reliable energy (that is driving competition from developing nations) is that Western banks and the World Bank are working together to block financing for coal plants in developing nations. This is a terribly discriminatory practise that should make every Social Justice Warrior shout – but the SJWs are too busy counting their offsets as they fly between climate conferences, busy saving the planet.Former diplomat and public servant Robert Lyman writes about this crime against humanity in “Saving the World on the Backs of the Poor.”But poor nations are not the only ones that will suffer from Western bankers and investors blocking coal.Canadian coal-producing provinces will also be decimated.  In Alberta, where coal is often providing more than 70% of the baseline power and where industry and commercial operations consume ~75% of the power generated, wind and solar will not cut it.Here’s a reminder of why.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/11/28/life-without-fossil-fuels/,Brian Johnston ,Life Without Fossil Fuels," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant who was a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years.Many people, and especially among the young, believe the theory that humans are causing catastrophic global warming. They assert that Canadians must soon eliminate all uses of fossil fuels – oil, natural gas and coal. Thus, for example, the current controversies about whether and where to build new crude oil pipeline systems often include statements by the opponents of such projects that we do not need another single one, regardless of economic considerations. To me, this view betrays a profound misunderstanding of the role that energy plays in people’s lives today. In this note, I will offer what I hope is a helpful explanation of that role. Almost everything associated with our modern way of life depends on the use of energy. Before 1860, for example, people had to do far more work just to do simple things like cooking, making a living and moving. To go somewhere on land, you walked, used a bicycle or horse-drawn carriage or, where tracks were available, took a train pulled by a wood-fired steam engine. People cooked over wood-burning stoves and hauled water for drinking. There were few indoor toilets and people lit their homes with candles or lanterns that used whale oil. Everything took much longer to do. The discovery of large oilfields and of ways to produce from them in the late 19th century, followed by the invention of the internal combustion engine to power cars and trucks in the early part of the 20th century, revolutionized the way people and goods moved. The invention around the same time of electricity and of ways to transport and apply electricity for lighting and heating allowed the application of energy to hundreds of new uses, a process that goes on today. Energy made work easier and allowed a massive increase in economic activity (investment, employment and trade) that improved living standards and expanded people’s choices of what to do and how to spend their time.Today, about 86% of the energy used in the world comes from fossil fuels. The rest comes from a variety of sources, the most important of which are nuclear energy, hydro-electricity and traditional biomass (wood and dried animal dung). New renewables, like wind and solar energy, account for about one per cent.  The proportions are different in countries like Canada, where fossil fuels account for only about 80%, but still by far the majority.People use energy in different ways, of course. Some energy is used directly for its heat or power value. Some energy is used in a “secondary” form, as the result of converting basic energy sources through power generation into electricity. Finally, energy is used indirectly, in the sense that the products we use are the results of energy that was used to make it and deliver it to us. An example of indirect, or embedded, energy use is the manufacturing and sale of a simple cotton t-shirt. Energy is needed to grow and harvest the cotton on farms; transport it to a factory; make, package and transport the chemicals used to bleach, dye, or condition the cotton; run the machines on which the t-shirt is processed; create packaging materials; ship the t-shirt to the store; and keep the heat on in the store. If one used a more complex product like a camera or cell-phone, the list of indirect energy uses would be much longer.Ironic that this t-shirt could not exist without fossil fuels. Each of the fossil fuels has unique characteristics that determine its usefulness. Oil has a very high energy density, in the sense that it offers a high amount of power compared to its weight and volume, and it is relatively easy and safe to transport and store. This makes oil an ideal source for transportation. Consequently, almost all (over 98%) of the energy used in cars, trucks, locomotives, marine vessels and aircraft is based on refined oil products. It is technically possible to use other energy sources, but usually far more expensive. Natural gas similarly has comparatively high energy content but it takes up much larger volume and it is more expensive to transport and to store. This makes it a good source of energy for stationary uses like heating buildings or powering electrical generation. Natural gas has an additional advantage of having in it very few contaminants that would reduce air quality; it is a clean-burning fuel.Table from Cambridge Prof. Michael J. Kelly’s paper shows relative energy density of different sources discussing how wind and solar do not address climate change and do not have the energy return on energy invested to support even basic society, let alone one of high culture and aviation.Oil and natural gas are also extremely important sources of feedstock (i.e. building materials) for petroleum and petrochemical products. Without them, we would not have access to hundreds of products that most people consider either essential or highly valuable for modern life. The examples are almost endless, but allow me to cite a few that young people might miss if they were gone – televisions, cell phones, computers, most clothes and footwear, refrigerators, air conditioners, hand lotion and cosmetics, antiseptics, deodorant, purses, panty hose, eyeglasses, luggage, and credit cards. Without oil and natural gas, farmers would have no modern fertilizers, so food production would decline significantly. There would be no plastic products to supply a huge range of things varying from water pipes to ice cube trays. Life as we know it would have much less variety.Image licensed from Shutterstock – See Keep Canada in the BlackCoal is also high in energy content, but it is heavier and has many more impurities combined with it, so that burning it in ways that do not impair local air quality is more expensive. However, coal is by far the most plentiful fossil fuel energy resource on the planet. Coalfields can be found in most of the world’s countries, and currently exploitable reserves could, at present rates of consumption, last over 3000 years. For many countries, the lure of coal is that it is plentiful, secure and cheap, traits that are highly valued in places where people cannot afford more expensive energy options. So, what would happen to Canada’s current economy if we tried to stop using fossil fuels too quickly, before other energy sources were available at affordable cost and with reliable technology? We can get a glimpse of this by examining the current data on greenhouse gas emissions for fossil fuel consumption, as published by Environment and Climate Change Canada in its most recent National Inventory Report. The following table shows Canada’s emissions by sector for 2015 in terms of megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e). Table 1Canadian Greenhouse Gas emissions by Sector (Mt CO2)            Sector                                     Emissions                               PercentageStationary Combustion(Energy)                                      328                                             45Transport                                   202                                             28Fugitive Sources                         57                                                8Agriculture                                  59                                                8Industry                                      51                                                7Waste                                          25                                                3Total                                          722                                             100 Of the stationary sources, mining and upstream oil and gas production constitute 105 Mt CO2e, and fugitive sources (all from fossil fuels production and transportation) constitute another 57 Mt CO2e. So, if Canada completely eliminated all production of oil, natural gas, coal and mining products like nickel, uranium, bauxite, and gold, we would reduce our total GHG emissions by 162 Mt CO2e, or 22.4 % of the total. That would still leave 560 Mt CO2e, or 77.6%, of the way to go. In the process, of course, we would shut down most of the economic activity, investment and employment in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Northwest Territories and do significant harm to the mining communities in every province and territory. Shutting down Canada’s production of fossil fuels and mining products would not end our consumption of fossil fuels, either directly or indirectly. What would tackling that mean? Well, the largest energy consuming sector is transportation, where oil-fueled vehicles and other modes constitute about 98% of consumption. People like to hope that electric cars will catch on, but up to now, they constitute only 1.5% of new car sales, even with government subsidies of up to $14,000 per vehicle. Would we really be able to eliminate all cars and force people to go back to the era before cars? Would you be glad to go everywhere by foot, bicycle, or (if you were lucky) by bus at all times and in all weather conditions? The fastest growing source of emissions is commercial trucks. There are no electric-powered trucks even on the horizon. How would we move products around the country if we eliminated the trucks? The most emissions-intensive mode of transportation is aviation. How would Canadian react if they could no longer fly, but had to take trains or buses to move across the country (noting that both trains and buses run on oil products, too)?Snowbirds would be “No Birds” – World travel by walking, biking, back to sailing ships.Most of the stationary energy emissions not in the energy sector are in emissions-intensive industries. These include petrochemicals and manufacturing of automobiles and trucks, steel, iron, aluminium, cement and other products. We could eliminate 43 Mt CO2e in emissions if we shut down these plants, but that would also eliminate many of the best-paying jobs in the country. How would organized labour respond to that? Much of the emissions in other sectors are the result of indirect, or “embedded”, energy use and emissions. In fact, according to studies in the United States, 46% of the total energy use in North America is indirect. A study by the American Enterprise Institute in 2008 broke this down in terms of sectors of the economy. The results, as percentages of embedded energy use, are shown in table 2. Table 2 Indirect Energy Use by Category            Activity                                   Percent of Indirect Energy ConsumptionHealth care                                                      27.5Food                                                                 23.7Transportation                                                12.0Housing                                                              9.9Entertainment                                                   5.8Clothing and shoes                                            3.7Financials                                                           3.4Beauty                                                                2.9Religion                                                              2.8Education                                                           1.5 The purpose of the U.S. study was to determine where people could economize on their energy usage, not cut it out entirely. However, the global warming catastrophe theory, we are told, requires that we end all fossil fuel emissions. Using the U.S. study as a guide would therefore mean that people should either stop or cut back heavily on the production and use of pharmaceuticals, restaurant meals, use of drugs and physician services, use of premade meals and beverages, grain and meat products, air travel, and household cleaners. Some people may think those are great ideas, and they would certainly take us all back to an earlier era. Evans tried living off grid – had a nervous breakdown. Found it to be cold, boring and very hard work…all the time.It might sound romantic to go back to the style and standard of living that people had in the 1860’s, but Canada did not have to support and employ a population of 35 million then. We may be able to cut back gradually and in ways that allow us to maintain our current standard of living, if in fact that proves necessary given the nature of the global problem. Perhaps, instead, a proper balance of fuels depends on the relative costs and advantages of fossil fuels versus others, and the challenge is to reach the right balance.~~~~[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”] Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'decarbonization', 'Uncategorized']",2017/11/28

The goal is to generate an annual return of 8%-14%.”  This is a very high rate of return likely only attainable due to large government subsidies and long-term contracts, as explained below. To place this return in context, consider that recently Blackrock warned that mutual fund returns would be in the 4% mark for the next decade, much less than the projected 7-10%.[3]  The interview with Larry Fink of Blackrock indicates that pension funds will be significantly underfunded as they typically look for about a 7% return.  Many funds incurred huge losses in the 2008 mortgage collapse; these were further complicated by reported 9.7% annualized losses (by CalPERS) in clean-tech investments as reported in 2013 in the Wall Street Journal in an interview with Joseph Dear, then CIO.[4] [5]The Toronto Star reported on May 19, 2017 that it was concerned that the initiative for an infrastructure bank was being rushed through and buried in the back pages of a very lengthy budget.[6] Further, the Globe and Mail had concerns about how Canadian taxpayers’ money might be used by such a bank, but not necessarily to Canadians’ benefit.[7]  Likewise, as early as May 2017, opposition party members such as Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre and NDP finance critic Alexandre Boulerice raised similar concerns that the process may have had undue influence from potential beneficiaries such as Blackrock.[8] Likewise, NDP critic Nathan Cullen has raised concerns about transparency.[9]Our interest in this topic relates to how public policies, subsidies and investments are being driven by climate change ideology that is founded in outdated information on climate science. Climate change policies related to wind and solar ends up creating burdensome debt and long-term subsidy commitments, forced on taxpaying citizens, while garnering stable, long-term profits for certain investors who have select beneficiaries (often union pension funds). Subsidies to wind, solar and biofuels in Canada are in the billions of dollars with nominal energy returns.[10] In our opinion, an infrastructure investment bank has the potential to literally enslave Canadians to paying for various ‘popularized’ but uneconomic public infrastructure initiatives like high speed rail, electric vehicle charging networks, etc. – initiatives which are generally not supportable on economic, environmental or climate change grounds due to Canada’s sparse population and weather extremes, but which may pay significant dividends to the infrastructure bank partners at the expense of Canadians.In our review of climate science issues, we have found that since at least 2005, the scientific community formally acknowledged that the radiative forcing theory (Greenhouse gas theory of human-caused warming) was flawed and that global warming was not rising dangerously as previously predicted, despite a rise in carbon dioxide.[11] The Trump administration in the US has adopted this view.[12] [13] But the investment community continues to claim that ‘dangerous warming’ is occurring and investors say that thus corporations MUST comply with United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment directives on climate risk reporting, and thus invest accordingly – typically in wind and solar infrastructure.Prof. Michael J. Kelly of Cambridge indicated in a peer-reviewed paper in 2016 that wind and solar cannot meet the economical threshold to support even basic society and that they do not address climate change.[14]  However, we find that the institutional investment community remains deeply committed to both wind and solar investments and spouting ‘dangerous’ climate rhetoric that does not reflect current scientific understanding of climate uncertainties.The challenge with wind and solar investments, for ordinary citizens, is that they typically incur very long-term fixed subsidies that make power prices burdensome to the average citizen – enriching institutional investors which have select beneficiaries. We are disturbed to see that unions have been funding environmental groups to push politicians and the public to agree to more and more wind and solar projects.  This appears to be a form of circular self-dealing.You can see how this effect of long-term payments would be significantly amplified if an infrastructure bank were set up in Canada.  People could literally be forced into peonage to pension funds.We find that there is already a worrisome trend of meddling in public policy and politics by ‘activist’ institutional investors, in effect creating conditions of self-dealing at the expense of, and without the agreement of the electorate.  We refer to this example in Alberta.NEI letter to premier:  https://www.neiinvestments.com/documents/PublicPolicyAndStandards/2015/Premier%20of%20Alberta%20Collaborative%20Investor%20Letter.pdfWe have also written the Ontario Securities Commission with our concerns about the UNPRI attempting to force Canadian companies to comply with their ‘climate risk disclosure’ policy. http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/30/letter-to-ontario-securities-commission-in-response-to-the-unpri-letter-on-climate-disclosure-review/Please review our recent reports to appreciate our concerns on this matter. http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/02/01/new-reports-challenge-share-on-climate-change-risk-and-denial-for-pension-fund-trustees-and-corporate-boards/We are concerned about potential conflicts of interest associated with these matters.Thank you for your attention.Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETY[1] http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/agf-retains-veteran-for-new-push-into-infrastructure-investing[2] “Morneau also held another 42,186 common shares in AGF Management Limited, an investment firm, worth about $474,000, that he received as part of his compensation package for serving as a director over the past 15 years.”http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/morneaus-corporate-holdings-hold-potential-conflicts-for-cabinet-post[3] https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/blackrock-chair-larry-fink-tells-investors-to-only-expect-a-4-percent-investment-return-with-a-balanced-portfolio.html[4] https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324557804578374980641257340[5] http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/california-pension-fund-loses-millions-on-green-tech-a-noble-way-to-lose-money/article/2525683[6] https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2017/05/19/liberals-should-not-push-through-infrastructure-bank-without-debate-editorial.html[7] Institutional investors – Canada – they’re just not into you…only your pockets  https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-table-budget-bill-to-join-chinas-asian-infrastructure-bank/article36758568/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&cmpid=rss1&click=sf_globe[8] https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-gave-investors-extraordinary-control-over-infrastructure-bank-opposition/article34910106/[9] http://www.nationalpost.com/liberals+fast+track+system+infrastructure+bank+approvals/13929168/story.html[10] http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/11/05/subsidies-to-solar-and-wind-energy-in-canada-an-inventory/[11] https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11175/radiative-forcing-of-climate-change-expanding-the-concept-and-addressing[12] https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-115-SY-WState-JChristy-20170329.pdf[13] https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/curry-house-science-testimony-mar-17.pdf[14] https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-energy-and-sustainability/article/lessons-from-technology-development-for-energy-and-sustainability/2D40F35844FEFEC37FDC62499DDBD4DC/core-reader[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”PayPal Donation”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon tax', 'climate change', 'decarbonization', 'energy subsidies', 'Paris Agreement', 'Uncategorized']",2017/11/24
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/11/24/climate-change-film-the-uncertainty-has-settled-wins-best-feature-documentary-in-paris/,songhees ,Climate change film “The Uncertainty Has Settled” wins Best Feature Documentary in Paris,"  (PARIS) The controversial documentary “The Uncertainty Has Settled” by filmmaker Marijn Poels won his third award for Best Documentary last night at the Independent Film Festival in Paris.The documentary, which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival, already won awards in Los Angeles and Berlin.According the jury, the film was chosen because it encourages independent thinking and the story serves as a powerful crowbar for opening the debate. “The Uncertainty Has Settled” tackles the sensitive discussion about climate change and energy.In the film, Poels mainly is visiting farmers in the German state of Saxony Anhalt who suffer from European regulations. Due to a failing agricultural policy and the billions of subsidies for the production of green energy, many farmers have become energy suppliers…instead of food producers.Poels asks critical questions about climate, science and politics. … Are we actually doing well?In recent months Poels toured with his film throughout Europe and experienced heated discussions in the cinemas.“It is an extremely sensitive theme” says Poels. “The film has a lot of resistance and assistance at the same time. There is division, not only in the social but also in the scientific debate. We will pay enormous costs for CO2 reduction.”Therefore Poels stands for a healthy and open debate.In January Poels starts production of his sequel. The filmmaker is planning a trilogy.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/11/21/the-gap-between-reality-and-wishful-thinking-on-canadian-ghg-reduction-targets/,,The Gap Between Reality and Wishful Thinking on Canadian GHG Reduction Targets," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior.Before and after the recent COP 23 Conference in Bonn, Germany, Canadian politicians made several statements about the progress that Canada is making in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and about their confidence that, through international collaboration, the goals set for future emissions reduction will be met. The media rarely, if ever, focuses on what these claims mean in terms of quantitative emissions reductions or sectoral impacts.Global News story link belowTo offer some insights into these matters, I thought it would be useful to review the projections of Canada’s future GHG emissions as published by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and published in Canada’s Second Biennial Report on Climate Change. That report, published in 2016, was based upon a prior ECCC report entitled, National Inventory Report: Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada 1990-2013.https://globalnews.ca/news/3854395/mckenna-heads-to-germany-to-defend-canadas-slow-start-on-emissions-targets/ The Targets Canada’s GHG emissions in 1990 were 591 megatonnes (Mt). They rose to 749 Mt in 2005 and then to 726 Mt in 2013. Successive Canadian governments have established targets for future emissions reduction using 2005 as the formal base year. Thus, the target for 2020 is a 17% reduction below 2005 levels, or 622 Mt, and that for 2030 is a 30% reduction below 2005 levels, or 524 Mt. Some provincial governments have established much more demanding targets. Projected Emission Levels In the Second Biennial Report, ECCC modelers presented their projections of future emissions in total and by economic sector using the business–as-usual, or “under current measures” scenario. This is a way to show what currently approved and implemented policy and program measures will achieve and the size of the “gaps” that will potentially be filled by future policy and program measures.The projections by economic sector are summarized in my table 1. Table 1EMISSIONS PROJECTIONS BY ECONOMIC SECTOR (Mt)Sector 2005   2013   20202030Oil and gas157179210242Electricity121857458Transportation169170169164EITE*897690107Buildings878696109Agriculture71757476Waste and others54545459Total749726768815*Emissions Intensive IndustriesThese projections are notable for a few reasons. Under current policies, Canada will fail to meet the emission reduction targets set for 2020 and 2030.  Indeed, emissions will continually grow from current levels. This is exactly what has been our experience with previous targets. ECCC foresees a sizable reduction in the emissions associated with electricity generation due to the elimination of coal-fired power plants. It also projects a modest decline in transportation emissions due to fuel efficiency regulations and some optimistic assumptions about the future penetration of electric vehicle technology. Apart from this, emissions are projected to be stable or growing in all sectors. Sectoral Trends It is easy to see the “villain” of this particular story. If one considers the projected changes in emissions over the period 2005 to 2030, total emissions would grow by 66 Mt, but emissions from oil and gas production would grow by 85 Mt, thereby offsetting whatever emissions reductions occur in the other sectors. This goes a long way to explaining why the oil and gas industry is the target of so much adverse attention from the environmentalist community. The assumptions underlying this projection are that conventional oil production will decline slightly from today’s levels by 2030, but natural gas production will rise from 6.45 trillion cubic feet  (tcf) in 2013 to 7.44 tcf in 2030, and oil sands production will rise from 2.1 million barrels per day (mmb/d) in 2013 to 4.3 mmb/d in 2030. Emissions from electricity generation are projected to decline from 85 Mt in 2005 to 58 Mt in 2030, with coal-related emissions dropping from 64 Mt in 2013 to 24 Mt in 2030 (but still occurring, contrary to policy statements). Emissions from natural gas-fired generation are projected to almost double from 16 Mt in 2013 to 30 Mt in 2030. This will clearly attract a great deal of policy attention in future. Emissions from passenger transportation (cars, trucks, buses, rail and aviation) are projected to decline from 185 Mt in 2013 to 138 Mt in 2030. (This comes under the heading of “I will believe it when I see it.”), while emissions from freight transport are projected to rise from 118 Mt in 2013 to 141 Mt in 2030, based presumably upon the expectation that that the economy will grow. Emissions intensive industries include mining, smelting and refining of metals, pulp and paper, iron and steel, cement, lime and gypsum, and chemicals and fertilizers producers. Emissions from these industries are projected to grow from 76 Mt in 2013 to 107 Mt in 2030, with the largest growth occurring in chemicals and fertilizers. Emissions from residential and commercial buildings are projected to grow from 86 Mt in 2013 to 109 Mt in 2030, with most of that occurring in the commercial sector, as residences may be affected by stringent (and costly) new building codes. The Gaps The estimated gap between the “under current measures” scenario and the 2020 target is 146 Mt, which would increase to 291 Mt by 2030. The 2030 gap, in other words, is equivalent to more than Canada’s total 2013 emissions from energy production, including every oil and gas facility and every electricity generator.  Further, that’s just the beginning. The federal targets notionally accepted in international discussions for 2050 would include 50 to 70% reductions in emissions from 2005 levels by 2050, or emissions levels of 363 Mt or 218 Mt. The transformation of the Canadian energy economy that would be required to meet these targets is extraordinary. Attaining such a transformation would require far more stringent and costly measures than any of those experienced or even discussed to date.  Having the numbers at hand may, one hopes, allow Canadians better to grasp what lies ahead if the country stays on its current policy path.[give_form id=”5890″ show_title=”true” show_goal=”false” show_content=”above” display_style=”modal” continue_button_title=”Donate by PayPal”]Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'COP23', 'GHG reduction targets', 'Paris Agreement']",2017/11/21

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/11/19/cop-23-limiting-emissions-by-blowing-smoke/,David Heinze ,COP 23 – Limiting Emissions by Blowing Smoke," Contributed by Robert Lyman © Nov. 2017Robert Lyman is a former public servant of 27 years and a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.  He is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and frequent contributor to Friends of Science.Robert LymanThe 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the United Nations Climate Change Convention ended in Bonn on November 18 with a flurry of announcements about “progress” towards meeting the goals that were established at COP 21 in Paris in December 2015. In case everyone forgot, COP 21 agreed not to agree. The Paris “Agreement” failed to establish quantitative greenhouse gas emission targets or to ensure that participating countries might be held accountable in any way for achieving emissions reductions. It established only two real commitments  (and those only for the wealthier countries) – to put in place national plans to reduce emissions and to contribute to the Green Climate Fund. The Green Climate Fund is the fund that is supposed to help developing countries finance their climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In principle, it is to be funded at the level of at least U.S. $100 billion per year by 2020.  COP21, however, failed to establish a formula to determine each country’s contribution obligations or recipient rights, leaving a rather large set of issues unresolved. In the words of the concluding press release, the alleged purpose of COP 23 was, “to raise the current global ambition to act on climate change” and “to drive us further, faster and together to this destination”. The press release did not mention that the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, has decided to withdraw from the COP 21 Agreement, such as it is. Apparently a good time was had by all – saving the planet. So what exactly did the COP23 Conference achieve? Did it substantiate or refine any of the loose commitments made at COP21? No. Did it result in any firming up of commitments or agreed-upon rules governing the Green Climate Fund? No. Its “achievements” come down mainly to these: A number of European countries (Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway and Spain) announced financial contributions to various new UN funds – an “InsuResilience Initiative”, an Adaptation Fund, a water in developing countries fund, a forestry fund, and a few others)HSBC announced that it will organize $100 billion for private “green investment” by 2020The International Energy Agency will establish a 30 million euro “Clean Energy Transitions Program”, with the sources of the fund not identifiedVarious countries agreed that they would do better to “coordinate climate action”50 mayors pledged that their municipal governments will “implement more ambitious climate action”A new “Powering Past Coal Alliance”, including 25 countries, promised to work together to accelerate the phase-out of coal use. None of the largest producers or users of coal are members of the alliance. The final communiqué also noted the following “highlights”: A Gender Action Plan will be created to formally support the “crucial role of women in combating climate change”A Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples’ Platform will be established. This was described as “a political and practical achievement that aims to support the full and equal role of indigenous people in climate action, while recognizing the responsibility of governments to respect the rights of indigenous peoples in these decisions”.Launch of the Ocean Pathways Partnership that by 2020 “link climate action with healthy oceans”. The Powering Past Coal Alliance, Gender Action Plan, and Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples’ Platform are all initiatives that bear the fingerprints of the Canadian government and especially of the “crusading” Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, Catherine McKenna. The COP 23 agreement endorsed all the well-known progressive political themes. Reading this list of “accomplishments” should make one recognize that the international climate discussions have become far more about virtue signaling of the participating governments to their domestic political bases than they are about resolving any of the difficult financial and economic issues that confront any serious attempt to transform the world’s energy system. At the rate at which new processes and international institutions are being established, we can be sure that international conferences will proliferate in future. Except in a few industrialized countries like Canada and Germany where damage will be needlessly done to coal producers and consumers, the decisions made at COP 23 won’t result in major, seriously costly, action to reduce emissions. That is actually the good news coming out of COP 23. IMPORTANT: Please donate $5.00 or more to help us continue our work. Become a member!

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/11/18/cop23-a-new-failure/,,COP23 – A New Failure," Translation of an article originally published in French on Contrepoints:https://www.contrepoints.org/2017/11/18/303418-cop23-nouvel-echec We are witnessing a holy alliance between Third World ecologists and big finance, orchestrated by the European Union, under the amused gaze of the American giant who has now taken leave of all this masquerade.By Alain Préat, Henri Masson and Drieu Godefridi.The party of the ecologists in Bonn – COP23 – has wrapped up. The polar bear disguises will be stored until the next COP. The activists had to be content with the dullness of Bonn, not having had the pleasure of going to the  paradisaical Fiji islands, which presided over COP23 as ‘host nation,’ but lacked the infrastructure to accommodate the thousands of usual ecologist tourists. (Rest assured, these islands are doing well, they are in no danger of being submerged.)The umpteenth failure of the Conferences of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change no longer surprises anyone. Except for some of the implacable, such as the RTBF (Belgian public service) or France 2, the media have also not talked much about COP23. If you are curious enough to look outside of Europe, you will have noticed that this High-Mass disappointed audiences even before its launch. When you cry wolf everyday you become inaudible.THE ILLUSION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENTIn fact, apart from COP-21 that gave the illusion of success with the Paris Agreement – but that is in fact a total failure, because this agreement is empty, and an orphan since the American departure – each COP succeeds the other without anything concrete being decided.How could it be otherwise since limiting CO2 emissions can only be achieved by two means: the massive deployment of nuclear energy – a solution that COP ecologists stubbornly refuse – or by creating a recession, what the “deep” ecologists desire and advocate quite coherently but one that governments refuse because it would plunge our people into poverty and regression.Some people will console themselves by thinking that a handful of countries who joined #PoweringPastCoal alliance are committed to no longer using coal to produce electricity. Who signed this agreement? Belgium. Remember that the last Belgian coal power plant, that of Langerlo, closed in April 2016. Belgium has thus joined Luxembourg and Fiji … which do not consume coal.THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE UN PROCESSThe failure is not only that of these conferences but more generally the supposedly “green” policies. For those who are willing to admit it, we are witnessing the bankruptcy of the entire UN process.The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in June 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Since 1992, the signatories have been lost in words, in abstruse texts and in travels – generating so much CO2 emissions that are “offset” (a term that designates, as in religions, penance for the fault committed) financially by the taxpayers – while CO2 emissions increased over 54% in 25 years ! This says it all. To which these ecologists respond, as the Socialists have done for 150 years: without us, it would be worse! Fortunately being ridiculous won’t kill you…THE PROBLEM OF MONEYThe failure was so predictable that, even before this meeting, President Macron had already convened another meeting to try to save the Paris Agreement . While the official process since 1992 is that of the Conference Of the Parties-COP, France organized another meeting on the heart of the problem: money! Yes, it is this, in the end, where lies the hope of the world of finance so dear to the French president: to manipulate the hundred billion dollars A YEAR provided for in the Green Fund that the COP-19 had announced.As the late Prof. Istvan Marko said, this fund would transfer money from the pockets of Western middle classes to the bank accounts of wealthy leaders of less developed countries, especially African and Asian, through the big finance.GREEN ALLIANCE – BIG FINANCEThere is thus a holy alliance between the Third World ecologists and big finance, all orchestrated by the European Union, under the amused glance of the American giant who has now taken leave of all this masquerade.The polar bear disguises will come out in November 2019 in Katowice, which will host COP-24. The journalists of France 2 and the RTBF will book their plane ticket and the hotel to ensure that the Belgian and French people will again be terrified for 15 days. Katowice? Yes, the coal center of Poland. Which has not signed the declaration of  the #PoweringPastCoal alliance because it produces 84% of its electricity. Since Germany, that just hosted COP-23, produces 47% of its electricity from coal, COP-25 should take place in South Africa, which generates 94% of his electricity from the COP’s number one enemy.Thus the masquerade would reach cosmic proportions.~~~~About the Authors of the blog post:Alain Préat – Interview:Académie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique  http://www.academieroyale.be/cgi?lg=fr&pag=774&tab=87&rec=1319&frm=0—-Drieu Godefridi –   a classical-liberal Belgian author, is the founder of the l’Institut Hayek in Brussels.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/10/28/getting-around-in-canada-vast-distances-extreme-weather/,Jim Davidson ,"Getting Around in Canada-Vast Distances, Extreme Weather"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017 As fuel taxes and carbon taxes raise the price of transportation in Canada, will it get too expensive to drive your car or truck? And if so, what are your choices? What influences those choices?Even though climate change activists advocate walking and cycling everywhere to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve health, and they claim that these are somehow equal to driving or using public transit, here are the actual statistics for Canada (in 2012):82 % of people commuted to work by car,12 % took public transit (buses and subways),6% walked or cycled.Cycling unlikely in Canadian winters – Image licensed from ShutterstockRead also:You Can’t Get There from HereExtreme Weather Vancouver Island and the lower mainland of British Columbia are about the only exceptions to the brutal rule of severe winter temperatures and plenty of snow in most Canadian cities. In most cities, cycling becomes dangerous and often impossible. Everything slows down, except subway traffic.Commuters on average spend about 24 minutes going to work while people taking public transit spend 44 minutes. While many cyclists swear it is faster to cycle than sit in traffic, probably true in some cities, it still means cycling office workers face the awkward challenge of messy streets and extremes of weather, when they must arrive looking business-ready.Though climate change advocates call for greatly increased public transit or high-speed rail within major centres, the density of urban development in Canada varies considerably from city to city, making these programs too expensive for the number of potential users and taxpayers.Canada and Cars It is no accident that Canadians use personal vehicles for most of their transportation needs. We live in a large country with plenty of space and we have longed enjoyed the benefits of low cost, plentiful energy supplies. For over a century, since the inception of the car, Canada’s basic infrastructure has been built around the availability of cars. That, in turn, has affected urban design.One cannot assume away that infrastructure, or believe that increasing the cost of driving will suddenly make transit more available or cycling and walking more practical as alternatives. To try and force people away from cars and promote cycling, walking or public transit use, many large municipal governments have tried to create more “densified” cities. This often has had the tragic side effect of reducing the land available for new housing, raising housing costs, and forcing out the poor.Calgary, Alberta’s beautiful East Village – Built on a known flood plain.Nonetheless, there is an unrelenting demand by new homebuyers for residences in the suburbs often 40 km or more from city centres. If consumers are “allowed” to exercise their free choices, those movements to the suburbs will continue, because people here in Canada enjoy the benefits of more space (in their homes, in their yards, and in their neighbourhoods and play spaces).We are not Europeans.Source: https://www.mentorworks.ca/blog/market-trends/01-downsizing-to-optimize-living- space/Inter-City Travel For inter-city transportation, consumers’ choices include cars, buses, trains, and aircraft (or, in rare cases, boats). Travel surveys show that:96% of same-day trips are by car,2% are by bus,• the remainder are by air, rail or boat.For over-night trips or longer:78% are by car,7% are by plane,3% are by bus,1% was by train.Plane travel may be even more GHG-intensive than car travel. In Canada, train and bus service between cities is uneven and often with limited schedules. People rarely choose these over car travel – not to mention that both require another means of travel once at the destination. So, it is unlikely to draw many people out of cars unless the costs of car usage rise very sharply. My Car – My Freedom – My Choice Even when rates for parking and fuel rise, once a person has purchased a car and committed to paying the fixed costs of purchase, insurance, and maintenance, the incremental fuel costs are a small part of the total. Even if the costs of transit are very low and the costs of fuel rise sharply, the commuter is unlikely to change his or her habits because of cost considerations alone.Further, once people live in the suburbs, their children often need transportation to various clubs or sports events around the city. With a private vehicle, parents can pick up groceries or home handyman supplies, or carry the hockey team’s equipment to and from the rink. These things are impossible by public transit.In a democracy where freedom of choice is valued, Canadians should not have to justify their preference for cars. Personal choice is a right, and depriving people of that right has a cost. The burden of proof for trying to tax cars off the market (with associated loss in jobs in the auto sales, parts and maintenance sectors), should rest on the shoulders of those policy makers who try to institute a measure that will force Canadians out of their cars and onto mass transit or other forms of transportation.But…but…but.. Climate Change! Those who say that Canadians must get out of their cars to “save the planet” by reducing greenhouse gas emissions ignore the fact that cars and light duty trucks (i.e. SUVs) used for personal transportation in Canada account for just 11.5% of Canada’s emissions. Even major changes in our car use, including completely eliminating all personal vehicles, would have only a modest effect on national emissions. Canada itself constitutes only 1.6% of global emissions, and all the emissions growth is occurring elsewhere. Forcing people out of their cars in the name of the climate, in other words, is simply extremely expensive and pointless virtue signalling.Interesting interactive graphic available here:http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/06/infographic-what-do-your-countrys-emissions-look ~~~~Some references drawn from:http://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/files/pdf/The-high-price-of-low-emissions-benefits-and-costs-of-GHG- abatement-in-the-transportation-sector-February-2012.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['carbon dioxide', 'carbon tax', 'decarbonization', 'motor fuel', 'transportation', 'Uncategorized']",2017/10/28

During my years in the Third World, climate change issue was never a priority, it was a new thing for me. These are windmills for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction. Does that work? Why are they all here? Due to globalization, potato and milk production is no longer profitable for German farmers. The energy policy provides windmills. Farmers are taking their cows out of the pasture and replacing them with windmills. The energy transition in Germany has gone very quickly. After the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, all nuclear power plants in Germany had to close. Without nuclear energy and then coal, energy is rapidly becoming more expensive. In recent years, 300,000 families have seen their electricity shut off, because they could no longer pay their power bills. And I thought: are we doing the right thing with such a rapid transition, such a radical policy? As a documentary-maker, you must then dive into the scientific issues. And then I unearthed a whole community of climate critics. I found that really interesting. Because I did not know that there is also a dissenting view, one that is not being exposed.” R. Veelo: You approached a total of 53 climate scientists (to interview them). Why do we only see 3 in the movie?Marijn Poels: “I’ve been very open about my intentions, and I wrote that I also approached climate sceptics. For this I often had negative and even angry reactions. The position was always: “there is consensus on climate change. Man contributes to the change by the CO2 emissions. And there is no reason for doubt.” Eventually I have been able to speak with many climate scientists. Many also have their questions about the “consensus,” but they dare not to say them in the presence of others. Because then they would be rejected by the institute. And that means you would lose your salary and job. That’s not what people do. ” R. Veelo: Scientists who have been (forced to) shut up?Marijn Poels:  “Yes, I think it’s most frightening to hear from scientists in their sixties who are afraid to open their mouths. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Ed.) is a “holy organization” – you are not allowed to doubt it. If you do that, then you (are deemed to) doubt the fundamentals of science and the institute, and then you will no longer belong to the community. ” R. Veelo: How can so many well-trained people stay on track (inside) while fundamentally doubting the climate consensus?Marijn Poels: “Of course, I’m not a scientist, so I do not know what’s happening in the workplace. But I see in the social debate what Freeman Dyson says in my movie: almost everyone retires within their own tribe. Being right is not so important. It’s more important to belong to your club than to speak the truth. Everyone is busy saving the planet from climate change. Speaking out against the “consensus” immediately generates blame/accusations that you want to help destroy the world and cause collapse. Ultimately this policy is being paid for by the people in the developing countries. The small farmers end up going along with this policy (to survive).” R. Veelo: What is your movie about?Marijn Poels: “It’s a personal search. The main question I am asking:  Are we on the right track with this radical energy policy? The farmer who turns his farm into an energy provider. Is that sustainable? I come from a “left” paradigm to that movie, but I meet skeptics and find their story is nuanced (not so black and white), but I am not allowed (by the establishment ‘consensus’) to believe that. Leonardo Di Caprio proclaims the consensus. Al Gore proclaims the consensus and even the Pope: if you do not believe in (man-made) climate change, you have no home or place in the modern world.Who then am I to criticize?At the end of the movie I’m with 93-year-old scientist Freeman Dyson, who tells me how to deal with it. He tells you very clearly that things like climate change topic have become too political. If you have two political dogmas, science does not work anymore. Then it becomes a religion. ” “The Uncertainty Has Settled” can be rented online at Vimeo.<iframe src=”https://player.vimeo.com/video/191830278?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0 …” width=”640″ height=”268″ frameborder=”0″ webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=”https://vimeo.com/191830278 “>The Uncertainty Has Settled</a> from <a href=”https://vimeo.com/marijnpoels “>Marijn Poels</a> on <a href=”https://vimeo.com “>Vimeo</a>.</p>~~~~Please help Friends of Science Society continue to provide factual information on climate science and energy policies.  Become a Member or Donate now.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/10/26/taxing-motor-fuels-how-much-is-enough/,,Taxing Motor Fuels – How Much Is Enough?," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant, a former public servant of 27 years experience; prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.See also the full report and power point “If It Moves, Tax it” – links at end of this summary.The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the taxes now imposed on motor fuels in Canada, the likely path of those taxes in the near future, and the revenue consequences for governments.The prices of gasoline and diesel fuel vary considerable across Canada, both because of differences in the market prices (based on production, refining, transportation and marketing) costs and taxes. In May 2017 average gasoline prices ranged from $1.02 per litre in Manitoba to $1.18 per litre in Newfoundland. Diesel fuel prices ranged from $1.02 per litre in Manitoba to $1.19 per litre in Vancouver. Taxes account for 43 cents per litre of the Canadian average gasoline price and 36 cents per litre of the diesel fuel price. This is mostly federal and provincial excise taxes. In 2017, total taxes paid on gasoline and diesel fuel will be about $23.6 billion. The fastest growing fuel taxes are carbon taxes, scheduled to rise from $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018 to $50 per tonne in 2022. Carbon taxes per litre of gasoline will rise from 2 cents per litre in 2018 to 11 cents per litre in 2022. By 2022, that will add $200 to each car operator’s annual fuel cost. Carbon taxes may, however, rise to $300 per tonne, or 68 cents per litre, by 2050, adding about $1,200 per year to the annual average fuel bill. International studies of the social benefits of emissions reduction indicate that they are may be worth U.S. $25 per tonne. Below that cost, investments in emissions reduction are beneficial and should be made; spending more than that makes the world worse off. The taxes already on Canadian motor fuels already far exceed the socially justified carbon tax level. Raising the price of motor fuels tends to reduce the demand for them by somewhere between 20% (short term) and 80% (long term) of the percentage price increase. At the socially justified carbon charge of $U.S. 25 per tonne, the maximum carbon tax in Canada should be $31.68 per tonne or 7.3 cents per litre. The likely result would be a reduction in demand ranging from 1% to 5%. At a carbon tax of $300 per tonne, the price increase would be 58% and the demand reduction would range from 12% to 46%. The motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission regulations issued in 2014 will increase light duty vehicle fuel efficiency by 41% from 2010 to 2025 and for the first time cover heavy duty vehicles. By imposing regulations and carbon taxes, governments are forcing car operators to pay twice. This is not cost-effective.LINK to Power Point: If It Moves, Tax It Oct 26 2017 If It Moves, Tax It Oct 26 2017LINK to Full Report: TAXING MOTOR FUELS – HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH report FINAL Oct 25 2017~~~~Please help Friends of Science Society continue to provide factual information on climate science and energy policies.  Become a Member or Donate now.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/10/25/the-97-percent-should-sit-and-watch-it/,Ron Clutz ,The 97 percent should sit and watch it," Dutch journalist of RTL-Z, Roderick Veelo wrote an enthusiastic review of Marijn Poels’ independent documentary, “The Uncertainty Has Settled” which was screened in the European Parliament on Oct. 18, 2017.Poels is a young, left-wing independent filmmaker who has spent much of his life working in developing nations where food security is a crucial issue.  He returns home to Europe for a break, only to find that farmers are producing subsidies with wind farms instead of growing food and that climate change policies have turned common sense, food security, and economics upside down.Translation of this original report by Roderick Veelo:Ook 97 procent van de wetenschap kan er naast zittenEen synopsis van het gesprek met Poels hier en zijn documentaire daar.I had the privilege this week to speak with Dutch documentary maker Marijn Poels and to view his movie “The Uncertainty has settled”. A documentary I strongly recommend to anyone. If only because of the pleasure of hearing things that are rarely or never heard.Marijn Poels, filmmakerA synopsis of my interview with Poels is here- hier the documentary link- daar.The subject of the film is climate change. The consensus on human influence on science, politics and the media is so huge, that a different sound almost fails to penetrate into our daily lives.The general agreement on man-made climate change may well have produced Treaties from Kyoto to Paris, billions in investments and a climate minister, so the rare amazement and doubt feel like a breath of fresh air in this closed consensus.Because there is something here like imposed unanimity without contradiction. I do not know if the climate sceptics in Poels’ film are closer to the truth than the famous 97 percent (of their colleagues), but their story at least fascinating.I become even more curious about the hostility against these proper scientists – and anyone who dares to listen to them – share. A deviant analysis of the climate is apparently a serious offense.The accusation [by the self-proclaimed consensus group] is that a unified approach is undermined and questioning anything would lead to the salvation of the earth being under threat. Criticism on the consensus is a climate offense.The advantage of thus creating an enemy over just having a difference of opinion is that you do not have to talk to an enemy. We do not see an open debate between climate scientists with differing analyses, only suspicions and abusive language.The enforced harmony does not tolerate dissidents, but inevitably the enforced unanimity creates doubt and opposition.Freeman DysonThe final touch in Poels’ documentary is from the worthy American physicist Freeman Dyson (now aged 93). Dyson sees the social and scientific debate as a tribal struggle. It has common security as its priority. Dyson: “Whether you really are right does not matter. It’s more important to be part of the club than to speak the truth.”~~~~Please help Friends of Science Society continue to provide factual information on climate science and energy policies.  Become a Member or Donate now.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/10/22/the-carbon-dioxide-word-game/,Jeff Green ,The Carbon Dioxide Word Game," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017  Image licensed from Shutterstock Young adults in Canada today have grown up during a period when educational standards are significantly different from those of previous generations, and “environmental awareness”, was often included as a formal or informal part of the curriculum. Yet, misconceptions abound. I was reminded of this the other day when a young woman I met expressed concern about how carbon dioxide was harming air quality and people’s health. Even the government, after all, calls carbon dioxide “pollution”. In the interests of clarity, therefore, I thought I would offer some hard information that people might find good to have. In brief, carbon dioxide does not harm air quality.Visualization of carbon dioxide (CO2) moleculeCarbon dioxide is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas found naturally in the earth’s atmosphere. It is produced by natural sources like volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, people and animals (including fish), decay of organic materials, the combustion (i.e. burning) of fossil fuels, and as a by-product of some industrial processes like baking and brewing. Plants and algae use light to photosynthesize a compound called carbohydrate from carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide is the primary source of carbon life; in other words, without carbon dioxide, there would be no life on earth.Image of various particulate matter. “Soot” (upper left hand image) is actually ‘”carbon” – a physical remnant of incomplete combustion of burning wood or fossil fuels. It is scientifically inaccurate to refer to the gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), as “carbon” as they are different things. http://www.chemistryexplained.com/elements/A-C/Carbon.html  Carbon dioxide is an essential element in human respiration; people breathe out about 40,000ppm (parts per million) CO2 with every breath.The quality of the air we breathe is sometimes impaired by certain contaminants, and it helps to know what these are. The main ones are:Particulate matter: Particulates are tiny drops of liquid and sold particles, the size of dust or smaller, suspended in the air. They come mainly from agriculture, construction and dust from roads, although various industrial sources play a role. Along with ozone, it is a major component of smog and, at high levels, can harm human health. (Often referred to as PM2.5 or PM10 – meaning Particulate Matter smaller than 2.5 or 10 microns in size.)Chart showing diverse forms of airborne particulate matter according to size range.Nitrogen oxide: Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown toxic gas with an irritating smell. Exposure to high levels of nitrogen dioxide can cause breathing problems and reduced lung function, and it is a component of acid rain.Ground-level ozone: Low-level ozone is a colourless gas that is formed through a chemical reaction of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in sunlight. The major sources of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are transportation, oil and natural gas production, electricity generation, home heating and even the burning of firewood. At high levels, ground-level ozone can cause breathing problems, lung damage, and asthma attacks in humans and damage to sensitive vegetation.Sulphur dioxide: Sulphur dioxide is a colourless and toxic gas that smells bad. It is caused both by natural sources and by human activity, the most important of which are smelting and refining, electricity generation, heating, and oil and gas production and other industries. Sulphur dioxide in high concentrations can contribute to breathing and heart problems, especially among infants and the elderly.Carbon monoxide: Unlike carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide is a highly toxic gas that is caused by the incomplete burning of oil, natural gas and coal. High levels of carbon monoxide can cause dizziness, unconsciousness, and even death.  Environment Canada chart shows decline in noxious emissions from 1990  https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=En&n=E79F4C12-1 So, carbon dioxide does not affect air quality. It is, in effect, plant food. Those who call it air pollution are trying to present carbon dioxide as something it is not, in order to further a political agenda.Time lapse of plants with different CO2 concentrations:~~~~More resources:National Air Pollution Surveillance Program (NAPS) – Air quality in Canada is consistently monitored: “Today there are 286 sites in 203 communities located in every province and territory.” Provinces require reporting from industrial emitters at regular intervals; those who exceed air quality standards can be fined.https://www.ec.gc.ca/rnspa-naps/Canada-wide, the GEM-MACH modelling system forecasts air quality based on diverse emissions input data including daily satellite data.https://weather.gc.ca/aqfm/index_e.htmlYourEnvironment – 100 year temperature data, air quality emissions and water quality are available for most communities in Canada at:www.YourEnvironment.caMother Nature also creates many air pollutants – including wildfire smoke, dust, pollens, spores and molds.  Aerobiology Research Labs provides monitoring and data for most locations across Canada (i.e. daily weather reports often include pollen counts)http://www.aerobiology.ca/ A plain language report by Dr. Thoenes, Emeritus Professor of Chemical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, on his view of carbon dioxide and climate change:https://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Thoenes_Views_CO2_Climate.pdfPlease help Friends of Science Society continue to provide factual information on climate science and energy policies.  Become a Member or Donate now.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/10/21/disputing-the-haskayne-school-of-business-presentation-canadas-energy-future-renewable-energy-in-vogue/,Duane Pendergast ,Disputing the Haskayne School of Business Presentation- “Canada’s Energy Future: Renewable Energy in Vogue?”," Opinion Contributed by Michelle Stirling © 2017On Oct. 19, 2017, I attended a University of Calgary, Haskayne School of Business presentation by David Jacoby, President of Boston Strategies International.  The group in attendance were mostly supply chain managers, along with other members of the public, like myself.Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager, Friends of Science SocietyThe event description opened with what I found to be an odd phrase:  “Renewable energy transformation is fashionable everywhere…” Fashionable?… but things were about to get odder yet.Mr. Jacoby’s presentation opened with reference to the Paris Agreement, with some disparaging comments about his own US government’s rejection of the agreement. He showed a map of the world with Alaska and the US marked in red – to  illustrate the outstanding climate laggard of the world.  He seemed to think that if ‘everyone’ else in the world was on board with the Paris Agreement, the US should agree to it.A detailed review of the Paris Agreement shows that it is basically an unbalanced effort at extorting money from the industrialized West, in particular the US, with no benefit to the environment, and that the Paris Agreement will not meet the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases or preventing climate change.[1] If Canada were to attempt to meet the Paris goals, according to Ottawa energy policy consultant, Robert Lyman, “Achieving the aspirational goal of 80 per cent reduction recommended by the IPCC would mean reducing emissions to 147 megatonnes CO2 equivalent. That would be comparable to reducing Canada’s per capita emissions and our energy economy to the current levels of Bolivia, Sudan or Iraq.”[2] The Americans clearly understood the extortionate and economically crippling outcomes and that is the main reason President Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement.The Green Climate Fund, associated with the Paris Agreement allowed that countries, some with the highest GDP would not be required to contribute, but could apply as recipients. Others with the highest per capita incomes like Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, UAE, would not have to contribute, while deeply indebted Greece would be required to pay. (Updated: This paragraph added Oct. 23, 2017 at 7:13 am)Mr. Jacoby then moved on to a graph showing an astounding growth in renewables (wind/solar primarily) against a foreground flat-lining or even declining graph of conventional energy sources.  The style of presentation of this graph left the impression that renewables would be exceeding conventional energy sources – in fact, according to Robert Lyman’s summary of the International Energy Agency’s 2016 report:In 2014, the shares of primary energy supply by energy source were: oil, 31.3%; coal, 28.8%; natural gas, 21.0 %; biofuels and waste, 10.3%; nuclear, 4.8%; hydro, 2.4%; and “other”, including all renewables energy sources, 1.4%. (Message: Fossil fuels now account for 81% of the world’s energy supply and renewables just over one per cent. That situation will not change soon, easily or cheaply.)[3] A power point linked within this recent blog post regarding the recent Generation Energy conference illustrates the expected growth of fossil fuels, based on BP and US EIA statistics.[4] While renewables are still a growth industry, they still will be a very small component. Oil and gas are mature industries and this is reflected in the stability of their markets though overall fossil fuel demand is forecast to continue to be in demand worldwide.Graph from BP Statistical Review 2017 shows renewables as a fraction of global energy consumption and continued rise in natural gas; only slight declines in oil and coal.Surely this crucial context and statistical ratio should have been presented.Based on reports from Ottawa energy policy consultant, Robert Lyman, and other peer-reviewed experts, I dispute many claims of Mr. Jacoby.Wind and solar are not the cheapest forms of power, no matter what the reduction in the cost of the devices (turbines/panels). Extensive multi-billion-dollar infrastructure, transmission/distribution lines and appropriate 24/7 dispatchable conventional power plants must be part of the system (typically Combined Cycle ‘peaking’ Natural Gas plants) for wind or solar to operate on the grid. The Energy Return on Energy Invested in wind/solar is extremely low. Wind and solar cannot be compared as “apples to apples” with coal, natural gas, hydro or nuclear because they are intermittent forms of power; they also require massive areas of land; they are extremely low density. Prof. Michael J. Kelly of Cambridge notes that due to the very poor Energy Return on Energy Invested, wind and solar cannot support even basic society, let alone one of higher education, culture and aviation.  He calls it ‘total madness’ to continue going down this path.[5] At best, wind and solar are supplemental; with specific applications in some cases for remote locations or non-grid applications.Graph from Prof. MJ Kelly’s paper showing that wind and solar do not meet the economical threshold to support basic society. See footnote 5. Solar is an energy sink in Canada; anything north of 35 N latitude is an energy sink location for solar panels. The objective of wind and solar is supposedly to reduce CO2 emissions – however they simply drive up the cost of electricity.  Ontario Professional Engineers report that adding more wind and solar to their grid will also drive up CO2 emissions! What has happened in Europe is that industries have simply left for places with no environmental regulations – like China – so ‘reducing’ emissions in Europe to increase them in China.  In the case of Germany, emissions have risen because they have had to add more coal plants for cheap baseload to back up the addition of so much wind and solar to the grid. To get an idea of the additional costs for infrastructure, the recent paper “Burden of Proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems” [6] (Heard et al 2017) offers this shocking insight: “In Germany where penetration of solar photovoltaic systems is the highest in the world, voltage overloading is leading to grid reinforcement requirements expected to cost €21–27 billion [E-bridge consulting cited in 96].” In recent email correspondence with Robert Lyman on the topic of renewables he wrote to me: “Renewable energy (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass) would not provide a single kWh of electricity if it were not for major government subsidies. The subsidies begin at the research stage, and continue with production, siting, regulation (i.e. exemptions from the environmental review processes that conventional energy projects must undergo), exemption from local government taxes and land use planning requirements, government mandates to utilities (whether privately or publicly owned) to purchase them regardless of cost, tariff practices (e.g. feed-in-tariffs), income tax exemptions, forced backup by fossil fuel plants (i.e. cross subsidization by other utility generators tolerated by public utility commissions) and, in the case of solar, utility buy-back of surplus power so that all other ratepayers must pay the costs. Without massive subsidies, there would be no renewables.” (Note: These comments apply to Ontario most specifically, and broadly to other jurisdictions with some variation.) By contrast, in Canada, fossil fuels are not subsidized, they provide the basic by-product elements for thousands of useful products and millions of jobs, and they return billions of dollars to governments in terms of taxes. None of this is true of renewables.Image licensed from Shutterstock for Friends of Science report “Keep Canada in the Black” Surely this important context should have been presented to the audience.Mr. Jacoby suggested that soon self-driving, electric vehicles would dramatically change the car market and lead to a substantial drop in oil production/consumption.  Regarding electric vehicles, again, the tale is told by the numbers. Robert Lyman has summarized material from International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) and Clean Technica on vehicle numbers/trends:[7]Of 907 million personal vehicles on the road worldwide in 2014, 405,000 were EV’s. EVs constituted 0.04 % of the PVs on the road globally.Sales of all-electric trucks and buses are negligible.Of 88 million new vehicle sales in the world in 2014, 307,000 were EVs. That is, the EV share of new vehicle sales was 0.35%. In 2015, that probably rose to one half of one percent.To reach 60% of present PV sales by 2040, EV sales would have to increase to 120 times today’s level.The potential growth in total vehicle sales globally is immense, especially in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The likelihood that EV sales will constitute 60% of the much-increased sales of all vehicles by 2040 approaches zero.Internal combustion engines, powered by petroleum fuels, will be the dominant source of motive power for a very long time. Despite Mr. Jacoby’s claims that we could simply electrify our vehicles, and his reference to Tony Seba of Stanford (author of “Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation – How Silicon Valley Will Make Oil, Nuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Utilities and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030”), that we will be all on automatic self-driving electric cars within a decade, this is highly unlikely. An article in the Jan. 2017 edition of American Scientist Sigma Xi Society magazine and a letter to the editor the following month discuss the challenges of integrating such vehicles into society – and there are many.[8] As well, energy commentator Euan Mearns demonstrates, in an example for the EU, that societies would have to concurrently add many more terawatts of conventional power generation for fully electric vehicles and upgrade the grid for billions….trillions of dollars.[9] Not to mention, at present there is no viable alternative to diesel for heavy hauling transport. Jacoby made passing reference to battery storage as a means of resolving the issues of intermittency of wind/solar, referencing Mr. Elon Musk’s work on the PowerWall and large battery projects. According to energy commentator Euan Mearns, battery storage is a ‘Holy Grail,’ far from being able to meet market needs, far from market ready, and if technical issues could be overcome, costly beyond measure.[10]  Some excerpts of his commentary:Battery storage needed to convert Germany’s 2013 solar generation to baseload: $800 billion, about 13 times the $66 billion cost of installing the ~33GW of solar capacity involved.Battery storage needed to convert solar generation equal to a year of Hinkley nuclear generation to baseload: $700 billion, about 28 times the ~$25 billion cost of the Hinkley (UK nuclear) plant.Battery storage needed to convert solar + wind generation equal to a year of Hinkley nuclear generation to baseload: $350 billion, about 14 times the cost of the Hinkley nuclear plant.Battery storage required to convert one month of UK wind generation to baseload:up to $500 billion, over twice the $200 billion cost of the ~100GW of wind capacity involved. (Note 1: storage requirements for a complete year would likely be significantly higher. Note 2: the lower-storage options discussed in the “estimating storage requirements” post are achieved by increasing wind capacity and curtailing large amounts of wind power.) Jacoby said that Saudi Arabia was demoting oil. Perhaps they are, but on the scale of ‘climate laggards’ in the world, they are at the bottom, while we Canadians are at the top of the pile in terms of renewable energy installation, generation and consumption!  None-the-less, we still require conventional fuel – especially for transportation and heating. We Canadians live in a climate of significant extremes of cold plunging down to -40C/F in winter; rising to +35C/95F in summer. We Canucks are challenged by sparse population and vast distances for our transportation and supply chain.  The Saudis are a competitor to Canadian oil and gas and not a role model in terms of climate change or renewable energy. [11] You would think that with all that sunlight and the Saudis would have already covered the desert with solar panels and proven its worth. Not so much.Figure 3: Electricity generation by source as percent of total electricity generation. G20 countries, 2015. Hydro, nuclear and wind, solar etc are the low-carbon sources. Thermal generation is dominantly coal and gas.In closing, I found it very odd that Canada’s Energy University – the University of Calgary – hosted a presentation that appeared to misreport the facts on renewables and conventional energy use world-wide.  No matter how many renewables are built, they all rely on masses of fossil fuels throughout the process of mining, manufacturing, transportation, installation and operation – along with typically a need for Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power generators to back up the grid 24/7.  These ‘peakers’ also offer the best earnings for utility companies, thus the intermittent nature of wind and solar becomes the ‘generator’ of profits for companies and investors – but a burdensome debt for consumers who pay the subsidies on all fronts, the integration costs, transmission lines, carbon taxes, coal phase-out costs, and then – the higher power prices. The result for all these costs is a less reliable power grid.  Blackouts and power dips and surges, once the sign of a developing  nation is now emblematic of nations with widespread wind/solar integration.  Surely we should accept the “Lessons Learned” by others and not go down this path.

This article gives the highlights of that report. Rupert Darwall is a strategy consultant and policy analyst, a corporate finance specialist and former special advisor to the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer. He is the author of several published works, including The Age of Global Warming: A History, in 2013. Indoor cooking on open flame  In Entoto, on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, thousands of women and girls collect firewood. They carry these burdensome heavy loads for many miles which they will use or sell as woodfuel. In Ethiopia 90% of energy comes from biomass like wood and charcoal. By Chebyshev1983 at English Wikipedia (Transferred from en.wikipedia to Commons.) [Public domain], via Wikimedia CommonsBackgroundUniversal access to cheap, reliable electrical energy is a defining feature of modernity. In the west, it distinguished the 19th from the twentieth centuries. For the emerging economies today, this is equally true. Yet, there are 1.2 billion people without access to electricity and 2.8 billion people without modern cooking facilities, forced to rely for their energy needs on traditional biomass (i.e. wood and dried animal dung). The consequences of this are almost unimaginable for those who live in Canada or other modern economies:  Household air pollution is estimated to kill 3.5 million people annually and to cause many more cases of respiratory, cardiovascular and other illnesses.Of the countries that have electricity, over forty experience at least 20 hours of electricity outages per month.Across sub-Saharan Africa, some 30 countries suffer from regular blackouts and brownouts, with associated economic losses estimated in some cases in excess of 5% of GDP.Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa face electricity costs from U.S. 20 cents to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), compared to a global average closer to U.S. 10 cents per kWh. This raises the cost of goods and services, making enterprises uneconomic and forcing poor people to continue relying on traditional biomass. Photo credits: Clive SchaupmeyerThis should constitute a compelling economic, social and moral case for the World Bank, the world’s principal financing institution promoting economic development in the less developed countries, to target its development funding to investment in the lowest-cost path to universal access to cheap, reliable electricity. For many of the countries of Asia and Africa, the cheapest, most accessible and secure source of electricity generation is by coal-fired generation plants. However, the World Bank will not fund coal plants, except in exceptional circumstances, where there are “no feasible alternatives to coal”. Instead, the World Bank gives priority to “green energy”, meaning wind and solar energy plants. The World Bank’s Current Policy In 2016, the World Bank adopted a Climate Change Action Plan that focused on “adding 20 Gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2020 and to ‘green’ power grids to enable the addition of a further 10 GW of wind and solar”.  Only three years, earlier, in 2013, the World Bank acknowledged the drawbacks of intermittent renewables when it stated: “Ensuring supply adequacy with solar and wind power would require significant regional diversification and large-scale transmission network expansion to connect these sources, a challenge even in developed countries”. In spite of its own analysis showing the cost disadvantages of renewable energy, the World Bank decided form a partnership with the then United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in the 2011 “Sustainable Energy For all Initiative (SE4ALL). This sets an arbitrary target of doubling renewables’ contribution to the global energy mix by 2030. The projected costs were enormous. Prior to 2013, the World Bank advisory group on climate change recommended focusing on two goals: improving energy access and strengthening energy efficiency. Under the influence of Ban Ki-moon, a third goal was added: a massive increase in renewable energy, with at least half new generation capacity in Africa being renewable. Annual investments to achieve the three goals were calculated to be at least $600-$800 billion per year over the current level of investments, entailing a doubling or tripling of investment flows. The bulk of those investments are associated with energy efficiency and renewable energy. Including the previously expected level of spending, achieving universal electricity access has a price tag of about $50 billion per year. Renewable energy costs $500 billion per year and there is a further $500 billion a year for energy efficiency. In fact, the costs are so high they are unlikely to be met. So, in effect, the goal of promoting renewable energy is crowding out the goal of universal access, sacrificing access for unrealistic green ideology. “Forcing decarbonization on societies that have yet to carbonize means less development. Resources are not costless. More sustainability means less poverty reduction.”  A small boy sits by his mother’s traditional wood fuel stove. Because of the inefficient heat production of wood-fired stoves such as this one, women cook indoors for hours each day in poorly ventilated dwellings. Wikipedia Project GaiaAuthor: Chebyshev1983Conclusion“Intermittent sources of energy incur operating and cost penalties that are not reflected in plant-level cost comparisons. Their materials intensity conflicts with the UN’s sustainability mantra. Lastly, they create huge and as yet untackled disposal problems. All these present substantial challenges to rich nations in their rush to adopt wind and solar. Grid stability is compromised, costs and prices spiral and the full extent of the solar PV disposal problem is still emerging. For poorer nations still in the process of extending the benefits of the twentieth century to all their people, providing incentives to adopt wind and solar would present a development calamity.” The new Administration in the United States is now seeking to rein in the World Bank so it focuses on its mission to alleviate world poverty. It wants countries to access and use fossil fuels more efficiently. To maximize development potential and poverty reduction, Rupert Darwall recommends that the World Bank’s shareholders go further and insist that the Bank withdraw from the anti-development SE4ALL initiative, abandon renewable energy targets and ensure than any renewable energy projects that it supports do not undermine the economics of electricity grids. The text of Rupert Darwall’s report can be found here: https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2017/10/Darwall-WB.pdf~~~~Dr. Madhav Khandekar comments on the use of coal to support the needs of a billion people who have no power, running water, or basic sanitation.  Dr. Khandekar is a former research scientist for Environment Canada, a scientific advisor to Friends of Science Society and expert reviewer of past IPCC reports.Please help Friends of Science Society continue to provide factual information on climate science and energy policies.  Become a Member or Donate now.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/10/18/trolling-for-critical-thinking-on-climate-policy-calling-out-climate-barbie/,,"Trolling for Critical Thinking on Climate Policy, Calling Out Climate Barbie"," Michelle StirlingContributed by Michelle Stirling © 2017 In a Sept. 21, 2017 op-ed in the Ottawa Citizen, Nancy Peckford asserts that Minister Catherine McKenna was ‘right to take on the trolls’ and makes a plea for respectful public dialogue toward females in politics, denouncing the twitter epithet “Climate Barbie.”  As a woman in business and the arts, I make a plea for critical thinking, competency and common sense from female politicians as a requirement for respectful dialogue.Ms. Peckford is speaking on behalf of a group that calls itself Equal Voice and she claims the term is a sexist slur. Equal Voice want to encourage more women in politics.  That’s great.As a woman, I don’t want more women in politics for their biology, but for their brains.  I want women in politics to make thoughtful decisions for me and my country, not for someone else’s country or interests.  I come from the West – where the Famous Five women made constructive change for everyone – especially women – in their fight to have women recognized as persons.  They were very competent and concerned with the best outcomes for women and children.That will not be the case with Minister McKenna’s climate change policies and Canadians know it.In frustration, Canadians have resorted to name-calling instead of addressing the evidence. Let’s bring the conversation back to the facts.Upon Minister McKenna’s return from the COP-21 Paris event, she told Rosie Barton on Power and Politics on CBC that it was urgent we attend to the ‘climate crisis’ because the Marshall Islands were drowning due to sea level rise (allegedly due to human caused climate change from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions). She even had a cute little palm frond on her jacket to prove it.However, that is not the truth. Dr. John D. Harper, FGSA, FGAC, P.Geol., former director of the Geological Survey of Canada, explains that these tiny Marshall Islands are eroding by the constant battering of the huge Pacific Ocean. Feels like sea level rise – but it’s not.Did the Minister just accept the Marshall Islands claim at face value and then mislead Canadians?Based on the Minister’s Marshall Islands misinformation, the Minister adopted the 1.5 oC target, because, as she told Calgary Chamber audiences this spring “I am an ambitious person.” Sadly, she also told us she knew nothing of the climate file going in to the Paris COP-21 event, laughing as she said, “What is this ‘COP’ (Conference of the Parties)?”Great. An ambitious, misinformed person negotiating a deal that can sink our economy. She apparently values the future of islanders living in the tropics over those of her own countrymen who face half a year of cold, dark winter and vast distances for transport of goods.But she assured us that upon her return from Paris, the “rubber had to hit the road.”How so? The Minister claimed that putting a price on carbon would prevent wildfires and floods. This is utter nonsense. Calgary’s eight worst floods were before 1933, and two of the greatest flow rates were in the late 1800s. Likewise, ask British Columbia how their carbon tax worked for them this year as fire protection.The Minister’s persistent, perky video clips in English and French, exhorting Canadians to take “climate action” are embarrassing to those who have studied the more than 4 billion years of climate change on Earth. Her claims that the “environment and economy go hand in hand” revel her obvious lack of appreciation for Canada’s exception environmental record during booming economic times.Visit Your Environment and you can see complete air and water quality records for you own community. Look at the 100 year temperature record there. Most places show no signs of global warming.The Minister believes “clean-tech” will save us. All clean-tech is made from oil, gas and coal! Her GHG reduction targets are unattainable with present technology and will destroy our economy. Did she ever bother to ask an economist about it?The carbon taxes the Minister’s government is imposing; the push for coal phase-out in Alberta, will lead to a tripling of power prices for Albertans, and will be the final blow for struggling female entrepreneurs here in Calgary. How will heat-or-eat poverty help women and children?Further, as President Trump has pointed out, the Paris Agreement does nothing for the environment or climate.I don’t want women with “equal voices” in politics if they are misinformed and doing damage to working women, men, and families.Give me someone with critical thinking, competency, and common sense. I care about how they use what’s in their brains. I don’t care about what’s in their pants.Michelle Stirling is a member of the CAJ and AAAS. This is an expression of her personal opinion.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/10/17/the-grand-quebec-hypocrisy-on-energy-east/,Ron Clutz ,The Grand Quebec Hypocrisy on Energy East," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is a former public servant of 27 years and prior to that a diplomat for 10 years. He is an Ottawa energy policy consultant.Following the recent announcement by Trans Canada Pipelines that it was withdrawing its applications to the National Energy Board and the relevant provincial permitting authorities to construct the Energy East Pipeline project, a number of Quebec politicians expressed their happiness with the announcement. Denis Coderre, the corpulent Mayor of Montreal, who had publicly opposed the pipeline on the grounds of its alleged adverse impact on the environment, signaled a “thumbs up” and stated, “I have been saying since Day 1 that (TransCanada was) arrogant and condescending.” Quebec Energy Minister Pierre Arcand was “not surprised” by the decision, Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said he “was indifferent to the decision,” and Parti Quebecois leader Jean-Francois Lisee described TransCanada’s decision as “a great victory.” Even though a coalition of Quebec business groups supported the pipeline, the sponsor’s decision to withdraw was broadly supported in the Quebec media and public. It did not matter that all of the claims by environmental groups that the project would adversely affect land, water, fish and wildlife were nonsense and that the TransCanada never received its “day in court” to demonstrate this factually. No one ever got to hear and test the claims that the project’s economic benefits would significantly outweigh any reasonable valuation of the adverse environmental effects. The project was defeated by a coalition of factors, the most important of which were the constant changes in the regulatory system for the evaluation of new pipeline projects in Canada, all of which added significantly to the cost and delays in getting the project reviewed on its merits, and the acceptance by too many vocal Quebecers of the thesis that allowing additional Alberta oil to reach new markets in eastern Canada and elsewhere would somehow catastrophically warm the planet. The Trudeau government will have to bear responsibility for constantly changing the “rules of the game” with respect to the once-professional and independent regulatory review of new oil and gas pipelines in Canada, so as to place its global warming agenda above any objective assessment of the Canadian public interest with respect to each proposed pipeline project. What, however, of the Quebecers like Denis Coderre who find it morally objectionable to increase greenhouse gas emissions by transporting more oil to market? Objectively, how well do they stand up to this standard of “green” behavior? Well, it so happens that Quebecers actually do consume oil and natural gas and they do produce carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels. According to Environment Canada statistics for 2015, the most recent year available, greenhouse gas emissions in Quebec were 80.1 megatonnes, 11.4% of the Canadian total. A substantial amount of this came from the use of refined oil products produced from the two refineries located in the province, the 137, 000 barrel per day Sunoco plant in Montreal and the 235,000 barrel per day Valero plant in Levis near Quebec City. From where, one might ask, do these refineries get their crude oil? Well, it turns out that they both get their crude oil from western Canada via Interprovincial Pipeline Line 9 through Ontario. The crude oil for Valero is loaded onto tankers in Montreal and shipped to Levis. Quebec refineries used to be supplied by the Portland Pipeline system from Portland Maine to Montreal, but that pipeline was essentially shut down in early 2016 and only used for emergency purposes since. So, Quebecers have no problem getting their crude oil from western Canada and they have no problem producing 80 megatonnes of emissions from their use of oil and gas for transport, industry, residences, agriculture and other purposes. They just do not want to see any additional emissions associated with Canadian fossil fuels produced for anyone else. Their values are selective. Their hypocrisy is reprehensible.~~~~Please help Friends of Science Society continue to provide factual information on climate science and energy policies.  Become a Member or Donate now.

National Energy Board Proposed Reforms Report June 1 2017Contributed by Robert Lyman @2017 Robert LymanMany Canadians have been unaware of the work of the National Energy Board (NEB). Since its establishment in 1959, The National Energy Board has served as the federal government’s independent, expert, quasi-judicial regulatory body dealing with important energy matters. The Board itself operates at arms’ length from politicians, and is supported by a secretariat that includes a group of highly skilled, technical staff who can assess engineering, economic, financial, safety and environmental issues. The NEB’s mandate is to carefully review proposals for national energy infrastructure, such as pipelines and power lines, and oil/gas imports/exports, and to carry out energy market analysis with which it can advise the government.  Recently various activists and environmental groups claimed the NEB process was flawed and demanded a review.  A panel appointed by the government has just completed the review and offered recommendations for a significant revision to replace the NEB with an entirely new structure and process.Robert Lyman posed the question “Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?” at his Calgary presentation on May 9, 2017. The proposed changes to the NEB are a related complication. Canadians must look at the highly competitive global markets and evaluate whether making infrastructure projects more difficult to approve, in a process that is apparently less technical, is in the best economic interests of the nation, even as Canada is already an acknowledged leader in environmental management.  Ottawa energy policy expert, Robert Lyman, has contributed the following overview.  LINK TO REPORT:  National Energy Board Proposed Reforms Report June 1 2017Related:Moving Oil by Pipelinehttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/11/27/moving-oil-by-pipeline-examining-the-facts/Moving Oil by Tankerhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/11/18/moving-oil-by-tanker-in-canada-the-facts/Friends of Science Society presents the evidence over the ideology on climate change and related energy policies.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/29/calculating-the-social-cost-of-co2-emissions-using-fund/,David Walker ,Calculating the “Social Cost” of CO2 Emissions Using FUND," Calculating the “Social Cost” of CO2 Emissions Using FUND*(*The Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution – an Integrated Economic Assessment Model)Contributed by Ian Cameron © 2017IntroductionGovernment agencies, such as Environment and Climate Change Canada (EC), define the social cost of CO2 or SCCO2 (more commonly misstated as the “social cost of carbon” or SCC) as “… an estimate of the monetary value in a given year of worldwide damage that will occur over the coming decades and centuries from emitting one additional tonne of CO2 emissions.” [EC’s March 2016 Technical Update to Social Cost of Greenhouse Gas Estimates, p. 1.] In other words, the agencies assume that any incremental emissions of CO2 are going to increase global temperatures for a number of years, thus causing general harm (in economists’ terminology, a global public “bad”) for as long the emissions remain in the atmosphere. A typical use for SCCO2 is in policy analysis, such as doing cost-benefit calculations for proposed government regulations. For example, the EC Technical Update, p.i, states: “Estimates of the SCC therefore provide a way to value CO2 emission changes in cost- benefit analysis where the goal is to provide informed analysis to decision makers that quantifies the incremental mitigation benefits associated with a policy action and compares them to the incremental costs of abatement.” That is, the bureaucrats use the calculated SCCO2 to convince political leaders to impose greenhouse-gas reduction policies on their citizens. According to the Technical Update EC relies for its SCCO2 estimates on the work of the US Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon/Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which published its own technical update in August 2016. The IWG results are in US dollars, which EC converted to Canadian. To calculate the SCCO2 the IWG used three integrated assessment models (IAMs) called DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate and Energy), FUND (Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution) and PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect). As explained on page 15 of the Technical Update the IWG averaged results from the three models with five socioeconomic emissions scenarios using three discount rates (2.5, 3 and 5%) to reduce a series to future costs to one number (the SCCO2). IAMS differ from the general circulation climate models (GCMs) in that they consider demographic, ecological, political and economic variables in addition to the physical climate system. GCMs employ complex mathematical models of the circulation of the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans in a three-dimensional grid, stepping forward in time. One of the outputs from the GCMs is future global temperatures, from which it is possible to calculate equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECS) – the eventual temperature rise in °C resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. IAMs take these ECS (or rather a probabilistic range of ECS) to calculate future changes in global temperatures, from which they determine the resulting impacts on, for example, regional temperatures, sea-level rise, storms, land loss, agriculture, forests, water resources, biodiversity, human health and income. Equilibrium Climate SensitivityThe ECS supplied with FUND is a truncated gamma probability distribution, as shown in Figure 1. It has a minimum value of 1.0°C, peaks at 3.0°C (the statistical mode) and has a long tail extending to the right, theoretically to infinity. Because of the curve is skewed to the right, the average ECS is 3.5°C (which divides the area under the curve into equal parts.) The reason for this ECS distribution is found in an entry on Judith Curry’s blog describing a recent paper published by her and Nicholas Lewis. The blog entry contains excerpts from the IPCC’s AR5 report where the IPCC concluded: “Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C (high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium confidence).” Hence, the skewed curve, with a minimum of 1.0°C, shown in Figure 1.The Lewis and Curry paper relied on comprehensive 1750-2011 time series and uncertainty ranges for climate forcing components, together with estimates of heat accumulation in the climate system. That is, the authors used climate records, rather than GCMs, arriving at a median estimate for ECS of 1.64°C. Later Dr. Lewis reduced his ECS to 1.45°C by using new aerosol estimates, but even this failed to account for natural climate change (the millennium cycle recovery from the Little Ice Age) and the urban heat island effect.  Adjusting for these factors gives an ESC best estimate of 1.02°C. Therefore, the following SCC calculations use ECS values of 3.5°C and 1.0°C. Accessing FUNDBecause they rely on an input ECS, IAMs use simple calculations to determine temperature as a function of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and can run on desktop computers, rather than the supercomputers needed for the GCMs. One of the IAMs, FUND, is freely available for download and use by anyone with coding skills and some knowledge of the Julia language (to study the FUND code and then use it for calculations and analysis). FUND’s home page contains additional information and references to various publications that relied on the model. FUND divides the world into 16 regions: USA, Canada, Western Europe, Japan-Korea, Australia-New Zealand, Eastern Europe, Former Soviet Union, Middle East, Central America, Latin America, South Asia, South-East Asia, China, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Small Island States. Each region may have its own input parameters by year (e.g., for population and economic growth rates), while some parameters are global in nature (e.g., ECS). The model calculates a global temperature change for each year from which it determines temperature changes for each of the regions. The effects of these changes, as well as sea-level rise, have economic and environmental effects on each region, including forced migrations among the regions. The Appendix to this report lists the 29 components making up the FUND model, together with each component’s incoming parameters and outgoing variables. The following plots and table give some idea of what FUND does. It starts in 1950 (the1950-2000 period is used to calibrate the model) and runs in one-year time-steps to 3000. However, the IWG and EC use 2300 as the end year for their SCCO2 calculations. They also have five socioeconomic scenarios called Base, Image, Merge, Message and MiniCAM. Page 7 of the EC Technical Update mentions the last four, and the Base scenario appears to be a business-as-usual case. The IPCC’s website also discusses the scenarios. The scenarios differ only in six input parameters: methane emissions; nitrous oxide emissions; carbon efficiency improvement indices; energy efficiency improvement indices; population growth rates; and economic growth rates. FUND has 201 files of data of input parameters. Of these, 106 contain fixed values and the remaining 95 have probability distributions of either normal, triangular or gamma types. The latter includes the ECS. For a given scenario and several years of CO2 emission, the IWG ran FUND and the other two IAMs 10,000 times with random draws for the ECS and other probability distributions, then averaged the resulting SCCO2 values for all three models and scenarios. See pages 3 and 4 of the EC Technical Update for a more complete description of the process. FUND ResultsThe results discussed below come from single runs of FUND using two values of ECS and the mode (most probable value) for all the other probability distributions. Figure 2 shows global populations for the five scenarios. These curves are the result of the population growth-rate inputs, less deaths from normal mortality as well as from climate change effects (disease, storms, etc.)Figures 3 and 4 depict the annual CO2 emissions and resulting atmospheric concentrations. There is a time lag between when emissions and concentrations peak because of CO2 persistence in the atmosphere.Figures 5 and 6 show the sea-level and temperature rises assuming an ECS of 3.5°C, while Figures 7 and 8 present the results for a more reasonable ECS of 1.0°C. The calculations behind these curves are quite simple. For example, FUND’s climate forcing component requires 7 lines of code to determine the radiative forcing (in W/m2) from atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, as well as methane, nitrous oxide and sulfur hexafluoride) and the climate dynamics component has another 5 lines to calculate the temperature change resulting from the radiative forcing and ECS. The oceans component uses 2 lines of code to calculate the sea-level rise based on temperature. Both the climate dynamics and ocean components also incorporate time delays and various constants in their calculations.In Figures 7 and 8 the lower ECS reduces the temperature and sea-level rises by approximately the ratio of the two ECS values. FUND calculates the annual global costs associated with a one-tonne release of a greenhouse gas in any given year. Figure 9 plots these costs for 1 t of CO2 released in 2020 in the Base scenario for ECS of 3.5°C and 1.0°C.Both curves show sharp positive and negative changes in the initial years (2018-2030). For the ECS = 3.5°C plot there are some sharp negative spikes in about 2190, 2230 and 2270. These all result from the fact that FUND calculates marginal damages for each of the 16 regions and adds them to get a global total for each year. Sudden year-to-year changes in one or more regions can make a noticeable difference to the global total and the otherwise smooth curves in Figure 9. In the initial years, Western Europe, Japan-Korea, and China regions are responsible for the negative global values. For the ECS = 3.5°C, the USA region causes the negative spike near 2190; in 2230 it’s Central America, and in 2270 it’s South Asia. In calculating regional damages from global warming FUND evaluates the various costs listed as inputs to Component 29 in the Appendix. As a result, the overall results in a given year are subject to sudden changes in any of these inputs. However, the prime use of FUND is to calculate SCCO2. Table 1 shows the results for the Base scenario, using a 3% discount rate.Table 1 – Calculated Social Costs of CO2 Emitted in Various Years (2016 $US/t) Emission YearECS = 3.5°CECS = 1.0°C201030-16202041-22203058-30204086-282050117-26For an ECS of 3.5°C the calculated SCCO2 values increase significantly with the year of emission. This gives governments justification for steadily increasing carbon taxes (or cost of emissions permits under cap-and-trade schemes.) For an ECS of 1.0°C all the SCCO2 values are negative. In other words emissions of CO2 produce a net benefit to the world. This is in spite of the fact that (in Figure 7) global temperature increases well beyond the 2.0°C limit set by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. (Google “2.0°C limit” and you’ll get numerous links to articles affirming how bad it is.) Figure 10 plots SCCO2 vs ECS for emission year 2020, showing that an ECS of about 1.5°C is the break-even value.ConclusionsRoss McKitrick, who knows something about economic models, wrote a newspaper article for the National Post’s Junk Science Week series about the IAMs. Regarding FUND, PAGE and DICE he said: “They still all rely on simplified representations of the economy and the climate. And, most importantly, they all depend heavily on a handful of guesstimates on key parameters.” He also made this observation about FUND: “FUND differs from the other two IAMs because it takes into account CO2 fertilization of plants and the observation that moderate warming in some regions will be a net benefit. The other models assume that all CO2 is bad and any temperature change (up or down) is bad, which are themselves assumptions worthy of being challenged.” Dr. McKitrick concluded: “The numbers produced by the IWG have a large and growing influence over energy and economic policy in the U.S. and Canada and elsewhere. Unfortunately, for all its claims about following the science, where it really counts it ended up peddling guesstimates based on inconsistent models. To borrow a phrase, it is time to restore science to its rightful place. Calculations behind the social cost of carbon need to reflect empirical evidence about low climate sensitivity, and when this is done, the numbers appear to be much lower than those currently in use.” Dr. McKitrick isn’t the only economist critical of the IAMs. Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute prepared some slides for a presentation on the subject of SCC. The slides discuss ECS, CO2 fertilization, domestic vs global SCC, choice of discount rates, and end with a quote from MIT economist Robert Pindyck: “An IAM-based analysis suggests a level of knowledge and precision that is nonexistent, and allows the modeler to obtain almost any desired result because key inputs can be chosen arbitrarily.” Finally, the IWG, upon which EC has been relying for its SCCO2 calculations no longer exists. Last March President Trump signed an executive order to disband it. The next time EC updates its SCCO2 estimates, it will have to do so on its own.The Julia code for producing the graphs is here.Appendix – FUND’s Component ConnectionsThe following list shows the 29 FUND components, together with each component’s incoming parameters and outgoing variables. These variables then become parameters for other components further down the list as FUND processes the list during each time-step. The names of most of the components, parameters and variables are obvious from their context, but some are cryptic.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/23/climate-energy-what-if-we-come-back-down-to-earth/,Ron Clutz ,Climate / Energy: What if we come back down to Earth?," Contributed by Drieu Godefridi © 2017Belgian philosopher, jurist, author of “Le GIEC etMort; Vive le Science” (The IPCC is Dead: Long Live Science) published in English under the title “The IPCC: A Scientific Body?”Important information has emerged in the field of energy, and yet it is as if European politicians ignore it. Judge for yourself based on just the following facts: According to “Bloomberg New Energy Finance,” a news source favorable to renewable energies, investments in those energies in 2016 are in a free fall (-18%) compared to 2015, down even from 2014. The regression would be even more marked, if there were for not  “vanity projects” such as the pharaonic “solar” built in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In the United Kingdom, the decline in renewable investment is 90%.It should be noted that almost all investments in renewable / intermittent energy are dependent on public subsidies. Suppose those subsidies be withdrawn, and investment in the renewable will fall to nothing. This was the case in Spain after the 2008 crisis, this will be the case in other countries.The question arises as to whether pension funds and other investors who are massively present in the renewable sector do not make a mistake by not fully disclosing to their customers the dependence of a whole sector on subsidies, and the scientific uncertainties on the human causation of climate change, which is the alleged raison d’etre for a ‘low carbon’ technology.Secondly, emerging countries, of which China – which has emerged so well that it is now the world’s largest economy – invest heavily in energy, but in fossil fuel energy. The largest coal-fired power plants builders are now Chinese, 1600 new coal-fired power plants are being built (!), of which 700 by Chinese companies, often in countries that have scarcely burned coal to date (Pakistan, Egypt; source: http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/lawrence-solomon-paris-is-dead-the-global-warming-deniers-have-won).All this implies a 43% increase in coal capacity. At the same time countries of the West – and more and more Western Europe alone – are divestingfrom the fossil to the renewable. To put it bluntly: Asia is burning cheap energy, while Europe is inflicting upon herself a high energy price. Of course, this will have consequences on all fronts.This information may surprise you. This is because the world of energy, and the image of it by the European press, have ceased to coincide. Reading the European press, the renewable energy for the past 20 years is the incarnation of the future and the fossil energies that of the past. In reality, fossil fuel energy has never fared so well, and it is on the fossil fuels, and not the renewable, that the emerging economies are betting, after the Chinese giant. All this was predicted in 2014 by Samuele Furfari, expert at the European Commission, in a book with the provocative title Vive les energies fossiles! subtitled “The counter-revolution of energy” (March 2014).Most notably, scientists from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have just published in one of the most prestigious science journals, Nature Geoscience, an article that recognizes that the IPCC models are wrong, and I quote these eminent scientists including Myles Allen of Oxford University: “We haven’t seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models.” However, it is the entire renewable / intermittent energy and investment sector that depends on the “settled science” of the IPCC. In other words, if these models are false, nothing justifies the forced march of the Europeans towards the burdensome debt-load of subsidized renewable (intermittent) energy.This is crucial information. Is it not time for European politics to take these factors into account, instead of persisting in what Jean-Pierre Schaeken describes as “The Utopia of Renewable Energy” (published by the Royal Academy, Brussels: May 2017)? Dernier article “Outcome of the Paris Accord: a re-founding act of American democracy?”, Arguments — Revue européenne de science, vol. 2, n°2, été 2017, http://revue-arguments.com/articles/index.php?id=78 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'EU', 'solar energy', 'Uncategorized', 'wind farms']",2017/09/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/21/bc-wildfires-human-caused-climate-change-or-pine-beetles-and-a-dry-year/,Carolyn Carruthers ,BC Wildfires – Human-Caused Climate Change or Pine Beetles and a Dry Year," Contributed by Ralph Bullis, P. Geol., FGC © Sept. 2017With such a bad wildfire season in BC and with so much disruption in the province, I suppose it’s inevitable that someone (Al Gore? CBC? The Weather Channel?) would step up and state categorically that this is all caused by humans using fossil fuels.However, if you look up the BC government and federal government statistics on BC wildfires and plot out the past 40 years – since 1977 – and what you find is somewhat surprising. First of all, there has been a steady decrease in the number of fires over that period with the average being just over 2,100 per year. This year, up to early September we’ve had about 1,230. Yet, the number of hectares burnt is huge – almost 12,000 square km – more than the previous worst in 1958 (with about 8,550 sq. km.).The second thing that surprised me in the data is that up until about 2002, the average number of sq. km. burnt per year was about 320 and the trend was flat (with an anomalous spike in 1982 with about 2,800 sq. km. burnt). But since 2002 we have seen a significant increase in the areas burnt – in fact the average from 2003 to 2016 is about 1,550 sq. km. or about 5 times the average up to 2002.So what’s going on? How can the number of fires annually be steadily going down yet the amount forest being burnt increasing and the increase in burnt areas beginning about 2002?Well, I talked this over with some friends and the suggestion arose that perhaps the insect infestations might play a role.So, I retrieved the insect infestation data and when I plotted the pine beetle infestation numbers, it turns out that there was a rapid increase in the number of hectares infested starting in about 2000. As you can see from the attached plot, the number of hectares under pine beetle infestation climbs rapidly from less than 200,000 ha in 1999 to over 10 million ha in 2007. The good news in all of this is that the beetle infestation since then has been rapidly dying off, down to just over 300,000 ha in 2015.So, just at the same time period when extensive areas of forest were dead or dying due to pine beetles we see an anomalous uptick in forest fire extents.Now, the coincidence of larger fires and extensive forest kills due to pine beetles may be just that – coincidence – and there may not be a correlation. But, if it comes to a choice of blaming the extensive forest burns on climate change or on those huge expanses of highly combustible dead forest due to pine beetle infestations, I know what the scientist in me would select.~~~~Ralph Bullis is a UBC Geology grad (1970) who has worked for over 40 years in the mining and exploration industry, in many countries on various projects.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/17/climates-of-times-past/,Ron Clutz ,CLIMATES OF TIMES PAST," André Bijkerk has for many years been active in the Dutch climate sceptic world and as moderator of the Yahoo ClimateSceptics Forum. His specialty has been in Holocene paleoclimate with its geological and paleobotanical aspects. The present post originally appeared in Dutch on Hans Labohm’s blog climategate.nl  (September 9th 2017)DUTCH Version:http://climategate.nl/2017/09/09/andre-bijkerk/CLIMATES OF TIMES PASTby André BijkerkConsidering the likelihood of future presentations and discussions, an update of paleoclimatological information was overdue.  I was amazed to bump into a full overview of the atmospheric CO2 content of the last 420 million years published much earlier this year. An important milestone in the history of climate on Earth.What is the big picture? Paleoclimate researchers have been struggling with the faint young sun paradox for a long time now. Over its lifetime the sun is thought to increase its energy radiation gradually, in the order of magnitude of 10% per billion years. That means that the sun must have been a few percent less intense a few hundred million years ago. To be precise, 420 million years ago, it was about 50 W / m2 at approximately 1370 W / m2 of solar radiation according to the authors. Ergo, at that time  the earth should commonly have been somewhat colder than now.However, many rocks and fossils  from the long elapsed era suggest that the earth has been much warmer at times than is the case now. This can not reasonably have been caused by a weaker sun and so there had to be something else that made it possible and obviously,  this would allegedly be greenhouse effect. If that is true, it must also be possible to find a correlation between the reconstructed temperatures and concentrations of greenhouse gases, mainly CO2;  this study deals with the latter. Previously, the record was only rather coarse, with many more gaps and unsuitable for the support of the greenhouse’s hypothesis. But now we have this:Source: Foster et al., 2017 Nature doi: 10.1038 / ncomms14845.The blue line is the statistical average value of the various reconstruction plots for CO2. The red line shows its linear regression (curved because of the logarithmic scale). Based on this image, the authors argue that they are seeing a balance between the gradual decrease in CO2 concentration due to the ever-increasing intensity of solar radiation. If in the distant past, CO2 has indeed been able to increase the temperature to compensate for the weak sun, this would mean a significant climate sensitivity for CO2 doubling, and therefore they warn once more for the so-called thermageddon scenarios.But is that correct and can we check it? What we miss here is a detailed reconstruction of the temperature. We only see a coarse subdivision in the so-called greenhouses and icehouses in the black and white bar above the chart, with the blue indication of the lowest latitude reached by ice. This suggests a coarse correlation, but we must remember that the greenhouse gas should be linked directly to temperature as an interacting mechanism. Hence you can not tolerate millions of years in between.So if we really want to test this hypothesis, we need a more accurate temperature construction. This does not exist for the entire 420 million year, but we have detailed ‘proxy’ reconstructions for the last 65 million years, the Cenozoic era, and a recent one provided by Zachos et al 2008. It also seems long enough to be able to judge whether the CO2 and the climate are indeed even remotely correlated, certainly in comparison with the current disputes about a few hundredth of a degree per decennium.However,  finding the original data proved to be difficult, so I digitized the well-detailed graph itself. The resulting error is less than one percent, not enough for rocket science, but fine for finding correlations. This then produces the red curve in this graph:Figure 1. Horizontal X-axis in millions of years, 0 is present, Vertical Y-axis on the left is CO2 content in ppm, according to Foster et al 2017; plotted with different types of ‘proxies’ directly from their ‘supplemental data’; The scale is logarithmic, for a better comparison. To avoid clutter, data from the last million years have been omitted.  The blue curve is again plotted as the statistically significant average value (LOESS fit) Secondary Y-axis at the right right is for the proxy-modeled average temperature reconstruction of the Earth. This is the red curve.The question now is to what extent the red line of temperature reconstruction correlates with the blue line of CO2 reconstruction. We can see that in Figure 2. Here we have transformed the values of the LOES fit to their natural logarithm, again for better comparison, since the relation between concentration of greenhouse gas and its absorption is considered to be logarithmicFigure 2. The comparison of temperature and CO2 reconstructions throughout the Cenozoic in half-million-year steps: The horizontal X axis is the logarithm of the concentration of CO2 in ppm and the vertical Y axis shows the temperature reconstruction in degrees Celsius.The caveat is that the plots are still  very coarse and each one may misrepresent the average value of their time frame. However with several plots generally concurring, the confidence about the accuracy is not at its lowest. Normally, you would expect a curve or a more or less straight line without square corners so that every value on the x-axis has a unique value on the y-axis. Here in this case, however, we observe CO2 around 300 ppm at global temperatures between 12 and 20 degrees Celsius in the period 0-15Ma, or 24-25 degrees with the same concentration around 60 million years ago. Also, it can be stable 18-20 degrees Celsius with the CO2 concentration decreasing from some 850 ppm around 31 million years ago to around 300 ppm around 15 million years ago.Again, these reconstructions are too coarse for precise conclusions but it is obvious that they most certainly do not support the notion that CO2 was a (the most) dominant forcing of the temperature in the Cenozoic. Especially the early period, the Paleocene, from 65-55 million years ago had comparable CO2 levels than today but was more than ten degrees warmer. But if it wasn’t CO2, then what was it?Shifting of continents is not a good explanation, since the temperature reconstruction is based on proxies of the ocean. Maybe that Nikolov and Zeller can offer another explanation, with their hypothesis about planetary temperature dependance on surface pressure. So, how about an atmosphere with a slightly higher pressure at ground level, like for instance 1200 hPa at the surface, rather than 1013 hPa. This could happen due to differences in the balance of the oxygen and nitrogen cycles between the atmosphere, ocean and biota. This would also better explain how giant dragonflies could exist and how dinosaurs learned to fly. But it also might have caused a prolonged vertical temperature gradient or lapse rate, easily to more than 10 degrees above current surface temperature.Hence, it’s not that we need CO2 to explain a much warmer past.~~~~Dutch Version:Bijkerk-Klimaat ver verledenShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'decarbonization', 'EU', 'paleoclimate', 'Uncategorized']",2017/09/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/16/teslas-supply-chain-risks-the-cobalt-problem/,,Tesla’s Supply Chain Risks – The Cobalt Problem," Contributed by Robert Lyman © Sept. 2017Robert Lyman is a former Canadian public servant of 27 years experience; prior to that he was a diplomat for 10 years.Robert LymanJohn Petersen, a lawyer and expert on the technology and economics of battery storage in different applications, frequently writes articles for investors in which he analyzes the likely market performance of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and especially Tesla. In a September 12, 2017 article on the investment website Seeking Alpha, he commented on a recent report by Morgan Stanley on the impact that electric vehicles may have on the market for cobalt, a scarce metal needed for EV battery packs. This is a summary of his article. The Morgan Stanley market analysis makes several very optimistic assumptions about the future of electric vehicles. It assumes that: EV sales worldwide will increase from 1.1 million with 38 kWh battery packs in 2017 to 9.4 million with 47 kWh battery packs in 2025 (This is far below the projections of EV enthusiasts but well above the pace at which sales have been increasing to date).Cobalt supplies will increase rapidly due to aggressive mine expansion and all planned and proposed projects will be successful;Demand growth in industrial applications will remain sluggish;Demand growth in non-EV batteries will flat-line;Demand for stationary storage systems using cobalt-based lithium-ion batteries won’t materialize (i.e. no major use of electricity system-wide batteries);EV demand will ramp up at moderate rates and average battery pack sizes will remain small;Recycling of cobalt will contribute thousands of tons of cobalt to the supply chain each year. Petersen points out that the last assumption is particularly weak. There are no proven, cost-effective and readily deployable technologies for recycling lithium-ion batteries into battery-grade precursor materials. There also are no large-scale lithium-ion battery recycling facilities; building out the necessary infrastructure will take decades. Eliminating the recycling assumption means that yearly supply deficits of cobalt would start at 5.4% of global demand in 2017 and soar to 14.6% by 2025. The result will be highly volatile prices and bidding wars that will place severe stress on EV builders. Could a new battery technology come along that would reduce the need for cobalt? Petersen points out that it typically takes 10 years to move a battery technology from a Eureka! moment in the lab to the first commercial product; 10 more years to move from the first commercial product to a performance optimized product; and 10 more years to move from a performance optimized product to a cost optimized product. He next examined the fuel savings associated with different current EV battery technologies, ranging from hybrids to a high battery-capacity Tesla Model S. With a hybrid, or HEV, a single kWh of battery capacity can save up to 100 gallons of fuel per year. When batteries are used as a fuel tank replacement in an EV, a single kWh of battery capacity saves as little as 6 gallons of fuel per year, and most of the emissions saving at the vehicle level will be offset by increased emissions from power plants. He concludes that all-electric vehicles are “an unconscionable waste of scarce natural resources masquerading as conservation.”****The Petersen article adds some useful perspective to the EV numbers game that is constantly being played out in the press, where just about every week there is another article published claiming that in the near future all cars will be plug-ins.Here are some reference points.Three years ago, the International Energy Agency’s Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) report projected a global EV stock of 150 million, or 10% of the total vehicle stock, by 2030.In the ETP 2017 report, the IEA lowered its projection to 56 million EVs by 2030.In an October 2016 article on the Friends of Science blog, I projected that, based on actual sales to that point, the EV stock would be somewhere between 7.4 and 13 million by 2020.Based on sales to the middle of 2017, I projected that the total stock would be somewhere between 5.8 million and 6.5 million by the end of 2020.The Morgan Stanley report assumes an increase in EV sales at a remarkable pace, as indicated below:2017   –  1.1 million2018  –   1.6 million2019   –  2.2 million2020  –   2.9 million2021  –   3.1 million2022  –   4.0  million2023  –   5.8 million2024  –   6.9 million2025  –   9.4 millionAssuming no EVs are retired (highly unlikely), the global EV stock would thus rise as follows (end of year):2016 – 2 million2017 – 3.1 million2018 – 4.7 million2019 – 6.9 million2020 – 9.8 million2021 – 12.9 million2022 – 16.9 million2023 – 22.7 million2024 – 29.6 million2025 – 39 millionThat spectacularly fast rate of growth is consistent with the ETP 2017 projection.Petersen has shown that material shortages, mainly of cobalt, make such projections impossible. I would argue that there is no way governments will continue the massive subsidies now going to EVs. Currently, subsidies range from $5,000 to $15,000 per vehicle in different countries. Using the 2020 figure of 2.9 million sales, that would require subsidies of at least $14.5 billion in that year alone, and by 2025, the annual subsidies would rise to at least $47 billion.Oh, and by the way, by 2020, the total light duty vehicle stock in the world is expected to be about 1.3 billion. Even with 9.8 million EVs on the world’s roads, that would be 0.75% of the total vehicle stock.Near the end of this year, I will do another “scorecard” article on EVs.~~~~Related:Robert Lyman:A Tale Told by Numbers-World Vehicle TrendsEuan Mearns:How much more electricity do we need to go 100% electric vehicles?Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'electric vehicles', 'energy subsidies', 'Uncategorized']",2017/09/16
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/15/friends-of-science-issues-annual-report/,Ken Van de Burgt ,Friends of Science Issues Annual Report," Contributed by Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager © Sept. 2017Some people have been extremely curious about Friends of Science Society – so curious that they could not phone, email or send us a letter asking about our organization.Instead, they went to the most powerful trade enforcement agency in Canada – and not privately – publicly.  On Dec. 3, 2015, Ecojustice Canada Society, a federally registered charity, representing six high-profile signatories, demanded that the Competition Bureau investigate our tiny organization and recommended that we be thrown in jail for putting up billboards about science, because Ecojustice claimed the billboards were false and misleading.Their claim: Dec.-3-2015-.Application-to-Commissioner-of-Competition-re-Climate-science-misrepresentations.submittedLet’s deconstruct.There is a quirk in the law related to the Competition Bureau, described herein by lawyer Michael Osborne.  But since we are not a commercial group, and our ratio of influence is very small, as is our $150K annual budget, and the billboards complained about had run the year prior to the complaint, it’s hard to imagine that we were/are somehow stopping the $1.5 trillion/year global Big Climate Industrial Complex from moving into the #SmartGrowthCentury… or whatever we are supposed to be guilty of.Ecojustice rested much of its claim on the fact that the Ad Standards Council had received some 96 complaints about our billboards when they ran in French in Montreal.  Ad Standards Council had done a very extensive review of materials from ourselves and from some individuals representing the side of those complaining.  They had decided that our billboards should be more ‘nuanced’ and less definitive in the statements we made – so we complied! We did not object to their process and we were pleased when in the Ad Standards Council ruling, they did recognize our perspective in part saying: “global warming and climate change are caused by the serious effects of the sun and carbon dioxide.” (This is a direct quote from their letter to us, referred to in our Advertiser’s Verbatim Statement below.)3. The Ad Standards Council is a voluntary organization with no legal authority, but with an agreed upon Canadian Code of Advertising Standards for signatory media organizations.  The objective is for industry partners to maintain appropriate communications to the public and not misuse their Charter Right of Freedom of Speech to mislead – especially on topics where public safety or finances might be at risk (i.e. making unsubstantiated claims about potions or treatments related to health,  or advertising ‘come on’ deals at stores that offer only 1 item on sale but no other stock, etc.)  We complied with the Ad Standards Council’s process and feel they provide a valuable service to Canadians.Ecojustice still insistent on Sept 11, 2017, MONTHS after the start of their public campaign, that we should be investigated for ‘deep-pockets’ funding us. Friends of Science Society’s annual budget is about $150K/year.  Ecojustice? about $6 million.4. The public framing of these affairs has made it appear to some that Friends of Science Society has something to hide because to date we have not published an annual report like most charities do.  There is a simple answer as to why – we are not a charity. We do not and cannot issue tax receipts for any donation.  Consequently, people do not get a tax benefit when they donate to us. Public reporting of such details is not required (since there is no public tax subsidy at play). We do not fall under those charitable guidelines.5. Thanks to the Ecojustice high profile publicity about Friends of Science Society, we now have total strangers demanding that we reveal our sources of funding!What insatiable curiosity everyone suddenly has about a small non-profit that runs on $150K a year, powered by a handful of volunteers and consultants!Of course we don’t publish the names of our members, who are individuals and who donate the nominal funds for our operation.  Again, the reason is simple and two-fold.a) as a small non-profit with no charitable status, we are not required to.b) under Alberta’s PIPA – Personal Information and Privacy Act – by law we are forbidden to disclose without the person’s express consent; and privacy is also part of our agreement with our member/subscribers who receive our bimonthly Cli-Sci and Friends of Science Extracts. Our agreement is that their privacy will be protected. These terms are the same as with almost any organization you purchase subscriptions or services from whether it is Amazon, National Observer, Simons retail or American Express or other credit service. However, it seems hard for people to grasp that.6. So, after setting that context, here’s our Annual Report. The contents were presented in a public forum for members in Calgary on June 8, 2017, with a sandwich board outside advertising the event to the public, not behind closed doors. Enjoy this overview of our work and finances.Annual Report of 2016 JUNE 2017 for blog   Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Canadian charities', 'climate change', 'decarbonization', 'energy subsidies', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes', 'Leap Manifesto', 'Paris Agreement', 'Uncategorized', 'war on climate']",2017/09/15
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/13/the-cost-benefit-question-on-city-of-calgary-climate-change-plans/,,The Cost-Benefit Question on City of Calgary Climate Change Plans," In his book Decadent Societies, historian Robert Adams wrote, “[B]y the fifth century, men were ready to abandon civilization itself in order to escape the fearful load of taxes.”The City of Calgary has been actively engaged in incorporating climate change planning into almost every level of municipal culture.Sometimes citizen’s groups have been involved, like Sustainable Calgary.Sometimes Mayors have joined in international programs like the 2010 Greener Cities by Sir Richard Branson.But has anyone stopped to ask questions about the Cost-Benefit of some of these proposals and initiatives?  Do citizens even know what some aspects of ‘going green’ will cost them?Is ‘climate change’ too often a diversion of funds and attention from more serious municipal needs like flood mitigation, infrastructure, or homelessness?Friends of Science Society has issued two reports responding to the City of Calgary’s Climate Change Plan.The first is entitled: “City of Calgary – The Climate Cost-Benefit Question.”  It demonstrates the incremental path of rising costs.LINK:City of Calgary Climate Policy Cost Benefit Overview Sept 8 2017 FINAL AThe second report is entitled: “The Costs of Doing Something Wrong: An Evidence-based Review.” It examines the scientific claims about climate change data in the Calgary area and looks at some climate change policies in the context of geographic and climate norms and population densities of other global cities.We are often admonished that the cost of doing nothing might be catastrophic – but this report examines how the cost of doing something wrong is destructive to society overall.LINK:Calgary Climate Change Plan 3 REV FINAL sept 13 2017 By 2015, Calgary was $4 billion in debt.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/09/13/speaking-truth-to-power-responding-to-the-abacus-poll/,spock2009 ,SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER – RESPONDING TO THE ABACUS POLL," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant and former public servant of 27 years; a diplomat for 10 years prior to that.IntroductionRobert LymanDuring my long career in the Canadian federal government, a common instruction to policy advisors and managers was that we should “speak truth to power”, that is, to advise Ministers of all the implications of proposed policies whether good or bad or whether or not they aligned with the political preferences of the decision maker. This was sound advice to officials in a democracy, but following it sometimes involved risks to one’s career prospects. I was reminded of this when I read the recent (September 9, 2017) report of Abacus Data Inc. about Canadians’ opinions about oil, energy, pipelines and climate change. On a wide range of issues, an increasing number of Canadians are simply wrong. The reasons are not obvious. They may be misinformed or misled, or they may just never have taken the time to find out about energy issues beyond what they have read on social media. When I say “wrong”, I mean that the facts about what is now happening are different from their perceptions or that the probabilities about what will happen in future according to the most authoritative sources differ from their perceptions. In this article, I will try to “speak truth to power”, the power being the general public, who ultimately are the decision makers in our democracy. ApproachBecause of the complexity and number of issues, I cannot give each the attention it deserves. I will try to offer certain key facts, considerations or references to important documents, in the hope that people will consider the points and follow up on each, depending on their interest. While Abacus posed several questions during their surveys, there were seven main issues on which a large portion of the views were, in my judgment, incorrect. I will deal with them in the order that Abacus did in its press release. As a general comment, Abacus asked people to respond to two types of questions, one concerning what will happen and the other about what should happen in future. No one knows with certainty what will happen, but there are some authoritative sources of energy market analysis that are far more likely to come true than those that do not address these questions in a systematic way. The two sources I will use mainly here are the National Energy Board’s report entitled Canada’s Energy Future 2016: Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2040, and the United States Energy Information Administration’s International Energy Outlook to 2040. The NEB report can be found here:https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016/index-eng.html The Energy Information Administration’s report can be found here:https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/0484(2016).pdf The Gorilla in the Room – The Global Warming HypothesisIt seems clear that many Canadians are influenced by those who believe the hypotheses that humans are the main cause of climatic changes and that this will result in catastrophe. This view is accepted with almost religious fervor by a whole generation of people based on Al Gore’s movies and the constant reinforcement this view receives from an uncritical media. For those who still have an open mind, and want to understand whether, indeed, “the science is settled”, I recommend that they read the recent testimony of Dr. Judith Curry, an eminent climatologist, before the U.S. Congress. It can be found here:https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-115-SY-WState-JCurry-20170329.pdf Even if they continue to believe the science and the model projections, people should understand and question what governments are proposing as a policy response.  The United Nations claims that, to reduce the risks of global warming, the world’s people must stop using fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) as soon as possible, with a target of a 60% to 80% emissions reduction in the wealthier countries by 2050 and a 100% emissions reduction by 2100 for all countries.  Fossil fuels constitute 85% of the energy used in the world today, and there simply are no scientifically proven and commercially viable alternatives for many of those uses. Accepting the global warming catastrophe thesis and the policies now proposed thus means not just adopting a few low-cost energy efficiency measures, but imposing extremely high taxes and intrusive regulations on people’s lives and believing that governments can manage, through central planning, to achieve an unprecedented revolution in the energy system – all in 33 years. In an address that I gave to the Friends of Science in May 2017, I explained why this is not even possible. I invite people to read it here:http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/05/10/can-canada-survive-climate-change-policy/ The Abacus Survey versus Issues and Facts Abacus Survey: Oil demand will fall significantly.Issues and Facts: Oil demand in Canada is closely related to the growth in the needs of the population to transport people and goods. There is likely to be significant improvement in the fuel efficiency of light duty personal motor vehicles due to current regulations out to 2025, which will probably be sufficient to offset an increase in the number of these vehicles. However, oil use in transit vehicles and aviation for passenger transportation and in trucks, rail, and marine vessels for freight movement will continue to increase. The NEB projection is that, overall, Canadian transportation demand will grow from 2653 petajoules (PJ) in 2013 to 2858 PJ in 2040. Global oil demand is growing at the rate of over one million barrels per day per year due to increases in use in the less developed countries, and especially in Asia. The EIA projection is that global oil demand will grow from 90 million barrels per day in 2012 to 121 million barrels per day in 2040. Abacus Survey: Oil demand should fallIssues and Facts: This is a “values” opinion based, I can only assume, on people’s belief that the disadvantages of oil to people’s lives will outweigh the advantages. One might have received a different response if the question had been whether the person responding was willing to stop using all oil-fueled transportation now. Today, oil products meet over 98% of transportation needs. Electric vehicles constitute little more than 1% of total cars in Canada and in the world and they are more expensive and limited in range than the vehicles run on gasoline and diesel oil. There are no technologically available and commercially viable alternatives to oil in the trucking, rail, marine or aviation modes. The only way to curtail oil use is for governments to restrict people’s choices of how to move or transport goods. Current vehicles emit less than one per cent of the air contaminants that a 1970 model vehicle did. They are remarkably “clean”. Even if you believe that humans are causing catastrophic global warming, Canada accounts for only 1.6% of emissions in a world in which rapid emissions growth is occurring in the less developed countries and especially in Asia. Whether Canadians use more or less oil will have no effect on whether global emissions rise or on global temperatures. Abacus Survey: There should be more solar and wind energy in the energy mix 20 to 30 years from nowIssues and Facts: To say which energy sources should be produced or which energy services should be demanded by consumers substitutes a moral judgement for the free choices that producers and consumers make in competitive markets. It means, in effect, that people think governments should decide which products and services are supplied and demanded, without regard for the preferences of the generation utilities or the electricity consumers. If solar and wind energy sources are the lowest cost and most reliable sources of electricity generation, there is no reason why they would not grow in use. If they are not, then they will only grow when governments substitute their judgements for what people and business would freely choose, as in fact has happened in all the countries where solar and wind energy have gained market share. Both solar and wind energy are today more expensive than traditional energy generation sources like coal, hydroelectricity or natural gas. The jurisdictions that have built a significant amount of solar and wind capacity like those in Germany, Denmark and Ontario have among the highest electricity rates in the world, with hundreds of thousands of people suffering from energy poverty. See: https://www.fes.de/de/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=7772&token=146b5f8683f107dc36becf4aa5c6a1c703e8ef0b Solar and wind power are intermittent energy sources, meaning that they only produce electricity when the sun shines or the wind blows respectively. In contrast, the demand for electricity varies depending on the time of day and the season. Because renewable energy sources cannot be relied upon to provide electricity when it is needed, and electricity in bulk (i.e. large scale production) cannot be stored, utilities must build entire backup systems based usually on natural gas or coal to provide electricity supply when the renewables are not available. Consumers pay for both systems. Until the storage problem is solved (and it is nowhere close to being solved), solar and wind are too expensive and unreliable. Abacus Survey: Should new pipeline capacity be added in Canada?Issues and Facts:This question can be interpreted as either a normative (i.e. values-related) or analytical one. The values-related question is often cast in terms of global warming as discussed previously, although the linkages are very weak. Adding a major new oil pipeline system in Canada, like the proposed Energy East project that would cross the entire country, would not add even one one-thousandth to current global emissions, so logically it is irrelevant. I addressed many of the concerns that people might have about the likely effects of pipeline construction in a brief entitled, Moving Oil by Pipeline – Examining the Facts. Please read it here:http://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/11/27/moving-oil-by-pipeline-examining-the-facts/ The analytical question concerns what will be the market benefits if Canada builds more pipelines and what will be the costs, or disadvantages, if more pipeline capacity is not built. Oil and natural gas pipelines typically are multi-billion dollar energy infrastructure projects. In addition to providing the transportation capacity needed to move energy from where it is produced to where it is needed, pipelines have extremely large direct, indirect and induced economic effects of their own. During the construction stage, the main benefit is the income provided to the companies that supply and build pipelines and the materials needed for them, right across Canada, as well as the significant employment during the construction years. During the twenty-five or more years that a pipeline operates, it provides billions of dollars in revenues to the investors, the companies who supply it (and their employees) and to federal, provincial and local governments. Asking whether building a new pipeline is a good idea is like asking whether it would be a good idea to build a new port to allow more goods to be transported and traded. When there is not enough oil pipeline capacity, the production capacity that companies add has limited access to markets, so it sells at a discount in the markets that it does reach, thus reducing by hundreds of millions of dollars per year the revenues that come back to Canada. Producers and the refiners that need the oil find other ways to transport the oil, whether by railroad tank cars or barges, which is more expensive than pipelines and entails a higher risk of spills. The “bottom line” is that pipelines offer the cheapest, most reliable and safest way to move oil to market, and that stopping oil pipelines will only slow down oil development in one region, not stop it altogether. Abacus Survey: Reducing emissions is better than adding pipelinesIssues and Facts: By phrasing the statement this way, Abacus offered a false choice. Greenhouse gas emissions, whether in Canada or the world, are growing inexorably because the world’s demand for energy is growing and fossil fuels remain the lowest cost and most accessible sources of energy supply. The EIA International Energy Outlook made the following projections to 2040. First, worldwide energy use will grow continuously over the next three decades, led by strong increases in non-OECD areas and especially in Asia. In the EIA reference case, consumption grows 48 per cent from 2012 to 2040. Fossil fuels will still account for almost 80 per cent of energy use in 2040. Use of petroleum and other liquid fuels will grow from 90 million barrels per day in 2012 to 121 million barrels per day in 2040, while natural gas use will grow from 129 trillion cubic feet in 2012 to 203 Tcf in 2040. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will grow from 32.3 GT tons in 2012 to 43.2 GT in 2040, a 34% increase. 91% of the emissions growth will take place outside the OECD. None of this depends on whether Canada builds more pipelines. Abacus Survey: Do pipelines receive rigorous government oversight in Canada?Issues and Facts:In the previously mentioned paper entitled Moving Oil by Pipeline – Examining the Facts, I described the elaborate system of pipeline regulation currently in place in Canada at both the federal and provincial levels. Again, I urge people to read it. Sadly, many environmentalist organizations in Canada have attempted to undermine the reputation and credibility of the National Energy Board, Canada’s federal regulator of oil pipelines. The NEB was established in the 1950’s following a major public controversy over a pipeline. The government of the day judged rightly that decisions about whether and where to build pipelines should not be treated as political footballs. Instead, they should be decided, in the first instance, by an independent, professional regulatory body operating at arms’ length from the partisan political process. The National Energy Board was thus established to ensure that all public interest considerations – economic, environmental, safety, financial, and engineering – were considered on the record through public hearings and detailed technical review by experts. It has served this function well. Many environmentalists have unjustly attacked the NEB because they want decisions on pipelines to be made on partisan grounds, and they think climate change considerations should take precedence over all other public policy considerations. Abacus Survey: The pace of innovation in new forms of energy is quick, and Canada must be part of this new energy revolution, not fall behind because of a reliance on oilIssues and Facts:It should be obvious to any reader that, by phrasing the statement this way, Abacus injected a biased expectation into it. That alone should cause people to discount the validity of the poll answers. This statement grossly over-simplifies two separate questions, and implies a causal relationship that does not exist between use of oil products and the pace at which new energy services enter the marketplace. Science and technology involves five different stages: research, development, demonstration, dissemination and commercialization. There is no way to predict when a scientific discovery will be made in the laboratory and how long it will take to proceed through each of the following stages. The rapid pace of change in the information technology area is often falsely assumed to apply to all other areas of technology; it does not. If one examines the history of the use of energy and the rate at which new energy technologies have been able to penetrate the market to the point at which they fulfill at least 15% of a society’s needs, the average duration has tended to be at least thirty years, and much longer to achieve broader dissemination. Part of this is due to the inertia involved in replacing existing energy-using infrastructure: cars and trucks last about 10 years, residential and commercial buildings 50 to 75 years, and much of modern transportation infrastructure like highways and bridges up to 100 years. The real question is not whether new technology will penetrate the marketplace, but rather whether the pace of transformation will be driven by government subsidies and regulations that attempt to favour some technologies over others, picking “winners and losers”, at immense financial costs.  Governments historically have been terrible at centrally planning economies, as demonstrated by the failure of the former Soviet system. It is not clear why governments should be considered any better at picking the energy sources of the future.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Crude Oil', 'electric vehicles', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes', 'oil sands', 'Paris Agreement', 'solar energy', 'Uncategorized', 'wind farms']",2017/09/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/31/whos-number-1-the-race-to-be-the-worlds-highest-emitter/,,Who’s Number 1? The Race To Be The World’s Highest Emitter," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017A companion piece to an earlier post:India – The Next Greenhouse Gas Emissions GiantThere is so much written in the media about the efforts of the wealthier countries in the world like Canada to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that few ever think about the other side of the story, which concerns the fact that global emissions are growing. So, I thought I would take a look at the facts, that is, the data on emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent as compiled by British Petroleum for its 2017 Review of World Energy. The data cover the period 2006 to 2015.The facts don’t lie. They are just the facts.First, world emissions grew from 2006 to 2015 by 2.6 gigatonnes (Gt), or 1.6% per year, to reach 33.3 Gt in 2015.The world average hides significant differences among regions and countries. In Europe and Eurasia (i.e. including the Russian Federation and some other large northern Asia countries), emissions actually declined over the period by an annual average of -1.0 %, reaching 6.2 Gt by 2015. North America’s emissions also declined by an annual average of 1.0 % to reach 6.5 Gt by 2015. In every other region, emissions rose. In Africa, emissions rose by an average of 2.6% per year to 1.2 Gt by 2015. In South and Central America, emissions increased by 3.1 % per year to reach 1.4 Gt by 2015. In the Asia Pacific area, emissions increased by 3.6% per year to reach 15.9 Gt. Finally, in the Middle East, emissions rose the fastest, at the rate of 4.2% per year to reach 2.1 Gt by 2015. In short, during a period marked by the most serious recession since the Great Depression, emissions declined in most of the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) but rose in the newly industrializing and poorer countries.Historically, the United States was the largest GHG emitter, followed by Russia. The rapid expansion of China’s economy since 1990 has reversed roles. China surpassed the United States as the largest emitter in 2004 and by 2015 produced 9165 megatonnes (Mt), more than two thirds higher than the United States. China’s emissions grew at the average annual rate of 4.2% from 2005 to 2016.China, however, is just the head of the pack. There are several other countries with large and growing emissions, as indicated in the following table.Countries with High and Growing GHG EmissionsCountryGrowth Rate per year 2005-20152015 Emissions (Mt)India6.0 %2165South Korea2.3 %654Iran3.5 %617Saudi Arabia5.2 %612Indonesia3.7 %493Brazil4.0 %491South Africa0.7 %422Turkey4.1 %343There are a number of other countries, mainly in Asia, that have not yet reached the “heavyweight” class of emitters but which have very fast emissions growth rates. The following table provides some examples:Countries with Fast Growing EmissionsCountryGrowth Rate per year 2005-20152015 Emissions (Mt)Qatar10.3 %109Bangladesh7.3 %75Vietnam 6.8 %167Columbia5.8 %91Peru5.6 %49Algeria5.4 %136Turkmenistan 5.3 %83United Arab Emirates5.2 %275If the world experiences a period of prolonged economic recovery (i.e. a good thing), it is likely that the pace of emissions growth will accelerate in several of the countries listed here. It appears that the potential for significant emissions reduction is related to the stage of economic development that a country is in. Those that are in a post-industrial stage in which the service and knowledge industries dominate and in which people can afford to spend on environmental initiatives appear to have a higher likelihood of reducing emissions. Those that are still based on largely agrarian or pre-industrial industries continue to grow both their economies and emissions at slow rates. Those in or entering the stage of rapid industrialization seem likely to continue their fast emissions growth.It appears highly likely that India will continue the rapid expansion of its economy and increase its emissions, probably surpassing the United States in emissions within the next decade.

We are deeply concerned that investors, beneficiaries and the public are being misled on climate change issues related to investments, and that markets are being skewed in ways that favour geopolitical trade wars against Canadian corporate interests and against the Canadian public in general.  This issue of ‘climate disclosure’ is a crucial issue of economic sovereignty for Canada and our competitive place in energy geopolitics.About Friends of Science SocietyWe are a non-profit society made up of earth, atmospheric, solar scientists, Professional Engineers, economists and public policy experts.  We do not represent any industry. Our information is evidence-based.Climate Risk and DisclosureFollowing the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR5) of Sept. 2013, it was evident that for 15 years to the date of publication (2012) there had been no measurable rise in global temperatures (IPCC AR5 Working Group I, Physical Sciences, Chapter 9, Box 9.2. page 769), [1] despite a significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration.Disturbingly we find that UNPRI signatories like NEI Investments claim that since 2002, they have based their investment and climate risks on IPCC early findings.  Throughout UNPRI documents, there is common reference to a goal of maintaining earth’s global temperature rise to a 2°Celsius cap through greenhouse gas emissions reductions and the Paris Accord is cited as the tool by which this will be accomplished.  According to Ottawa energy policy consultant, Robert Lyman, achieving the aspirational goal of 80 per cent reduction recommended by the IPCC would mean reducing Canadian emissions to 147 megatonnes CO2 equivalent. That would be comparable to reducing Canada’s per capita emissions and our energy economy to the current levels of Bolivia, Sudan or Iraq. The UNPRI refer to the report of the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TFCD), a group which includes many high-profile investors in renewables (wind/solar).  The chair is Mr. Bloomberg. According to a Washington Times report of 2015, ‘green’ billionaires have funded the US Sierra Club for hundreds of millions of dollars to demarket coal and push for renewables and carbon taxes. [2] Indeed, in Canada, since 2011, the US Sierra Club, a minority shareholder in TransAlta, has been agitating for coal phase-out. (See Appendix C)The TFCD chair Michael Bloomberg is quoted on the TFCD website as saying: “Increasing transparency makes markets more efficient, and economies more stable and resilient.” —Michael R. Bloomberg, ChairIn fact, the experience in Canada is the opposite.  Canadian companies, particularly those in the oil sands, have voluntarily complied with GHG reporting in good faith, only to have their reporting used against them in a vicious, global, demarketing program driven by large Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations (ENGOs), that are often funded by large foundations or investors in renewables or who are seeking to establish additional cap and trade systems. (See Oak Foundation screen shots Appendix D). The 2016 CDP report “In the Pipeline” ranks Canadian oil sand majors at the bottom, despite many environmental innovations, Combined-Heat-Power developments and GHG reductions. [3]Alberta coal-fired power producers also complied with voluntary disclosure; they have been run out of business by an offshore funded campaign of fear about health consequences and costs.  In fact, the evidence of numerous peer-reviewed reports show that coal emissions are a minor factor in air quality in Alberta.  The Alberta power market is in chaos and NEI Investments and related signatories have influenced the Alberta government to adopt an extremely ambitious renewable energy plan (to adopt some 5,000 MW of wind/solar, replacing coal with 2/3 generation by renewables. This ratio of generation by renewables has not been accomplished anywhere in the world.)2. Climate Models (Computer simulations) Falsely Attribute Recent Warming to Human GHG emissions; not reported or referred to in UNPRI MaterialsThe IPCC AR5 report contains valuable information showing that climate models (models are computer simulations) upon which the UNPRI climate disclosure action is predicated, are falsely representing warming as if it was a result of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. [4]Appendix One of this document shows a graph from the IPCC AR5 report and describes how climate simulations/models that remove the human greenhouse gas factor, demonstrate that natural influences most closely parallel the observed temperatures. This means that the IPCC shows human greenhouse gas emissions are NOT the main driver of global warming.  The appendix also discusses how solar activity more closely parallels changing climate patterns and over longer time scales.In no part of the UNPRI letter submitted to you, in their annual report or in the TFCD document, do we find any reference to this material or the fact that there are vast uncertainties about causes and ratios of human vs natural influences on climate change.  To the contrary, in Canada, the Koskie Minsky report “Climate Change and the Fiduciary Duties of Pension Fund Trustees in Canada” [5] on climate disclosure, released in of Sept. 2015, Canadian pension fund trustees and managers are told in no uncertain terms “climate change denial is not an option.”Friends of Science Society issued two reports responding to this position.DOWNLOAD LINK for Friends of Science Society Reports: CLICK HEREOR CLICK ON the following images below.           DOWNLOAD LINK for UNPRI Annual Report 2016: PRI_AR-2016OR CLICK ON the image below.Footnotes to the above excerpt of the letter:[1] Flato, G., J.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/21/india-the-next-greenhouse-gas-emissions-giant/,,India – The Next Greenhouse Gas Emissions Giant," Contributed by Robert Lyman ©2017IntroductionThe discussion about whether Canadians must sharply reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to avoid human-induced catastrophic global warming often lacks a sense of context. “Context” refers to the setting, or broader circumstances, in which an event takes place. For example, as the (alleged) problem is a global one, how much Canadians should do and spend to reduce emissions partly depends on what other countries in the world will do.The largest GHG emitter in the world is China. According to the U.S. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, in 2014 (the most recent year for which data is available), China’s carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from fossil fuel burning, cement production and natural gas flaring were 2.7 gigatonnes (Gt), almost twice those of the United States (1.43 Gt). In third place stands India.Source: Boden, T.A., Marland, G., and Andres, R.J. (2017). National CO2 Emissions from Fossil-Fuel Burning, Cement Manufacture, and Gas Flaring: 1751-2014, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, doi 10.3334/CDIAC/00001_V2017.This note will provide information about what India is now doing and is likely to do with respect to GHG emissions as one element of the context within which Canadians should consider their choices.India’s EconomyIndia is renowned for its large and diverse population and for the significant economic transformation it has made in the last thirty years, especially since adopting a more market-based approach to economic planning in 1990. It is a developing country with a per capita GDP of around USD $1,408 per year. It is also the second largest country in the world in terms of population (1.2 billion); it may soon overtake China in this regard.Despite its recent economic progress, India remains a very poor country. It has the largest proportion of the global poor (30%) and around 24% of the global population who have no access to electricity (304 million). About 30% of the world’s population relying on solid biomass (wood and dried animal dung) for cooking live there. Ninety-two million Indians lack access to safe drinking water. About 363 million Indians live in desperate poverty, lacking most of the things that people living in Canada take for granted. The country faces an immense infrastructure deficit. In short, it has many priorities for its population other than reducing GHG emissions.Energy & Emission TrendsAccording to the British Petroleum Review of World Energy, in 2016 India consumed 724 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoes) in primary energy. Consumption was divided among coal, with 412 million Mtoes (57%); oil, with 213 million Mtoes (29%); natural gas, with 45 million Mtoes (6%); hydro-electricity, with 29 million Mtoes (4%); biomass and other renewables, with 17 million Mtoes (2%); and nuclear energy with 9 million Mtoes (1%).Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2017.Over the period 2006 to 2016, primary energy consumption grew from 414 million Mtoes to 724 Mtoes, an increase of 75%.Coal has experienced the lion’s share of the growth in energy use. Coal consumption grew from 219 Mtoes in 2006 to 412 Mtoes in 2016, an increase of 193 Mtoes, or 88%. Over that period, new coal plants entering production added 143 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity. In 2015, India surpassed the United States to become the second largest coal consumer in the world (after China).This promises to continue well into the future. Sixty-five gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired generation are now under construction, with an additional 178 GW in the planning stage. A recent press report noted that India’s construction of new coal plants and other generation capacity has gotten ahead of current demand projections, and that 13.7 GW of planned capacity additions have been cancelled While this was treated as news that India had forsaken coal for solar energy, it only meant that about 8% of the planned construction has been deferred. A massive expansion continues.Consumption of “other renewables” (including wind, solar, geothermal and waste) also increased sharply but from very low levels. In 2006, consumption was 3.3 Mtoes, and this increased to 16.5 Mtoes by 2016. Although this was a large increase in percentage terms (400%), by the end of the period these renewables still constituted only 2.3% of primary energy consumption.While energy consumption has increased, the energy intensity of the Indian economy decreased from 18.16 grams of oil equivalent (goe) per Rupee of GDP in 2005 to 15.02 goe per Rupee of GDP in 2012, a decline of over 2.5 % per year. This is due to increased energy efficiency, urbanization and a government mandate that all new large coal-based generating stations must use highly efficient supercritical technology.India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)Under the 2015 COP21 agreement, all participating countries must submit “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDC’s) stating their plans to reduce GHG emissions, and to update these plans every five years. In its INDC provided to the United Nations in the fall of 2015, the government of India stated that it planned to substantially reduce the “emissions intensity” of the economy.In the INDC, India said it would:Aim to achieve a target of 60 GW of wind power installed capacity by 2022.Increase solar power capacity to 100 GW by 2022.Increase biomass energy installed capacity to 10 GW by 2022.Achieve 63 GW of nuclear capacity by 2022 “if supply of fuel is assured.”Enhance energy efficiency.By 2030, increase the share of “clean energy” in the total energy mix by “as much as 40%.”According to the INDC, India has imposed a tax on coal equivalent to USD $2 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, recently imposed a tax on gasoline equivalent to USD $140 per tonne and one on diesel fuel of USD $64 per tonne.The COP21 Agreement does not bind any country to achieve a specific emissions reduction target. While several governments have volunteered to pursue certain targets, India’s INDC makes it clear that it is not legally bound by its plan:“It is clarified that India’s INDC do not bind it to any sector specific mitigation obligation or action, including in the agricultural sector. India’s goal is to reduce overall emissions intensity and improve energy efficiency of its economy over time and at the same time protecting the vulnerable sectors of economy and segments of our society.” In the section on finance requirements, India’s INDC makes clear that its pursuit of emissions reduction depends on external sources of funding.“Preliminary estimates indicate that India would need around USD $206 billion (at 2014-15 prices) between 2015 and 2030 for implementing adaptation actions in agriculture, forestry, fisheries infrastructure, water resources and ecosystems…An Asian Development Bank Study on assessing the costs of climate change adaptation in South Asia indicates that approximate adaptation cost for India in energy sector alone would roughly be about USD $7.7 billion in the 2030s… Estimates by NITI Aayog (National Institute for Transforming India) indicate that the mitigation activities for moderate low carbon development would cost around USD $834 billion until 2030 at 2011 prices.India’s climate actions have so far been largely financed from domestic resources. A substantial scaling up of the climate action plans would require greater resources. A detailed and full-scale assessment of international climate finance needs will be finalized at a later stage and would depend on the gap between actual cost of implementation of India’s plans and what can be made available from domestic sources. While this would evolve over time, a preliminary estimate suggests that at least USD $2.5 trillion (at 2014-2015 prices) will be required for meeting India’s climate change actions between now and 2030.”What This MeansPaul Homewood, the British analyst who writes articles on global warming in his blog Not a Lot of People Know That wrote an insightful piece on India’s INDC shortly after it was submitted in October 2015. He pointed out that:No actual carbon dioxide emission reduction target was set.India’s commitment (such as it is) is only to 40% renewables electricity generation capacity, not generation. As renewables have low rates of utilization, the amount generated by them will be much lower than 40%.India’s plan is to reduce the carbon intensity of GDP by 33% by 2030, but almost half of this was already achieved between 2005 and 2015.Homewood also provided a useful calculation of what it would mean in terms of actual emissions if India achieved its intended improvement in emissions intensity. India’s GDP in 2014 was 106 trillion rupees and the Indian government projects it to reach 397 trillion rupees by 2030. According to British Petroleum, India’s emissions in 2014 were 2,088 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This means that, if the economy’s emissions intensity does not change, India’s emissions by 2030 would be 7,820 million tonnes, but with a 19% reduction in intensity, emissions would be 6,334 million tonnes. In other words, even if India meets its emissions intensity goal, emissions would still be three times as high in 2030 as they are today.Using BP’s methodology for calculating carbon dioxide emissions, in 2016 the United States produced 5,053 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and that total is declining. Under its INDC, by 2030 India’s emissions would far surpass those of the United States. Further, India has made no commitment that those emissions will decline after 2030.India has been one of the most assertive of the less developed countries in demanding that western countries provide much increased assistance in the form of funding and technology transfer to help other countries reduce emissions. One of the principal mechanisms for transferring funds is the Green Climate Fund first approved at the Copenhagen Climate Conference. The Annex II parties to the COP21 Agreement, including Canada, are expected to pay $100 billion per year into this fund, starting in 2020. India’s estimate that it would need at least USD $2.5 trillion in financial assistance from 2015 to 2030 for its mitigation efforts means that India is staking a claim to $167 billion per year, far more than the Green Climate Fund calls for.The withdrawal of the United States from the COP21 agreement means that the likelihood of the Green Climate Fund achieving its funding goals approaches zero.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Paris Agreement']",2017/08/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/17/climate-change-policy-and-confederation/,,Climate Change Policy and Confederation," Robert LymanContributed by Robert Lyman © August 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant with 27 years of experience as a public servant and prior to that, 10 years of experience as a diplomat.In May 2017, I gave a speech to a conference organized by the Friends of Science in which I attempted to answer the question, “Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?” I acknowledged then that many people would be surprised to hear the question phrased that way. However, I went on to explain why the political controversies surrounding climate change policies now and in the future might pose challenges to national unity. As time passes, I have become even more convinced of the risks.The actual and potential stresses on national unity related to climate change policy arise from three sources: promotion by governments and environmental advocates of overly ambitious greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction targets; the consequent large burden of costs placed upon resource industries in certain regions; and the forthcoming controversy about the disparity in regional effects of the carbon tax vs. cap-and-trade approaches to pricing carbon dioxide emissions.The Consequences of Emission Reduction TargetsCanadian governments have been participating in international discussions on climate change since the late 1980’s, largely under the auspices of the United Nations and its subsidiary organizations such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). There have been 22 conferences of the Parties under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. As a result of Canada’s participation in that process, successive federal governments have committed to accept targets for emissions reduction. At present, these targets are political, not legally binding, commitments; they are to reduce GHG emissions by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020, 30% by 2030 and at least 50% (and up to 80%) by 2050. Various provincial governments have also adopted emission reduction targets, different from, and sometimes more demanding than, those adopted federally.The emission reduction targets apply in absolute terms; they are not, in other words, commitments to reduce the emissions intensity of the Canadian economy, but rather commitments to absolute reductions, ignoring the consequences of increasing population and national income. In a sense, they constitute a gamble that, by taking extraordinary policy and regulatory measures, Canada will be able to accelerate the application of new, more energy-efficient technologies fast enough to more than offset the emissions increases normally resulting from population and economic growth.The ready acceptance of ambitious goals for transforming today’s energy economy are often based on a misunderstanding of how long it takes for such transitions to occur, plus very optimistic claims of imminent technology breakthroughs. The evidence of history, as well documented by Professor Vaclac Smil of the University of Manitoba, is that energy transitions take a long time. He conducted a comprehensive study of energy transitions in which he measured how long it typically takes for a particular energy source to go from 5 per cent of the market to claim a large share (25 to 30 percent) of total supply. The repeated answer is that it takes decades, even in wealthy countries where there is a high rate of investment and a generally open attitude towards new technologies. He notes, “Energy infrastructure is the world’s most elaborate and expensive, and the longevity and inertia of many large energy enterprises make it impossible for any large, complex national system (to say nothing of the global level) to reconfigure itself even in three or four decades.” Cars typically have useful 10-year lives, industrial equipment 20-year lives, residential buildings 50-year lives, and major infrastructure like bridges or even nuclear power plants longer still. It is even less believable that governments, rather than competitive market forces, could manage to quickly increase the market share held by one or two energy commodities, let alone achieve the complete changeover of the energy system.Given this inertia, the current pattern of emissions by economic sector is likely to continue for some time. In Canada, the emissions associated with oil and gas production have the highest share, and constitute 24% of the total. Those resulting from transportation account for 23%, from buildings 12%, from electricity generation 11%, from heavy industry 10%, from agriculture 10% and from waste and other sources 7%. Achieving the 2020 target is challenging enough, but it might be attainable through reductions in each sector. The 2030 target will be a significant stretch, especially if the Canadian economy grows faster than expected. The 2050 targets, however, would essentially entail eliminating all emissions from electricity generation, oil and gas production, heavy industry and most of transportation. All of that would have to occur within 33 years.The regional consequences of this would be devastating for Canada’s resource and manufacturing sectors. The elimination of coal, oil and natural gas as sources of electricity generation would significantly increase electricity rates in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, just as it has in Ontario. Blocking oil and gas development and production would remove the largest source of income and economic growth in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador and the northern territories. Shutting down heavy industry would mean closing the manufacturing plants that have long been the sources of much income and employment in central Canada – mining and metals, petrochemicals, auto and parts manufacturing, iron, steel, and cement to name a few. It is very difficult to believe that the people affected and the provincial and territorial governments would accept this without sharp resistance.Already today, the opposition from environmentalist groups and their supporters in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec to the construction of new oil and natural gas pipelines has demonstrated how ferocious can be the political conflicts over climate policy. In the case of projects like the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, already approved by the National Energy Board and the federal Cabinet after a lengthy and rigorous regulatory review, the opponents in British Columbia have made clear their willingness to erect interprovincial trade barriers that would harm Alberta’s producers. Such actions are probably illegal, as will be tested in the courts; they certainly are contrary to the principles of fair interprovincial trade that have long been understood to be part of the Confederation “bargain.”The Imposition of Large Costs on Fossil Fuel Production and ConsumptionIn the near term, the greatest stresses from climate policy on Canada’s regional economies will probably result from the use of taxes and other fees to increase the cost of fossil fuel use and the thus discourage emissions. British Columbia and Alberta have already imposed carbon taxes and the federal government has announced a national carbon tax. The federal tax will be applied at the rate of $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent starting in 2018, rising by $10 per year until it reaches $50 per tonne in 2022. Of course, the tax increases will not stop there, but will probably continue indefinitely. Ten dollars per tonne is equivalent to 2.3 cents per litre of gasoline, so $50 per tonne would equal 11.5 cents per litre. That would raise several billions of dollars per year in revenues.The former National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy, in a 2012 report, projected that a carbon tax of at least $300 per tonne would be needed to meet the 2050 target. Even that seems inadequate to the task. In Norway, automotive fuel (mostly diesel oil) already costs CDV (Canadian Dollar Value) $2.29 per litre. One would need a carbon tax of over $500 per tonne to raise Canadian gasoline prices that high. Yet, car fuel consumption in Norway continues to rise.The incremental effects of raising carbon taxes will be to reduce the returns to the fossil fuel exporting companies, as Canadian producers have to sell their output in competition with sources from other countries, including the United States, where such taxes will not apply. They cannot pass the costs of the taxes on in the form of higher prices. Over time, this will progressively diminish the profitability and ultimately the economic viability of production here. Ironically, by disadvantaging Canadian fossil fuel producers, governments would be depriving themselves of one the largest current sources of corporate income tax and royalty revenue.At which point would such taxes produce strenuous pushback from the populations and governments of the affected provinces? I doubt we will have to wait long to see.Interprovincial DisparitiesThe federal carbon tax will apply on all provinces that are not already pricing carbon at an equivalent rate. Thus, British Columbia and Alberta will be exempt so long as they meet or exceed the federal rate. Also exempt will be provinces operating a cap-and-trade system, provided certain conditions are met. Quebec is now a partner with California in a cross-border carbon trading system called the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), and Ontario plans to join the WCI soon. Nova Scotia has announced that it will set up its own stand-alone cap-and-trade system.As Quebec’s cap and trade system is closely integrated with California’s, the price of an emissions permit goes up and down with the supply and demand for such permits in California, the larger market. The carbon permit price is currently about CDN $17 per tonne, well above the Canadian federal carbon tax rate of $10 per tonne in 2018.The California cap-and-trade system has been very unpopular with industries there, even though the state went to considerable lengths to create an oversupply of emissions permits and to establish other flexibility mechanisms that would keep permit prices relatively low during the first few years the system operated. It now faces a potentially serious legal problem. The legislative authority for the system is set to expire at the end of 2020. Reportedly, any extension that includes government-run auctions of the emissions permits – a critical element in political terms there – would likely require a two thirds “supermajority” under Proposition 26. If the state attempts to proceed without new legislation, it will undoubtedly be challenged in the courts. This adds considerable uncertainty as to whether and how the California cap-and-trade system will work in future.Assuming the political and legal issues in California are resolved, the forces that will drive the price of carbon under the California system will likely remain quite different from those governing the Canadian carbon tax. According to projections by CaliforniaCarbon.Info, an online carbon market research firm, there will be an increasing gap between the WCI carbon prices and the Canadian tax, as illustrated in the following table:Carbon Charges by Jurisdiction (CDN $ per tonne)20182019202020212022Quebec/Ontario (in WCI)18.1018.8219.8622.1323.70Alberta/B.C. (not in WCI)30.0030.0030.0040.0050.00Canada federal10.0020.0030.0040.0050.00So, we may face a situation where, as early as 2020, there will be a large and growing difference between the carbon charges paid by the provinces that are part of the WCI and those that are not. One can imagine the displeasure of people in Alberta and Saskatchewan if, by 2022, they are paying much higher taxes than people in Quebec and Ontario, especially if by then the central provinces still oppose the construction of pipelines to deliver western oil to the east coast.Under the federal government’s carbon tax policy, provinces with cap-and-trade systems will only be exempted from the minimum tax rate if two conditions are met. The first is that the province’s 2030 emissions reduction target must be in line with the federal target of a 30% reduction from a 2005 base. This is true for Ontario and Quebec. The second is that a cap-and-trade province must have annual emissions targets for 2022 that “correspond, at a minimum, to the projected emissions reductions resulting from the carbon price that year in price-based systems.” So permit prices and carbon taxes have to produce the same result. This seems to mean that they have to be the same, but it is not clear. The standard has been left deliberately vague.In this vagueness lies the potential for much political negotiation behind the scenes. Would Justin Trudeau, the current Prime Minister, force Quebec and Ontario to accept higher prices than these provinces had thought they had guaranteed for themselves by participation in the WCI? Would the other provinces, especially in western Canada, accept any less than equal tax treatment, however that was achieved? Such extremely sensitive political issues could become constitutional issues if they gave to secessionist forces in any part of the country the justifications they seek.The risks of growing disparities between federal carbon prices and WCI cap and trade prices, further, do not run in only one direction. In an August 9, 2017 article in the Financial Post, Peter Shawn Taylor pointed out that, over time, California’s commitment to reduce state GHG emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 exceeds the targets set by Ontario and Quebec. In order to obtain legislative approval of this goal, which will involve sharply reducing the supply of emissions permits over time (i.e. raising the price), California Governor Jerry Brown agreed to provide substantial tax breaks to farmers and other state businesses. By 2025, when the state’s permit surplus is expected to largely disappear, the WCI permit prices could be pushed above $70 per tonne, which could be higher than the federal Canadian carbon tax. Thereafter, there may be a race between WCI permit prices and rising federal carbon taxes, with the WCI permit prices driven by California policies and economy, and the federal carbon tax determined by whichever party is in power in Ottawa.ConclusionIt bears remembering that GHG emissions in Canada constitute a mere 1.6% of the global total. For those who view with skepticism the entire controversy over alleged human influences on the climate, it beggars the imagination that the people of Canada might willingly imperil its economy, and potentially its unity, over the question of how much to reduce emissions of a gas when the global effects of whatever Canada does can only be negligible.Sadly, the risks are far greater than most people know.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'British Columbia', 'climate change', 'Ontario', 'Quebec']",2017/08/17

David Eggen, Minister of Education, by an anonymous Alberta Professional Engineer.Installing solar panels on our schools is probably a good plan as students should be aware of the photovoltaic production of emission-free electricity. But students should be given information about the financial implications of renewable energy. In Alberta, our coal power plants produce electricity for ~2 cents per kWh. The October 19, 2016 newspaper article [in the Financial Post] regarding Kingston Solar described a 100 MW project costing over $600 million with a purchase power agreement paying a Feed in Tariffs (FIT) of 45 cents per kWh.Financial Post – Terence Corcoran: Solar power for city-dwelling dummiesStudents must be told that solar power will significantly increase the cost of electricity in Alberta and as adults they will be looking a larger electricity power bills. FIT is one way to finance solar electricity and the other option is to provide capital financial subsidies for solar projects. But capital cost subsidies will become part of Alberta’s long-term debt and as adults, students will face increased provincial taxation to pay off that debt.Solar, after nuclear, is the most capital-intensive renewable energy with an average capacity factor of less than 15%. Alberta wind power (see AESO 2015 report) has an average capacity factor around 30% – double that of solar. Alberta should not finance and install major solar projects that only [produce power] 15% of the time. If we must go into debt, nuclear power at 100% capacity factor would be the better long-term investment, providing our transmission lines are capable of moving power about the province.It is well-known that Ontario’s experience with renewable energy has significantly increased the cost of electricity for the province. While financial malfeasance is not on the table, the Ontario public is pushing back against the government’s renewable energy costs.Major solar power expenditures could/would be a huge financial mistake for Alberta.Signed,(Name withheld)P.Eng.

Energy Economy – by the Numbers," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017British Columbia, like Quebec and Manitoba, is fortunate to have large natural resources that permit very high production of electricity from hydroelectric sources. In fact, about 94% of British Columbia’s electricity generation comes from hydroelectric and other renewable energy power sources. The problem is that electrical energy only represents about 20% of the total energy consumed in British Columbia (source: Globe Foundation).BC runs on fossil fuels. Only 20% of energy consumed in BC is electrical.Photo Credit: By The original uploader was Kelownian Pilot at English Wikipedia – Transferred from en.wikipedia to Commons by Arsenikk using CommonsHelper., CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7570182It is difficult to find current data concerning the energy consumption in British Columbia by source. In 2000, 33 % was supplied by oil and propane, 26 % was supplied by natural gas 20% was supplied by the burning of wood wastes and the rest was supplied by coal and coke.  (source: Globe Foundation) Environment Canada’s data on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by energy source offers a glimpse into the energy consumption by sector and fuel. In 2016 (the most recent year for which data is available), energy-related GHG emissions were 50.5 megatonnes (Mt), up 19.5% from the 42.2 Mt in 1990, but down 2.3% from the 51.7 MT in 2005. This shows the effects of the economic recession. Source: Environment Canada) About half the 2016 emissions arose from the transportation sector (25.5 Mt), virtually all resulting from the combustion of oil products; 74% of the transportation emissions were from road uses (personal and freight). Transportation emissions have grown 36% since 1990.

In all cases except agriculture, emissions have risen since 1990; in agriculture, they declined slightly. (source: Environment Canada) Car sales have stayed largely flat since 1990, but truck sales are up 43% (from 103,000 vehicles to 147,000 vehicles). (source: Statistics Canada) Average household energy use in B.C. is led by natural gas with 81 gigajoules per household, followed by wood and wood pellets (71 gigajoules), oil (47 gigajoules), electricity (36 gigajoules) and propane (26 gigajoules). B.C. has two operating oil refineries, at Burnaby and Prince George. They rely primarily on crude oil supplied from Alberta. About 50% of the refined oil consumed in B.C is gasoline, 24% is diesel fuel, 20 % is aviation fuel and 6% is heavy fuel oil. Claims that all commuter transport could be switched to mass transit and all freight transport could be switched to rail ignores the fact that most of the province consists of smaller communities that could not afford transit and are not accessible by rail. (source: Blair King, “Dispelling Myths about British Columbia’s Energy Picture”) Shipping and ports are extremely important elements of the B.C. energy supply picture. In 2011, Port Metro Vancouver shipped 6,671,000 metric tonnes of petroleum products, which represents about 8% of the total tonnage exported out of Vancouver. At present, about 3,160 vessels call at the port each year. While that might seem like a lot, the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, slightly smaller in the area of land and water than Vancouver, sees about 30,000 seagoing vessels per year, or about 80 per day.

Rotterdam Partners see the economic competitiveness of the port in glowing terms:“Foreign investorsRotterdam Partners was in 2014 actively involved in attracting 40 international companies to the Rotterdam region. They include NICO, ZPMC, Navigators, Pure Fix Cycles and The Venture Generator. These international companies account for at least 34.9 million euros in investment and 797 jobs, 442 of which are new jobs. Most of the companies that decided to locate to Rotterdam in 2014 operate in the Technology & Industrial, Oil, Gas & Chemical, Transport & Logistics and Business Services sectors. As in previous years, most of the new projects came from the Asia region. China is the largest contributor from this region with twelve companies. The number of foreign companies that opened their first location in the Netherlands broke a record at 25.” Wikipedia describes the port as: “Covering 105 square kilometres (41 sq mi), the port of Rotterdam now stretches over a distance of 40 kilometres (25 mi). It consists of the city centre’s historic harbour area, including Delfshaven; the Maashaven/Rijnhaven/Feijenoord complex; the harbours around Nieuw-Mathenesse; Waalhaven; Vondelingenplaat; Eemhaven; Botlek; Europoort, situated along the Calandkanaal, Nieuwe Waterweg and Scheur (the latter two being continuations of the Nieuwe Maas); and the reclaimed Maasvlakte area, which projects into the North Sea.Rotterdam consists of five distinct port areas and three distribution parks that facilitate the needs of a hinterland with 40,000,000 consumers.” British Columbia ports now see themselves as vital links in the infrastructure that supports the import and export of goods between Canada and Asia. This growth in trade will yield very large economic benefits to the province, unless of course local opposition blocks it. (source: Province of British Columbia White Paper on Energy Policy in BC 2013) British Columbia now accounts for only 5-10 % of Canada’s natural gas production, but with the discovery of new extraction techniques, it is estimated that there are almost 40 trillion cubic metres of gas in place in unconventional shale, coal methane reserves and other large gas–bearing shale in the Horn River Basin, Cordova Embayment, Liard Basin and Montney play areas. If only 20% of this is recoverable, it could add 280 trillion cubic feet to the province’s recoverable natural gas supply. (source: Province of British Columbia White Paper on Energy Policy in BC 2013) The province has already benefitted from the sizeable Crown royalties and corporate income taxes generated from natural gas production and exports. Annual revenues have exceeded $1 billion per year, peaking at over $2 billion in 2008. In addition, between, 1993 and 2012, bonus bids from the sale of exploration and production rights totaled about $10 billion. (source: British Columbia White Paper on Energy Policy 2013) Will the province walk away from the much higher levels of revenues potentially available from shale gas development? 24.5 million tonnes of coal were extracted in British Columbia and exported in 2015. (source: Bringing Perspective blog). The province’s coal reserves are immense, estimated to be in the range of 25 billion tonnes. B.C. is the third largest exporter of metallurgical coal in the world. While coal is not used for power generation in the province, B.C. coal serves the needs of Asian economies. (source: British Columbia White Paper on Energy Policy 2013) Now, there is discussion of restricting export sales through taxes or quotas. That sounds like shooting oneself in the foot.Port of Vancouver – powered by fossil fuelsPhoto Credit: By No machine-readable author provided.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/11/transportation-of-oil-natural-gas-in-north-america-by-the-numbers/,,Transportation of Oil & Natural Gas in North America – by the Numbers," Robert LymanContributed by Robert Lyman © August 2017Robert Lyman is an Ottawa energy policy consultant with 27 years of experience as a public servant and prior to that, 10 years of experience as a diplomat.Almost every day, we read about environmentalist activists trying to block the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines and marine ports for oil and natural gas liquids tankers in Canada. When these matters are debated on social media, the activists claim that there are unacceptably high risks associated with every project. Every “worst case” in the past somehow becomes the “most likely case” in the future, according to their claims. With this in mind, it might be useful to recall the most recently available factual information from a number of authoritative sources.Pipeline ConstructionPipeline and Gas Journal is the main petroleum industry journal in North America. Every year, it publishes the results of its surveys and information received from other countries about the number of pipelines planned or under construction in the world. The Journal’s recently published 2017 survey indicates that 83,802 miles of pipelines are planned or under construction world-wide. Of these, 38,390 miles include projects in the engineering or design phase and 45,412 miles are in various stages of construction.Within North America (Canada, the United States and Mexico), 15,279 miles of pipeline are under construction and an additional 16,535 miles are in the planning and design stages.Contrary to environmentalist claims, the North American and global pipeline systems are expanding at a rapid pace, with very few being held up because of alleged environment-related concerns.Pipeline SafetyThe federal governments of Canada and the United States regulate the safety of oil and natural pipelines that cross interstate or inter-provincial borders or international borders. The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) in the United States publish regular reports.The most recent report of the TSB is for 2016. The following are the key statistics from that report, which covers all federally regulated pipelines in Canada.In 2016, the federally regulated pipeline system transported 1.2 billion barrels of oil along about 18,500 km of pipelines. That year, natural gas pipelines transported 6.5 trillion cubic feet along approximately 53,346 km of pipelines.The board maintains statistics on both “accidents” and “incidents.” Accidents are those that result directly from the operation of a pipeline where a person is killed or seriously injured, or the pipeline sustains damage affecting its safe operation. Incidents are all reportable pipeline occurrences other than pipeline accidents.In 2016 there were zero (yes, ZERO) pipeline “accidents” in Canada. That is the same number as occurred in 2015.In 2016 there were 101 pipeline incidents, comparable to 100 reported in 2015. 57 of the 101 incidents involved no release of product. Of the 42 incidents that recorded a release of natural gas:6 involved a release of less than 1 cubic metre.19 involved a release of 1-25 cubic metres.7 involved a release of 26-1000 cubic metres.4 involved a release of over 1000 cubic metres.In 2016, crude oil releases of 1.5 cubic metres (9.44 barrels) or more decreased to 1 (yes, ONE) from 3 in 2015.Amid constant warnings about the risk of spills or releases from oil & gas pipelines in Canada, the fact remains that 99.9999% of the oil and natural gas transported to market arrives safely.In the United States, oil, natural gas and other types of pipelines are regulated by the PHMSA. According to PHMSA statistics, there were 66,943 miles of crude oil pipelines in 2014 and 74,796 miles of crude oil pipelines in 2016. Statistics on the volume of crude oil transported are published by the Association of Oil Pipelines and the American Petroleum Institute. The most recent year for which data is available in 2014, when 9.3 billion barrels of crude oil were transported.The U.S. record for pipeline safety is not as good as that in Canada and the published data is also not as detailed. PHMSA reports pipeline incidents for all pipelines. It publishes the number of “serious” incidents, where fatalities or injuries occurred. The average number of fatalities over the past 10 years is 13 per year; the average number of injuries over the past 10 years is 64 per year. This equates to an average of 77 serious incidents per year over the past 10 years. Compare that to zero accidents per year in Canada for 2015 and 2016.Unfortunately, PHMSA reports do not provide the same level of detail concerning the number and volume of oil spills as do those of the TSB in Canada. The information is available as a result of the joint American Petroleum Institute (API)-Association of Oil Pipelines Annual Pipeline (AOPL) Safety Performance Report and Strategic Plan. Based on the reports from pipeline operators, in 2013 there were 134 releases from onshore liquids pipelines along pipeline rights of way. The number of barrels released declined from about 90,000 in 2000 to about 30,000 in 2012, before increasing to 110,000 barrels due to one large spill in 2013. Over half (55%) of the barrels released in 2013 were caused by third parties or outside forces, not the operation of the pipeline companies themselves. Of the 397 pipeline incidents reported to PHMSA in 2013, nearly 140, or 35%, were smaller than one barrel, over 260 (two-thirds) were 5 barrels or smaller, and nearly 350 (88%) were 100 barrels or smaller. Only 20 releases were larger than 500 barrels.The U.S. State Department, in its assessment of the risks of oil spills as part of its review of the Keystone XL Pipeline, calculated that between 2002 and 2009, the number of releases per ton-miles of petroleum pipeline transport was 0.0006.Even that extremely low figure hides an important fact. Most of the spills occur on older pipelines, many of which have been in operation for over seventy years. The technology of pipeline construction and operation today is vastly better than that used on the older portions of the pipeline system, and the risks of a spill are much lower with new pipelines.When 9.3 billion barrels of oil are transported, and only 100,000 barrels are released (and subsequently recovered), the risk of an oil spill is extremely low. The risk is not zero, but there is no other modern industrial activity where the risks of serving the public’s needs for energy or any other product are zero.Tanker Traffic in CanadaMost oil tanker traffic in Canada takes place on the East Coast. Transport Canada maintains statistics on the movement of tankers and on oil spills.There are about 4,000 inbound trips by tankers each year on the East Coast, so tankers account for about one fifth of the 20,000 inbound vessel trips each year there. Over 82 million tonnes of various petroleum and fuel products are moved in and out of 39 East Coast ports.In Quebec, 25 million tonnes of crude oil and various petroleum products are moved in and out of 39 ports.On the West Coast, where oil tankers have been moving in and out since the 1930’s, in 2015 there were about 197,500 departures and arrivals of vessels. Tankers accounted for 1,487 of them, or 0.75%.Why, one wonders, if almost all the tanker movement is on the East Coast, is so much controversy focused on the West Coast? Does this really have anything to do with the safety of oil tanker movement?West Coast Oil SpillsThe largest oil spill in Canada occurred off the East Coast in 1970, forty-seven years ago. The tanker Arrow spilled over 10,000 tonnes of oil far off the coast of Nova Scotia.The Canadian West Coast’s largest spill was 240 tonnes, caused by the sinking of the ferry M/V The Queen of the North in 2006. In 1988, the Nestucca oil barge spilled 87 tonnes of oil off the west coast of Vancouver Island.In 2015, the M/V Marathassa was reported to have spilled fuel oil in Vancouver’s English Bay. This caused a major controversy about the alleged delay in responding by the Western Marine Response Corporation (WCMRC). In response to the uproar, the Minister responsible for the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) launched an independent investigation. According to the report of the independent review, there were a number of examples of miscommunication between federal and provincial officials immediately after the spill was reported. According to Transport Canada’s Response Organization Standards, Response Organizations must mobilize resources within six hours after notification of the spill in a designated port. In addition, CCG has Environmental Response Levels of Service, requiring resources to be mobilized within six hours of the assessment. In fact, WCMRC responded and had crew on scene one hour twenty minutes after the incident was reported and immediately began skimming the oil off the water. WCMRC’s response thus was well within the established standards. Nonetheless, the controversy was in the Vancouver press for several weeks. There was minimal impact on the public from a health and safety perspective. Approximately 20 birds were affected; one duck died. This “crisis” is held up as an example of the failure of the Canadian marine safety system.In spite of the fact that oil tankers and much other shipping has been operating off the West Coast for well over a century, there has never been a spill from a tanker, and the spills from other vessels have all been small and quickly cleaned up. Canada’s system for responding to and cleaning up any marine spills works very well. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Crude Oil', 'Quebec']",2017/08/11

Or Join the Debate.," Contributed by Michelle Stirling and the Science Team at Friends of Science.On July 27, 2007, the Edmonton Journal ran an op-ed by Jim Storrie wherein he called Friends of Science “climate denialists.” We have no record of Mr. Storrie ever contacting us for a statement on our position regarding climate change. Read the original op-ed here Opinion: Trump-style vitriol infecting Alberta politics.The following is a rebuttal to Jim Storrie’s article.A recent Edmonton Journal op-ed by Jim Storrie took the light-hearted joke “Be afraid, be very afraid” and wound it up into a session of fear-mongering and smears, including our organization – Friends of Science Society – as “climate denialists.”“Trump-style vitriol” must refer to the President pulling out of the Paris Agreement. If you read our recent blog post “Just the Facts” by Ottawa energy policy consultant Robert Lyman, you’ll see why no businessperson would sign the Paris Agreement – only Carbonbaggers and bureaucrats would agree to it.The Friends of Science team of scientists have reviewed climate science literature for 15 years. Climate change is self-evident. Some 4.5 billion years of its evidence is written in the rock that our earth scientists study. Earth’s temperatures have naturally gone from minus 70°C to plus 70°C over time without any human intervention whatsoever, with no correlation to carbon dioxide concentrations.Our senior scientific advisors are Ph.D. holders in atmospheric science, earth sciences, and astrophysics.  But Mr. Storrie attacks us without doing the correct journalistic thing – call, email, do some research.  Ask us for sources for our position that the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change.Friends of Science agrees that the climate changes. We agree that carbon dioxide from human emissions is a factor in climate change. We agree that there has been warming since 1860, but only up to the recent stagnation of warming of some 20 years.  These statements are the foundation of the much cited “97% consensus.” Consensus ends there. Scientists dissent on ratio of human vs. natural variability of climate change.The chaotic voices of environmental groups claim that humans are the sole cause of climate change. They state that if you give them money, they will stop climate change.The acknowledged world authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change as: “any change in climate over time…whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.”Wasn’t this past year the ‘hottest on record?’ News media and catastrophists forget to mention the scientific margin of error. If 2016 was hotter than 2015, it was only by 0.02°C – two one-hundredths of a degree. This an immeasurable amount arrived at by averaging and homogenizing temperatures. It is not an actual thermometer measurement.  The margin of error on this value is 0.1°C, meaning 2016 could have been +0.12°C (global warming) or -0.08°C (global cooling). We will not know until we have additional years against which to compare and see trends.If you look at temperature rise since 1860 on a regular 1°C thermometer, you would barely see it. The earth’s vast oceans cover 70% of the Earth’s surface area, but have only been nominally monitored with precise Argo instrument drones since 2000. There is a lack of equidistant land monitors world-wide. Thus, many people question the accuracy of ‘global warming’ claims.Historically, we have transitioned from the warm and stable Medieval Warm Period (850-1250), to the violent, chaotic, cold of the Little Ice Age (1250-1860), and then to the stability of the Current Warm Period. Warming is not unusual.So, what is the cause? According to astrophysicist Dr. Nir Shaviv, Chair of the Racah Institute of Physics at the Hebrew University, changes in the many aspects of solar and planetary activity drive the major forces of climate change on earth. Scientists in many disciplines agree. Earth itself is an active planet with constant tectonic plate movements, changes in geomagnetic fields, shifting ocean currents and atmospheric oscillations. Human activity also influences climate, including land use changes, water diversion, deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions, but this is much smaller, by comparison, to natural variability.Don’t be afraid, or very afraid. Science is about inquiry, not compliance. Join the debate.See the following YouTube videos for more information.Dr. Nir Shaviv: Dr. Shaviv – What about the 97% consensus?Dr. John D.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/08/10/reflections-on-the-proposed-changes-in-canadian-environmental-assessment/,,Reflections on the Proposed Changes in Canadian Environmental Assessment," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017IntroductionOn June 29 2017, the federal government released a discussion paper on the review of environmental and regulatory processes. The paper included several suggestions for reform of the current environmental assessment system, including a broadening of the scope of assessments to include the cumulative effects of economic activity in the regions affected; further broadening it to include not only environmental issues but also economic, social and health issues; adding a new national interest, or policy, determination; initiating much more extensive “engagement and planning” both by project proponents and governments; expanding the opportunity for public involvement through eliminating the “standing” test used by the National Energy Board; using gender-based analysis in assessments, integrating indigenous traditional knowledge more extensively in assessments; and sharing administrative authority and management responsibility with indigenous peoples.The scope and number of the changes proposed are unprecedented. As someone who worked for many years in the federal government, I have observed the changes made in the federal environmental assessment and review system since its beginning. I therefore have some appreciation for the issues involved and the consequences if the government embraces all of the changes now under review. My guess is that there are fewer than a thousand people in Canada who fully understand what is at stake. It would be a disservice to try to analyze all the complex questions involved in a short set of comments. I offer instead a personal perspective on the overall significance of the changes.The Value of Environmental Assessment and ReviewThere are few, I think, who would question the value of environmental assessment and review as an integral part of the public policy process and of the regulatory reviews of specific projects. Such reviews are an essential part of the “due diligence” that government officials and political decision-makers should carry out. The Canadian public values environmental quality and it, I believe, also agrees that governments should be proactive in identifying potentially adverse environmental impacts before they occur, so that the government can decide whether to allow development to proceed, and if so, under which terms and conditions.Environmental assessment has evolved considerably since Canada and the United States began performing such assessments or requiring project proponents to perform them in the 1970’s. Initially in Canada, environmental assessment was conducted under the terms of a federal guidelines order intended to add a “best practices” component for this type of public interest review. Later, after a series of court judgments, the requirement to conduct an environmental assessment, and the standards governing such assessments, were enshrined in legislation. Thereafter, the courts, more than governments, became the arbiter of whether an assessment had been done in such a way as to meet the requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.It is notable that no such legislative requirements apply to the other public policy considerations that governments take into account before deciding on important matters. No law requires that officials or project sponsors conduct analysis of the economic effects, the financial or cost-benefit effects, the effects on groups and regions, the effects on safety and security, the effects on health, the effects on international relations or any of the large number of other considerations that typically are included in a memorandum to Cabinet. No rule requires that the public be informed, consulted and given an opportunity to offer its detailed comments on other policy considerations. No court decides whether the procedures used to find out important information have been properly followed or, when judging that they were not, is authorized to set aside the government’s decision. Environmental assessment and review thus has obtained an almost pre-eminent place in the public policy and regulatory regime, not because Canadians decided by ballot that environmental considerations should outweigh all others, but because there is a law that governs what will be done and how it will be done.There are some who believe that all government deliberations and analysis, like those that apply to environmental considerations, should be open to public scrutiny, with ample opportunity for and time spent on public hearings and debate. Whatever the merits of this view in terms of a more “direct “ democracy, these requirements do not apply now under our still mostly representative style of democracy. The federal proposals for change would move us firmly in a new direction.Problems Have ArisenOver the period since the late 1980’s, the actual process of environmental assessment and review has become very detailed and complex. A great deal of time and attention is spent on determining the scope of the review, whether it merits only a straight-forward screening, a more comprehensive review or a full assessment including the establishment of an independent panel. While those who value environmental quality have welcomed this evolution, there have also been those who have used the system as a means to delay, hinder and ultimately defeat any project they opposed. The requirement for public engagement has provided an opportunity for hundreds and sometimes thousands of people to attend hearings, not because they have some additional scientific evidence that bears upon the merits of the project, but because the hearing offer a way indirectly to hold a public plebiscite on the overall acceptability of the project. In certain hands, the process has ceased to be about scientific assessment of a project’s effects; it has become a weapon.The practical effect of ever more requirements for environmental assessment and review and more public involvement has been an increase in the duration of reviews, in the demands on federal officials, in the costs incurred by project proponents and in the uncertainty associated with the outcomes. It is difficult to find reliable data on the duration of federal and provincial reviews, but it is clear that many took longer than 18 months to complete and some took over twice that long. Considering that the reviews do not formally commence until the regulating agency determines that the application is complete (i.e. has all the information, including environmental studies already done), this seems excessive.This poses particular problems for the energy and minerals resource industries. Many energy and mineral commodities trade in highly cyclical markets, where the supply and demand conditions and the resulting prices can change sharply over time, and in unpredictable ways. Those who invest in major projects costing billions of dollars face certain “windows of opportunity” in the cycles during which the economic conditions favour the early success of a project. If regulatory approvals, extended because of the burdens imposed by prolonged environmental assessment and hearing processes, delay projects for years, these windows of opportunity can be missed. The recent cancellation by Petronas of a proposed $36 billion LNG project in British Columbia illustrates the risks of this.Regulatory EfficiencyPerceiving inefficiencies in the environmental assessment process as a hindrance to economic development, the federal government included provisions in its Budget implementation bill in the spring of 2012 to replace the former assessment process with a new one set out in the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA), which Parliament passed in June 2012. Under the new Act, the environmental effects of a project to be taken into account are a change that may be caused to a component of the environment under federal jurisdiction, a change that may be caused on federal lands or outside the province where the project is to be constructed, and an effect on aboriginal peoples of a change to the environment. If the project, to proceed, requires a federal department, agency or regulatory body to exercise a power or perform a duty or function (such as issuing a permit), then the definition of environmental effects includes “certain changes to the environment directly linked or necessarily incidental to that exercise or performance, as well as socio-economic effects of such a change”. The CEAA 2012 definition of environmental effects is narrower than the definition in the former Act, where an environmental effect was any change that the project would cause in the environment, as well as socio-economic effects of such a change. The more narrow definition of environmental effects in CEAA 2012 slightly limited the power of the Minister of the Environment to submit an environmental assessment to a review panel.CEAA 2012 also imposed time limits for environmental assessments. Most standard assessments must be completed in one year. When a review panel conducts the environmental assessment, the entire process is limited to two years, although certain exceptions are allowed that have resulted in much longer reviews (e.g. the National Energy Board assessment of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project). Further, while in the past almost any member of the public was able to appear before a review panel to give his or her views on a project, CEAA 2012 limits those permitted to participate at hearings to “interested parties” which are persons directly affected by the proposed project, as well as those with relevant information or expertise. In fact, these limits have rarely been stringently applied, and any member of the public is still able to submit written comments to the review panel for its consideration. The net effect of the CEAA changes was to reduce the scope of assessment somewhat and to impose time limits with the objective of improving the efficiency of the regulatory process.Concerns About the FutureThe extensive changes to the federal environmental assessment process now under consideration would “turn back the clock” on the changes made in the environmental assessment regime as a result of CEAA 2012. However, they would go much further in expanding the scope and complexity of the assessment process.Broadening the scope of environmental assessment to include analysis of the economic, social and health issues essentially would make these considerations subsidiaries of the environmental assessment process. One wonders whether, for example, the future conduct by officials of economic analysis on a project would henceforth be subject to the same rules that now govern the procedures and processes of environmental assessment, including granting the courts the power to assess whether the economic assessment had been carried out in a way that met legislative and judicial standards. Would the development of environmental policy frameworks, such as the Climate Change Policy Framework, mean that henceforth the economic, social and health analysis would simply become secondary considerations in the attainment of international climate objectives?The addition of more processes to the ones already included in environmental assessment would also represent an unprecedented change. These include the proposed national interest or policy review, conducted mainly by federal officials but with extensive public consultations and aboriginal engagement; the addition of a potentially lengthy planning stage; the use of a new system of gender-based analysis that seems unclear in its intent and would certainly take time for officials and project sponsors to master; and redesigning regulatory processes so that aboriginal organizations have much more authority and control. Eliminating the “standing” test used by the National Energy Board and other agencies seems like an invitation to all and sundry to “pile on” in their opposition to every project, filling every hearing room with hundreds of opponents simply repeating the same message.It seems evident that these changes, taken together, would considerably lengthen and complicate the environmental assessment process. For project opponents, it would create an extensive new set of opportunities to delay and block almost every major project. For project proponents, it would make the process far more costly, resource-intensive and unpredictable.Would this really serve the Canadian public interest? If not, whose interest would it serve?For further reading, see Robert Lyman’s summary of the Environmental & Regulatory Reviews discussion paper and his commentary of the use of aboriginal “traditional knowledge” in environmental regulation.The Government of Canada is seeking public comments on the Environmental & Regulatory Processes discussion paper until August 28, 2017.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/07/26/in-defence-of-science-a-commentary-on-the-use-of-aboriginal-traditional-knowledge-in-regulation/,,In Defence of Science – A Commentary on the Use of Aboriginal “Traditional Knowledge” in Regulation," Contributed by Robert Lyman © July 2017IntroductionOn June 29, 2017 the Canadian federal government issued a discussion paper on the review of environmental and regulatory processes, presenting a number of changes in the present regimes that the government is considering. One of the main departures from current practice proposed in the paper was the incorporation of indigenous knowledge alongside other sources of evidence. Specifically, the paper indicated that the government is considering two measures:Co-developing “tools, guidance, and capacity with indigenous peoples to better support and systematically consider indigenous knowledge.Protecting “the confidentiality of indigenous knowledge where appropriate (e.g. sacred site locations).”While it is nowhere stated this way, the implication of the discussion paper is that, henceforth, Canadian agencies undertaking environmental assessment or considering the public interest impacts of major resource developments will give equal weight to science (i.e. empirical evidence concerning the effects of the project) and traditional indigenous knowledge.This commentary challenges the wisdom of such an approach.BackgroundSince the release of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in 1995, there has been an ongoing debate in academic and certain political circles in Canada about the possible incorporation of aboriginal peoples’ “traditional knowledge” into public policy. Several serious issues have been raised about whether “aboriginal knowledge” is knowledge at all in the sense of a body of verifiable facts, whether its heavy reliance on “spiritual teachings” qualifies it as a source of objective evidence, its vagueness and lack of systematic discipline, and its potential, in the field of environmental assessment, for justifying practices that, while acceptable in terms of aboriginal historical practice, clearly pose dangers to wildlife preservation. As documented in a lengthy paper by Frances Widdowson and Albert Howard of Trent University, these concerns have largely been ignored by the proponents of aboriginal knowledge. [1]DiscussionWhat is meant by “traditional indigenous knowledge”? One definition that has been used by the Government of the Northwest Territories since 1993 is “knowledge and values which have been acquired through experience and observation from the land or from spiritual teachings, and handed down from one generation to another.” It is perhaps also well-described as the system that indigenous people used through the centuries when they had no written tradition of passing down from generation to generation what was known by hunters about the wildlife conditions in which they had historically hunted.There is no question that “indigenous traditional knowledge” includes a large component that rests on spiritual teaching about the relationship between the aboriginal people and the world and wildlife around them. In fact, this native “theology” is a particularly worrisome part of the indigenous traditional knowledge claim to be a valid basis for modern decision-making. Nowhere else do governments accept spiritual beliefs as “knowledge”. Stripped of the spiritual beliefs, indigenous aboriginal knowledge largely consists of the information one would receive from a guide familiar with the local area – basic knowledge whose incorporation certainly would not require a radical transformation of scientific research, policy development or regulation. The significance of the linkage to native spirituality is essentially that, in an atmosphere of elevated sensitivity to aboriginal concerns, it becomes politically incorrect to challenge aboriginal beliefs as a basis for action.The acceptance of aboriginal spiritual belief as knowledge by governments is thus dangerous for three reasons. It can be used to justify any activity, including actions that are environmentally destructive. It cannot be tested for its validity and relevance to the matter in question because there is no empirical way to do so. Finally, any attempt to challenge it can be attacked as “racist” or pejorative to aboriginals when there is no such intention.The previously referenced paper by Frances Widdowson and Albert Howard makes an essential point in this regard:“Rather, each item of purported traditional knowledge – like each item of purported knowledge of any kind – must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, according to the quantity and quality of evidence for and against it. …The mere fact that a belief has been ‘acquired through experience, observation, through the land or from spiritual teachings, and handed down from one generation to another’ does not, in and of itself, constitute the slightest reason to believe that it is true. And if it is not true, it is not knowledge” (Widdowson & Howard, 2009, p. 6).It is especially problematic that the federal discussion paper appears to support equal consideration of facts, analysis and judgments based on the use of the physical and social sciences and aboriginal traditional knowledge. The significance of findings based on modern science is not that it is always “right” but that the methods used are empirical (i.e. based on real-life observation) and replicable by other studies. Further, if they are shown to be inadequate, the methods used can be revised and the conclusions discarded. Traditional knowledge, in contrast, does not have this capacity to progress because it involves repeating ancestral patterns, binding its holders to mythology from the past. It is static – immune from questioning because it is based on what is “held” by elders with revered qualities whose views, according to advocates, must be uncritically supported. Any attempt to challenge these beliefs, any attempt to raise critical questions is often immediately condemned as gestures of “disrespect”.Supporting traditional knowledge may be seen, especially in political terms, as a harmless acquiescence, a way to build aboriginal self-esteem so that the aboriginal population can overcome the harmful effects of past government policies. Unfortunately, it can be far more damaging than that.he National Energy Board attempted, during its hearings on the applications for the Nova Gas Transmission Project, the Northern Gateway Project and the Energy East Project, to determine what precisely was meant by aboriginal traditional knowledge and how this could be properly taken into account in the Board’s decision-making process. If one examines the testimony from those hearings, the points made by the aboriginal people who testified can be summarized briefly in the following points.Aboriginals have existed for many years on the lands under which a proposed pipeline will be constructed.The lands have many burial grounds.The hunting, fishing, and trapping on the lands are not as good as they used to be thirty or forty years ago. It takes longer to get food if you try to live entirely of the land.Over the past forty to fifty years, the oil and gas industry has been more active in exploring and developing lands in the area.Aboriginals have been told that “the pipeline will blow up and so may litres of oil will leak.” They do not trust what they are told by representatives of the petroleum industry.None of this, one might argue, has anything to do with traditional knowledge. It has to do with fears, many of which may be unsubstantiated. The remarkable thing about these hearings was that no one – not the pipeline proponents or the NEB panel members – asked any probing questions that would have tested the validity of the arguments being made. No one asked for evidence that aboriginals had any legal interest in the lands where the proposed pipelines would be built. No one asked for any proof of a connection between the oil industry’s past, present or future activity and the population of wildlife in the area. No one asked whether the burial grounds were located anywhere near the proposed right of way for the pipeline. No one, in other words, subjected the aboriginals to standards of evidence that would have been imposed on anyone else. If one were looking for evidence of a continuing “colonial” mentality in which aboriginals are treated like children who should not be expected to meet modern standards, it would be difficult to find a better example.ConclusionThe public interest in considering whether or not major resource projects and energy transmission projects should proceed and, if so, under which conditions, does not properly rest on taking solicitous account of the historical beliefs of aboriginal peoples. It rests on the rigorous and objective application of standards of knowledge and evidence that can be critically tested through examination and cross-examination. Most of the studies of traditional knowledge are undertaken by traditional knowledge advocates, many of whom have a vested interest in the assertion of traditional knowledge’s validity. The objective distance that is needed to evaluate the credibility and value of traditional knowledge is lacking.The proposal that the government of Canada should entrench consideration of aboriginal traditional knowledge into the core of modern regulatory practice and indeed elevate it to a par with scientific, evidence-based knowledge and considerations is fundamentally flawed. It would undermine the rigour needed to properly assess the Canadian public interest.ReferencesWiddowson, F., & Howard, A. (2009).

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/07/20/environmental-and-regulatory-reviews/,,Environmental and Regulatory Reviews," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017A Summary of the Federal Government Discussion PaperOn June 29, 2017, the federal government announced the issuance of a discussion paper on the review of environmental and regulatory processes. Coming only a few months after the issuance of a report by the Expert Panel on Modernization of the National Energy Board, the discussion paper dealt with many of the same subjects and themes. Indeed, the discussion paper makes clear that many of the ideas described in the Expert Panel report have already been accepted in principle by the federal government and that the government has already set the broad course that it wishes to follow.The purpose of this note is to summarize the most important elements in the discussion paper, especially as these relate to the development of climate change policy and its application to the Canadian energy economy.In announcing the paper, Minister Carr stated that it was based on extensive consultations, Expert Panel Reports and Parliamentary studies over the past twelve months. This seems strange given that these “public consultations” received virtually no press attention. One wonders whether they were by invitation only. It certainly is clear and that a broad range of indigenous and environmental groups were consulted.The paper states many of the same contentions as were made by the Expert Panel, namely that:There is a need for greater transparency around the science, data and evidence supporting decisions and to ensure indigenous knowledge is sufficiently taken into account.Protections to Canada’s fisheries and waterways are insufficient.Indigenous peoples and the public should have more opportunities to meaningfully participate.The explicitly stated assumptions are that: Canada’s environmental assessment processes need to be changed to regain public trust; opportunities for Canadians to participate in environmental assessment processes are too limited; information is difficult to access; indigenous knowledge is not fully considered; information presented by project proponents is not properly “validated”; individual projects are often reviewed without an understanding of the “broader environmental and development context”; decisions are not sufficiently explained; reconciliation with indigenous people and recognition of their rights has not been clear and consistent; and proponents and investors need a more predictable and fair process.To address these perceived problems, several changes are proposed.Impact Assessment and Regulatory ProcessesThe current environmental assessment and regulatory review processes will essentially be merged into a new more closely integrated one.There will be a greatly expanded introductory process intended to perform a “Strategic Regional Assessment” and “Early Engagement and Planning”; following this phase, “additional conditions are applied to support regulatory compliance during the regulatory phase”.Projects under review will then be divided into two groups: “designated” and “non-designated” projects. The designated projects will include major energy transmission projects, nuclear projects and offshore oil and gas projects. There is no explanation as to why some projects would be designated and others not.The designated project process would entail, as a first stage, an extended “impact assessment” carried out by the single environmental assessment agency, either alone or jointly with a regulatory body. This would essentially be a review in principle to determine whether it was in the national interest, after which there would then be a policy decision by the appropriate Minister or Cabinet. Only then would the actual regulatory review based on the “technical” merits of the project be performed by the responsible regulatory body.The non-designated project review would entail no “Strategic Impact Assessment” or political decision, but rather would a more limited review for a projects’ “safety, economic, environmental, social and health considerations”.Assessing Cumulative EffectsThe proposed approach includes new requirements and processes.Working with provincial and territorial governments and indigenous peoples, the federal government (who, exactly, is not clear) will develop national environmental frameworks to inform regional assessments (e.g. Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change; Air Quality Management System).The government will conduct strategic assessments that “explain the application of environmental frameworks to activities subject to federal oversight and regulation, starting with one for climate change”.The government will prepare regional assessments to guide planning and management of cumulative effects, identify the potential impacts on the rights and interests of indigenous peoples and inform project assessments.The government will establish an “integrated open science and data platform” to inform environmental frameworks and regional assessments.Early Engagement and PlanningThe Strategic planning phase will include “direct engagement between Crown representatives and indigenous peoples to discuss impacts and identify issues”.An initial list of issues will be developed; it will be made public and public feedback will be obtained.Clear guidance will be given to industry on what will be assessed and the scale of the assessment.Public ParticipationEliminating the “standing” test previously used by the National Energy Board for those wishing to participate in assessments.Improving participant funding programs.Engaging Canadians in a “two-way dialogue” on environmental assessment and regulatory processes through better use of social media and other tools.Increasing transparency on reasons for environmental assessment and regulatory decisions.“Inclusive monitoring and compliance activities, so that life cycle regulators and permitting departments work closely with indigenous peoples, communities and landowners”.Science, Evidence and Indigenous KnowledgeThe government is considering:Moving toward an open science and data platform containing knowledge that supports environmental assessment and regulatory processes.Incorporating indigenous knowledge alongside other sources of evidence.Introducing peer reviews of science and evidence in the assessment phase.Making plain language summaries of the scientific facts that support assessments accessible to the public.Impact AssessmentThe government is considering:Broadening the scope of assessment to include environmental, economic, social and health issues.Consistently using Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) in assessments.Introducing legislation to explicitly require assessment of impacts on indigenous peoples.Establishing a single government agency responsible for impact assessments and for coordinating consultations with indigenous peoples.Using joint reviews by the environmental assessment agency and the responsible regulatory body for all major energy transmission, nuclear and offshore oil and gas projects.Reviewing the Project List and establishing clear criteria to update it in future.Partnering with Aboriginal PeoplesThe government is considering:Being more “responsive” to indigenous rights, jurisdiction and decision making, with “space created” for increased indigenous involvement and indigenous-led assessments.Sharing administrative authority and management responsibility with indigenous peoples.Early and regular engagement and participation.Formalizing the co-development of frameworks for cooperation on environmental assessments and regulatory processes.Increasing participation of indigenous peoples on assessment boards and review panels and in regulatory processes.Clarifying roles for consultation and accommodation in regulatory processes.Cooperation with JurisdictionsThe government is considering:“More comprehensive cooperation” with interested jurisdictions to support the objective of “one project – one assessment”.Introducing legislation to allow substitution of provincial and territorial project assessments for federal ones where there is alignment with federal standards.Developing new provisions and criteria to enable substitution of project assessments to indigenous governments.Ensuring that processes better recognize indigenous jurisdiction laws, practices and governance systems.Allowing ministerial approvals of exceptions to legislated timelines.Cooperating with other jurisdictions to guide planning and management of cumulative effects.Next StepsThe government is seeking public comments on the discussion paper before August 28, 2017. Comments can be made at Government of Canada Environment and Regulatory Processes.The public input and that received from other sources will be taken into account as the government finalizes it approach to amending the environmental assessment and regulatory processes this fall.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Environmental and Regulatory Processes']",2017/07/20
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/07/18/review-of-nasa-book-sun-weather-and-climate/,,"Review of NASA book “SUN, WEATHER and CLIMATE”"," Albert JacobsA review of the book “Sun, Weather and Climate” authored by John R. Herman and Richard A. Goldberg of NASA in 1978. By Albert Jacobs, co-founder of Friends of Science.The first amazing thing about this book is that this is a 1978 NASA publication. How times have changed! In its Foreword, Stanford’s John Wilcox wrote:“It seems likely that Sun – weather/climate investigations will occupy an increasingly prominent role in the coming decade, and the publication of this book should give a significant impetus to these efforts” (Herman & Goldberg, 1978, p. iv).Its 50 pages of reference lists and indexes follow some 300 pages of systematic review of the solar science work and the science papers up to the mid-seventies. This was at a time when the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was setting the anthropogenic global warming machinery in motion, solidifying its “duh” version of total solar irradiance (TSI), and dismissing any significant influence on earth climate from forces outside the atmosphere.Also, the internet age with its web access had yet to arrive.Little surprise then that Dr. Wilcox’ prediction remained largely unfulfilled at a critical period.The other reason for amazement is how much was actually known in the mid-seventies. The sixties and seventies were a very fruitful period in solar research.The various effects the Sun has on the Earth.The Cosmic Ray nucleation principle, with which Svensmark made his name in his basement lab experiments around the beginning of this century, had been known for some twenty years. The solar relationship with the changes in atmospheric ionization rates by GCRs (galactic cosmic rays) had been known since Dr. Ney’s article in Nature in 1959 (Ney, 1959).The importance of the Hale solar polarity cycle (double the sunspot cycle) to the climate connection had been recognized in 1925, suggesting that there was more than the sheer quantity of radiation to be taken into account when looking at sunspots.The relationship between varying solar UV radiation and the ozone layer was well-known since Goldberg published on it in 1954 (Goldberg, 1954). Hey, why the Montreal Protocol?The nature of the dual dynamo and the function of the tachocline were not known at the time and some papers speak of “changing sectors”, which may well relate to the expressions of the toroidal and poloidal fields.The Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS).But I don’t think the word “dynamo” appears in the book.A degree of definition of the various factors in solar radiation and its alphabet soup of physics symbols was reached and the book supplies their backgrounds as well.This is obviously not a fireside book, but is not so much a history book either. It will find its use as a gold mine of basic knowledge for non-astro scientists and others and a reference work par excellence.The book is available at Amazon but all 360 pages of it can be downloaded as a 19MB PDF at the Long-term Investment Education Fund.ReferencesGoldberg, L.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/07/18/laccord-de-paris-cop21-seulement-les-faits-svp/,,"L’ACCORD DE PARIS COP21 – SEULEMENT LES FAITS, SVP"," English version of this post found at THE COP21 AGREEMENT – JUST THE FACTS, PLEASE.le 9 Juin 2017Contribution de Robert Lyman © 2017“Les faits, et seulement les faits” doivent nous éclairer et nous préserver de malentendus entourant toute discussion, alors que l’administration Trump a pris la décision de se retirer de l’Accord de Paris COP21 (2015) qui traite du changement climatique.Les médias ont sursauté en nous affirmant que le ciel allait nous tomber sur la tête, et que les Etats-Unis avaient abandonné leur « leadership », tout en comparant ce pays à un « état paria » comme la Corée du Nord, la Somalie, la Libye et l’Ouganda !Examinons donc les faits!Question: A quoi se sont précisément engagés les pays du COP21?Réponse: Le COP21 ne contient aucun engagement des pays signataires de l’Accord à se soumettre à des objectifs de réduction d’émissions, aussi bien globalement que séparément ; il n’y a aucune sanction légale pour non-conformité. Il s’agit seulement d’un engagement politique sur la base d’efforts possibles pour garder les émissions globales à effet de serre à un niveau pour ne pas dépasser, en théorie, une hausse moyenne de température globale de 1,5°C.Chaque pays signataire s’engage à « préparer et respecter sa “contribution nationale” à atteindre », mettre ses plans à jour tous les cinq ans et rendre compte de ses mesures de réduction d’émissions domestiques.Un pays peut se désister de l’Accord après trois ans, avec un an de préavis.La question de savoir si le COP21 est un accord ou un traité n’est pas résolue!Si aux Etats-Unis il s’agit d’un traité, le sénat américain devrait le ratifier, ce qui est pratiquement irréalisable. Appeler le COP21 un simple accord dans les autres pays signataires détruirait sa crédibilité. Cela explique donc pourquoi l’accord/traité n’engage ces pays qu’à un « objectif philosophique », en évitant surtout toute cible précise.Le COP21 a de nouveau fait écho du “Green Climate Fund” de 100 milliards de dollars établi lors du COP15 de Copenhague, tout en prenant en considération les besoins et priorités des pays en voie de développement. Les 24 pays cités à l’Annexe II devant le fonder incluent plusieurs pays de l’OCDE, mais excluent de grands pays riches comme la Chine, la Russie, le Brésil, et l’Arabie Saoudite ! Parmi les pays en voie de développement qui sont éligibles à recevoir des contributions du Fond, on trouve la Chine, le Brésil, le Méxique et l’Inde. Et il n’y a aucune contrainte pour ces pays à rendre compte de l’utilisation des fonds reçus!Question: A quoi se sont engagés les pays lors les accords précédents, et qu’en est-il résulté?Réponse: En 1988, des gouvernements se sont inquiétés de la possibilité que l’accroissement des émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES) émanant de l’activité humaine n’ait de répercussions néfastes sur la température du globe. En 1992, les pays développés se sont mis d’accord sur un objectif à caractère volontaire de stabilisation des GES au niveau de celui de 1990 à l’échéance 2005. Seuls l’Allemagne et le Royaume-Uni ont réussi à l’atteindre.En 1997, quelques 150 pays s’engagèrent suivant le Protocole de Kyoto à réduire entre 2008 et 2012 les émissions de GES à en moyenne 5% en dessous des niveaux de 1990. Ni la Chine ni l’Inde ne signèrent le traité, tandis que les Etats-Unis le signèrent mais sans le ratifier, donc que les trois plus gros émetteurs se soient abstenus!En 2011, le Canada, le Japon et la Russie annoncèrent qu’ils n’assumeraient plus d’objectifs additionnels du Kyoto. Le Canada se retira de Kyoto en décembre 2011, en objectant qu’il serait forcé de payer 14 milliards de dollars de pénalités alors qu’aucun autre pays n’y était assujetti.Seuls l’Allemagne, le Royaume-Uni et la Suède ont pu parvenir à leurs objectifs Kyoto. L’Allemagne a réussi grâce à son électricité produite à partir de lignite, suite à la réunification et modernisation de l’Allemagne de l’Est. Le Royaume-Uni remplaça le charbon par le gaz naturel. Quant à la Suède, elle transforma ses systèmes de chauffage, passant du charbon à la biomasse et remplaçant les chaudières au fioul par des thermopompes. Les Nations-Unies (ONU) pensent que la biomasse a un bilan carbone neutre, bien que sa combustion dégage de grosses quantités de dioxyde de carbone dans l’atmosphère.Une seconde période d’engagement, l’Amendement de Doha, fut adoptée en 2012, suivant lequel 37 pays étaient assujettis à des objectifs obligatoires. Cependant, cet Amendement n’entra jamais en vigueur, n’ayant pas reçu l’accord nécessaire de 144 pays.Question: Où en sommes-nous des émissions globales depuis que les pays ont adopté des objectifs de réduction?Réponse: Le tableau ci-dessous nous indique les niveaux d’émissions globales pour quatre années depuis 1990, exprimés en millions de tonnes équivalent CO2, d’après le « United States Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center ».Emissions GlobalesAnMégatonnes Equivalent CO2 199022,273200024,690201033,472201436,138Résumons: en dépit des accords répétés des différents gouvernements pour réduire les émissions globales, celles-ci ont augmenté de plus de 62% entre 1990 et 2014. Cette croissance vient surtout des pays moins développés, de l’Asie en particulier.Question: Quelles sont les Contributions Nationales que les pays engagés du COP21 ont soumis?Réponse: Le 30 Octobre 2015, le secrétariat de l’ONU publia un rapport de synthèse sur les contributions nationales cumulées (INDCs) qui auraient été soumises à ce jour. Donc, 119 soumissions ont été reçues, couvrant 147 pays de la Conférence des parties, et représentant 86% des émissions globales à 2010.Selon cette synthèse, les mesures prises dans les contributions nationales devraient résulter à un niveau de 55.3 gigatonnes (Gt) d’émissions d’équivalent CO2 en 2025, et de 56.7 Gt en 2030. Ces émissions seraient en 2025 de 34 à 46% plus importantes que celles de 1990, et de 37 à 52% en 2030. L’ONU estime que la croissance des émissions serait ralentie de 10 à 57% du taux établi de 1990 à 2010.Bjorn Lomborg, professeur au Copenhagen Business School, a analysé l’impact de réduction de température des contributions nationales soumises à ce jour, se servant du modèle standard informatique MAGICC.Cette modélisation intègre toutes les hypothèses et équations de l’IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) qui supposent que l’augmentation anthropique des GES seraient la cause d’un réchauffement global important dans l’avenir, ce qui reste toujours l’objet de débats houleux.Tout en restant optimiste, en supposant que les réductions d’émissions promises au cours de ce siècle soient soutenues, les impacts des Actions à prendre conformément au COP21 sont en général faibles. Toutes politiques climatiques des Etats-Unis, Chine, UE et reste du monde, mises en œuvre depuis les années 2000 jusqu’en 2030 et soutenues durant le siècle, ne causerait probablement qu’un ralentissement de la hausse de température globale de 0,17°C en 2100!En fait, ces engagements n’auront que peu d’effet sur la stabilisation du climat, et leurs impacts seront indétectables pour de nombreuses décennies.Le graphique ci-dessous illustre le peu d’impact du COP21.Question: Est-il vrai que sa contribution nationale démontre le leadership mondial de la Chine en réponse au réchauffement global?Réponse: La contribution nationale chinoise (INDC) a été reçue favorablement par plusieurs groupes écologiques. Rappelons que la Chine est de loin l’émetteur le plus important de GES dans le monde.L’économie et la population chinoises continuent de grandir rapidemment lorsqu’on les compare aux autres pays, ainsi donc le défi pour la Chine est en quelque sorte to briser le lien entre sa croissance économique et l’augmentation de ses émissions associées à une demande accrue d’énergie. La contribution nationale chinoise doit inclure des projets pour que leur économie soit moins fortement intense en émissions.Ainsi, le but est de faire décroître les émissions de CO2 par unité de PIB de 60% à 65% du niveau 2005 en 2030. La Chine espère aussi accroître la proportion de combustibles non fossiles pour sa consommation énergétique primaire aux environs de 20%, et d’augmenter substantiellement l’envergure de ses forêts. Ceci résulterait à ce que les émissions chinoises culmineraient vers 2030, et peut-être même décliner ensuite.Ce sont des buts probablement « inspirants », alors qu’ils impliquent des modifications sans précédents de leur économie énergétique. En admettant que ces objectifs soient atteints, il est néanmoins certain que les émissions chinoises en 2030 seraient entre deux et deux fois et demi supérieures à celles des Etats-Unis, le deuxième plus gros émetteur au monde.Non seulement le COP21 n’oblige pas la Chine à verser de contributions au « Green Climate Fund », mais, comme noté plus haut, la Chine peut de fait se qualifier comme bénéficiaire du fond.Question: Quelles sont les sources actuelles de consommation d’énergie au monde?Réponse: Selon la International Energy Agency, en 2012 (date la plus récente pour disponibilité de données confirmées), la consommation globale d’énergie par source, mesurée en quadrillion de British thermal units (Btu) est comme suit : carburant liquide (huile et liquides de gaz naturel), 183,55 ; charbon : 153,27 ; gaz naturel : 124,21 ; nucléaire, 24,47 ; et renouvelables : 63,77. Les renouvelables incluent principalement l’énergie hydro-électrique et la biomasse, c’est-à-dire la combustion traditionnelle de bois et de fumier animal séché. En gros, la répartition est donc combustibles liquides 33% ; charbon 28% ; gaz naturel 23% ; nucléaire 5% ; et renouvelables 12%. Les énergies solaire et éolienne comptent ensemble pour moins de 2%.Question: Comment les experts projettent la croissance des GES pour l’avenir?Réponse: Selon la publication « 2016 International Energy Outlook » de la « United States Energy Information Administration », basée sur une analyse sérieuse des tendances économiques, démographiques et technologiques, les émissions globales de CO2 liées aux énergies vont croître de 32.3 Gt en 2012 à 43.2 Gt en 2040, soit une augmentation de 34%. Quatre-vingt dix pour cent de la croissance des émissions viendront des pays hors l’OCDE, principalement Chine, Inde et Asie de sud-est.Le graphique ci-dessous illustre ces tendances.Ce sont les faits. Le lecteur peut conclure par lui-même à savoir si la participation ou non des Etats-Unis au COP21 aurait une retombée importante sur la croissance des GES ou sur la température globale moyenne du futur.English version of this post found at THE COP21 AGREEMENT – JUST THE FACTS, PLEASE.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization']",2017/07/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/07/07/the-donald-and-the-touchstone/,Robert Lyman ,The Donald and the Touchstone," By William Kay, manager of ecofascism.comTouchstones change colour when rubbed against gold. They can gauge an alloy’s purity. Global Warming is a touchstone of our times. Ask someone about it. If they say it’s a hoax, you’ve found gold. You’ve found someone with awareness.On June 1, 2017 in a much-anticipated Rose Garden speech President Trump announced America’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. [1] Festivities lasted 34 minutes beginning with an intro from VP Pence who praised Trump’s economic nationalism. Trump’s 30-minute address thrice mentioned climate. He said:“This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.”He quoted a Wall Street Journal editorial recommending withdrawal in part because it: “won’t matter much to the climate.”His sole sortie into climate science:“Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree – think of that; this much – Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount.”President Trump offered to renegotiate a climate accord on terms fair to the US. He then tossed the mic to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who boasted America had lowered its CO2 emissions through private sector innovation; adding that Yankee know-how might help other countries do likewise.Neither President Trump nor Pruitt believe in the Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) hypothesis. Trump has rightly called it a hoax. (He wrongly called it a “Chinese hoax.” This hoax bears the stamp: Hergestellt im Deutschland.)If CAGW is fake science then why mention carbon emissions and temperature increases in the same breath? Why re-negotiate climate deals when their premise is rubbish? Why reduce CO2 emissions when they are, on balance, beneficial? The Trump Administration is loathe to get embroiled in the climate science imbroglio yet can’t resist hoisting climate alarmists on their own petards when opportunities arise.The only argument alarmists seem to have is that CAGW enjoys overwhelming support among scientists. Alarmists are the keepers of the settled science; of the purported consensus.Arguments from authority aren’t inherently fallacious. Everyone uses them. They are often decisive in the legal arena. In the scientific arena, if the authorities overseeing a branch of science overwhelmingly endorse a proposition then the burden of proof shifts to the contrarians who must explain both the flaws within the impugned proposition AND how the authorities could be so wrong.There exists no near-unanimous pro-CAGW consensus. Four separate alarmist papers each miraculously concluded that 97% of climate scientists endorse CAGW. This numerology gets chanted ad nauseam. These papers contain laughable attempts at statistical subterfuge. [2] One paper winnowed its sample to a clique of 75 career alarmists. Another dissembled the “Catastrophic” in CAGW such that acknowledging trace human influences upon climate became full-blown endorsement of CAGW.While the “97% consensus” is a disgraced exaggeration; and while the undeniable presence of active controversy within climate science weakens the argument from authority; the fact remains that all major scientific academies, journals and institutes endorse CAGW.This, however, is a manufactured consensus; politically charged from the get-go.Rather than explore the ancient origins of climatism, let’s pick up the action circa 1974. OPEC’s oil price shock jolted European elites into re-visiting stratagems of energy autarky. They founded the International Energy Agency to promote state-subsidized alternative energy initiatives.In 1978 then-UN Secretary General Waldheim proposed the UN lead a “coordinated and imaginative effort” in harmony with environmentalists to diversify global energy production away from petroleum and toward sustainable sources. [3] This is no conspiracy theory. Conspirators are secretive. Waldheim proposed this to the UN General Assembly with reporters from almost every news organization in the world taking notes.Timelines tell tales. Between the mid-1970s through and the mid-1980s there arose an international crusade for non-fossil fuel based energy. This crusade was led by: West European governments; their American fifth column (Democratic Party); the UN; and thousands of enviro-NGOs. This pre-existing, up-and-running, state-embedded meta-organization subsequently, in the mid-1980s, adopted Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming as its unifying myth.EU leaders freely discuss their entwined agendas of saving the climate while advancing European energy independence. Despite decades of resisting market forces annual EU fuel imports still tally $500 billion; their lifeblood flowing to their mortal rivals. [4]Act One of the Fourth Reich’s [5] masterplan involves emancipation from imported fuels through massive subsidies to wind power, solar power, biofuels and electric transportation. Act Two exports the energy revolution so their nurtured manufacturers of turbines, batteries and digesters have ready customers for their wares. Reduce energy imports; increase manufacturing exports – a sieg-sieg scenario.BREAKING NEWS! Governments fund science! Scientists are civil servants. Governments parade scientists around like cadets on public holidays.In a convoluted shell-game a dozen US federal agencies do climate science. The GAO’s estimates:“Federal funding for climate change research, technology, international assistance and adaptation has increased from $2.4 billion in 1993 to $11.6 billion in 2014...” [6]The pure science portion of this heist remained constant at $2 billion while the tech portion was hoisted to $9 billion. The National Science Foundation’s $7 billion budget (climate and otherwise) is spread thinly to thousands of scientists, trainees and post-docs. Regarding climate, the NSF admits: “human-caused changes to the climate system, and their consequences, provide much of the impetus for the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) climate change research.” [7]British science is a government op. Research Councils rake in $4 billion a year from taxpayers. Climate is clearly a preoccupation of the $500-million-a-year Natural Environment Research Council. Engineering and social science councils also cash in. Climate Communication is trending. Separately, the state-owned Meteorological Office employs 200 climate scientists including the scoundrels at the pivotal Hadley Centre for Climate Science who attained infamy during “climate-gate” for manipulating temperature data and suppressing scientific inquiry.Continental science is even more translucent and hydra-headed. Notable organizations include the German Research Foundation (overall budget $3.5 billion), the 37,000-employee Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres and the 23-member European Climate Research Alliance. Europe’s cli-sci feeding frenzy is inseverably collaborative and transdisciplinary.The influential 400-employee Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research made ripples when Director Shellnhuber publicly dreamed of an Earth Constitution interpreted by a Planetary Court empowered to strike down pesky national laws. [8] Scores of like-minded outfits riddle Europe, and America.M.I.T.’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change directors were aghast to hear President Trump borrow their work for his “tiny amount” talking-point. Within hours they corrected the President. [9] (Their 0.2 C guesstimate reflected Paris’s increment over Copenhagen, not the difference between Paris and laissez-faire.) Joint Program co-director John Reilly has called Trump “ignorant” and has dismissed Obama’s climate plans as “timid.” [10] Woe betide the sceptics who rest their case upon the elastic plotlines of a pulp science fiction series.Global Warming is a big lie. Global Warming is a foundational myth of the European Union. Global Warming is a paternalistic deception fostering European hegemony. President Trump should forget about untying the Gordian Knot of climatist sophistry. He should hack it off and throw it down at the feet of the Euros chirping: “nice scam fellas, now let’s compete for the customers of the world.”Referenceshttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/01/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accordhttps://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdfhttp://www.ecofascism.com/article18.html#Waldheimhttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/post-paris-climate-talks-and-geopolitics-wm-kay-primer-final-dec-21-2015.pdfhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/15/the-fourth-reich-is-here—without-a-shot-being-fired/http://www.gao.gov/key_issues/climate_change_funding_management/issue_summaryhttps://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/climate/intro_background.jsphttp://www.humansandnature.org/democracy-hans-joachim-schellnhuberhttp://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-issues-statement-research-paris-agreement-0602http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-and-the-myth-of-the-coal-revivalShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'EU', 'Paris Agreement']",2017/07/07

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/28/alice-in-ontarioland-the-great-ontario-electricity-sale/,,ALICE IN ONTARIOLAND – The Great Ontario Electricity Sale," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland, spellbound his readers by writing a story in which everything seemed topsy-turvy and counter to the ways people think things generally should be. Even Lewis Carroll, however, could not have imagined how the province of Ontario sells electrical energy to its export customers in New York and Michigan.Source: Wikipedia – see copyright details at bottom of the pageIt is an extraordinary tale, and so I will give you the simple version. Since 2005, the Independent Electricity Systems Operator (IESO), the Ontario government agency responsible for managing the electrical energy system, has purchased an increasing amount of electricity from new generators at 20-year fixed term contracts. It also purchases power from the government-owned Ontario Power Generation (OPG). The generators receive two streams of revenue. One stream comes from the price that power sells for in the competitive wholesale market. The other stream is the revenue they receive from the Global Adjustment (GA). The Global Adjustment is a charge on Ontario electricity ratepayers (i.e. consumers) that makes up the difference between what a generator receives on the market for their output and what it was promised in its contract.Even though electricity demand has been falling in Ontario, IESO, under government orders, has been adding more and more generation capacity, especially from wind and solar power generators. This has created a large and growing power surplus. The surplus has, in turn, driven down the market price, resulting in generators receiving higher payments through the Global Adjustment from ratepayers.Electricity generally cannot be stored except at very high cost. Consequently, when supply exceeds demand, IESO first seeks to curtail purchases from generators (i.e. it pays them not to produce) or, when even that is not enough to balance supply and demand, it sells surplus power to export customers.The export customers, mainly in New York and Michigan, buy at the market price – the wholesale rate. This leaves Ontario domestic customers on the hook for the Global Adjustment on electricity exports. It is added to electricity bills and acts as a subsidy from Ontario ratepayers to those in New York and Michigan.According to a joint study by Energy Probe and the Consumer Policy Institute, the cost to Ontario electricity customers for exported power rose from $100 million per year in 2006 to $1.8 billion per year in 2016,.The cost per kilowatt hour (kWh) exported drops furthest on days when there is low demand and high wind. During the week from May 24 to 30 2017, the market rate dropped to 0.11 cents per kWh (eleven one hundredths of a cent per kWh). During that one week, IESO exported 278,712 megawatt hours (MWh), which cost Ontario ratepayers $35.6 million in Global Adjustment costs. But wait, it gets worse. During the previous week (May 17 to 23), the market price was actually negative at -0.5 cents per kWh, so 308,616 MWh were exported. Ontario paid export customers $148,000 to take the electricity but Ontario electricity customers were charged $39.4 million. Eighty per cent of these charges are paid by residential customers.If you were wondering who the Mad Hatter is, look no further than the Premier’s office.~~~Mad Hatter image: By John Tenniel – vector version of Image:MadlHatterByTenniel.jpg), This work is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author’s life plus 100 years or less.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/24/grid-level-electricity-storage-noaas-critique-of-the-wws-vision/,oldbrew ,Grid-Level Electricity Storage – NOAA’s Critique of the WWS Vision," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017A new paper prepared by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Earth System Laboratory and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) is drawing attention in policy circles in the U.S. The paper critiques the claims of a study by Mark Jacobson et. al. that it is feasible, at low cost, to achieve 100% conversion of the U.S. electricity generation system to wind, hydroelectricity and solar energy by 2050 (the “WWS Vision”). The authors of the critique include experts in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who could not be accused of being “climate sceptics”. Indeed, they have previously authored reports in which they concluded that an 80% decarbonisation of the U.S. electrical grid eventually could be achieved at “reasonable” cost, assuming that a broad suite of generation options and other technologies are employed. Their critique of the Jacobson et. al. study, instead, challenges its methodology, modelling and assumptions. One of the most interesting parts of the critique concerns its challenge to the assumption that the variability of wind and solar generation will be readily addressed through the widespread and rapid installation of two grid-level energy storage systems. The Jacobson et. al. study assumes a total of 2,604 gigawatts (GW) of storage charging capacity, more than double the current capacity of all power plants in the U.S.  The energy storage capacity would consist almost entirely of two technologies that “remain unproven at any scale”: 514.6 TWh of Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) and 13.26 TWh of phase change materials (PCMs).  Jacobson et.al. envision UTES systems being deployed in every home, business, office building, hospital, school, and factory in the United States. In the “supporting information” published with the NOAA paper there are more detailed descriptions of the two storage technologies. The following is a summary that may be useful for the layperson. Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES)UTES systems use geothermal boreholes (i.e. holes drilled deeply into the earth) to store heat in the soil. To date, they have only been used in a handful of projects and at small scale. The largest UTES borehole system in the world is a project in Crailsheim, Germany that supplies seasonal thermal storage for 260 homes and two community buildings and has a total storage capacity of 0.0041 TWh. An even smaller ground hole heating system supplies Drake Landing, a master-planned community of solar-powered homes in Alberta. Both of these projects are supplemented by conventional fossil-fuelled heating systems. The performance and cost of UTES systems depends on the underlying geology of the site, such as the thermal properties of the soil and the absence of any groundwater flow (groundwater flow will remove stored heat over time). The two systems now operating supply only heating, whereas the Jacobson et. al. paper envisions 85% of U.S. residential air conditioning, 95% of commercial and industrial air conditioning, and 50% of commercial and industrial refrigeration being coupled with UTES and/or ice-based PCM storage systems. The Jacobson et. al. paper states, but does not document, a wide range of costs for UTES varying from U.S. $0.71 to $1.71 * per kilowatt hour (kWh). The known capital costs for the Drake Landing system, according to the NOAA critique, suggest that a UTES installation cost of at least $1.8 trillion for the 100% wind, solar and hydroelectric system.. This excludes the cost of the requisite heating and cooling systems inside homes, businesses and industrial facilities capable of making use of stored energy in UTES systems. The cost estimates available also are based on installation of UTES at the construction stage; the costs of retrofitting existing buildings are likely to be higher.(* updated/typo corrected June 27, 2017 – previously $.71) Energy Storage in Phase-Change Materials (PCM)The use of phase change materials in high-energy storage is still effectively at the research and development stage. To date, only a handful of concentrating solar power projects have been built worldwide with any thermal storage, and these systems exclusively employ more mature (and costly) molten salt storage systems. Phase-change materials, so-called due to their ability to store heat by transitioning from a solid to a liquid state, include paraffin wax and certain salts. Employing these materials could yield higher densities and lower costs than molten salt. However, several technical challenges must be solved before these storage systems would be ready for commercial use, including notably solving corrosion material degradation and thermal stress-related durability problems. As PCM remains pre-commercial, there is no reliable data for the current cost of PCM storage; it is anyone’s guess. A recent technical report from the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency reported a wide range of U.S. $11 to $55 per kWh. ConclusionThe NOAA critique concludes that, “The relative immaturity of these technologies cannot be reconciled with the authors’ assertion that the solution proposed  (in the Jacobson et.al. paper) are ready to be implemented today at scale at low cost and that there are no technological or economical hurdles to the proposed system.” In fact, much of the case made by those who believe that the world can and should quickly transition away from fossil fuels rests on the thesis that the inherent variability problems associated with wind and solar energy can be solved by energy storage systems. The NOAA paper shows how this thesis rests on the assumed existence of energy storage systems that either do not yet exist, are not ready for mass application and/or would be extraordinarily expensive to implement.~~~~Images in collage licensed from Shutterstock (except unicorn) Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Paris Agreement', 'solar energy', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2017/06/24
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/22/prospects-for-meeting-emission-reduction-goals-the-case-of-quebec/,,PROSPECTS FOR MEETING EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS: THE CASE OF QUEBEC," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017IntroductionMuch of the controversy in Canada concerning climate change issues takes place at a very general level. People discuss first whether one should believe those scientists and modelers who predict catastrophic global warming, and second what are the implications of this for the emissions reductions measures, if any, we should take in Canada. A lively debate still takes place on both questions. We might gain more insights by asking, “What if”. What if, for example, Canadians in each province tried actually to meet the official greenhouse gas emission reduction targets already set by governments? The purpose of this note is to explore the possible implications if the residents of Quebec actually had to meet the targets that have been set for them by the federal and provincial governments over the next thirty-three years (i.e. to 2050) and beyond. A thorough analysis of this would require the use of sophisticated econometric models and an enormous amount of data, which I lack. The comments that follow should thus be considered as attempts to offer qualitative insights into the analysis that must be done and the choices that lie ahead. The TargetsThe Government of Canada formally has committed to the United Nations to reduce GHG emissions from current levels (722 megatonnes, or Mt, of carbon dioxide equivalent, in 2015) to 622 Mt in 2020 and 525 Mt in 2030. In 2008, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a political commitment that Canada would reduce its emissions by 50% or more from 2005 levels by 2050; that would mean a reduction to 369 Mt. The Government of Quebec has made a political commitment to reduce provincial GHG emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. As provincial emissions in 1990 were 90 Mt, this implies a 2020 target of 72 Mt. Quebec has also committed to reduce emissions by 80 to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. That implies emissions levels in a range of 18 Mt to 4.5 Mt by mid-century. Neither the federal nor provincial commitments include any condition concerning future increases in population or economic activity. The goals are based upon the expectation, one can only assume, that somehow emissions reductions can be achieved at rates that will offset economic and population growth and, in addition, achieve very significant reductions in the emissions intensity of the economy. There is also no official connection between the goals articulated by the two different orders of government. Clearly, for example, Quebec’s 2050 target far exceeds what would be required for the province if the emissions reduction measures contemplated to achieve the federal goal were to be applied proportionately across all provinces and territories. The Current SituationThe most recent data on GHG emissions in Quebec are for 2015. According to Environment Canada, Quebec emitted 80.1 Mt in that year, 11.4% of the Canadian total. Table 1 indicates the breakdown of those emissions. Table 1Quebec GHG Emissions by Source in 2015SourcePercentageTransport42Stationary Combustion29Industrial Processes13Agriculture10Waste6  Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada National Inventory Report, 2015 Quebec’s emissions stayed virtually unchanged from 1990 to 2006. Following the onset of the global financial crisis, they declined steadily to 2011, rose briefly in 2012 and then declined again to 2015. Other things equal, they are on a path to meet the 2020 target of 72 Mt. However, a number of background factors may affect this. Quebec’s economic and population growth rate has lagged behind the Canadian average since 1981. From 2011 to 2016, according to Statistics Canada, Quebec’s population grew by 3.3%, compared to 5.0 % for Canada as a whole.  The Quebec Statistics Institute reports that Quebec’s real growth in GDP declined from almost 3% in 2010 to around 1% from 2013 to 2015.  These low rates of population and income growth facilitated emissions reductions. Since late 2015, in contrast, provincial GDP has been rising at a rate above 2% per year.  If Quebec can continue or increase this pace of economic growth, emissions may move higher than forecast. The Potential Implications of the 2050 TargetsThe structure of Quebec’s energy economy differs from that of some other Canadian provinces in two important respects. The first is that, unlike most other provinces, the Quebec economy is not based heavily on resource extraction in the form of hydrocarbons development or hard rock mining, although there are some large mines in the province. It is primarily a service economy. The second is that it is blessed with access to large and already developed hydroelectric power resources that have allowed the province to establish an electricity generation system with very low emissions of greenhouse gases. On a per capita basis, Quebec is one of the lowest GHG emissions jurisdictions in the world. This means that the options available for Quebec to make significant additional emissions reductions at low cost are much more limited than in the case of other provinces, and especially the major hydrocarbon producers and users. For example, while transportation-related emissions represent less than 25% of the total in the western provinces and in Canada as a whole, at 42% in Quebec they constitute the largest share. Emissions from large stationary sources and emissions-intensive industry combined constitute 41% of Quebec emissions. If Quebec’s goals are to be met, the cuts must come in these two areas. This will not be easy. Transportation Reducing emissions in transportation is far more complex than the general public believes. The complexity arises from the differences among the surface, marine and aviation modes of transport and from the many ways in which emissions can be affected, including efficiency improvements in existing vehicle technologies, development and market penetration of new technologies, changes in the behavior of vehicle operators, inter-modal shifts and use of alternative fuels. The academic literature and the media are full of positive expectations about the emissions reduction potential of new technologies, but many of these technologies have not yet been developed, and may not be developed for decades. Most transport-related emissions come from surface vehicles. About half come from cars and light passenger trucks (SUVs), a quarter from commercial trucks, 10% from aircraft, 4 % from rail and the remainder from buses, motorcycles, and off-road vehicles, including those used for farming and construction. The recent and near-term trends in passenger vehicle emissions are almost entirely due to the effects of regulation. In October 2010, Environment Canada issued the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations, which prescribed progressively more stringent annual emissions standards for new vehicles in model years 2011 to 2016. In 2014, Environment Canada introduced even more stringent standards for the 2017 to 2025 model years. Under both phases of light-duty vehicle regulation, the fuel efficiency of new cars will increase by 41% and the fuel efficiency of new passenger light trucks will increase by 37%. In addition, new emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles (buses and trucks) are expected to reduce Canada’s emissions by about 2 Mt by 2020. These emission reductions will come at a high cost to vehicle manufacturers, a cost that will be passed on to consumers via the prices of the vehicles. The vehicle industry argues that, after more than 30 years of increasingly stringent regulations, it is reaching the limits of current technology. Certainly, the regulations are changing the types of vehicles available to consumers. It is unlikely that Quebec can do anything on its own that would change the fuel efficiency and emissions of North American vehicles beyond what is agreed jointly by the U.S. and Canadian governments. Increasing carbon taxes on gasoline will make driving more expensive for drivers, but experience in Europe has shown that even very high prices will not substantially reduce fuel use. In Norway, for example, gasoline prices were CDN $2.46 per liter in the first quarter of 2017, the highest in Europe, and yet gasoline demand there continues to rise. We would need a carbon tax of $60 per tonne to raise average Canadian prices to that level. The “bottom line” is that the combined effect of regulations and higher fuel taxes will increase fuel efficiency and reduce per vehicle emissions, but as has happened to date, the increasing number of cars on the roads will probably leave emissions stable or very slightly declining. It is extremely unlikely that regulation and taxes will force consumers to abandon their cars altogether, as would be required by an emissions reduction of 80 to 95%. What about electric vehicles (EV)? Electric vehicles are the beneficiaries of both large government subsidies and pervasive media hype. However, a 2010 report by J.D Power and Associates that offered a pessimistic view of EV market prospects has proved prophetic. The study concluded that the combined global sales of hybrids and all-electric plug-in vehicles might total 5.2 million units in 2020, just 7.3% of the 70.9 million passenger vehicles to be sold worldwide in that year. At the end of 2016, global sales just passed the 2-million-vehicle mark, well below the J.D. Power estimate for 2020. This is also far less than the numbers projected by the former Obama Administration in the U.S. and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. EVs constitute less than 1% of new vehicle sales in Canada. While sales grow every year, they are unlikely to become a significant portion of the total vehicle fleet for at least 20 years, and perhaps much longer. John Lawson, one of Canada’s foremost transportation economists, has studied the potential for reducing emissions through modal shift (i.e. encouraging passengers or freight movers to switch from high-emission modes of transport to lower-emission modes). The results may be surprising. Doubling of intercity train passenger travel would actually increase emissions slightly, because of the low occupancy rates of trains.Doubling of intercity bus travel would reduce emissions, but only by half a megaton to 2020, because traffic is so limited.Doubling of urban passenger travel by transit (a very ambitious goal) would only save 2.53 Mt in all of Canada by 2020. Municipal governments are already struggling to make the transit capital expenditures they consider necessary to alleviate congestion, and they hardly have the funds needed to double the capacity of the current systems. There are even more limited prospects for massive reductions in freight transportation through inter-modal shifts. Trucks are the fastest growing source of GHG emissions in transportation. Shifting 10% of freight from trucks to rail is considered a significant goal, as businesses prefer trucks for their flexibility; unlike rail, trucks can pick up and deliver freight to many destinations. If a 10% shift from large trucks could be achieved, this would only reduce emissions in all of Canada by 0.42 Mt in 2020. Environmentalists celebrated when a two-seater all-electric aircraft won a race in Europe, beating conventional piston-driven models, and a solar-powered plane flew around the world. The subsequent media coverage rarely mentioned that in both cases most of the aircraft’s weight was the battery, or that it took the solar plane a year to make the trip because of problems with its battery. There are a number of ways to improve the fuel economy of commercial aircraft and these are now being pursued by the international civil aviation industry. The idea that long-distance commercial jetliners could be powered by battery packs, however, lies more in the realm of Jules Verne than in serious aviation planning. The only way to drastically reduce GHG emissions from commercial passenger and freight aircraft is to restrict, indeed possibly ration, their use. This was actually proposed in an early version of the Canadian Green Party’s Platform posted online prior to the federal election of 2015, but it was wisely dropped in the final version. Severely limiting commercial flights in Quebec to meet the 2050 target, of course, would have the double benefit of sharply reducing emissions in the hotel and restaurant industries. Stationary Combustion Sources and Emissions Intensive Industries These sectors of the economy include many of the industrial plants that consume large amounts of oil, natural gas or coal. Across Canada, the firms are mostly in industries related to mining and metals fabrication, petrochemicals, automobile and truck manufacturing (and related parts manufacturing), iron, steel, cement and pulp and paper industries, among others. In the period 2005 to 2012, emissions in these sectors declined, partly due to the effects of the economic recession. As in other sectors, there are opportunities to improve energy efficiency and thereby reduce GHG emissions in Quebec’s emissions-intensive industries. However, reducing total emissions to the range of 18 to 4.5 MT would lower Quebec’s per capita emissions to a level similar to that of Somalia today. Without radical measures, there seems no way to so transform the provincial economy in 33 years, or even in 60 years. Environment and Climate Change Canada publishes the names of the large facility GHG emitters in Canada. There are almost 80 in Quebec, of which the following are the 10 largest:  FacilityCityGHG Emissions  (kt CO2e)Valero RefineryLevis1414Suncor RefineryMontreal1202Aluminerie AlouetteSept-Iles1128Usine de BouletagePort-Cartier979Rio Tinto Fer et TitaneSorel-Tracy907Usine ArvidaSaguenay848Usine AlmaAlma842Cimenterie de Saint-ConstantSaint-Constant818Aluminerie de BecancourBecancour814ArcelorMittalContrecoeur752   To say the least, closing these plants to achieve the emissions reduction target would have important regional implications within Quebec. ConclusionQuebec likely will meet its 2020 emissions reduction target. As increasingly more demanding targets are set, they will be much more difficult to attain. Indeed, it is not clear what set of policy measures could be implemented to achieve the 2050 goal. The most comprehensive policy instrument would be a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The tax regime currently being implemented by the federal government, however, would only raise carbon taxes to $50 per tonne (equivalent to 11.5 cents per liter of gasoline) by 2022. The former National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, in a 2012 report, estimated that a carbon tax of at least $300 per tonne (equivalent to $1.30 a liter of gasoline) would be required to meet a 2050 goal of a 50% reduction in Canadian GHG emissions. The more ambitious Quebec goal of an 80% to 95% reduction would probably require a much higher tax. The political acceptability of carbon taxes may well depend on whether they are fully recycled into the economy through reductions in other generally applied taxes.  Quebec politicians, like those in other provinces, seem very unlikely to pass up the opportunity to spend a revenue windfall on a wide range of favoured projects and groups. In this and many other ways, politics seems likely to undermine the 2050 target. ~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Paris Agreement', 'Quebec', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2017/06/22

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/18/lutopie-du-tout-renouvelable-par-jean-pierre-schaeken-bruxelles-academie-royale-de-belgique-2017/,,"L’Utopie du tout renouvelable, par Jean-Pierre SCHAEKEN, Bruxelles, Académie royale de Belgique, 2017"," Par Drieu Godefridi Je recommande vivement la lecture de ce tout petit (80 pages) ouvrage de synthèse sur l’électricité européenne.https://www.amazon.fr/Lutopie-tout-renouvelable-Jean-Pierre-Schaeken/dp/2803105985/ Après la sortie américaine de l’Accord de Paris, il se confirme que l’Europe s’engagera, seule, dans la voie d’une électricité tout intégralement générée par de l’énergie renouvelable (soleil, vent). Schaeken traite la question de manière purement technique et terre-à-terre. Il commence par examiner les conditions de réalisation d’un système électrique “bas-carbone”. La production de l’éolien et du photovoltaïque suppose de couvrir nos mers et nos champs d’éoliennes, nos toits et nos territoires de panneaux photovoltaïques, ce qui requiert des sommes inouïes qui seront et sont déjà financées par le contribuable. L’adaptation de nos réseaux de distribution au caractère intermittent de l’électricité renouvelable suppose également des sommes colossales — 1500 milliards d’euros d’ici 2050… pour le seul transport de l’électricité ! “Ce n’est pas grave, c’est l’Etat qui paie.” Schaeken montre enfin que les techniques de stockage — sans lesquelles l’électricité renouvelable n’est pas apte à assurer un minimum de sécurité d’approvisionnement, exclure les “black-outs”, etc. — n’existent à l’heure actuelle tout simplement pas, et que rien ne permet de prédire qu’elles existeront un jour sous une forme qui ne soit pas grossièrement onéreuse. Dans une deuxième partie, Schaeken examine l’impact d’une politique bas carbone sur le système électrique européen. Il montre que la sécurité d’approvisionnement est déjà compromise par le mixte électrique actuel, et que par les motifs exposés dans la première partie cette sécurité sera de plus en plus précaire. Quant à la compétitivité, l’équation est simple : les entreprises européennes payent leur électricité de plus en plus cher, tandis que leurs concurrents mondiaux, y compris américains, ont accès à une électricité qui l’est de moins en moins. L’idée que le développement de l’électricité “verte” favorisera l’emploi et la croissance est une plaisanterie : chaque emploi “vert” naît de la subvention de l’Etat, pour un montant qu’il aurait été plus efficace économiquement de laisser dans l’économie marchande. On estime qu’un emploi vert “tue” deux emplois sains. Quand, par ailleurs, la conséquence de l’opération est de renchérir — et dans quelles proportions ! — le prix de l’électricité de toutes les entreprises et professions marchandes sans aucune exception, on mesure aisément que l’opération relève d’une forme de sabotage à grande échelle. Tout cela au nom de la “science” d’un organisme, le GIEC, dont il a été démontré qu’il n’a rien de scientifique et qu’il est intégralement politique. En résumé, l’Europe a déjà dépensé des sommes folles pour l’utopie du tout renouvelable, elle s’apprête à en dépenser bien davantage encore, tout cela avec une influence marginale sur les émissions de CO2, et nulle sur la température moyenne du globe.  L’environnementalisme est le marxisme de notre temps.~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2017/06/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/15/outcome-of-the-paris-accord-a-re-founding-act-of-american-democracy/,Craig King ,Outcome of the Paris Accord: a re-founding act of American democracy?," Interview with Drieu Godefridi, Belgian philosopher, jurist, author of “Le GIEC etMort; Vive le Science” (The IPCC is Dead: Long Live Science) published in English under the title “The IPCC: A Scientific Body?” Godefridi discusses his view that the exit of the Trump Administration from the Paris Agreement is a sensible return to American democracy. Godefridi traces the incremental takeover of public policy by globalists and minority view activists using unelected, unaccountable politically-rife bodies like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under the guise of ‘science’ to foist ever-more economically detrimental demands on the West. These groups use contrived morality and guilt to affect a bank hold-up, the trigger-about-to-be-pulled being the ‘climate catastrophe.’  Without arguing the science, President Trump called that bluff as he exited the Paris Agreement.He called it on economic and common-sense grounds, being accountable and representing the interests of Americans as an elected official. This is in stark contrast to the EU where the unelected, unaccountable EU commission has become detached from the people’s needs and entrenched in the ideological fantasy of the day. This translation includes this introduction and clarifying details for North American audiences. Question: Drieu Godefridi, you qualify the American decision to leave the Paris Agreement as the re-founding act of the American democracy. Could you expand on this surprising point of view, surprising at least, compared to that of most European politicians and analysts?Reply: You are right, this point of view is undoubtedly in the minority. Globalists are now considered as opposed to nationalists. The Europeans and the American Democrats would be the Globalists. The nationalists are the Republican supporters of “America First”. From this point of view, to the Globalist, everything is simple: the American exit from the Paris Accord is a selfish act of a narrow nationalist who cares about the immediate economic interests of America at the expense of the collective interest and that of the planet.On the surface, this narrative is very convincing, it has only one fault: it is false.The Paris Accord marks the apotheosis, not of “globalism,” but of a particular version of globalism, which one should rather qualify as socialist. Indeed, let us recall the actual content of the Paris Agreement! What does it foresee? Essentially, two things: the drastic reduction of CO2 emissions in the West, right away, with the possibility for states such as China – the world’s largest CO2 emitter – to continue to increase emissions to 2030, with no requirement whatsoever to reduce emissions. The second essential component of “Paris” is the Green Fund, which provides for the transfer of $ 100 billion a year from the West to the rest of the world. “Paris” is therefore, first and foremost, the triumph of what was called “support for the Third World” in the 70s and 80s, that is to say, a massive and permanent transfer of wealth from the West to the rest of the world. Question: We can see the socialist component. But what about globalism? How does the Paris Agreement contribute to globalism?Reply: “Paris” is doubly globalist: first, because the transfer of wealth will be done through a clever network of international institutions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Green Fund — an institution, with a secretariat, directors, exotic meeting places, etc. —and all the intermediate institutions created by the Paris Agreement.Secondly, “Paris” is driven by “morality” with the IPCC itself employing the services of moral philosophers to help them make their political case. The founding moral intuition which presides over the Paris Agreement is internationalist socialism. International socialism has always considered that the differential of wealth that benefits the West results from the pillage of the rest of the planet. This is described in terms of imperialism, colonization, exploitation of weaker partners. In that world view, the only “just” solution (aka “climate justice”) to this is the immediate and unconditional transfer of a substantial portion of these wealth to the rest of the world. Thus, the Paris Accord discloses itself clearly as a matter of globalism, but of a very particular vision of it – internationalist socialism. Question: Even if the Paris Agreement is indeed motivated by a socialist vision, is it not selfish and unjust on the part of the Americans to refuse to share their wealth?Reply: The founding thesis of universalist socialism is that the wealth of the West is born of the plunder of the rest of the world. This is obviously false, and this has been demonstrated time and time again. The West owes its surplus of wealth to the preference given over five centuries to a particular economic system, capitalism! [1] The West has rejected the alternatives, socialism or subsistence. Moreover, the falsehood about the capitalist West as simple global robber barons is so well entrenched in leftist/socialist/globalists that even the concessions and foreign aid made to date by the West on are never enough to satisfy the transfer of wealth desired by the Third Worldists.With the Paris Accord, which is not born from nothing, we enter a completely different dimension. This time, it is no longer morality, generosity or compassion (i.e. disaster relief) that requires the transfer of the wealth of the West. It’s science! It is the idea that because the Western industrial world has polluted the world for so many years should mean that the West must transfer its wealth to the rest of the world, which can continue to pollute. Further, this guilt money must be paid into the Green Fund which puts unaccountable, unelected green groups and green rent-seekers an opportunity to exploit this ultimate global subsidy for renewable-intermittent energies! Admire the finesse of the process: it employs the very strength of the West — capitalism — to show that the West has sinned. How naive and amateur are the Third Worldists of the past, with their moral arguments, faced with the omnipotence of the scientific argument!However, and this should have put the flea in the ear of at least some of the European “leaders”, the results are exactly the same: bleeding the West to the benefit of the rest of the world. Question: This coincidence of the present scientific argument with the moral argument of the past does not invalidate the scientific argument! If science tells the truth, is it not fair that the West polluter “pays” the rest of the planet?Reply: Your question is perfectly intelligent. The coincidence of the two arguments does not invalidate the science. However, you likely will have noticed, like me, that the climate debate does not deserve to be described as scientific in any way, anymore. What is the matrix of climate science? That is the IPCC, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As early as 2010, I demonstrated in the book “Le GIEC est mort, vive la science”/ “The IPCC: A Scientific Body?” that by its composition, competences and functioning, the IPCC is a totally political organization, and not a scientific one as it claims. I do not have the competence to pronounce on the science of climate as such, nor do I need it: for it is easy to understand that a political organization can only produce political reports. The current “science” of climate is that of a scholar steeped in science… and politics – with a dominant political gene. Question: Are you telling us that there is no such thing as credible climate science?Reply: Certainly not. But what matters is that so much of the science is skewed by politics – via the IPCC – and by massive public subsidies for scientists, NGOs and companies in line with the IPCC, that it is not possible to qualify the thesis as dominated by science. (It should be noted, moreover, that public subsidies are now supplemented by subsidies from the renewable-intermittent industries, which are closely dependent on public subsidies.) By way of example, here is how John Broome, IPCC moral philosopher, describes the writing process of the IPCC Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) – which is the document used by governments to set national climate policies:“In effect, the text is edited by several hundred people sitting together in a big room. One hundred and seven countries sent delegations of varying sizes. Saudi Arabia is said to have sent ten or more. The delegates arrive with political interests. Many oppose each other diametrically. Moreover, their governments are already locked in negotiations preparing for the major climate-change meeting that is planned for Paris next year under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The wording of the SPM matters to the delegates, since it may be quoted in the negotiations. At our IPCC meeting, they treated the SPM as though it were a legal document rather than a scientific report. It was flattering in one way to find so many governments giving our work such serious attention. But the effects of their attention were often infuriating. To achieve consensus, the text of the SPM was made vaguer in many places, and its content diluted to the extent that in some places not much substance remained.” [2] Question: So the American release of “Paris” is neither selfish nor contrary to science?Reply: One thinks what one wants of the American president, but he perfectly grasped the essence of the Paris Agreement, which is to redistribute the wealth of the West to the rest of the world – he expressly declared it on the Lawn of the White House, on June 1st, 2017 when making the American exit from Paris official. In so doing, he has stopped the formidable internationalist socialist machinery that was in the process of being set up. In other words, he has refused to validate the third-world moral intuition, and the scientific pretext that gave birth to the Paris Agreement. I do not think there is any other way to read this outcome. Question: Yet, in so doing, he is reforming American democracy?Reply: In my view, yes. We live in a reality of which we know that it has become strongly globalized economically. There has been much less attention to the other globalization that has taken place before our eyes, that of an extremely dense network of international organizations and institutions that has increasingly been given the power to create standards by right. Question: How would this second globalization – that of the law – be more problematic than the first one? Are the two not complementary?Reply: The difficulty is that these global organizations are not subject to the same democratic requirements – election and accountability – as well as separation of powers, as are our democratic national institutions. We have denounced so much the “democratic deficit” of the European institutions! Indeed, it is wrong that the faceless and very ideological judges – here I point at the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the EU – decide on the future of Europe in such major areas as immigration or terrorism. They do so, completely apart from the wishes of European citizenry. But this deficit is nothing compared to that of the other international organizations, which generally have only a vague idea of democracy (and often appoint despots to human rights commissions, for instance)! One notes here, before all, the United Nations, whose umbrella organization in the field of climate, the UNFCCC, is just an emanation.What we have been seeing for the past two decades, in the areas of climate, gender theory, immigration and terrorism, and so on, is that activist minority ideologues have confiscated democratic debate. By acting at the international level, they have an enormous advantage. As soon as such an unaccountable international body has seized a cause, its standards prevail over national parliaments! When gender theory was enshrined in its most radical version in 2011 by a Council of Europe Convention, it became virtually impossible to dislodge it. When, in cases such as HIRSI (2012), the European Courts devoted the “no border” ideology, it became almost impossible for the national ministers who wished to defend their own borders to do so. Examples that come to mind are Francken in Belgium, his British and Austrian counterpart, or the countries of the Visegrád group – a handful able to oppose it effectively. But it is in the domain of climate that this confiscation of democratic debate is the most masterful, reaching a kind of virtuosity. Question: Why?Reply: But by the effect of science! The theory of gender is meant to be scientific, but it does not deceive anyone: it is an ideology, assumed as such by authors like Judith Butler. The ideology of the “no border” is moral, it does not claim to be scientific. Climate is something else! Every time since its birth in the fold of the IPCC, the ideology of the climate has claimed science as its foundational authority – and science in its most precise version! Physics! The politicized IPCC has never stopped claiming it is presenting science since. So, it is this second globalization, a prelude to a world government that is openly called for by the elites of internationalist socialism, which is threatened today by the American exit of the Paris Agreement. Question: Let us finish with a prognosis: and now, what will happen?Reply: In my humble opinion, two things: first, “Paris” is dead. We are going to witness a form of hysterical “debate” in Europe. It is clear that France, Belgium and Germany will compete as to who is more virtuous, climate-wise, and that they are supported by the gigantic economic sector of the $1.5 trillion/year sector of “Big Climate” – that of industries and investors in Renewable-intermittent energies, and by high finance helped by ‘green’ groups, which would have had control over the massive transfers of the Green Fund. Of course, economically, the European position is not tenable. The Paris Accord would have been the bank heist of the millennium had Americans complied, is not possible with only the funds of European states such as France, Belgium or the countries of the Southern Europe. These are completely drained financially. These countries are over-indebted, have historically unprecedented levels of taxation, they owe a large amount of money to NATO, how could they finance the Green Fund? Through the EU climate policies, they are increasing the price of their energy every day while the rest of the world – beginning with the Americans – will now lower the price of theirs? Simply stating it this way exposes the lack of serious intent.As for the science of climate, we are going to experience interesting developments. The head of the American environmental agency, Scott Pruitt, announced the setting up of working groups to disentangle the Science from the Ideology in climate science. Question: You believe that this will be the outcome?Reply: I believe this even more today – that this is the solution that I foresaw in 2010! However, this will only have a “virtuous” outcome if the Americans do not replicate the UN error, that is to say, to subject scientists to politics, and pretend – what the IPCC has done with impunity since its foundation – to derive moral and juridical norms from “science”, which is of course an aberration. Question: A word of conclusion?Reply: What dies with “Paris” is the socialist globalism in its present format. It will be reborn from its ashes! After the Third World-ism, after climatism, it will arise as a New Emperor in New Clothes, do not doubt it! The (twisted) egalitarian drive that presides over socialism in all its forms is not ready to disappear. Under the aegis of the previous occupants of the White House, America itself, traditionally more resistant to socialism than the Europeans, has already largely embarked on this path. Therefore, from this point of view, the American break from the Paris-globalist bank heist, deserves to be described as a re-founding – as a return to the roots of American democracy and the wisdom of its founding fathers. Read the original interview with Drieu Godefridi here.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2017/06/15
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/15/the-international-energy-agency-world-energy-outlook-2016/,franktrades ,THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY WORLD ENERGY OUTLOOK 2016," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017In November 2016, the International Energy Agency issued its latest World Energy Outlook (WEO), its summary of econometric model projections of global energy supply and demand from 2015 to 2040. The full outlook sells for several hundred dollars, so most observers have had to make do with the Executive Summary and the presentation of report highlights made to market analysts in London shortly thereafter. The U.S.-based Institute for Energy Research also published a useful summary and commentary in December 2016. More recently, some of those who support the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming have taken to quoting WEO 2016 as evidence that the COP21 Agreement on Climate Change has placed the world on a fundamentally new path of energy development and consumption.  This note will review the contents of the 2016 WEO as revealed in the documents referenced above to allow the reader to judge whether this is correct. The IEA has been publishing World Energy Outlooks every few years since the organization was founded in 1974 at the time of the first OAPEC oil embargo. Then, the IEA was an organization whose primary focus was on energy security matters, meaning the risks posed to the economies of the member states by possible oil supply disruptions and the subsequent volatility of crude oil prices. As the danger of such disruptions subsided during the 1980’s, many policy advisors among the OECD countries questioned whether there remained any need for its continued existence. By then, however, the IEA had established a significant bureaucracy within the OECD structure and regular meetings in Paris proved very appealing. In 1988, European countries began to pay more attention to the claim that humans were causing catastrophic global warming. This, and the increasing political strength of the Green Parties in Europe, meant that the European countries wanted an institution that could serve to coordinate and conduct analysis on the actions countries were taking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The IEA had already demonstrated its expertise in market analysis, so it took on this role. Since then, the IEA’s published analysis, especially its projections of future trends, has been heavily influenced by the preoccupations of the European members. The WEO 2016 is based upon analysis of three scenarios, none of which are well explained in the material available. There is a “main scenario”, another which would place the world on a pathway to meet the United Nations goal of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius, and a scenario involving a pathway consistent with limiting the rise in average global temperatures to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Even the main scenario involves assumptions and projections that are far closer to the U.N.’s policy goals than those of other major forecasters, like the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Here are the most important projections from the main scenario: Global energy demand will rise 30% from 2015 to 2040. Consumption of all fuels will increase.Total energy consumption in OECD countries will decline but increase significantly in China, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and parts of Africa.The demand for low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear energy, hydro-electricity, biomass, wind and solar will represent the largest share (nearly half) of the increase in global energy demand over the period 2015-2040.In 2040, solar photovoltaic power generation will exceed 2,000 terawatt hours globally, and wind generation will exceed 4,000 terawatt hours.There will be extremely fast growth in the take-up of electric vehicles, with the worldwide stock of electric cars reaching 30 million by 2025 (up from 2 million at the end of 2016) and 150 million in 2040. Like the growth in renewable energy, this depends on the continuation of “supportive policies”.Oil consumption will grow to 103.5 million barrels per day in 2040.Natural gas demand will grow at an annual rate of 1.5% to 2040, with LNG playing an increasingly important role in trade.While coal consumption in the United States and Europe will decline by up to 60% by 2040, global coal consumption will continue to increase due to growth in China, India and Southeast Asia.Fossil fuels will still represent 74% of global energy demand in 2040.Countries are on a track to achieve the goals set out in their Paris Agreement pledges (presumably meaning the goals set out in the first set of five year Individual Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs).These measures will slow the growth in greenhouse gas emissions, but will not be nearly enough to limit warming to less than 2 degrees C.“The transformation required for a reasonable chance of remaining within the temperature goal of 1.5 degrees C. is stark. It would require net-zero emissions at some point between 2040 and 2060, thus requiring radical near-term reductions in energy sector CO2 emissions, employing every known technological, societal and regulatory decarbonization option.” It is not clear on which basis the IEA could judge that countries are on a track to meet the “pledges” in their first five-year INDCs, when the assessment was being made less than one year after the pledges were filed. The summaries of WEO 2016 released to the public lay special emphasis and pride of place on the projected growth in renewable energy consumption, the increases in electric vehicle sales, the enormous potential in energy efficiency improvements and recent (one-year) declines in hydrocarbon industry investment. WEO 2016 never explains what it means by the “supportive policies” that it foresees bringing this about, but the intent seems clear – strict regulatory mandates and very large taxpayer-funded subsidies for the foreseeable future. For all of its focus on global warming-related objectives, it is notable that the WEO 2016 report summaries nowhere mention what will happen in terms of global greenhouse gas emissions to 2040. With consumption of all fossil fuels growing to that point in time, the result, however, should be clear. World Energy Outlook 2016, https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2016/november/world-energy-outlook-2016.html IEA Fact Sheet, World Energy Outlookhttp://www.iea.org/media/publications/weo/WEO2016Factsheet.pdf Institute for Energy Research Summaryhttp://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/ieas-world-energy-outlook-2016-includes-paris-agreement-doesnt-reach-goal/  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['decarbonization', 'Uncategorized']",2017/06/15
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/06/09/the-cop21-agreement-just-the-facts-please/,Barry Bateman ,"THE COP21 AGREEMENT – JUST THE FACTS, PLEASE"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017In the classic television series Dragnet, broadcast in the 1950’s, the main character was a deadpan detective named Joe Friday. Friday would cut through the stories being told to him by any witness by insisting, “Just the facts, please”. Dragnet became a model for many different police dramas over the years, and the advice, “Just the facts, please” took its place in the English language as a helpful reminder of how to get past much of the confusion surrounding any discussion.I thought of this as I read and listened to the comments in the broadcast and social media concerning the Trump Administration’s decision to withdraw the United States from the current United Nations agreement, reached at the Conference of the Parties in December 2015 (COP21), to deal with climate change. According to the media comments, the sky is truly falling and the United States has given up its “leadership”; indeed, it has become a “rogue state”, along with countries like North Korea, Somalia, Libya and Uganda. Let us, like Joe Friday, examine the facts. Question: What, exactly did COP21 commit countries to do? Answer:  COP21 contains no commitments for the Parties to the agreement to meet any emissions reduction target, either globally or individually. It contains very few binding legal requirements, there is no formula for determining what each country’s obligations are, and there are no legal penalties for non-compliance. Rather, it represents a best-efforts political commitment to keep the level of global GHG emissions below that which, in theory, might produce a 1.5 degree Celsius increase in average global temperatures. Each country is committed “to prepare and maintain successive individual nationally determined contributions (INDCs) that it intends to achieve”, to update these plans every five years and to pursue and report on the related domestic emission reduction measures. After three years, a Party may withdraw from the Agreement with one year’s notice. There is an unresolved debate as to whether to call COP21 an agreement or a treaty.To call it a treaty in the U.S. would mean that it would be subject to Senate ratification, where it would never pass. To call it just an agreement in other countries could reduce its credibility to nothing. That is why the agreement/treaty commits countries to accept an “aspirational goal”, but steers clear of specific targets. COP21 reiterates a goal first articulated in the 2010 Copenhagen COP agreement. The developed countries, meaning the 24 countries on the “Annex II” list, committed again to “set a collective goal” for a Green Climate Fund of at least U.S. $100 billion a year, “taking into account the needs and priorities of the developing countries”. This too is voluntary and there is no formula as to which country should pay what. The Annex II countries includes several OECD countries but not some of the world’s largest and highest income countries like China, Russia, Brazil, or Saudi Arabia. The developing countries eligible to receive contributions from the fund include the middle-income countries like China, Brazil, Mexico and India. There is no requirement for developing countries to report what they do with the money. In fact, the least developed countries are exempted entirely from the requirement even to prepare “nationally determined contributions” to emissions reductions. Finally, COP21 authorizes the establishment of several new programs to be run by the United Nations Secretariat, which will administer and advise on adherence to the agreement. There will be “progress reviews”, all voluntary. Question: What did previous agreements commit countries to do, and how did that work out? Answer: In 1988, governments working together at international levels first raised concerns about the possibility that increasing human-related emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) might be having an adverse impact on global temperatures. In 1992, developed countries agreed on a voluntary target of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2005. Only Germany, the United Kingdom managed to attain those targets. In 1997, about 150 countries committed under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions by an average of 5% below 1990 levels by the 2008 to 2012 period. China and India never signed the treaty, while the United States signed but did not ratify it, so three of the largest emitters in the world stayed out. In 2011, Canada, Japan and Russia announced that they would not take on further Kyoto targets. Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Treaty in December 2011, citing its objection to being required to pay up to $14 billion in penalties when no other country was being so penalized. Only Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden attained their Kyoto targets. Germany did so because, following reunification, it modernized the former East German electricity generation based on brown coal. The U.K did so because natural gas replaced coal from the formerly government-run coal mines. Sweden completely transformed its district heating systems, switching from coal to biomass and replacing oil-fueled boilers with heat pumps. The U.N. considers biomass to be carbon-neutral even though burning it discharges large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A second commitment period, known as the Doha amendment, was agreed in 2012. In it 37 countries had binding targets. However, the Doha Amendment did not enter into force, as it did not achieve the acceptance of the required 144 states. Question: What has happened to global emissions since countries started adopting emissions reduction targets? Answer: The attached table shows the levels of global emissions for selected years since 1990. The numbers are in terms of million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and the source is the United States Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. Global EmissionsYearMillion Tons CO2 Equivalent199022,273200024,690201033,472201436,138   In summary, in spite of governments’ repeated agreements to reduce emissions, from 1990 to 2014 global emissions grew by 62 %. Most of this growth occurred in the less developed countries, and especially in Asia. Question: What did the COP21 Parties commit to do their first submissions of Individual Nationally Determined Contributions? Answer: On October 30, 2015, the U.N. secretariat published a synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the INDCs that had been submitted up that point. By then, 119 submissions had been received, covering 147 Parties to the Convention and representing 86% of global emissions to 2010. According to the U.N. synthesis, the actions set out in the INDCs would result in global emission levels of 55.3 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2025 and 56.7 Gt of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030. When presented in ranges, global emissions would be 34-46% higher than 1990 levels in 2025 and 37-52% higher than 1990 levels in 2030. The U.N. estimates that the growth of emissions would be slowed by 10 to 57 % from the rate that occurred between 1990 and 2010. Bjorn Lomborg, a professor at the Copenhagen Business School, has analysed the temperature reduction impact of the INDCs submitted to date, using the standard MAGICC climate model. This model integrates all of the premises and equations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that increasing human-related greenhouse gas emissions will cause significant global warming in future, which remains the subject of intense debate. Even optimistically assuming that promised emission cuts are maintained throughout the century, the impacts of the Actions to be taken pursuant to COP21 are generally small. All climate policies by the US, China, the EU and the rest of the world, implemented from the early 2000s to 2030 and sustained through the century will likely reduce global temperature rise about 0.17°C in 2100. In effect, these commitments will do little to stabilize the climate and their impact will be undetectable for many decades. The following graph illustrates the difference COP21 would make. Question: Is it true that China’s INDC shows it to be the world leader in addressing global warming? Answer: China’s INDC has been very favourably reviewed by a number of environmental groups. China is by far the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. The Chinese economy and population continues to grow rapidly by comparison with other countries, so the challenge for China is somehow to break the link between economic growth and the increases in emissions associated with higher energy demand. The Chinese INDC projects that this will be accomplished by making the economy less emissions-intensive. Thus, the goal is to decease the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% from the 2005 level by 2030. China also hopes to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% and to substantially increase the size of its forests. The result would be that China’s carbon dioxide emissions would peak around 2030 and possibly decline from there. These are probably “aspirational” goals, as they assume unprecedented changes in the energy economy. Even if these goals were attained, however, Chinese emissions by 2030 would be two to two and a half times as high as those of the next largest emitter, the United States. China is not required under the COP21 agreement to make any contributions to the funding of the Green Climate Fund. As noted previously, it can in fact qualify as a recipient of that fund. Question: What are the current sources of energy consumption in the world? Answer: According to the International Energy Agency, in 2012 (the most recent year for which confirmed data are available), global consumption of energy by source, as measured in terms of quadrillion British thermal Units (BTU) was as follows: liquid fuels (mainly oil and natural gas liquids), 183.55; coal, 153.27; natural gas, 124.21; nuclear, 24.47; and renewables 63.77. Renewables include primarily hydroelectric power and biomass, meaning traditional burning of wood and dried animal dung. Roughly speaking, therefore, the percentage breakdown is liquids fuels 33%; coal 28%, natural gas 23%; nuclear 5%, and renewables 12%. Wind and solar energy combined account for less than 2%. Question: How are greenhouse gas emissions projected to grow in future according to the most expert sources? Answer: According to the United States Energy Information Administration’s 2016 International Energy Outlook, based on its best analysis of economic, population and technology trends, global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will grow from 32.3 gigatonnes in 2012 to 43.2 gigatonnes in 2040, a 34% increase. Ninety-one per cent of the emissions growth will take place outside the OECD, mostly in China, India and Southeast Asia. Here are three graphs from the International Energy Outlook report that illustrate the trends.  Those are the facts. Readers can draw their own conclusions as to whether the United States involvement or non-involvement in the COP21 agreement is likely to have a significant impact on the growth of global greenhouse gas emissions or on future average global temperatures.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Uncategorized']",2017/06/09

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/05/30/the-sky-is-falling/,mark4asp ,The Sky is Falling!," Contributed by Robert Lyman © May 2017 In a story published two days ago in the Independent, a U.K. newsmagazine, Seth Berenstein reported on the claims of a group of scientists, including Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton University, about the possible effects of the United States withdrawing from the December 2015 Paris agreement on global warming. Oppenheimer is quoted as saying that “one expert group” (unidentified) ran a worst case computer simulation of what would happen if the U.S. does not curb greenhouse gas emissions but all other countries meet their targets. It found that “America would add as much as half a degree of warming (0.3 degrees Celsius) to the globe by the end of the century.” “Another computer simulation team put the effect of the U.S. pulling out somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2 degrees Celsius.” Wow! As a matter of fact, the Paris Agreement contains no targets. It is a “best efforts” political commitment to constrain the growth in global GHG emissions by amounts to be set by each country in a series of five-year plans. The first five-year plans were estimated to reduce eventual warming (if one believes the models) by about .015 degrees. Even those emissions reductions were contingent on the industrialized countries giving at least $100 billion per year to the developing countries to finance their programs. The developing countries have since said that they need at least $300 billion a year and the industrialized countries have not even come up with $40 billion over five years. The thesis that all the other countries of the world would, absent the U.S. participation, go on to reduce emissions by the amounts envisioned by U.N. bureaucrats is baseless anyway. The U.N. claims that global emissions will have to be cut in half from today’s levels by 2050. All the authoritative sources on global energy supply, demand and emissions project that, instead, emissions will grow by 40% or more by 2050. So, under an unrealistic scenario based on questionable modeling and inaccurate assumptions about what the rest of the world will do, the so-called experts are projecting that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement could affect global temperatures by somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 degrees Celsius 83 years from now.

The Board itself operates at arms’ length from politicians, and is supported by a secretariat that includes a group of highly skilled, technical staff who can assess engineering, economic, financial, safety and environmental issues. The NEB’s mandate is to carefully review proposals for national energy infrastructure, such as pipelines and power lines, and oil/gas imports/exports, and to carry out energy market analysis with which it can advise the government.Recently various activists and environmental groups claimed the NEB process was flawed and demanded a review.  A panel appointed by the government has just completed the review and offered recommendations for a significant revision to replace the NEB with an entirely new structure and processRobert Lyman posed the question “Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?” at his Calgary presentation on May 9, 2017. The proposed changes to the NEB are a related complication. Canadians must look at the highly competitive global markets and evaluate whether making infrastructure projects more difficult to approve, in a process that is apparently less technical, is in the best economic interests of the nation, even as Canada is already an acknowledged leader in environmental management.  Ottawa energy policy expert, Robert Lyman, has contributed the following overview.  This summary is the first of a multi-part series on this topic. – Friends of Science SocietyTHE REPORT OF THE EXPERT PANEL ON THE MODERNIZATIONOF THE NATIONAL ENERGY BOARDContributed by Robert Lyman © May 17, 2017This document is intended to provide a summary of the key elements of the May 15, 2017 report of the panel appointed by the current Trudeau Government with a mandate to offer recommendations that would “modernize” the National Energy Board, and specifically would “position the NEB as a modern, efficient, and effective energy regulator and regain public trust”. This summary will focus especially on the policy and regulatory system that would result if the panel’s recommendations were accepted and implemented, not on the rationale offered by the panel. As introduction, however, it should be noted that the panel presented its conclusions as a product of its cross-Canada consultations and as part of “a comprehensive vision for the future of the energy transmission infrastructure regulation” in Canada. Notably, the report recommended: Placing energy infrastructure regulation within the framework of a national energy strategy that furthers Canada’s climate change emissions reduction commitments;Significantly increasing the role and authority of indigenous people (“creating a nation-to-nation relationship”) in all phases of energy policy, infrastructure regulation, and lifelong oversight of energy infrastructure;Radically increasing the scale and scope of stakeholder engagement in all phases of energy project regulation; andIncreasing the transparency and openness of all licensing processes and follow-up actions by the regulator. To achieve this vision, the panel recommends the following: Replacement of the National Energy Board with an entirely new policy and regulatory review systemRecommendation that, as the first stage in that system, the government of Canada develop an energy strategy that “reconciles economic, social and environmental (particularly climate change) goals in a way that can meaningfully inform decision making and frame the context for debates about whether, for example, a proposed energy infrastructure project aligns with Canada’s big-picture goals for economic, social and environmental progress”.Establishment of the first step in project review as a one-year process in which the Governor in Council (i.e. the federal Cabinet), after extensive consultations with aboriginals and analysis by a new Major Projects Management Office in Natural Resources Canada of its strategic acceptability, would determine whether the project “aligned with the national interest”;Creation of a new Canadian Energy Transmission Commission (CETC) to replace the National Energy Board. This board, along with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEA), would evaluate “the potential risks of a project to Indigenous peoples (based on robust consultation), the environment, and human health and safety”. This process would be conducted by a five-person panel of Hearing Commissioners at least one of whom is indigenous), composed of two commissioners from the CETC, two commissioners from the CEA, and a fifth panel member. The environmental assessment would take place under CEA authority. The panel expects this to be a process that would take one year.The CETC would then examine all the “technical issues” related to the pipeline and whether it could operate safely and securely (there is no mention of regulating safety, engineering, economic viability or rates). This process would take another two years and, if satisfied, the Joint Panel would have authority to grant or deny licences.Creation of a new, independent Canadian Energy Information Agency, separate from policy and regulatory functions, to provide “information and analysis for policy makers and the public”.The CETC play a major role in “keeping the land pure”, by regulating the safety and integrity of pipelines and electricity transmission lines during their operation, recognizing that “as we reduce our global dependence on fossil fuels we can expect the number of new major pipeline projects to dwindle…Overall, the goal shared by the CETC and industry is an ambitious one: zero incidents and zero releases.”Initial Comments on ReportThe report is broadly divided into three parts.The first part sets out the panel’s key premises, virtually all of which came from its public meetings with environmental and aboriginal groups. The premises include the following: That the National Energy Board members and staff are not diverse and lack sufficient expertise in fields such as environmental science, community development and indigenous traditional knowledge.That the National Energy Board has been “captured by the oil and gas industry, with many Board members who come from the industry that the NEB regulates and who –at least appear to – have an innate bias towards the industry”.That the NEB “limits public engagement, does not account for many of its decisions and generally operates in ways that seem opaque”.That non-industry players “must fight to have access to usable information about NEB-regulated activities, must fight to be heard, and who have little assurance that, when they are heard, their input is afforded any weight.”That the NEB operates in a national policy vacuum.That the NEB fails because it cannot serve as a forum for public debate about “national policy”, meaning climate change policy.That the NEB is not transparent, because “people are unclear as to the rationale behind NEB and Governor in Council decisions, what factors were considered, and how the process unfolded to arrive at a decision.”That the NEB operates a system in which “the rules are not clear to everyone at the outset.”Every one of these premises is wrong. It will require a longer paper to explain why.The second part of the report goes on to set out a number of recommendations for institutional change based upon other, seriously problematic, policy views. The most important of these policy views is that Canada has already decided to phase out the production and use of fossil fuels as part of its climate change policy and that all decisions on new energy infrastructure must be taken based upon this over-riding policy goal.  At no time has the federal government accepted the premise that meeting Canada’s international climate change-related obligations requires us to shut down one of our most important industries or to deprive Canadians of access to low cost, efficient fossil fuels.The second most important of these policy views is that the federal government’s commitment to “reconciliation” with Canada’s indigenous people requires that Canada’s native bands be given extraordinarily increased decision-making powers as part of the governance regime and be dealt with on a “nation-to-nation” basis.  This is an extremely broad interpretation of the federal government’s intent in responding to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report that examined the experience of aboriginal Canadians in the federal government’s former residential schools system. It would give aboriginal groups a virtual veto on all future energy infrastructure development.Both of these policy views deserve to be fully explained and refuted.Finally, the third part of the report presents a “vision” of a new policy and regulatory regime that would be a bureaucratic nightmare for any company that sought approval for new hydrocarbon energy infrastructure. The regime would have two stages. The first stage would entail a policy review and approval by federal officials and the Canadian Cabinet; as described in the panel report, it would be a thinly disguised screening process to test for acceptability to climate change considerations. The second stage would be a more technical review by a panel dominated by environmental and aboriginal interests. The process would, in theory, take one to four years, but as most projects would be denied after policy review, it can be presented as “more efficient”. Any project that made it through the entire process would almost certainly be wrapped up in regulatory reviews and public consultations for many years. The delay itself would probably make most projects unfeasible.It remains completely unexplained, of course, why such an onerous regime should apply to energy infrastructure proposals and not to major project proposals involving emissions-intensive industries like mining, petrochemicals, automobile and parts manufacturing, steel, iron and cement.The impact of such a regime on the exercise of provincial jurisdiction over natural resources is not explained but, I think, would be onerous indeed.Over the coming days, I will provide more in-depth comments on the report and on what may happen next. THE REPORT OF THE EXPERT PANEL ON MODERNIZING THE NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD – FALSE PREMISES PART 1IntroductionOn May 15 2017, a panel appointed by the Canadian federal government published its report on how to “modernize” the National Energy Board. This is the first in a series of commentaries that will examine whether the premises upon which the panel report were based, drawn largely from the panel’s meetings with environmental and aboriginal interest groups, are correct. In this paper, I will comment on the following two inter-related premises, drawing especially upon the actual performance of the National Energy Board panels that reviewed two recent pipeline projects in British Columbia – the Enbridge Northern Gateway project and the Trans Mountain Expansion project. The premises are: That the NEB “limits public engagement, does not account for many of its decisions and generally operates in ways that seem opaque”; andThat non-industry players “must fight to have access to usable information about NEB-regulated activities, must fight to be heard, and have little assurance that, when they are heard, their input is afforded any weight.” The Northern Gateway Project The Northern Gateway project was a proposal by Enbridge Inc. to build two oil pipelines from Bruderheim, Alberta to Kitimat, British Columbia, and a marine terminal at Kitimat so that tankers could transport oil from Kitimat to Pacific markets. Enbridge invested more than $450 million to develop the project, including the preparation of extensive reviews of the environmental, land use and social effects. It also carried out broadly based consultations with aboriginal groups. Enbridge offered up to ten per cent of the equity in the project to 40 aboriginal groups, and 26 accepted the offer. After years of preparatory work, in May 2010 Enbridge filed the project application with the National Energy Board. The Canadian Minister of the Environment and the National Energy Board established a Joint Review Panel to consider the application in accordance with the requirements of the National Energy Board Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The joint review process took over four years to complete. In 2011, the NEB staff provided 35 public information sessions and 32 online workshops to share procedural information and to answer questions about how to participate in the hearing process. From January to July 2012, the joint panel heard oral evidence from 393 participants in 17 communities. It also heard oral statements from 1,179 individuals. 206 intervenors and 12 governmental participants registered for the formal hearing process. During the formal hearing process, experts presented evidence for and against the project. Northern Gateway and 56 other parties submitted written final arguments. The joint panel heard voluminous evidence related to the merits of the project (as well as hundreds of political comments that dealt with subjects outside of the panel’s scope of review), and listened to many arguments during the formal hearing process and cross-examination. Based on this and the analysis done by supporting staff, the joint panel concluded that the project was in the public interest and recommended to the Minister of Environment and the Canadian Cabinet that the Northern Gateway Pipeline project be approved. In doing so, it recommended the imposition of an unprecedented 209 conditions. The National Energy Report, as usual, issued a lengthy and comprehensive report on the process it followed, on the issues considered, and on the reasons for its decisions. Copies of the two volumes of the report are available to anyone with access to a computer and the Internet. It can be seen here:http://gatewaypanel.review-examen.gc.ca/clf-nsi/dcmnt/rcmndtnsrprt/rcmndtnsrprt-eng.htmlIn June 2014, the (Conservative) federal government accepted the joint panel’s report and authorized the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity. On June 30 2016, however, the Federal Court of Appeal, in a split decision, quashed the government’s decision. The regulatory approval process and the decision of the then Governor in Council to approve the Northern Gateway Project had been challenged on a number of administrative grounds and on the basis that consultation with Aboriginal groups at various stages had been inadequate. All of the administrative law challenges and a majority of the consultation challenges were rejected. However, two judges (the “Majority”) concluded that the Order in Council and the certificate of public convenience and necessity should be quashed on the grounds that Canada had not discharged its duty to consult in the period following the regulatory process but prior to the Governor in Council decision. A dissenting judge of the Court would have upheld the approval. In other words, the Court did not object to the joint panel’s decisions or to the process that it had followed in reaching them. The Federal Court sent the joint review panel’s recommendation to the (Liberal) federal government for review. The Liberal government decided that, notwithstanding the findings of the panel, the project was likely to cause “significant adverse environmental effects that are not justified in the circumstances”. It directed the NEB to dismiss the Northern Gateway application. In doing so, it referred to the fact that the project would involve crude oil tankers transiting through the Douglas Channel, but it offered no further explanation. This was directly counter to the findings of the federal government’s own Termpol Review Committee, an expert, non-partisan committee of federal government officials that examined the risks associated with the marine portion of the Northern Gateway project. It is notable, perhaps, that no one in the Canadian media reported or made an issue of this. In summary, the NEB/CEAA Joint Review Panel completed an extensive, prolonged and rigorous review on the Northern Gateway project proposal in which thousands of stakeholders, including notably environmentalists and aboriginal groups, had many opportunities to participate, and did so. The NEB published a full explanation for every aspect of its final decision. The Trans Mountain Expansion Project Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC is a company that has operated an oil pipeline system that runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia for over 60 years. After extensive preparation, in December 2013 the company submitted an application to the National Energy Board for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct an expansion of its existing system. The project would involve the twinning of the existing 1,147 km pipeline with about 987 km of new buried pipeline along the same right-of-way. It would increase the capacity of the existing system from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day. The project also involved the expansion and upgrading of the terminal facilities at Burnaby to allow increased tanker traffic. Starting in May 2012, Trans Mountain Pipeline conducted an intensive series of consultations and exchanges with stakeholders, governments, landowners, aboriginal groups and the general public. These conversations allowed the company to share project information and hear stakeholder feedback, concerns and questions through face-to-face meetings and social media. Throughout these conversations, the company sought feedback on specific routing details, as well as environmental and other local impacts. Stakeholders provided feedback on many aspects of the project.  The following is a high-level outline of the stakeholder engagement opportunities the company has offered.https://www.transmountain.com/reporting-back In addition to the stakeholder contacts initiated by the company, The National Energy Board required Trans Mountain to contact anyone who lives, works or uses land and resources along the proposed pipeline route. The Board took several steps to ensure that those who could potentially be affected by the project were aware of it and knew how they could get involved in the review. In addition, the Board assigned a Project Advisory Team to help participants understand the hearing process and decide how best to participate.To facilitate the participation of aboriginal groups, landowners, individuals and groups, associations and non-profit organizations, the NEB made $1.5 million available to eligible intervenors to participate in the Trans Mountain Expansion Project hearing. There was also special participant funding offered in September 2015 for up to $10,000 per applicant to cover eligible evidence. In all, theParticipant Funding Program offered funding valued at $3,085,370 to 72 eligible intervenors; 79 per cent of this funding was offered to aboriginal groups. With the exception of oral “traditional evidence” received from Aboriginal groups, evidence was presented in writing, and testing of that evidence was carried out through written questions, known as Information Requests. Intervenors submitted over 15,000 questions to Trans Mountain over two rounds of IRs. Hundreds of other questions were asked, and answered, over six additional rounds of IRs. As there were 400 intervenors and legislated time limits, the Board decided that it was best to test the evidence through written processes. With the participation of about 400 intervenors and 1,250 commenters, the Board received significant information about the pipeline corridor. There were over 1,600 participants in the hearing. In response to requests from aboriginal groups, the Board heard oral evidence based on “oral tradition” from 49 groups. During the hearings, there were 291 motions and review applications, and the Board responded to each of these. In each case, it provided reasons for its decisions on the motions. The Board completed a review of all the issues related to the public interest in the proposed pipeline. In addition to the economic, social, financial, and safety issues traditional to its mandate, the Board completed a comprehensive environmental assessment of the project in accordance with its authority under the National Energy Board Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. In May 2016, two and a half years after receipt of the project application, the NEB issued its reasons for decision with respect to the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. It found that the Trans Mountain Expansion project was in Canada’s public interest and recommended that the Governor-in-Council (i.e. the federal Cabinet) approve the project and direct the Board to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity. It also recommended that, if the Cabinet approved the project, it impose 157 conditions dealing with safety, the environment and other issues. The full text of the NEB’s 530-page decision is available for all to read on the Board’s website. After yet further consultations with aboriginal groups and a review by Environment and Climate Change Canada of the greenhouse gas emissions that might be associated with the upstream suppliers of the pipeline, the federal (Liberal) Cabinet approved the NEB recommendations, including the conditions to be applied.Conclusion The preceding description of the reviews of the Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline projects should make clear that the National Energy Board has gone to extraordinary lengths to hear every view and every person who might conceivably be affected by the projects. It has used its influence and regulatory powers to increase the proponents’ already extensive engagement with stakeholders. It has given stakeholders multiple opportunities to be heard and to influence the decision process. Finally, it has explained, repeatedly and at length, the reasons for its decisions. It has met an extremely high standard of openness and transparency. This shows that the first, and one of the most important, premises of the Expert Panel on Modernizing the National Energy Board is wrong. THE REPORT OF THE EXPERT PANEL ON MODERNIZING THE  NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD – THE CENTRAL FLAW – Part TwoOn May 15 2017, a panel appointed by the Canadian federal government published its report on how to “modernize” the National Energy Board. This is the second in a series of commentaries that will examine whether the premises upon which the panel report were based, drawn largely from the panel’s meetings with environmental and aboriginal interest groups, are correct. In this paper, I will comment on the central recommendation of the panel, which is that the governance of Canada’s public interest review of proposed international and inter-provincial pipelines and electricity transmission systems, as now performed by the National Energy Board, should be jettisoned in favour of a two-phase system. Under the two-phase system, the federal Government should first conduct a “policy” review, and then a joint panel consisting of representatives of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and a new Canadian Energy Transmission Commission would conduct a review based on its assessment of “technical considerations and risk mitigation”. The alleged justification for this departure from long-standing Canadian practice is that the National Energy Board does not now provide an authoritative, independent and expert review of the public interest considerations that apply to energy transmission systems. Various parties, including several environmental and aboriginal representatives who provided comments to the panel, claimed this was so. In fact, the panel appears to have accepted all of this testimony as truth, without making any effort to check the factual accuracy of the allegations. The establishment of the National Energy Board in 1959 followed the first report of the Royal Commission on Energy (the “Borden Commission”) in October 1958. While much of the work of that commission dealt with issues of energy trade and market access (especially the question of whether Canadian crude oil should be exported to the United States or sold in eastern Canada), it followed a number of pipeline and energy supply controversies that were highly politicized. The government of the day recognized that it would far better serve Canada’s public interest if the decisions concerning major energy issues were, in the first instance, made by an independent expert tribunal at arms’ length from the partisan political process. In setting up the National Energy Board, the government designed it to perform this function. The government, by taking two other measures, also assured that the board would operate with due consideration for all interests. First, it made the board a quasi-judicial tribunal that had the power and obligation to hear evidence on the record and to submit it to cross-examination. This did not limit the ability of the board to gather information by other means, such as public hearings, but it ensured that, on matters where the board’s decision was required, its process would be fair and consistent with due process. (1) Second, the government provided the board with a strong secretariat, staffed with experts in all the fields in which the board would hear evidence. Thus, the board, in hearing an application for pipeline approval, can draw upon sound professional advice from independent experts on its own staff on economic, environmental, social, engineering, financial, safety and other public interest matters. In its adjudicative role, the NEB must decide or recommend if a project is in the Canadian public interest. The NEB Act does not explicitly define the Canadian public interest. However, it sets out direction about certain factors to be taken into account. Subsection 52(2) of the Act states the following: “The public interest is inclusive of all Canadians and refers to a balance of economic, environmental and social interests that change as society’s values and preferences evolve over time. As a regulator, the Board must estimate the overall public good a project may create and its potential negative effects, weigh its various impacts, and make a decision.” Under the National Energy Board Act, the NEB makes a recommendation on whether it is in the present and future public convenience and necessity that a pipeline project be approved. The Board does so by preparing and submitting to the Governor-in-Council (i.e. the federal Cabinet) a report containing its recommendation on whether a certificate should be issued and its reasons, and setting out the terms and conditions that the Board considers necessary or desirable. The Governor-in-Council makes the decision. It can direct the Board to issue the certificate, direct it to dismiss the application, or refer the report back to the Board for reconsideration of the recommendation and/or a term or condition. The National Energy Board has been recognized internationally as a model for how independent, expert regulation should occur. The success of the board in assessing the public interest has been such that only twice in its history has a government ever felt it necessary to reject the board’s recommendation as to how to deal with a facilities application. The Expert Panel now recommends that the entire NEB organization and process be overturned in order to “align NEB activities with national policy goals”. What are the national energy policy goals? The NEB already undertakes extensive analysis and review of the economic, environmental, social, engineering, financial, and safety issues. Does that not offer a comprehensive list of all the non-political issues that a government might wish to consider on the record and with full public input? Yes, it does, with one large exception that the Expert Panel considers pre-eminent – climate change. The Expert Panel’s report makes clear that it sees the public interest, the “strategic energy policy” consideration, as the need to constrain the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. It finds it intolerable that the “federal government (in partnership with the provinces) is exploring the creation of large pipeline projects which inherently signal planned increases in our overall production and continued global and domestic use of fossil fuels, an objective that is seemingly at irreconcilable odds with Canada’s stated goal of reducing emissions and moving away from fossil fuels.” It thus favours the introduction of an initial energy strategy stage at which federal government departments, followed by the federal Cabinet, would make a decision on a project’s alignment with the national interest, meaning primarily with the government climate change policy. The first observation one might make is that, if the Canadian government really has decided that Canadians are henceforth not to make any new investments or take actions that will increase greenhouse gas emissions, this could easily be communicated to the National Energy Board so that it would be included in the considerations applied by the board in dealing with applications to construct new energy transmission facilities. There would be no need for Cabinet to remake this judgment on a case-by-case basis. The second observation, however, is that withdrawing such a decision from the hands of an impartial board and placing it squarely in the hands of Cabinet would have the effect of politicizing all future decisions on energy infrastructure. Cabinet is not required (and indeed is often most reluctant) to explain to the Canadian public the reasons for its decisions, which may be entirely partisan and driven by what will best serve the interests of the political party currently in power, not by broader concerns about the interests of the Canadian public. Moving decisions to the political level first, and having the Cabinet’s “strategic” judgment rest primarily on whether Canada might increase its greenhouse gas emissions would move concerns about Canadians’ contribution to (alleged) global warming to the top of the national interest list. This would sharply impair the quality of Canadian governance of the energy industry. Among other things, if a new “strategic energy policy” filter is to precede regulatory judgments about a project’s other merits so as to discourage the movement of fossil fuels to markets, this would surely undercut producers’ market access and consumers’ security of supply. Would this not represent an unprecedented intrusion into the policy areas of prime interests to the provinces? If the federal government will veto new pipelines transporting energy from the main fossil fuel producing regions in western Canada, why would it allow increased energy transportation from Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia or the northern territories? To extend the logic beyond the realm of energy production and transmission, why would similarly restrictive “strategic” restrictions and policy judgments not apply to the permitting of major GHG emissions-intensive plants such as those in the mining, petrochemicals, automobile and parts manufacturing, steel, iron, and cement industries? It is of interest in this context that, according to all of the most respected authorities on future energy supply, demand and emissions (including for example, the International Energy Agency, the United States Energy Information Administration, EXXON/Mobil and British Petroleum) (2), global greenhouse gas emissions will continue to grow significantly for the foreseeable future and that over ninety per cent of this emissions growth will occur in the non-OECD countries. In other words, what Canada does or does not emit will have absolutely no impact on the path of growing greenhouse gas emissions or on global temperatures. This reality stands starkly at odds with whatever justification might exist for the Expert Panel’s recommendation. The central flaw of the Expert Panel’s proposed redesign of Canada’s energy regulatory system is thus that it is a thinly disguised attempt to prejudge the merits of energy infrastructure projects based primarily on climate change objectives, when the measures proposed would have no impact whatsoever in furthering those objectives. The National Energy Board has the powers of a court of record and its processes and decisions are subject to appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal and, ultimately of course, to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Board has an excellent record before the courts on matters of law, such as fairness of process and jurisdiction over interprovincial and international works and undertakings. In practice, the Board is supervised by the courts, and the groups affected by the Board’s decisions make frequent appeal to the court system.See, for example, the Energy Information Administration’s June 2016 International Energy Outlook here: https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/0484(2016).pdf THE REPORT OF THE EXPERT PANEL ON MODERNIZING THE NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD – IMPACT ON EFFICIENCY – Part ThreeOn May 15 2017, a panel appointed by the Canadian federal government published its report on how to “modernize” the National Energy Board. This is the third in a series of commentaries that will examine the panel’s presumptions and recommendations. In this paper, I will comment on the panel’s recommendations to lengthen the process of review of proposed international and inter-provincial pipelines and electricity transmission systems from the fifteen-month goal that now nominally guides the National Energy Board, to that which would be required under the panel’s proposed two-phase system. Under the two-phase system, the federal Government should first conduct a “policy” review, and then a joint panel consisting of representatives of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and a new Canadian Energy Transmission Commission would conduct a review based on its assessment of “technical considerations and risk mitigation”. The duration of regulatory review of energy infrastructure applications has become a subject of increasing controversy. The regulated industry seeks to have a predictable process that is completed in reasonable time without undue delays. However, the increasing interest on the part of a wide range of stakeholders over the past decade has led the NEB (and other regulators) to open proceedings to many participants. In several cases, the participants do not offer any analysis or expert advice on the matters that are subject to NEB review; rather, they treat the NEB process as a generalized public hearing at which they may express their views (especially opposition) on a wide range of issues. There is no question that certain environmental organizations that oppose the construction of energy pipelines (and all other fossil fuel development) have chosen to use multiple interventions and procedural tactics to delay the completion of reviews. Discussion concerning the duration of reviews has thus become, to some extent, a battleground between those who seek efficiency of decision-making and those who oppose pipeline projects on principle. The Current SystemOn July 6, 2012, the federal government amended the National Energy Board Act to include time limits for the processing of applications made under certain sections of the Act. Notably, the legislation imposed beginning-to-end time limits of 18 months for major NEB applications requiring a certificate. This is broken down into 15 months from the date the Board determines an application is complete until the NEB completes its assessment with the issuance of a recommendation to the Governor-in-Council (i.e. the federal Cabinet). From that point, the Cabinet would have three months to make a decision. The legislation also provides for mechanisms to exclude from the time limit the periods that the Board considers are required to obtain additional information or studies from the applicant. This “loophole” has resulted in much longer periods of review. Thus, as noted in a previous commentary, the NEB review of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project took two and a half years to complete. The Proposed SystemThe Expert Panel proposes to replace the current National Energy Board review by a two-phase process, including a “Strategic Review” followed by a technical assessment and licensing phase. The Strategic Review phase, in turn, would be divided into three parts: review by federal government departments (led by a new Major Projects Office in Natural Resources Canada) of the consistency of the proposed project with Canada’s national interests, a broad-ranging consultation with indigenous peoples (led by another Indigenous Major Projects Office), and review by the federal Cabinet, based on advice provided in a memorandum to Cabinet. In its report, the Expert Panel sets out a quite ambitious list of topics that the Strategic Review would cover – consultation and accommodation of indigenous peoples; alignment with national economic, energy and environmental policy; consistency with relevant provincial emissions limitation strategies; a climate test for upstream and downstream emissions; Strategic Impact Assessments, including available regional and land use planning impact assessments; acceptability of the proposed route; and a catchall “any other showstoppers”. The licensing phase “would seek to ensure that the detailed project plan adequately minimizes risks to the environment and public health and safety and respects Indigenous rights, aboriginal and treaty rights, and title.” The report also notes that the licensing phase would include project-level environmental assessment. CommentaryThe Expert Panel acknowledges that the new process would take longer to complete. “Overall, timing for a major project review in our model is expanded from the current 15 months to three years (one for national interest determination plus Governor-in-Council decision-making, and two years for detailed joint panel hearings).” Many of the recommendations appear to be based on naiveté or ignorance. One of the best illustrations of this is the Panel’s suggestion that a “Strategic Review” of the most important policy implication of a project could take place before the finalization of a detailed project proposal, including a review of the adequacy of the project application (as is now done by the NEB staff). Without the details of the project, how exactly would departments, or the Cabinet, come to an informed judgment about such issues as the economic, environmental and social impacts? How would they determine the acceptability of the proposed route? On what, exactly, would one conduct expansive consultations with indigenous groups? How would one distinguish between poorly generalized attacks on the project concept and genuine concerns based the actual infrastructure in question? The answer, of course, is that the National Interest determination under the new system would be based not upon the specific merits of the project in question but upon two central questions that the Expert Panel places at the heart of its report. Those questions are whether the proposed project would, directly or indirectly, result in increased greenhouse gas emissions and whether indigenous groups oppose the project and therefore need to be “accommodated” in some way. Taken together, the answers to these two questions would almost certainly lead to the rejection of any and all pipeline applications. How long would such a Strategic Review” take? The formulation of new teams within a new Major Projects Office and its Indigenous Major Project Office counterpart would take a few months. Gathering of information, preparation, planning and conduct of consultations with Indigenous (and probably other) groups would take several months. There would follow a period of interdepartmental consultation and the drafting and scheduling of a submission to Cabinet. The federal Cabinet has a busy schedule and is unlikely to be rushed. Accomplishing all this in a single year would be “heroic” to say the least. It would probably take at least 18 months. If the result were the decisive rejection of the project, environmental and Indigenous groups could properly claim that the process was very efficient in terms of getting a prompt decision. In the rare circumstances in which a proposed project survived the Strategic Review phase, the technical review would present additional challenges. It is notable that the list of subjects the Expert Panel suggests be reviewed is all cast in terms of the concerns frequently raised by environmental and aboriginal groups. The Expert Panel seems to have neglected to list such topics as engineering, financing, toll design, and economic benefits, among others, that might be of interest to labour, consumers and those who would be served by the pipeline. If the technical review were expanded to include such considerations, as is now done as part of the NEB’s process, it could take far longer than the Expert Panel projects. The consequence is that a project that somehow survived the two phases of review would spend at least three and a half years, and probably longer, under policy and regulatory study. This would significantly discourage investors, especially if, as seems likely, the new United States Administration streamlines the regulatory review process that will apply to competing investments in the United States. ConclusionIf the government’s objective is to place reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accommodating indigenous peoples’ concerns ahead of all other public interest objectives, it can accomplish this more directly by changing the National Energy Board Act to alter the definition of the public interest. It similarly could eliminate any restriction on the duration of NEB reviews. It does not have to adopt the elaborate and ill-conceived proposals of the Expert Panel. THE REPORT OF THE EXPERT PANEL ON MODERNIZING THE NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD – INDIGENOUS PEOPLES – Part Four On May 15 2017, a panel appointed by the Canadian federal government published its report on how to “modernize” the National Energy Board. This is the fourth in a series of commentaries that will examine the panel’s presumptions and recommendations. In this paper, I will comment on the panel’s recommendations to increase the substantive participation of indigenous peoples in public decision-making and regulation of energy infrastructure, with the objective of having Canada “fully realize nation-to-nation relationships with Indigenous peoples”. In reporting on its public meetings with various groups, the Expert Panel stated that it heard that: “Indigenous peoples in all regions of Canada are ready to play a leadership role in resolving some of the most pressing issues of the day. We learned about a unique and invaluable Indigenous world view that sees humanity as one part of a larger network of all life and all creation, where our fundamental obligation is not to exploit the world, but to care for it and ensure that the incredible natural bounty that all Canadians enjoy is there for the next generation, and the generations that will follow…In our discussions with Canadians, we observed a broad-based expectation that Canada will make good on its promise to reconcile and bring real nation-to-nation relationships to life with Indigenous peoples, involving real change to how decisions are made.” The report strongly endorses these views and calls for a major transformation. “Building on the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the Prime Minister’s unreserved endorsement of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we see ourselves situated at the beginning of a new era in the history and evolution of Canada, an era where Indigenous peoples will, at long last, assume their rightful place at the table of Confederation as leaders, knowledge keepers, and most importantly as equals, bringing to bear distinct and valuable experiences and wisdom.” The Expert Panel recommends that: Every aspect, and every stage, of energy regulation would be modified to “increase the real and substantive participation of Indigenous peoples, on their own terms and in full accord with Indigenous rights, aboriginal and treaty rights and title.”The National Energy Strategy phase of review would take at least a year to complete, and would require extensive consultations with indigenous people.A new Indigenous Major Projects Office would be created in the federal government “to support true consultation and accommodation, and several other measures to ensure that Indigenous rights, aboriginal and treaty rights, and title are fully taken into account by the regulator”;The second phase “technical review” panel would have to include an Indigenous person on it;“In accordance with the results of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the Prime Minister’s unreserved endorsement of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, modernization of the NEB will be the first major step in assuring that at long last, indigenous peoples will assume their rightful place at the table of Confederation as leaders, knowledge keepers, and most importantly as equals, bringing to bear distinct and valuable experiences and wisdom.” Canada will “meet Indigenous peoples on their own terms”.The new Canadian Energy Transmission Commission would establish “formal programs to enable and increase the involvement of Indigenous communities in monitoring activities” related to pipelines’ safety, environmental protection and emergency preparedness. The Current Situation The National Energy Board has for many years expanded the opportunities for all members of the Canadian public to participate in its hearings and other processes when it is considering a project. The NEB’s process is an open and transparent forum designed to obtain as much relevant evidence as possible. This does not accord any special or pre-eminent status to any group, including indigenous people. However, following a series of Supreme Court Decisions, the federal government has developed elaborate and detailed guidelines with respect to indigenous consultation and accommodation that must be followed by all federal departments and agencies, including the National Energy Board. The guidelines can be read here: https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014664/1100100014675 Beyond meeting the requirements for consultation and accommodation, the NEB encourages potentially affected indigenous groups to participate in the review process for any project. It requires companies to consult with potentially affected indigenous groups early in the project planning and decision phases to discuss the project, identify concerns and potential impacts and mitigation measures. It also encourages indigenous people or groups with concerns about proposed projects to contact companies and ask company representatives to come and talk to the community about the project.The NEB has recognized the importance of strengthening relationships with indigenous peoples. At the initiative of the current Chair, it is implementing a multi-faceted Indigenous Engagement Strategy, as part of which the NEB offers to meet with indigenous groups to explain its regulatory process and how to participate in the process. This includes providing information about the NEB’s Participant Funding Program. There are also Process Advisors who, as part of their role support aboriginal groups who are participating in the public hearings. It is important to understand the nature of the NEB hearing process. As it is a quasi-judicial tribunal and works much like a court, when making a decision the NEB can only consider information that has been placed on its public record. This makes indigenous participation in NEB hearings especially important because, beyond the hearing process, the NEB cannot take part in one-on-one discussions with anyone about a project application that is being considered by the Board. One permanent member of the NEB, Dr. Keith Chaulk, and one temporary Board member, Wilma Jacknife, are indigenous persons. Finally, it is already the case that the National Energy Board and the Government of Canada in general are legally (indeed, constitutionally) bound to honour indigenous treaty rights and title. No change in current regulatory structures is needed to assure this. Commentary Indigenous people already enjoy the same opportunities to participate in and influence NEB decisions on proposed energy infrastructure as do all other Canadians, and indeed also enjoy special privileges with respect to consultation, accommodation and programs to support their involvement in the decision process. Despite this, several indigenous representatives appealed to the Expert Panel for more power and influence over the decisions affecting energy infrastructure. In effect, the groups that spoke to the Panel demanded special powers and privileges that will not be accorded to other Canadians, and (for the time being, at least) they want these powers and privileges to apply to one specific sub-sector of the Canadian economy, energy transmission. This raises several fundamental questions, of which these are a few: Would the goal of “reconciliation” justify according such powers to indigenous representatives? Would the concept of “nation-to-nation” relationships as articulated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People justify according such powers to indigenous representatives? Are there other paths by which indigenous people might attain the benefits that they seek from energy infrastructure (and from energy development generally) that do not require fundamental changes in the current Canadian system for regulating energy infrastructure? In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued a report based on its study of the experience of indigenous students who attended government-funded residential schools during the period from around 1900 to the late 1970’s. Unlike the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, the Canadian Commission heard mostly from victims. The Commission’s report included a long list of “Calls to Action”, with 94 main recommendations and many more sub-recommendations as to what the Canadian government and all sectors of Canadian society should do “reconcile” with indigenous people. It is difficult to find in the Commission’s report a succinct definition of what is entailed in reconciliation or what the limits of reconciliation might be. The calls to action are often extremely vague. Others, however, have strived to bring some clarity to the concept. In a paper entitled Reconciliation in Canadian Law: The Three Faces of Reconciliation, Tony Knox of McCarthy Tetrault LLP provided a useful analysis that might help to clarify matters. Knox describes how the Supreme Court of Canada has elaborated on the theme of reconciliation in four key decisions. Knox’s paper cab read here: http://www.mccarthy.ca/pubs/Reconciliation_Paper_July2009.pdf A follow-up paper, entitled A Closer Look at Legal Reconciliation, may be read here: http://knoxlex.com/knox_insight-conf-2011_Closer-Look-at-Legal-Reconciliation.pdf In the Sparrow decision in 1990, the Court found that “federal power must be reconciled with federal duty and the best way to achieve that reconciliation is to demand the justification of any government regulation that infringes upon or diminishes Aboriginal rights.” In the Van der Peet decision in 1993, the Court concluded that Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act mandated reconciliation of Aboriginal claims to land based on Aboriginal occupation in Canada, which predated Crown sovereignty over the Canadian landmass. In effect, Section 35(1) mandated integrating concepts of pre-existing Aboriginal law, where it applied, with the formal laws of Canada. In the Gladstone decision in 1996, the Court concluded that Aboriginal Canadians do form part of the larger Canadian population and that some objectives of government, such as conservation, are important enough to limit Aboriginal rights within the necessary rights of the broader Canadian society. Finally, in the Haida decision in 2004, the Court discussed the processes whereby reconciliation of laws might occur, including negotiation of treaties, consultation and accommodation, establishment of regulatory schemes for determining the adequacy of consultation, government guidelines for dealing with special cases, and ultimately reference to the Constitution. The central objective of reconciliation, as the courts have defined it, thus has been on reconciling different systems of law. This seems (to the layperson at least) to resemble the questions that might arise from efforts to achieve nation-to-nation agreements and accommodation rather than social or political reconciliation. It leaves unclear where one might look to find an authoritative statement of the principles that might guide “reconciliation” with respect to matters such as regulation of energy infrastructure. Turning to the implications of the U.N. Declaration, the fundamental question is whether, given our constitutional, legislative and treaty history, it can be applied here. The Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould, current Minister of Justice of Canada, addressed this question in her speech to the Assembly of First Nations on July 12, 2016. Among other things, she noted that Article 5 of the U.N. Declaration says indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions, while retaining their right to participate fully, if they so choose, in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the state. She then asked what are the political, economic and social structures the Canadian government should recognize? There are, after all, 614 different aboriginal groups (First Nations?) in Canada. She observed: “So as much as I would tomorrow like to cast into the fire of history the Indian Act so that the Nations can be reborn in its ashes – this is not a practical option – which is why simplistic approaches, such as adopting the UNDRIP as being Canadian law are unworkable and, respectfully, a political distraction to undertaking the hard work required to actually implement it.” She advocated “an efficient process of transition” that basically would require each First Nation to develop its own political institutions of government and then to have them recognized by the Canadian state, through the negotiation of a whole new set of treaties to replace the historical ones. She did not estimate how long all that would take. (One wonders whether the majority of Canadians would welcome the accordance of European-style nation-state recognition to hundreds of new native bands within our midst.) The full text of Minister Wilson-Raybould’s speech may be read here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_bPXJbq-wgWenpoa2NIRmgwT2NlWkx3enNSWXJELTFSSzc4/view Are we left with any clear connection in logic or public interest between the concepts of reconciliation and nation-to-nation relationships on the one hand and improving the regulation of Canadian energy infrastructure on the other? From here, it is difficult to see one. This leaves the final question of whether it would be possible to attain the benefits Indigenous people seek from energy infrastructure without major changes to our current energy institutions. In June 2016, Dr. Ken Coates of the University of Saskatchewan published a report for the Indian Resource Council entitled First Nations Engagement in the Energy Sector in Western Canada in which he documented the range of interactions and the impact of recent legal changes. After noting the divergence of views among indigenous groups, he describes the complexity of the current relationship to pipelines and resource development generally. “First Nations people …are rightly concerned about the environmental, social and economic benefits of major projects. But when they are drawn into the sector as real partners, both in terms of appropriate consultation and active participation, First Nations have been able to strike a balance between protecting local eco-systems, ensuring responsible development on their territories, and creating economic space for their communities in a sector that, until recently, left them on the outside looking in. Even as local and regional debates over natural resource development seemingly put First Nations at odds with government, industry and the public at large and heading for further conflict, First Nations engagement in the industry has created models of collaboration, trust and partnership that hold nation-changing promise for Indigenous people and the country at large.” Dr. Coates outlines two starkly different scenarios, one in which some or most indigenous groups continue to oppose every major energy resource and transportation project, especially in western Canada, and one in which there are thousands of indigenous people working in the energy industry, they have equity investments in energy projects, there are hundreds of indigenous-owned service and supply companies, and there are toughly-negotiated but successful impact and benefits agreements. Both scenarios are possible. Dr. Coates’s report may be read here: http://www.irccanada.ca/sites/default/files/First%20Nations%20Engagement%20in%20the%20Energy%20Sector%20in%20Western%20Canada.pdf In considering the report of the Expert Panel the federal government must decide whether the Canadian public interest would be served by changing the current regulatory system from one in which indigenous people are heavily engaged and consulted and in which they have influence as large as, or slightly larger than, any other group of citizens, to one in which indigenous people have the power effectively to veto all new energy infrastructure development.  The choice seems clear.Summary and RecommendationsThe preceding commentaries have addressed the central elements of the report of the Expert Panel on Modernization of the National Energy Board. We have addressed the main premises of the panel relating to whether the National Energy Board, as it now operates, limits public engagement, accounts for its decisions, operates in way that seems opaque, and explains the rationale for its decisions. As amply demonstrated by the Board’s conduct during its review of the Northern Gateway Project and the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, the NEB has gone to extraordinary lengths to hear every view and every person who might conceivably be affected by the projects. It has used its influence and regulatory powers to increase the proponents’ already extensive engagement with stakeholders. It has given stakeholders multiple opportunities to be heard and to influence the decision process. Finally, it has explained, repeatedly and at length, the reasons for its decisions. It has met an extremely high standard of openness and transparency. Recommendation: The findings of the Expert Panel should be rejected as not based upon the evidence. We have examined the panel’s contention that the National Energy Board does not perform an authoritative, independent and expert review of the public interest considerations that apply to energy transmission systems. The public interest considerations that the Board must address are set out in Subsection 52 (2) of the National Energy Board Act. The Board operates in a manner consistent with the judgment of Canadian governments since 1959 that decisions on whether to approve major energy transmission systems should be made, in the first instance, by a non-partisan tribunal, and that political judgments should follow. Moving decisions to the political level first, and having Cabinet’s “strategic” judgment rest primarily on whether Canada might increase greenhouse gas emissions would move concerns about Canadians’ contribution to global warming to the top of the public interest list. This is inappropriate and would sharply impair the governance of the energy industry. Recommendation: The recommendation of the panel to eliminate the National Energy Board and implement a first-step strategic review based primarily on climate policy considerations should be rejected. If Cabinet indeed wishes global warming considerations to be specifically and factually addressed in the review of energy transmission projects, the Government should seek Parliament’s approval of appropriate amendments to Subsection 52(2) of the National Energy Board Act. We have examined the panel’s contention that the Government’s objectives with respect to reconciliation with indigenous peoples and implementation in Canada of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires the elimination of the National Energy Board and the granting to representatives of indigenous peoples of much increased roles and authorities in relation to energy transmission systems, powers not enjoyed by other Canadians. We found no clear link between the generalized concept of “reconciliation” as set out in the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the requirements of responsible energy regulation. We note that the Minister of Justice has already acknowledged publicly that adopting the U.N. Declaration as Canadian law is unworkable under Canada’s current constitutional, legislative and treaty circumstances. We have further pointed out the extraordinary lengths to which the National Energy Board has already gone to strengthen relationships with indigenous peoples and to increase their participation in the regulatory process. Recommendation: The recommendations of the panel to grant indigenous peoples’ representatives special enhanced status, roles and decision-making power above those of other Canadians in the regulation of energy transmission systems should be rejected. The past efforts of the NEB to engage indigenous people should be recognized and applauded. We have reviewed the likely effects of the panel’s recommendations to create a two-part public review process to govern energy transmission systems. We have noted the panel’s acknowledgement that this would, at minimum, double the length of project reviews from 18 to 36 months. We have explained why the proposed system would make it extremely unlikely that any new transmission system transporting fossil fuels would ever be approved. Even if this possibility remained open, the complexity and length of the review would present a bureaucratic nightmare for any company that sought approval for a new hydrocarbon transmission system. This, in turn, would impair market access for Canadian energy producers, especially in western Canada, and impinge on provincial jurisdiction over resource development. Recommendation: The recommendations of the panel with respect to the establishment of a two-phase regulatory system should be rejected. ~~~~This concludes the new postings on this topic. Additional reading:Moving Oil by Pipeline: Examining The Factshttps://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/moving-oil-by-pipeline-examining-the-facts/Moving Oil by Tanker in Canada: The Factshttps://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/moving-oil-by-tanker-in-canada-the-facts/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'climate change', 'Energy East', 'Leap Manifesto', 'oil sands', 'Uncategorized']",2017/05/17
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/05/10/can-canada-survive-climate-change-policy/,dryscottdale ,Can Canada Survive Climate Change Policy?," Contributed by Robert Lyman © May 9, 2017This is the prepared text of a presentation made at the Friends of Science Society’s 14th Annual CLIMATE DOGMA EXPOSED event in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, on May 9th, 2017. Robert Lyman is a Principal at the Ottawa-based ENTRANS Policy Research Group, Inc., a former public servant of 27  years, working in senior policy roles, and prior to that, a diplomat for 10 years.  Following this presentation, Steve Goreham spoke on “Climate Science and the Myths of Renewable Energy,” much of which is covered in his latest book “Outside the Green Box: Rethinking Sustainable Development.”A full house at the Red and White Club, McMahon Stadium. Ladies and gentlemen, I truly am pleased to be in Calgary for this event and to be able to speak to you on the question of whether Canada can survive climate change policy.Hearing the question framed this way must surprise some of you. We hear so often in the media and from environmental groups that Canada and other countries may not survive what many predict to be the catastrophic effects of human-induced global warming. It must indeed seem strange that someone would wonder about the effects of the policies now proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as though the policies themselves are the threat. And yet they are. Everyone comes to this issue with a certain perspective, so I will declare mine at the outset. I am not a scientist. I am not here to address the issue of how much human-related greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere nor on the sensitivity of global temperatures and climate to the increases in those concentrations over time. There are others here far more qualified than I to discuss that. Instead, I want to discuss the policy and program measures that the people of Canada and other countries, especially in the industrialized world, are being urged to adopt and what will be the implications of those policies and programs. I believe in the importance of a sound public policy process when governments decide on issues that have important present and future consequences. My career has taught me several important lessons about what makes for good public policies. The first is that good policies need to reflect the diversity of Canada and of the public interest. As in most countries, the people here include many different groups differentiated by financial interests, economic and social status, region, viewpoint and political party. Good public policy needs to take into account how each group will be affected and seek the highest benefit for all. Similarly, Canadians expect governments to pursue many different national goals: economic development, social justice, safety and security, public health and environmental quality to name a few. Sometimes these goals are compatible and sometimes they compete with one another.  We live in a pluralist, multi-goal society. Further, good public policies in Canada must acknowledge and respect the design of our federal political structure. Policies that severely harm some provinces and regions, allegedly to benefit the whole, may indeed place the federation at risk. Every now and then, a policy issue comes along whose adherents think it is the most important one of all. Today, the theory that humans are causing cataclysmic global warming has created a claim for ascendancy over all other public policy objectives.Indeed, many environmental organizations here consider that Canada should, as a point of moral principle and to show leadership, seek to completely eliminate greenhouse gas emissions in the shortest possible timeframe. To that end, they seek the complete ending of coal use as the first step in the transformation of the electricity sector. They oppose all construction of new oil or natural gas pipeline systems. They use pressure on investors and various shaming tactics to discourage new investment in oil and gas exploration and development. They ask governments to impose absolute ceilings on the level of GHG emissions from certain energy sources as we have seen in the case of the oil sands. They advocate constantly in support of new programs, regulations and subsidies to favour renewable energy sources over traditional ones. Before discussing the challenges that these demands pose, let me review how we came to this juncture and Canada’s place in the world. In 1988, governments working together at international levels first raised concerns about the possibility that increasing human-related greenhouse gas emissions might be having an adverse impact on global temperatures. Since then, various countries have adopted targets to reduce emissions. In 1992, developed countries agreed on a voluntary target of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. They did not even come close. Having not met a relatively modest target, countries agreed upon a more stringent one. In 1997, about 150 countries committed under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions by an average of 5% below 1990 levels by the 2008 to 2012 period. They failed miserably. You might ask why, in Canada, a series of governments made political commitments to emission reduction targets that their officials candidly advised them probably could not be met. Part of it, I suspect, was simple cynicism. There was no political downside to promising to reduce emissions, only to actually doing it. Making large emissions cuts is costly and governments are usually cautious about provoking the public. So, they pretended to embrace the targets, but stopped short of the really disruptive measures.  This, however, had a disadvantage. The government’s adherence to non-attainable targets gave environmental groups a proverbial two-by-four with which they could beat federal politicians about the head and shoulders every year. And so they did. Since the 1990’s, twenty-two conferences of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change have been held in efforts to broker a deal. Recently, some countries have made political commitments to more stringent reductions. In the Copenhagen accord of December 2009, Canada and other countries committed politically to reduce GHG emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. Pursuant to international discussions preceding COP21 in December 2015, the government of Canada made a political commitment to attain a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. Outside of the COP framework, in 2008 the group of eight leaders, including Prime Minister Harper for Canada, established a long-term objective of reducing global emissions by 50% by 2050. They also announced that they supported a goal for all industrialized countries to reduce their emissions by 80 per cent or more, compared to 1990, by 2050. At the COP21 conference, the parties finally realized that agreeing on another yet-more-stringent target was not credible, so they adopted a new strategy. They agreed not to set out in the agreement explicit goals to reduce emissions. Consequently, the COP21 agreement can be presented, especially in the united states, as not a treaty. It contains very few binding legal requirements, there is no formula for determining what each country’s obligations are, and there are no legal penalties for non-compliance.  Rather, it represents a best-efforts political commitment to keep the level of global GHG emissions below that which, in theory, might produce a two degree celsius increase in average global temperatures. So no one knows for sure how much emissions would have to be reduced, and the countries did not agree on specific targets. One might fairly describe this as a failure. Significantly, though, the agreement included a political commitment to file with the U.N. Secretariat a series of five-year plans to reduce emissions. These five-year plans were to become the bases upon which stringent reductions will occur. Ladies and gentlemen, these commitments are just the beginning, the mere “foot in the door” for the more radical demands that lie ahead. We are still bound in principle to reduce Canadian GHG emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2050. The U.N still wants us to “show leadership” by reducing emissions by 80% from 2010 levels by 2050. A number of environmental groups in Canada and other countries have recently endorsed the Wind, Water and Sunlight, or WWS, vision. This vision seeks completely to eliminate the use of all fossils fuels – coal, oil, and natural gas – in the world by 2050. The New Democratic Party’s LEAP Manifesto endorses this vision, as does the Green Party and most of Canada’s influential environmental organizations. The government of Ontario also has formally committed the province to this vision. So have a number of large Canadian municipal governments. How can we even begin to understand the magnitude of the changes being proposed? One way is to look at the sources of energy consumption and related emissions today. In 2005, Canadian emissions were 738 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. In 2014, after six years of the worst recession since the Great Depression, Canadians emitted less, 722 megatonnes. Twenty-six per cent of those emissions were from oil and gas production, 23 per cent were from transportation, and roughly equal portions of around 10 per cent were from electricity generation, buildings, industry and agriculture, with waste and other sources making up a residual 7 per cent. Assuming that emissions do not grow one bit over the next 32 years as a result of increased economic activity or increased population, achieving a 50 per cent emissions reduction from 2005 levels would mean reducing emissions to 369 megatonnes CO2 equivalent. That is comparable to completely eliminating the current emissions from oil and gas production, electricity generation, and all emissions-intensive industries like mining, petrochemicals, auto and parts manufacturing, iron, steel and cement. Gone. Achieving the aspirational goal of 80 per cent reduction recommended by the IPCC would mean reducing emissions to 147 megatonnes CO2 equivalent. That would be comparable to reducing Canada’s per capita emissions and our energy economy to the current levels of Bolivia, Sudan or Iraq. I think it is fair to say that this would not be wildly popular outside of certain environmentalist and left-wing circles. The effects on regional economies would be devastating. Just eliminating all oil and gas production would deprive Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador and the northern territories of their most promising resource development and income growth opportunities. Eliminating or sharply reducing all consumption of oil would mean electrifying all railways, sharping curtailing ownership and use of personal and commercial road vehicles, and severely limiting use of aviation and marine transportation services. No sector of the economy would be spared. If indeed such measures were actually to be implemented as national policy, really and truly the Canadian federation might not survive as a political entity. You might say that any government that tried to push the climate change agenda so far would soon run into the limits of technology, economics or politics. That may be true. Unfortunately, even if radical emissions cuts prove to be impossible, governments still may be impelled by international political commitments to take measures with major economic costs. The American Enterprise Institute recently noted that, even though not legally binding, the Paris agreement provides a framework for a global, political pressure machine to exist for decades. The agreement is designed to stimulate political protest any time policy makers fail to keep commitments to de-carbonize the economy, pony up billions of dollars in climate aid for developing countries, and make increasingly ambitious emission reduction promises every five years, in perpetuity. Further, the Paris agreement tacitly affirms the preferred narrative that climate change is humanity’s greatest peril and that ‘inaction’ threatens millions of lives. Which benefits would be achieved by incurring such costs? Well, climate change is, above all, a global issue. The emissions occur all over the world and the effects are global. Despite all the rhetoric about reducing world carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion and gas flaring, according to the U.S. Carbon dioxide information analysis center, they rose steadily from 16.6 Gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent in 1973 to 34.1 Gigatonnes in 2014.   So, they more than doubled over that timeframe. Importantly, though, the origins of the emissions changed significantly. In 1973, the countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development, or OECD, accounted for two-thirds of global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion; by 2014, the OECD share had declined to just over a third. So all, or almost all, of the emissions growth occurred outside of the OECD. What does the future hold? No one has an infallible crystal ball, but the united states energy information administration, or EIA, is one of the most authoritative sources of analysis and future projections concerning energy supply, demand and emissions. In May 2016, it issued its most recent international energy outlook, with projections to 2040. Based on the most thorough analysis of the likely trends in economic and population growth and the rate at which new technologies will be applied, the outlook included some striking projections: First, worldwide energy use will grow continuously over the next three decades, led by strong increases in non-OECD areas and especially in Asia. In the EIA reference case, consumption grows 48 per cent from 2012 to 2040.Fossil fuels will still account for almost 80 per cent of energy use in 2040.Use of petroleum and other liquid fuels will grow from 90 million barrels per day in 2012 to 121 million barrels per day in 2040, while natural gas use will grow from 129 trillion cubic feet in 2012 to 203 tcf in 2040.Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will grow from 32.3 Gigatonnes in 2012 to 43.2 Gigatonnes in 2040, a 34% increase.91% of the emissions growth will take place outside the OECD. So, we have two sharply different perspectives of the future, the EIA’s projections of what probably will happen and the aspirations of the U.N. And many environmental groups as to what in their view should happen. Reducing emissions by 50% by 2050 to meet the U.N.’s vision would mean a global total of about 16 Gigatonnes, in contrast to the EIA’s projection of 43 Gigatonnes (Gt). The OECD countries – the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Japan, Australia and others – could eliminate 100% of their projected emissions of 14 Gt, and the world would still be over its target by 13 Gt. Let me repeat that in a more striking way. You have probably heard before that, as Canada represents only 1.6% of global emissions, nothing that we do in this country will make any difference to the trends in global emissions or the resulting climate effects, if any. If the current projections of the united states EIA are correct, then not only Canada but also the entire OECD region could cease to emit, and the global emissions total would still be far above the levels the IPCC claims must be achieved. With this as background, I would like to discuss three problems that now beset Canadians’ efforts to deal with climate change mitigation–the difficulty in choosing appropriate policy instruments, the excessive expectations concerning governments’ ability to deal with the climate issue, and the weakness of the federal government policy and planning process. To my knowledge, there has never been a public policy issue as complex as climate change. The calls for massive and rapid emissions reductions would be daunting if they affected only a single commodity in one sector of the economy. Instead, they concern fundamental changes to global and national energy systems and infrastructure that have developed over the past century and longer. Almost every aspect of our current industrial, transportation, settlement, and commercial capital stock and infrastructure has developed based upon the availability of relatively low cost hydrocarbons. Some advocates of rapid transformation believe that this can best be effected through the price mechanism. Unfortunately, fossil fuels stubbornly continue to be relatively plentiful and cheap. So, to retain the advantages of using market-based measures, the advocates recommend carbon taxes and cap and trade systems to reduce emissions. The federal government’s national carbon tax system imposes charges that will rise from $10 to $50 per tonne by 2022, and who knows to what levels after that. Not surprisingly, the current carbon tax regime has run into political resistance. The opposition in parliament has asked some embarrassing questions. How much revenue will the carbon taxes raise? What will be the cost of living impact on the average family? How will the competitiveness of Canadian firms be affected? The government will not say. Even tougher questions remain. How much does the government think such taxes will actually reduce Canadian emissions? What will be the effect of that reduction on global emissions and on temperatures? How high will carbon taxes and fees have to go to achieve the 2030 and 2050 goals? The former National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy projected that, to reach the 2050 goal, a carbon tax of at least $300 per tonne would be needed. That, at least, gives us some idea of where the tax level may be headed in future. Even in the absence of satisfactory answers about future tax levels, the theory that allegedly justifies both carbon taxes and cap and trade systems fails in practice. Professor Ross McKitrick of the University of Guelph has explained why. First, a carbon tax is only desirable in theory if it acts as the replacement for the long list of regulations, programs and subsidies that are now in place; the federal, provincial and municipal governments, however, have no intention of removing those measures. Second, a carbon tax, to avoid damaging the economy, has to be genuinely revenue neutral, in the sense that the funds must be channeled back into the economy by lowering the rates of other broadly-based taxes, not by being used to fund a host of new programs and subsidies that benefit the “green” lobbyists and industries; while British Columbia claims to have done this, there is zero chance any other government will. Third, the size of the carbon tax has to be set at a rate that properly reflects the alternative cost of reducing emissions and the best estimate of what damage is being avoided by reducing emissions; the current federal tax has no connection to either of these standards. Fourth, there has to be credible evidence that the economic cost incurred will be offset by incremental improvement in the world’s environmental condition; Canada is too small an emitter to matter and, as I explained, Asian countries are rapidly increasing their emissions in any case. Finally, we should not set a new carbon tax burden on Canadian companies seeking to compete in international markets; proceeding here when we know the Americans will not impose a carbon tax is simply irresponsible. Many of the same problems apply to cap and trade systems. I decided to explore further Professor McKitrick’s comment about the current list of regulations, programs and subsidies. There is not in Canada a comprehensive list of the measures that have been implemented by all orders of government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have been increasing in number, reach and cost since 1988. I counted 37 different generic types of measures now in use. Large bureaucracies exist to design, implement, and (less frequently) evaluate these measures. They stretch like the tentacles of some vast octopus across every aspect of the Canadian economy and touch everyone’s life. As no one has ever established an inventory of the measures now in place or of those under consideration, no one knows how much these measures already cost Canadians. Two things are certain – they cost billions of dollars annually, and they are not going away soon, regardless of the taxes imposed on carbon. I might add a third certainty, which is that the government will continue to develop and implement more and more programs and regulations as time goes on. Governments’ persistent reliance on what are generally called “direct action measures”, redundant if one believes in the efficacy of prices and taxes, indicates another tenet of the current climate change mitigation advocates. They strongly believe that governments have the institutional and knowledge capacity to manage the economy and to drive the pace of technological change. I referred earlier in my remarks to the wind, water and sun vision of Professors Jacobson and Delucci that has been extremely influential in supporting the 2050 targets. Jacobson and Delucci do not stop at setting out a list of promising technologies and visualizing the amount of renewable energy generation capacity needed to meet future demand. They set out detailed, quantified “roadmaps” of exactly which steps governments should take by which dates and of the resulting generation levels by 2050. The adherents to the WWS vision express extraordinary optimism, verging on blind faith, in the pace at which scientific discoveries, technology applications, commercialization of new products, and market penetration through mass production will occur. They seem to think that, if something can be done and it has alleged environmental benefits, all that stands in the way of its mass commercialization is for governments to subsidize or regulate so as to achieve their preferred outcome. In reality, of course, scientific breakthroughs do not come on a fixed schedule, and there is no direct relationship between the amount of money that society spends on research and the likelihood or timing of a discovery. If there were, cancer would have been cured long ago. Dr. Peter Grossman, one of the foremost experts in the history of U.S. Energy policy, has described how over many years U.S. Policy makers referred to the Apollo program and the Manhattan project as models for the development of alternative energy technologies. The technologies they have promoted at great costs are the same ones being advocated today in the name of addressing alleged global warming – solar energy, wind energy, cellulosic ethanol, electric vehicles, etc. The Apollo Fallacy, as Grossman calls it, conflates an engineering problem with a commercial problem, and it actually deflects efforts (and funds) away from scientific research and advance and focuses them instead on grandiose social schemes. Among other things, programs to accelerate the demonstration and use of specific technologies have amounted to picking winners over losers, and governments have proved again and again and again that they are remarkably bad at that game. There is an older term to describe what the advocates of rapid transformation want. It is called central planning. In fact, they seek the largest intrusion of state authority and central planning into the economy since the second world war. For those with some knowledge of history, there is considerable irony here. The climate change issue came to public prominence around 1990. 1990 was also the year when the political systems of the former Soviet Union and its satellite states collapsed as a result of their internal contradictions, and especially the realization that central planning was a fundamentally flawed approach. How ironic it is that, at precisely the moment in history when the failures of central planning were laid bare for all to see, environmentalists should seize upon climate change as evidence that central planning was an idea whose time had come! That confidence might be warranted if government climate change programs over the past twenty years had been wildly successful. Frankly, that has not been the Canadian experience. Instead, let me remind you of the conclusions reached by the federal government’s own monitor of program effectiveness, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development. Starting in 1998, the commissioner began to critique the government’s approach to managing emission reduction measures. In the seven reports that followed, there were five consistent themes. First, the government has not created effective governance structures for managing climate change activities. In fact, there have been weaknesses in horizontal governance across departments, accountability and coordination.Second, there has been, and remains, no overall implementation plan. The government has produced no estimate of the emission reductions expected from each sector. Without an implementation plan, industry, consumers and other levels of government lack a solid basis for knowing how to apply technology or make investment decisions.Third, as a result, Canada cannot determine whether the targets for emissions reduction already announced will be met or how much it will cost to do so.Fourth, there are few mechanisms in place to measure the performance of the emission-reduction measures that have been implemented so far.Fifth, the federal and provincial governments do poorly in coordinating their approaches to emissions reduction. In short, while there have been some exceptions, the federal government’s management of the climate change file has been a frustrating combination of good intentions, partisan politics and limited capacity to deliver. Environmentalists often claim that what we need is an honest dialogue about climate change. What they really mean is that the general public should acquiesce with the thesis that human-induced global warming threatens a catastrophe and that reducing emissions should be given priority over all other public interest objectives. I agree that we need an honest dialogue about climate change mitigation. It should start with the recognition that governments to date have publicly embraced emission reduction targets that are unachievable with present technology and at acceptable economic costs. We should acknowledge that we as a society have multiple goals of which environmental quality, however important one might think it is, represents only one. If we value our prosperity and unity as a federal, geographically diverse country, we must approach the climate change issue with a respect for all our collective goals. The Canadian federation has resolved difficult controversies in the past, including those concerning the best response to international events. Historically, we have valued moderation and accommodation. This offers hope that we can avoid irreconcilable differences in future. Much of Canada’s current political elite favours the pursuit of international goals over the steadfast promotion of the Canadian interest, whether on issues of trade, security or the environment. Never before, however, have we faced a situation in which commitment to an international objective May impose enormous and divisive costs on Canada for no discernable global environmental benefit. Climate change thus offers a clear dichotomy between the Canadian national interest and the global environmental agenda. Which should we value higher? I, for one, choose Canada. Thank you.1927 map of Canada’s wealth of natural and mineral resources.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Alberta coal phase-out', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Leap Manifesto', 'Ontario', 'Trudeau carbon tax', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2017/05/10
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/05/06/taking-the-economist-to-task-for-unfounded-climate-catastrophe-fearmongering/,franktrades ,Taking The Economist to Task for Unfounded Climate Catastrophe Fearmongering," Contributed by Dr. John D. Harper, FGSA,FGAC, PGeol., former director of the Geological Survey of Canada © May 2017I have recently been asked to comment on three articles published in The Economist. My background for such a response is as a Professor of Petroleum Geology and Sedimentology (ret.), a former Director-Energy for the Geological Survey of Canada, a former researcher in industry, and as an academic researcher on sea level changes and climate documentation through geologic time, Natural Resources of the Future and a couple of decades of studies in the Arctic.1) Skating on thin ice: The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe. Apr 27, 20172) The Arctic as it is known today is almost certainly gone. April 29, 20173) Thaw point: As the Arctic melts the world’s weather suffers. April 29, 2017Before I reply I wish to state that the calibre of the articles would not pass scrutiny at the university undergraduate level because they violate all the rules of verification of sources for the statements made and they apply fear-mongering approach to support their speculations, thereby demonstrating a lack of confidence in their own commentary. They address sea level rise with little understanding of the complex relationships involved. They address oil exploration not understanding the economic drivers and they discuss shipping without knowing the facts of current activities, nor the economic drivers there as well.That having been said let’s look at their comments and speculations. The title for “(1) Skating on thin ice” invokes the thought of catastrophe. Twenty thousand years ago much of the northern hemisphere was covered with ice. Canada as we know it today did not exist. To the humans of the day their sphere of knowledge of weather conditions was limited and local. Even at that time the ice was beginning to melt so that by 13000 years ago we saw archeological evidence of human occupation in the mainland US. By ~9000 years ago we have physical evidence of humans in North America in the form of the skeleton of a young woman who was interred in the La Brea tar pits. Did these people experience warming and climate change? Absolutely! Was such change catastrophic? On the contrary! Humans excelled, progressed, and spread around the world. They took advantage of the new opportunities provided to them and in turn began to affect the biological world around them. They continued to evolve socially until great societies were built and empires were constructed. The improvement of climate made all this possible and humans had no impact on causing those changes. They took advantage of them. The melting has not yet terminated. It continues. How completely the melting will take place we don’t know, but we cannot stop a process we do not understand and did not initiate. The comment that “perhaps …the consequences [will be] merely terrible rather than catastrophic”. So what do these fear-based terms mean? The climatic changes in the last 20000 years far exceed anything we see or speculate could occur in the next few years. What did the early humans have to fear? Absolutely nothing! The effort to promote fear is ludicrous since we cannot even define what that means.Could the ice completely disappear? Well during the Cretaceous (170-60 million years ago) the Earth had a greenhouse climate with very little evidence of glaciation. The dinosaurs loved it. The vegetation loved it. Mammals took advantage of it to expand into new environments. Was that climate a catastrophe? Far from it! Did humans influence CO2 in the atmosphere? No because they didn’t exist. Was that climatic change a catastrophe? If humans had lived at that time they would have populated every tropical area they could find. Certainly there was no catastrophe.The author(s) then address the issue of sea level rise. If one looks at the historical sea level rise curves for all areas of the Earth one sees a very rapid rise during the active meltback of the global ice cover until about 9000 years ago when the rise began to significantly decline in rate to the point that other Earth motions can now be determined to come into play. Such relative relationships between sea level rise and land motions can begin to be separated as to influence. Sea level rise is not accelerating but it will be a force to be reckoned with in coastal regions in the future. The only influence that humans have in this context is they love to live along the coast so they will have to be accommodating to nature. We certainly cannot stop it. Was the sea level fall at the beginning of the last ice age a catastrophe? Not at all!  Humans continued to “follow the sea” for its pleasures and its bounty of food. At that time, they had no idea the sea level was falling and each individual did not live long enough for a record to be established. The record from 2002 to 2016 is of little consequence in the context of the historical record over thousands of years.Attention is drawn to the fact that biologic populations are changing in the various ecologic environments and their numbers are also changing. Living creatures are opportunistic. If new environments become available to populate they will move into those environments. Remember the dinosaurs. They were followed by the mammals. Was that a catastrophe? For the dinosaurs maybe, but certainly not for the mammals. Biologic populations are never static. They change and we cannot stop them. On the other hand, many cope. Take a look at the coyote who can compete in the urban world but the wolf was almost driven to extinction by humans, as were the buffalo. Wildlife has more to fear from humans than they do from the climate.Concern has been expressed for the freshwater being introduced into the Arctic; are you aware that 49 Million years ago the Arctic was a freshwater pond? Was it a catastrophe? Far from it. As the barriers to the South opened in response to plate tectonic movements, the Arctic became a saline sea again. Was it a catastrophe? Far from it. At the moment, it does not appear that a repeat of the 49 Million year occurrence will happen because no barriers exist to permit containment of the fresh water. Fresh water influx tends to be mixed and moved by the currents almost instantly. So, the stated “cold hard facts” completely lack validity.We then are drawn to consider the end of Shell operations in the Chukchi Sea as though the decision was a consequence of Arctic events. Not really. The cost of Arctic exploration is incredibly high. With the advent of hydraulic fracturing the supply of oil has far-exceeded anything even people in the industry would have expected. It is simply a matter of economics. Why break the bank in the Arctic when you can do so much better at much lower costs in the Gulf of Mexico, or offshore West Africa and Brazil. Don’t forget that BP and ExxonMobil committed close to US$1 Billion for a five-year commitment to study leases in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. They have only pulled back because of government policies, decreased oil prices and general economic uncertainties. The decisions had nothing to do with climate.The author suggests that the Arctic shipping industry has backed off. Well once again it is a function of economics, availability of ice-class ships which meet the requirements of government legislation, and markets that justify the costs. When the mining business was fully active there were numerous ice-class ships which traversed Arctic routes. That industry has its own fair share of economic considerations which have slowed the expansion at this point. The opportunities have not vanished but rather await greater certainties as how to move ahead. Environmental issues, the Law of the Sea submissions, and hydrographic mapping of the sea floor for best routes are but a few of the issues being addressed. Arctic circumnavigation will have its day for certain. Humans jump to face opportunities.Russia is and always will be a big player in the Arctic. The discussion has been presented that Russia has half of the Arctic coastline. That is not what counts. The continental shelf on the Russian side is of a far greater area than that of Canada’s or any other country’s shelves.  The oil and gas potential on the Russian shelves may be as great as the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. Once the Russians begin their exploratory activities the North American activities will pick up. Once the industries see the opportunities happening the Arctic potential will begin to be realized. It is simply a matter of time.The potential for environmental calamity depends on what is meant by “calamity”. No one has quantified all the possible problems to be anticipated although efforts are being made to do so. An oil spill under ice at the wrong time of year would be a disaster. But the industry accepts this and has been diligently working to improve well control. Governments are becoming increasingly aware of such concerns. Those concerns must be met and I believe will be. The question is when.Finally, geoengineering is touted as being worthwhile. Humans are great at coming up with significant technical ideas but if there is a concern that the loss of ice will influence Arctic weather patterns the last thing we need to be doing is turn loose a bunch of engineers to play games with those patterns. Why not try to stop tornadoes before turning one’s hand to the Arctic? So far it cannot be done.Is it too late for the Arctic as stated in the article? Absolutely not! Incredible social, environmental, technical, and economic benefits lay before us in the Arctic. Prudent stewardship which includes the indigenous populations, which accepts that we must accommodate the changes taking place, and accepts that we cannot be so arrogant as to think we can stop those changes, is warranted.Lastly the “Thaw point article” and the ‘End of the Arctic as we know it” are based on speculation and are readily addressed by the issues discussed earlier. I am sure Sir John Franklin, if he were still here, would be quick to say the Arctic today is nothing like what he had to face. The authors state some important truths. “… the state of the Arctic shows that humans cannot simply undo climate change. They will have to adapt to it.”(April 29, 2017; Arctic thaw)  “… the gap between theory and practice is enormous and ethically fraught.”April 29, 2017; Arctic gone) It is time to get off the climate change bandwagon and put our efforts towards the understanding of how to accommodate what is happening.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['arctic', 'climate change', 'sea level rise', 'Uncategorized']",2017/05/06

Tried and true natural resources are required to produce all clean tech products and innovations. This document – “Grounded in Reality” – examines some of the key success factors of nations like Finland, Israel, Denmark and Sweden which feature ‘cluster’ qualities touted by Harvard economist and author Michael Porter as competitive factors for economic success. This report reviews these markets and looks at some comparative factors regarding Canada’s competitiveness among nations.LINK to report:GROUNDED IN REALITY May 03 2017 FINALProsperity Institute issued a policy brief in April 2017 entitled “Accelerating Clean Innovation in Canada.”  This document responds to that brief, rebutting and deconstructing much of the ‘cleantech’ hype with a more grounded approach.In “Accelerating Clean Innovation in Canada”  the premise appears to be that if government would just underwrite ‘clean’ industries with subsidies, set clean energy standards (such as no emissions or low-carbon standards), put a price on carbon, engage in proactive procurement of goods to give clean industries a financial lift and market profile (i.e. buying Tesla cars for government fleets, installing fast charging stations), and establish clean tech/hi-tech ‘clusters,’ then it will follow that there will be success. Smart Prosperity claim that then Canada will “tap into a fast-growing global market expected to be worth as much as C$2.5 trillion by 2020.”Likewise, reference is made to countries like Finland, Israel, Denmark and Sweden (FIDS) which have become world leaders in cleantech.  Friends of Science Society offers a general overview of some of the demographic, historic, cultural and contextual factors that appear to be the key drivers of the FIDS success, as a platform for discussion about the challenges Canada faces in a globally competitive environment.Friends of Science Society argues that Smart Prosperity presents selective information without context, thus misleading the public on the actual costs and probabilities in developing a competitive clean tech cluster.One thing is clear; no product in the world can be made without mined resources, reliable power and fossil fuels.  Fossil fuel by-products create a cascade of products and services that all people rely on everyday.  Canada has an existing Supercluster of oil/gas/oil sands/coal.  Hi-tech leaders like Samsung operate from South Korea, a country with no fossil fuels.  We buy their ‘clean-tech.’  They buy our coal. It is unlikely we can compete with them on clean-tech, though we may find and develop niche markets.One of our findings is that all successful cleantech countries also feature busy ports with global transportation networks.  The smooth flow of goods and services is key to a country’s success. Canada’s vast distances and challenging geography and weather make this harder for all industries to succeed.  On top of that, Canadian ports and export markets for oil and gas are subject to blockades and regulatory challenges by Canadian anti-oil/LNG/tanker activists.Contrary to Smart Prosperity’s position, replicating clean-tech success is not a matter of more government subsidizes, more regulation, more onerous standards, and more (carbon) taxes. It’s a matter of having a unified national vision and purpose, cadres of highly qualified scientists and technicians, championing entrepreneurs, and most importantly, moving goods to market. We examine some of these relevant factors in this report.Smart Prosperity Institute issued a policy brief in April 2017 entitled “Accelerating Clean Innovation in Canada.”  This document responds to that brief, rebutting and deconstructing much of the ‘cleantech’ hype with a more grounded approach.In “Accelerating Clean Innovation in Canada”  the premise appears to be that if government would just underwrite ‘clean’ industries with subsidies, set clean energy standards (such as no emissions or low-carbon standards), put a price on carbon, engage in proactive procurement of goods to give clean industries a financial lift and market profile (i.e. buying Tesla cars for government fleets, installing fast charging stations), and establish clean tech/hi-tech ‘clusters,’ then it will follow that there will be success.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/04/10/electric-cars-are-no-threat-to-oil/,renewableguy ,ELECTRIC CARS ARE NO THREAT TO OIL," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2017Robert Lyman will be one of our special guest speakers at the May 9th, 2017 “Climate Dogma Exposed” event at the Red and White Club, McMahon Stadium, Calgary.  Information and Tickets at www.friendsofscience.org or EventBrite.At a recent conference in Calgary, Steve Kronin, a former under secretary in the U.S. Department of Energy and a New York University professor, predicted that electric vehicles will make up 50 percent of the vehicles on the road by 2050 and that this will pose a threat to the oil industry because of its dampening effect on fuel demand. Kronin’s remarks echo those of many advocates for electric vehicles who enjoy speculating about the future. Their objective, perhaps, is to reinforce the thesis that there will be an easy and inevitable transition to a “decarbonized” world economy. Let us, instead, examine the facts and draw our conclusions from them. There is no question that there has been a relatively rapid growth in the sales of electric vehicles (EV), including both electric hybrids (PHEVs) and all-electric cars (BEVs), since 2010. Annual global sales of plug-in models rose from 134,000 in 2012 to 774,000 in 2016. By the end of 2016, cumulative global sales of plug-in passenger cars and light utility vehicles passed the two million mark. These sales were stimulated in large part by continuing large government subsidies in North America, Europe and China.  The geographic distribution of sales offers some insight into why sales have increased so fast. China, which has poured billions of dollars into consumer subsidies, had 645,000 cumulative sales of plug-ins by the end of 2016. In the United States, where federal subsidies of up to $7,500 per vehicle are available in addition to various state-level subsidies, the cumulative sales total was 570,000 vehicles. Japan accounted for 147,500 and Europe 637,000. Norway alone has the highest plug-in electric car segment. There, extremely rich subsidies have driven plug-ins to 29% of new car sales. That, for EVs, is the good news. However, a little perspective is in order. For all the growth from small beginnings, plug-in electric vehicles still represent less than 0.15 percent of the global light duty vehicle stock. In the United States alone, annual EV sales are far less than 1% of the total. Last year, there were 17 million new cars sold in the United States that run on oil fuels. There were 157,000 EV sales. It is far from clear that governments will continue indefinitely the large subsidies that have underpinned EV sales. In the United States, it has always been a feature of the existing program that the subsidies to an EV producer would end when its sales reached the 200,000 vehicle level. The Trump Administration is now in the process of eliminating or reducing many of the subsidy and regulatory programs implemented by the former Obama Administration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; one wonders how long the U.S. subsidy program can last. China has announced that it will eliminate EV subsidies by 2020. European taxpayers have begun to tire of endless subsidies to various “green” causes; even there, governments are starting to take a closer look at whether such subsidies are justified when most of them go to consumers who could afford to buy the vehicles without subsidies. Nonetheless, many countries remain committed publicly to a vision of rapidly growing EV sales. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has developed a policy and planning process called Energy Technology Perspectives that seeks to chart technology paths towards the reduction of global GHG emissions from 33 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2013 to about 15 Gt in 2050. The IEA vision for transportation sees EVs constituting 150 million (10%) of the total light duty vehicle stock by 2030 and nearly 1 billion (40%) of the total light duty vehicle stock by 2050. The 2015 Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change, announced at the time of the COP21 conference, set more modest targets of 400 million electric two-wheelers and 100 million EVs by 2030. With these targets in mind, on which growth path are EVs? Continuation of the relatively fast rate of growth in sales plus some acceleration could yield a vehicle stock of 7.4 to 13 million EVs by 2020. In contrast, an annual growth in sales by 230,000 units per year, as has happened over the last three years, would produce a stock of less than 3 million units by 2020 and less than 7 million units by 2030. Either outcome would be still be tiny in comparison to a global vehicle population of 1.3 billion. Further, the most optimistic projections of EV sales have very limited implications for global oil demand growth. Over the period since 2008, in spite of the most serious recession since the Great Depression, world oil demand has increased from 86 million barrels per day to 97 million barrels per day, or around 1 million barrels per day per year. If that trend continues, then even the most optimistic scenarios for growth in EV sales would only make a slight dent in oil demand growth. Oil would continue, as it is now, the most important energy source on the planet.– 30 –Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'decarbonization', 'Uncategorized']",2017/04/10

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/04/01/responding-to-a-tweet-about-a-graph/,Dan Pangburn ,Responding to a Tweet about a Graph," On March 31, 2017 on our twitter feed we received this comment and marked up graph from peaceful data boy @jamjoumie  I wish you were applied the same skepticism of methodology to the appallingly misleading visualisations you citeSince twitter is an unlikely forum for full explanations, we offer this blog post written up by our resident climate model and graph expert, Ken Gregory, B. AppSc.  Ken has assessed models for the past decade and provides these insights on the Canadian Climate Model.Response to Tweeted Graph with CommentsContributed by Ken Gregory © 2017Source of the graph is: “JH Christy”, John H. Christy from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. About the notes on the graph below; 1) [Data improperly aligned to visually exaggerate the difference.] The box at the bottom left shows that the linear trend of all times series intersect at zero at 1979, which is the first year of the satellite data. This is the best and fairest way to present the model and data comparisons. The data sets all aligned together at the start, or left side, so you can see how separated they are at the end, or right side. This is like most races, where the athletes start at the same point and you see how separated they are at the finish line. 2) [No uncertainty ranges shown.] It is impossible to estimate uncertainty ranges for a model run, or an average of many model runs. Uncertainty can be calculated when it is due to random events. Climate model trends are dependent on the choices made by climate modelers, like assuming upper atmosphere relative humidity stays constant with warming, or more water vapour and warming causes less clouds, or that urban warming has zero effect of weather stations, all of which are contradicted by data. The choices are greatly influenced by the desire to meet the IPCC and government funding agency expectations, the need to show a catastrophic projection to ensure continued funding, modeler biases, peer pressure, etc.   Uncertainty can be assigned to data measurement, but only to the random error component. Data is also subject to systemic errors, unknown errors, and biases of those interpreting and correcting the raw data. These errors are impossible to quantify. The range of all the model trends is not a measure of uncertainty. The average of the models is the consensus of the AGW theory which is used for climate policy. 3) [Averages together datasets, hiding that they aren’t in close agreement.]  The UAH and RSS satellite datasets trends are both much less than the multi-model average trend, which is about 0.24 C/decade. HERE is a graph of the UAH and RSS mid-troposphere datasets. The trends of UAH and RSS are 0.085 and 0.140 C/decade, respectively. RRS had recently increase the trend from 0.094 in version 3.3 to 0.140 C/decade in version 4. NOAA also publishes a satellite analysis. 4) [Doesn’t include other groups work estimating greater warming.]  There are only 3 groups publishing satellite temperature data.  5) [We don’t live on Mount Everest or in airplanes.]  Nobody claimed this so the comment is irrelevant. The graph is presented as a test of the AGW theory embedded in the climate models. A graph comparing surface temperature trends would not be a proper test as the climate modelers adjust various parameters, especially aerosols, to roughly match the surface temperature trend to the published surface datasets. The greenhouse effect operates primarily in the upper atmosphere, ie, a change in the amount of a greenhouse gas at 11 km altitude has 80 times as much effect as the same change near the surface, so the mid-troposphere is the proper region to test the theory.~~~~People often like to say Canadians cause global warming because of our oil and gas industries, but Ken shows in this video that Canadians only cause noticeable global warming in simulations – and then only because these rather exaggerated predictions are the ones favoured by groups in power of climate policy reports…Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'Uncategorized']",2017/04/01
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/03/26/chamber-of-horrors-minister-mckenna-comes-to-calgary/,Robert Muir ,Chamber of Horrors – Minister McKenna Comes to Calgary," Opinion – Contributed by Michelle Stirling ©2017Imagine your company faces serious, imminent, economic risks.  Imagine that last year friends and family were forced to flee wildfires in Fort McMurray and that’s part of the reason your business is on the brink.  Imagine that just 3 years before that, your business also took a hit in the Calgary floods, and maybe you were one of the unlucky people on the flood plain whose home or business was damaged or destroyed.Imagine you attend a Chamber of Commerce luncheon about economic opportunity, only to have two out-of-towners peddle their climate change carbon price wares by dancing on your distress.Yes, that was the Chamber of Horrors in Calgary March 9, 2017.Calgarians are friendly and polite, so no one said anything out loud.But most of us know that the eight worst floods in Calgary’s history were before 1933; two of those had greater flow than the 2013 flood by quite a lot. So – the Calgary flood was not about climate change. It was a weather event with unusual combination of circumstances.And Alberta has lived through wildfires every season – even Calgarians know them well, despite being high up on a near barren plain, because we get to breathe in the wildfire smoke plumes from BC, Washington, Northern Alberta, Saskatchewan and sometimes even Siberia. We know the Fort McMurray wildfires were human caused and they ripped through Fort Mac in part because the government of Alberta was asleep at the wheel and had cut wildfire budgets and contracts, despite clear recommendations post-Slave Lake, that we needed to be prepared by April 15 – crews, equipment, contracts, the works. We weren’t.http://wildfire.alberta.ca/resources/reviews/documents/FlatTopComplex-WildfireReviewCommittee-A-May18-2012.pdf That’s mismanagement, not climate change. Bill Adams, VP Western Canada for the Insurance Bureau of Canada introduced guest speaker, the Hon. Catherine McKenna, Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, with a dose of climate gloom and doom remarks. He then neatly tied the story line to his pitch by saying “Timothy Lane, Deputy governor of the Bank of Canada agrees and pointed to that fact in a recent speech where he made the economic case for carbon pricing. Lane made it clear that climate change is already having a profound impact on Canada’s economy and financial systems. And like most Canadians, we support efforts to reduce carbon emissions while protecting our economy.”He’s wrong on climate change and wildfire…and carbon pricing as any means of protection.  How did bankers and insurance brokers arrive at that conclusion? Spending too much time with anti-oil activist groups who make a living hawking climate porn? Whoa. Mr. Lane is not a climate scientist or wildfire expert. Neither such expert would make the claim that the Fort McMurray wildfire event supports carbon pricing as a means of stopping wildfires or floods. That’s just silly. One-of events are not climate change.  Climate patterns are measured in 30, 50, 100 year and millennial timescales. Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change rejects the notion that global warming would cause extreme weather events.Excerpt of Dr. Judith Curry’s 2014 testimony to US Senate And how about that smooth buy-in line “Like most Canadians…” Albertans are Canadians and most loudly reject carbon pricing. Mr. Adams introduced the Minister who immediately reminded us that ‘climate change is real.’ Honestly. Alberta, and Calgary have one of the highest per capita ratios of Professional Geoscientists and Professional Engineers, perhaps in the world but certainly in Canada. People who have studied 4 billion years of earth’s changes can tell the Minister a thing or two about how climate change is real and that it changes – a lot – without any human influence.  And the Professional Engineers can explain how a 0.02°C change (two one-hundredths) in temperature over 2015 is not a sign of anything because it falls within a 1 degree margin of error – so, could have been warmer…or cooler.  In fact, an averaged temperature from so many ‘adjusted’ sources is simply a metric – not an actual temperature measurement anymore.But I digress.The horror continued – worst of all was the Minister’s own statement that she knew nothing about the ‘climate file’ before beetling off to Paris to negotiate it.  Perhaps it was her blithe, happy-go-lucky, ‘so what’ tone that struck me as illustrating how completely oblivious she is to what her agreement will do to this country, if we try to follow through. She said: “So when I took this job I immediately went to the climate negotiations. I actually didn’t know about the climate file. I had to figure out what a COP* was. What is this COP? Many people had been to more than one COP, 13, 14 COPs.  I got there, dug in and we were able to get the very ambitious climate agreement but then the rubber had to hit the road here….”  (*COP- Conference of the Parties – int’l meeting on climate policy…going on for 22 years now.) The rubber had to hit the road here. Really? Rubber. I certainly felt a moment of OMG in that roomful of Albertans, many of whom work in the sciences, most in businesses associated with the energy industry, being told that the person who negotiated an international agreement that could turn the Canadian economy into that of Chad, knew nothing about the subject going in. She then added that she also considered herself a trade minister and that ‘she gets it’ about trade with the US. The next frightening thing was her reference to Mark Carney for advice on the climate file. Regarding Mr. Carney, “He said, first of all, we need to take climate action because it’s a huge risk for companies that don’t. So, that’s what keeps me up at night. If we don’t take action, then we’re going to go off a cliff.” Climate catastrophe bandwagonning doesn’t cut it if you are using a bank governor as your science source, relying on his much-vaunted address to Lloyds of London of Sept 29, 2015.  Especially when Steve Kopitz of Princeton Energy Advisors has found that none of Mr. Carney’s climate catastrophe claims are supported by actual climate data, freely available on US government websites.  Kopitz called Carney’s talk “a failure of analysis.” So, no cliff, Minister McKenna. Not about climate, anyway.But, the Minister did show a picture of a pipeline to impress us that two pipelines were approved.We Albertans don’t really care about that. We only care about pipelines that get built, Minister. The rest of the show and tell ventured off into much cheer-leading about how entrepreneurial we are and how there’s a $30 trillion market of clean growth ‘opportunities’ out there.  Oddly the minister seemed to be unaware that we already hold the key to any growth of any kind and any industrial development – because we have all the oil, natural gas and coal that is required to make anything. Everything. Even the Tesla and the Ballard fuel-cell buses she showed us as examples of innovation or the wind farms and solar panels. Tesla runs on coal powered electricity. Ballard buses are manufactured – built with materials extracted from or mined by the energy of oil, natural gas and coal. And to get wind you need oil. LOTS of it. So – get our product to market.To obtain in one year the amount of energy contained in one cubic mile of oil, each year for 50 years we would need to have produced the numbers of dams, nuclear power plants, coal plants, windmills, or solar panels shown here.http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/fossil-fuels/joules-btus-quads-lets-call-the-whole-thing-off We just need to get those green trade warrior ENGOs out of the way!http://internationalfunders.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IFIPConferenceReport2010.pdf About 81% of the world’s energy sources come from fossil fuels – only 1.4% come from renewables like wind and solar. Despite showing pix of wind turbines and solar panels, this ‘shift’ will take decades and LOTS of oil and gas and coal. In the meantime, there are millions of cars in the world that run on gas – showing us 10 Ballard fuel-cell buses is not impressive or representative of an economic opportunity, though interesting.Of 907 million personal vehicles on the road worldwide in 2014, 405,000 were EV’s. EVs constituted 0.04 % of the PVs on the road globally.Sales of all-electric trucks and buses are negligible.Of 88 million new vehicle sales in the world in 2014, 307,000 were EVs. That is, the EV share of new vehicle sales was 0.35%. In 2015, that probably rose to one half of one percent.To reach 60% of present PV sales by 2040, EV sales would have to increase to 120 times today’s level.The potential growth in total vehicle sales globally is immense, especially in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The likelihood that EV sales will constitute 60% of the much-increased sales of all vehicles by 2040 approaches zero.Internal combustion engines, powered by petroleum fuels, will be the dominant source of motive power for a very long time.https://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/a-tale-told-by-numbers-world-vehicle-trends/ And…if Tesla is innovation, just give us $5 billion and we’ll come up with something nice too.In the meantime, some American analysts have posted comedic commentaries on how many beer do you have to drink to believe Tesla …others see it as having similar financial patterns to Enron. A subsidized Tesla is a horrible example to show us.  Especially when the federal government has written a big fat subsidy cheque to Bombardier, which sits on a port and has global access for its products, but that same Liberal government can’t cough up any reasonable financial support for landlocked Alberta with about 200,000 people unemployed and Fort McMurray still lies, largely in ashes.  It’s a horrible example when this government plays footsie with environmentalists who are blocking pipelines, resource development and demarketing coal power, while claiming ‘victory’ over pipeline approvals. It’s a horrible example that the government has the gall to send a sunny ways senior minister to further demoralize an already hurting market, exploiting our pain to claim that carbon pricing will save the planet, stop floods and wildfires….Also, it was horrible to hear the Minister tout a carbon capture project as viable because multi-billionaire Bill Gates has thrown money at it.  Minister McKenna, Bill Gates has a net worth of $89.5 billion – billions he can afford to lose.We don’t. Besides, trying to make gas from air is…energy intensive!Comments from engineering-types:I suspect as soon as you run any kind of energy balance on this you will find it is a net sucker of energy.  There is a reason (several, actually) why we don’t use much carbon capture from combustion streams like coal flue gas – it is very diluted.  But that is nothing compared to how diluted CO2 in atmosphere is at 400 ppm.This process takes 10Gj of NG as input, so unless it produces net power output, you already have a cost of say C$30-40/tonne CO2 before considering any other costs.making O2 from an air separation unit is very power intensive and I suspect takes up most of the energy output, other than that taken up by pumps, compressors, fans, etc to run this thing.Politicians should not promote things that have not been technically or economically vetted.(PS – we are all for innovation….that makes sense!)And it is horrible to think that an Environment Minister also fancies herself as a trade minister for helping sell TEN Ballard hydrogen fuel-cell buses to China, a market of a billion people (where ‘Canada has a very good relationship with China at the highest level of government.’ she said) …while Saudi Arabia just closed a $65 billion deal to supply oil to China.HEY! If we’re serious on the environment and climate file that should have been OUR deal because Canada is quite a few thousand nautical miles closer to China, based on a quick Google search.Saudi Arabi-Bejing: 7,341 Nautical milesVancouver Bejing: 4,609 Nautical milesWe are CLOSER to China than Saudia Arabia, so there would be much less fuel consumption/emissions for transport. And did I mention, we also have the highest environmental standards of production. #CleanGrowthCenturyBut obviously, none of this is about climate change or the environment. It’s about pushing carbon trading.So, is this how the world foists a carbon trading market upon us? Lock in our resources and squeeze us dry? That’s a different kind of extraction industry, a kind of extortion. Albertans normally do business on a handshake, not a kneecap. Kudos to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce and sponsors for arranging this “Chamber of Horrors” presentation, as painful as it was to hear. At least we know exactly what we’re up against. And, we know it is folly. Would be nice to have a list of where institutional investment funds are placed…just to make sure there’s no…you know, vested interests driving this conversation.For me it was most certainly, the Chamber of Horrors. And we know that #BetterISPossibleAnd sadly it was repeated this past week with a full supplement in the Hill Times March 13, 2017 pumping out the same old Alberta/Fort McMurray wildfires-extreme weather-climate change-carbon price  misinformation to Americans. Thank heavens the US Government and @POTUS are far more pragmatic and really want to put people back to work. They approved Keystone XL. And based on how they cleared out protestors at DAPL, who left an unholy mess behind them while claiming to want to save the earth, it seems that Blockadia might be a thing of the past, too.Come and hear our speakers at CLIMATE DOGMA EXPOSED – May 9th, 2017.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/03/10/pembina-institute-invented-alternative-facts-on-renewable-energys-impact-on-global-warming/,Jeffery Green ,Pembina Institute Invented Alternative Facts on Renewable Energy’s Impact on Global Warming," Opinion – By Michelle Stirling © Feb. 24, 2017In a National Newswatch op-ed of Feb. 21, 2017, Ed Whittingham of Pembina Institute attacks Dr. Jack Mintz, claiming Mintz was “discrediting” Canada’s emerging climate plan with “alternative facts” related to Alberta’s coal phase-out and predicted rising power utility costs.  Whittingham claims Germany is going off coal. The US EIA shows Germany is predominantly driven by 44% coal power, 10% natural gas and 15% nuclear. Much of Germany’s wind and solar production is exported, with surges often causing grid problems and blackouts in neighbouring countries.Whittingham decries the unnamed “utility experts” Mintz refers to in his Feb. 15, 2017 Financial Post column. Power generation experts abound in Alberta and they support Mintz’ views. Here are some names for Ed. #names4EdOne is Dean Rosehart of the University of Calgary who hosted a 2015 Distinguished Speaker event on Alberta’s deregulated power system. Any of the panelists could have informed Dr. Mintz. Maybe he was even there!In 2014, we asked one of those panelists, Evan Bahry, Executive Director of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta (representing all forms of power generation), what it would cost to phase-out coal.  He told us in an email, permitting us to quote him verbatim, that it would require the equivalent of eight natural gas plants of 800 MegaWatt capacity to replace the power of the existing Alberta coal fleet.  Using the new Shepard Energy Center as a benchmark, built at a cost of $1.4 billion, it would be about > $11 billion – a replacement price that ultimately consumers will pay.  On top of that, he would not venture a guess as to the compensation to coal industry and investors for early phase-out – only saying it would come up to “many billions.”Gary Reynolds, former CEO of the Balancing Pool, who is frequently cited in the press, helped enlighten us on compensation costs for stranded assets and what subsidies would have to be paid to wind and solar to make it attractive for them to enter the market. He anticipated a $35/kWh rate – or about $900 million a year.  In 2012, Morrison Park Advisors noted in a report to the Market Surveillance Authority of Alberta, posted on their website, that there was no interest in wind/solar investments in Alberta because power prices were too low.A recent report “Potential Impacts on the AB Electricity Market of Policy Implementation Choices for the Climate Leadership Plan” and public speaking events by Duane Reid-Carlson of EDC Consultants shows it will cost billions more than the Alberta government is saying it will cost to phase-out coal and implement wind and solar.  Billions must be spent for transmission lines and integration for intermittent wind and solar – for very little energy return on energy invested.  Prof. Michael J. Kelly, engineering professor at Cambridge, recently published a paper entitled “Lessons from Technology Development for Energy and Sustainability” showing that wind and solar energy return is so low that it cannot even provide sufficient energy for a basic society that has education, let alone one that revels in high culture and air travelSo – experts abound.  Whittingham is firing blanks.Pembina’s Whittingham claims that humans can reduce rising global temperatures, it just might cost you to do so.  The Pembina crew claimed that back in 2002 when our soon-to-be scientific advisers debated Kyoto with Pembina representatives in the journal of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geosciences of Alberta.  Our scientific advisers said it was the sun that directly and indirectly drove climate change and warming/cooling cycles.  Pembina claimed that the IPCC had a consensus that it was human emissions.Now, some 15 years later we find that, excepting a couple of naturally-caused El Nino’s, there has been no statistically significant global warming despite all dire predictions and despite a significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration. Warming has simply not matched the theory.  Of course, the World Meteorological Organization did claim it was the ‘hottest year ever.’ If you take their margin of error of 0.1°C it means that the temperature could have been +0.12°C (global warming) or -0.08°C (cooling).And what of renewables saving the planet? Well, here is where Pembina’s alternative facts come in. Environmental activist Robert Kennedy’s quote says it best in Energy Post of April 7, 2016 – when you install wind and solar you are really just building a natural gas plant. One natural gas plant like Shepard for $1.4 billion will put out 800 megawatts of power  almost 24/7. In Alberta, just the transmission line to southern wind farms cost $2.2 billion. For that we only get ~7% of our power….only when the wind blows just right.Ontario Professional Engineers have reported that carbon dioxide emissions will rise if you add wind and solar to the grid because they must be backed up by natural gas plants. Only natural gas peaking plants are nimble enough to match Mother Nature’s dips and surges, but matching her whims creates more emissions.How so?Alberta power generation experts explained to us that the problem with wind is its randomness, wind is completely uncorrelated with demand. If the Alberta government adds another 5,000 MW then the total wind capacity* would be ~6,500 MW. Typically, this amount of wind would randomly experience 80% or higher ramps one or more times per week. This would be the equivalent of ramping 6.5 Shepard natural gas plants from off to full to off again. These plants are unable to do this over the long term. Thus, power operators may end up having to put in simple cycle units instead which, from a CO2 perspective, would defeat the alleged CO2-reduction purpose of adding wind.If Pembina believes carbon dioxide from human industry drives global warming, why do they push wind and solar? Obviously for the subsidies or Renewable Energy Certificates – these enrich green crony capitalists at the expense of the poor and middle class, and do nothing for climate change or environmental benefits.Further, as Warren Kindzierski, Associate Professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Alberta revealed in his peer-reviewed work and in a recent Financial Post op-ed, there is no air quality issue in Alberta related to coal-fired power plants as claimed by Pembina Institute and its acolytes. His research is supported by Alberta Health Services statistics, Alberta Air Quality data and numerous other peer-reviewed studies on related health/air quality issues.Our several reports, like “A Costly Misdiagnosis,”  “Burning Questions,” “Alberta Climate Plan and Carbon Tax – A Burden with No Benefit,” and “Dire Consequences” are filled with peer-reviewed references showing that Pembina is just wrong on coal-health claims and costs of coal phase-out and the climate plan.Whittingham and Pembina Institute are the ones promoting alternative facts – their costly misdiagnosis not supported by the evidence.Someone should ask why we are adopting their discredited policies.References:2015 Distinguished Speaker event permitting us to quote him verbatimwhat kinds of subsidiesMorrison Park Advisors noted in a report “Potential Impacts on the AB Electricity Market of Policy Implementation Choices for the Climate Leadership Plan” “Lessons from Technology Development for Energy and Sustainability” the journal of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geosciences of Alberta.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/03/03/fyi-alberta-our-request-for-hearing-by-the-alberta-utilities-commission-on-jenner-wind-farm-was-rejected/,,FYI Alberta – Our Request for Hearing by the Alberta Utilities Commission on Jenner Wind Farm was Rejected," Friends of Science Society does not represent any industry sector or any pecuniary interests – we examine the evidence over the ideology on climate change and climate policies and report on our findings.In 2013, Friends of Science Society hosted Dr. Benny Peiser of the Global Warming Policy Foundation of the UK as guest speaker – the title of his talk was “To Heat or Eat: Europe’s Failed Climate Policy Fiasco.” His discussion of the ramifications of the EU climate policies to date were shocking.Since 2002, our founding year, Friends of Science Society has researched and questioned the claimed economic and environmental/climate benefits of various climate change policies.  Dr. Peiser showed us the tragedy of Europe’s ‘rush-to-renewables.’Consequently, we hoped that we would have an opportunity to have a hearing on the merits of the Jenner Wind Farm, the proponents being the Power Renewable Energy Corporation of Quebec.A large part of our membership is made up of Alberta residents; many are experts in engineering, geosciences, solar sciences, power generation, business and industry.  We also have an international network of respected scientists and economists with whom we consult. We have informed opinions. However, we are a small organization with a nominal operating budget. We can speak up – but only the public can speak out.In the interests of informed public debate, we are posting our submissions and the decisions by the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC).  All of this material is already in the public domain, available on the AUC website, but it may be hard to find for someone not familiar with the process of filing.We are deeply concerned about the impact of climate policies, incentives to impose wind and solar on the Alberta economy (while phasing out #coal)  on business viability and on the impact on consumers, especially for those living on limited means.In our opinion, affordable and reliable power is a ‘human right’ in a ‘winter’ country like ours – and to our luck and credit, Alberta is blessed with excellent, high quality, low-emissions coal reserves that would last hundreds of years, that we own, as well as Alberta’s power producers having several low-emissions, high efficiency coal-fired power plants. Based on our review of climate science, the evidence and the relative benefits of coal power to Alberta, we reject the claims that phasing out coal will do anything but make Albertans poor. Based on our review of the evidence about health care, affordable and reliable power is the most crucial element of modern health care. (Please see our detailed review of the Alberta Climate Plan – A Burden with No Benefit.  Regarding health care and anti-coal activists, please see our reports “Burning Questions” and “Dire Consequences”)We invite you to review our submissions and the relevant decisions.  We are interested in informed, thoughtful and civil public debate.  It is our opinion that we have an obligation as do you, as citizens of Alberta (and Canada), to speak up on these matters.Our request for a hearing:friends-of-science-oppose-jenner-wind-farmAUC decision:21394rulingonstanding_0136-sept-22-2016-re-standingOur request for appeal:jenner-wind-farm-appeal-nov-17-2016_final-1AUC decision:decision22190-d01-2016_0004-auc-jennerThe foregoing are our opinions based on substantial evidence, and are offered without malice and with the intent to inform thoughtful public debate on these important, multi-billion dollar/multi-decade energy policy decisions in Alberta.Rather than killing bats and birds as wind farms do, it seems that Alberta’s coal-fired power plants are a happy nesting spot for Peregrine Falcons.Comments welcome. We appreciate civil comments and open debate.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/02/25/alberta-government-myths-how-about-whoppers/,Rocky Potuer ,Alberta government – Myths? How about “Whoppers”?,"  Posted by Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager Feb. 25, 2017This post responds to Alberta Environment and Parks recently posted three part series entitled “Myths and Realities of Alberta’s Climate Leadership Plan.”  Part Two   Part ThreeThe sad part of this is that the “myths” claimed by the government are far closer to the sorry truth, hence their need to try and rebut the public perceptions, with press releases and the three-part blog posts.  Following the Alberta government’s “interactive” telephone town hall discussions with Minister Shannon Phillips December 13 and 14, 2016, the Ministry of Alberta Environment and Parks issued three “clarifying” notes, titled “Myths and realities of Alberta’s Climate Leadership Plan”, intended to address what they feel are misunderstandings associated with the Plan.  These were issued Dec 22, 2016, Jan 13, 2017, and Feb 17, 2017.  Make what you will of the timing: It could be it takes a long time to determine the myths, it could be that such public notices should be spaced out nicely, it could be that important issues like this just take the government PR people a long time to sort out. Never mind.  Where to start?  Perhaps with the description of the “interactive telephone town hall discussions”.  They claim 50,000 Albertans “participated” which, while the number may be true, the description is stretching the truth.  Some questions were asked, and sounded very much like carefully screened “softballs” lobbed up for the benefit of the Minister to enable her to breathlessly read what appeared to be prepared talking points.  The only Calgary question which seemed the least bit contentious was mysteriously cut off part way through, which did not stop the Minister from then reading off a few more prepared points in “reply”.   Now, if anyone knows about myths, it is governments proposing “Climate Leadership”, and Alberta is no exception. Our federal government is also no stranger to telling whoppers and the “Big Lies” to support their climate stance; please see our previous post on the Canadian government submission supporting its “80 by 50 plan”: https://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/confusing-development-with-delusion-and-destruction/ So here is a very quick look at, and replies to, the Alberta government’s three postings on myths and realities: “It’s a Myth” Claim #1: The carbon levy (note, not a tax!) will raise household costs by thousands of dollars per year. The they claim the “levy” will “marginally increase the cost of gases used for heating and transportation”.Comment – The truth: What is their source for the statement “thousands of dollars per year”, perhaps they could provide a citation?  Various groups have suggested the tax will be expensive, such as: http://www.taxoneverything.ca.  The Alberta government’s reply simply tries to obfuscate the fact that costs will go up by carving it into components and talking about the first year, when the rate is lowest. “It’s a Myth” Claim #2: Rebates make the levy ineffective. They argue rebates are tied to income, not energy use. Comment – The truth:  Perhaps the main point which is missing is that this tax will have no effect on climate, period.  It is simply a wealth transfer and vote-buying mechanism, with some substantial carving off of revenues to pour down the green energy transition drain.  The sad part is that it will still be regressive because of its effect on overall cost of living, and its negative effect on economic development and investment in Alberta.  We will all suffer from the economic drag, with those on the lower end of the income scale hurting most of all.“It’s a Myth” Claim #3: This won’t actually reduce emissions. They argue pricing carbon is “economist-approved” and hey, it worked in BC. NOT!  Here are NDP critics bashing the BC Carbon Tax.Comment – The truth: Some economists argue not necessarily for a carbon tax as an inherently good thing, but rather it as the least of all evils.  Further, economists who tentatively support a carbon tax, recommend that it must be accompanied by casting off all the other job-killing regulations and rules which we are saddling ourselves with (as if that would ever happen!).  As for BC, please show me an unbiased study which clearly demonstrates that the claimed drop in energy-related GHG emissions in BC is solely due to the BC carbon tax – they also only mention 2007-2011, why? Perhaps its because BC reports that by 2014, the last year available from the BC government inventory, GHG emissions are UP about 3% over 2011.  There are some interesting stats within that as well: Energy as a category emits 5% more, within that we have Pipeline Transport up 28% and Transport generally up 11%.  I guess British Columbians are coming to grips with the carbon tax, at least in terms of consumption.  For BC inventory figures, please go to: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/reports-data/provincial-ghg-inventory “It’s a Myth” Claim #4: Albertans were not consulted on the Plan. The Alberta government argues that the government appointed a panel and engaged with Albertans.Comment – The truth: Actions, spirit and intent are all important.  Driving ahead with pre-conceived ideas and a biased reporting mechanism while “engaging” with your electorate fails the test.  As we pointed out at the time in various commentaries and videos, the Alberta Climate Panel was too one-sided.By the way, showing idle wind turbines manufactured by a failed Danish company does not seem like a great way to illustrate the point in the Alberta government blog. Oh well, at least when they are idle they are not slicing and dicing birds and bats. Source: Alberta government blog Part Two – this eerie image appears to show photo-shopped Danish wind turbines damaging Alberta’s world famous view of the Rocky Mountains – a multi-million dollar a year industry. BTW here’s the carbon footprint of a wind turbine. Shocking. “It’s a Myth” Claim #5: Alberta will see energy prices rise like Ontario.  The Alberta government makes five false points attempting to rebut this:1. AB gov’t says: Renewables are not being funded by adding costs to consumer electricity bills, but through reinvesting carbon revenues. The truth: This is being disingenuous at best (insincere, dishonest, false, deceitful, etc).  Higher prices are higher prices, whether showing up in your energy bill or your tax bill or your grocery bill or your reduced job prospects. 2. AB gov’t says: A competitive process is being used in Alberta, ensuring only the most cost-effective projects receive support. The truth: Being the best of the worst does not mean “cost-effective”, not does it mean costs will not go up, as they surely will. 3. AB gov’t says: More than 43% of Ontario’s cost increases are related to nuclear, which is not applicable in Alberta. The truth: So what?! We are eliminating coal, which will come at a tremendous direct and indirect cost to all Albertans, largely hidden away in various government categories of expenditures.  Coal is the primary source of power generation for system load in Alberta. (see graph at bottom of post)4. AB gov’t says: In Ontario solar and wind prices were bought at much higher prices than will be the case here. The truth: For one thing, not having gone through a tendering process yet, the Alberta government simply cannot make this claim. And again, buying unreliable solar and wind at inflated prices, even if slightly lower than Ontario, will mean higher costs! Further, as we have outlined, there was NO INTEREST in wind/solar investment in Alberta  as prices were too low– so wind and solar will have to be subsidized to attract investors. Experts put that at about $35/kWh which taxpayers will pay, one way or another.5. AB gov’t says: Alberta’s plan is based on carbon pricing and investing in “energy transition and efficiency”.  The truth: So is Ontario’s, just expressed in a different way.  There is no jurisdiction on the planet which has made any meaningful transition to renewables and generally all who have tried are suffering the consequences of significantly higher prices, whether through prices, tariffs, taxes, or all of these.Ontario Society of Professional Engineers show the price rise for power by source of generation.  Wind and Solar components require extensive multi-billion dollar investments in integration and transmission lines in order to operate on the grid.  At present, the price of coal power ‘at the gate’ (before administration, distribution costs, etc.) is about 2 cents/kWh in Alberta.  Ontario only had about 24% coal power generation; coal serves about 64% of Alberta’s system load  (see graph bottom of page).  Prices will be significantly affected in Alberta, as well consumers will bear the $3 billion compensation costs, the >$11 billion for replacing the coal fleet with natural gas, and there will be virtually no environmental or ‘climate change’ benefit as natural gas paired with volatile wind and solar ends up putting out virtually the same carbon dioxide emissions as coal.  Natural gas is also a market commodity, subject to wild price swings.  Please, Albertans are not stupid.  We see what has occurred in Ontario and every other “green” jurisdiction and we very rightly ask why we will be any better off.  Stop calling the rational objections of Albertans “myths” – the only myth is that we will achieve different results by applying substantially the same policies. “It’s a Myth” Claim #6: Carpetbaggers will come to your door selling green services and stuff. Government legislation will save you. Comment – The truth: Not worth talking about. People are quite capable of buying their own LED light bulbs and low-flow shower heads without government assistance. “It’s a Myth” Claim #7: Home inspection is needed to see if I qualify for a rebate. The Alberta government reply “this is a scam.” Comment – The truth:  The truth comes out! So the Alberta government created a program, with the direct effect of encouraging scams of various kinds.  Then they made a new law to make the scam illegal. Yet, to participate in parts of the Alberta government program, you do have to call in and schedule a home inspection – and of course more government employees will probably be required to handle that need.  So… green job creation. More bureaucracy. In short, the Alberta government’s attempt to decimate what it says are ‘myths’ only serves to demonstrate what big whoppers they are putting out to the electorate.As we have pointed out in the past, Alberta’s first climate leadership plan began in 2002 and was far-reaching and ahead of its time.  Many of the efficiencies the present government is claiming to want to achieve, were done over a decade ago, but Alberta’s reputation was smeared by offshore-funded activists. When will governments do something about THAT? Source: AESO 2016 Market Report on 2015 statsThe most recent report shows little change (pg. 11)““   Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Alberta coal phase-out', 'climate change', 'decarbonization', 'energy subsidies', 'Uncategorized']",2017/02/25

Geoph., Lead Author of our 2015 report “Burning Questions” and spokesperson in our “Burning Questions” video.On Jan. 30, 2017, the Financial Post published an article by U of A professor Warren Kindzierski. P. Eng., disputing air quality/coal emissions claims of the NDP government. On Feb. 1, 2017, Dr. Vipond, a coal phase-out proponent and representative of CAPE, tweeted us his blog response. Here is our response to him, prepared by Norm Kalmanovitch, P. Geoph. Note: Friends of Science Society is an independent non-profit funded by members.

This report shows Calgary at 9μg/m3 and Edmonton at 11μg/m3 so both major cities in Alberta are well below the safe standard of 20 μg/m3 annual mean.Toronto and Montreal which do not rely on any coal-fired power generation were worse than both Alberta cities powered by coal!http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-s-air-quality-3rd-best-in-world-1.980695PM10Select cities in CanadaWhitehorse: 3Fredricton: 6Victoria: 7Vancouver: 8Halifax: 8Ottawa: 9Calgary: 9Regina: 9Moncton: 10Edmonton: 11Toronto: 13Montreal: 19 Source: Environment CanadaScreenshot example of real-time map of world PM2.5 emissions available online. PM2.5 concentrations do fluctuate according to weather conditions, wildfires, industrial activity. http://aqicn.org/map/world/  China is often referenced as an example of the horrors of coal use. The reason that China has such high levels of pollution is that they do not employ the same level of pollution control on coal-fired power plants that we do here in Alberta.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/10/china-pollution-levels-hit-20-times-safe-levels This picture of a coal-fired power plant in China shows the steam coming out of the hyperbolic cooling towers and steam CO2which are non-polluting and PM2.5 and PAH pollution coming out of one of the main stacks.Further, China also has a popular charcoal-grilled street-food culture that contributes to large volumes of noxious emissions at ground level.Major cities like Beijing with 11.51 million people experience exaggerated “smoke from neighbour’s bar-be-que” effect from street vendors. China has imposed bans from time to time.Likewise, rural China residents cook and heat their homes by burning biomass – dung or wood – which is responsible for deaths and significant pollution globally.Consequently, while old or poor emissions-managed coal-fired power plants in China certainly contribute huge volumes of pollution, ground level pollution is significantly affected by both charcoal grilling in urban centers and biomass burning for cooking and heating in rural areas.The experience in China is so far removed from how air quality and industrial pollution is managed in Alberta, that should not be used as an indictment against modern/supercritical coal-fired power in Alberta.  On the topic of biomass, let us also look at Alberta inequities.Biomass uses wood by-products and wood pellets for fuel which produce both PM2.5 and PAH pollution when burned. Biomass power plants are not monitored so we have no way to tell what level of these pollutants is emitted from this Boyle Biomass power plant. We do know that some pollution is emitted because these power plants do not have the same level of pollution control found on all Alberta coal-fired power plants.Note in this Huffington Post article there is no mention of any pollution controls but there is mention of “carbon credits” because this biomass is deemed to be “renewable energy” which is both excluded from the carbon tax and benefits from receiving carbon creditsOn an annual basis ALPAC brings in $14 to $18 million from selling power to the grid. They also generate carbon credits and make about $2 million a year from that and get another $7 million a year from the Alberta Bio-Producer credit program. This is on top of $350 million a year in pulp sales.http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/david-dodge/biomass-burning-wood_b_6457938.html On the other side of the ledger is our coal-fired power plants which pay a hefty carbon tax for the CO2 pollution that they emit with this tax going to subsidize biomass power carbon credits for putting out real pollution!!!Alberta’s Genesee coal-fired power plant.http://www.capitalpower.com/generationportfolio/CA/Genesee/Pages/default.aspx    Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Alberta coal phase-out', 'decarbonization', 'Uncategorized']",2017/02/02

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/01/14/following-the-logic-of-phasing-out-oil-sands/,Jeffery Green ,FOLLOWING THE LOGIC OF “PHASING OUT OIL SANDS”," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ 2017At a town hall event in Peterborough, Ontario on Friday, January 13, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to a question concerning his Government’s recent decision to approve the expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline by saying it was a matter of trying to balance economic and environmental concerns. He went on to say that, “We can’t shut down the oil sands tomorrow. We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels but it’s going to take time and in the meantime we have to manage that transition.” One might be forgiven for wondering about the logic that would lead the Prime Minister of Canada to say that, as a matter of national policy, we should phase out one of the most important sources of economic and industrial development in the country, a source of literally tens of billions of dollars annually in government revenues, business and personal incomes, employment and export revenues. The case, one can only surmise, rests on accepting the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming, that Canada’s actions will remove that threat, and that the commitments that Canada made at the December, 2015 Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris oblige the government to make massive reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Each of those points is highly questionable, but let us follow their logic to see where they lead. The COP21 Agreement contained no commitments with respect to emissions reduction targets. It contained only a loose political expression of support for collective action to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2.0 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels and specific commitments to file periodic reports on the nationally-determined actions that governments were taking to achieve that goal. Separately, the Government of Canada agreed to set targets – a 17% reduction from 2005 emission levels by 2020 and a 30% reduction from 2005 emission levels by 2030. Canada has not yet enunciated a goal for 2050, but the targets set to date are consistent with the view propounded by many environmental lobby groups that emissions in the industrialized countries should be reduced by 60 to 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. Achieving major emissions reductions will be especially difficult given that normal economic growth would lead to their increase. Environment Canada, in its most recently published review of Canada’s GHG emissions trends in 2014, projected that, after declining from 736 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2 eq) in 2005 to 699 Mt in 2012, emissions would grow to 727 Mt in 2020. The fastest growing source of emissions at the sectoral level is the upstream oil and gas industry, including both conventional and non-conventional (i.e. oil sands) sources. Looking at the numbers, reducing emissions from the projected 2020 levels to the targeted ones would mean a reduction from 727 to 611 Mt, or 116 Mt; reducing emissions from projected 2020 levels (there are no authoritative projections of 2030 levels) by 2030 would mean a reduction from 727 to 515 Mt, or 212 Mt; and reducing emissions from projected 2020 levels by 2050 would mean reductions ranging from 433 Mt (60% target) to 580 Mt (80% target). Environment Canada projects the emissions from all oil and gas production in Canada to be 204 Mt by 2020. That includes emissions from not only the oil sands but also the conventional oil and gas production in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and the territories. If that could be done by 2030, it would almost attain the national emissions reduction target for that year. It would not come even close to meeting the much more ambitious targets the environmental lobby seeks for 2050. But why focus on oil and gas? The logic, one can only presume, arises not only from the fact that present emissions represent a large share of the Canadian total. It is also the fact that, comparatively speaking, the oil and gas upstream industry is considered emissions-intensive. A great irony is that, viewed on a total fuel cycle (”wellhead to tailpipe”) basis, 80 to 85% of the GHG emissions associated with oil occur at the tailpipe, or point of combustion stage. Yes, it is the downstream use of fossil fuels that causes the most intensive emissions! So, which are some of the other emissions-intensive parts of the Canadian economy? Here’s a list: Electricity GenerationFreight TransportationAviationMetal and non-metal miningSmelting and refiningPetrochemicalsFertilizer productionMotor vehicle and parts manufacturingAluminumPulp and PaperIron and SteelCement The fact is that governments will not be able to achieve the large emissions reduction now committed to or contemplated unless they address, cut back or “phase out” emissions in all these economic activities. The next time Prime Minister Trudeau announces in Ontario that, in the national interest, we will have to phase out an emissions-intensive industry, maybe he should substitute “motor vehicle and parts manufacturing” for oil sands. It would only be logical.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Justin Trudeau', 'Uncategorized']",2017/01/14
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2017/01/03/trump-transition-will-be-a-tsunami-washing-away-climate-corruption/,Jeffery Green ,Trump Transition Will be a Tsunami Washing Away Climate Corruption.," Guest post by Dr. Tim Ball ©2017Many people, including my wife, ask why I continue to fight for the truth about the greatest deception in history, the claim that humans are causing global warming. The answer is simple; I don’t want any politician to be able to say they weren’t told. I have written a multitude of articles in every medium possible, published books, done countless radio and TV interviews, and given hundreds of public lectures. It is in the record and readily available with the simplest of Internet searches. If they didn’t know, they didn’t look very hard or were deliberately selective. Despite that, there were times when I questioned the efficacy of my actions. This was brought home recently when in one of the many Internet interviews I do with students around the world a young woman asked if, in retrospect, I would follow the same path. After very little contemplation I said no and quoted the old saying that if the world wants to be fooled, let it be fooled. However, I then added, that it is of no consequence because of the path already taken and so you must follow Winston Churchill’s dictum. “Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.”  Nothing has happened to challenge my “honour or good sense.” Indeed, I steadfastly kept the idea in the front of my mind that if evidence of ‘good sense’ appeared that showed I was wrong, I had to be the first to announce it to the world. Over the last 40 years, I saw events come and go that I thought would expose the greatest deception in history: The claim that human CO2 is causing catastrophic global warming, known as anthropogenic global warming (AGW). I kept thinking and hoping that something or someone would appear to expose the entire thing. It needed an event or person who could go to the heart of the problem that was established and firmly protected within the realm of government. I watched the Chapter Eight debacle in which sections of a final report agreed on by the committee were drastically altered when it was released to the world. I thought the leaked emails, first 1000, then 5000 and finally 220,000 from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) that became the control centre for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would open people’s eyes. The exposure of malfeasance, collusion, and manipulation of data, publications and even scientific journals should have stopped the corruption. It didn’t. The disclosures should have converted the valiant supporters of the IPCC and CRU. It didn’t. For the few of us who already knew, it was just confirmation. It is a measure of the tunnel vision of left-wing ideology that the Guardian reporter George Monbiot, a strong supporter of both agencies and their work wrote, It’s no use pretending that this isn’t a major blow. The emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging. I am now convinced that they are genuine, and I’m dismayed and deeply shaken by them. But this didn’t trigger a campaign by him to demand the truth as it would in a less doctrinaire person. As Clive Crook wrote in The Atlantic “I had hoped, not very confidently, that the various Climategate inquiries would be severe. This would have been a first step towards restoring confidence in the scientific consensus. But no, the reports make things worse. At best, they are mealy-mouthed apologies; at worst, they are patently incompetent and even willfully wrong. The climate-science establishment, of which these inquiries have chosen to make themselves a part, seems entirely incapable of understanding, let alone repairing, the harm it has done to its own cause.” I thought the leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) that exposed the corrupt activities of the central scientists at the IPCC would stop the juggernaut. Instead, they hired PR people and set up controlled whitewash investigations as Crook noted. None of it stopped and only marginally slowed the AGW deception. The marginal delay occurred because the emails were leaked in November 2009, a month before the Conference of the Parties (COP) 15 meeting in Copenhagen that planned to agree on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. A year later COP 16 in Durban, South Africa, they approved the replacement for Kyoto, the great socialist transfer of wealth scheme based on use and abuse of CO2, with the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  Too many people had too much invested, and most of the public didn’t understand what was happening. A major factor in perpetuating the deception was the claim that 97 percent of scientists agreed. This was another falsehood deliberately created to perpetuate the myth. A Queensland University researcher claimed to have surveyed 11,944 papers and concluded 97.1% expressed an opinion supporting climate change. In fact, by their definition, only 41 agreed with their hypothesis or 0.3%.  The only 97% figure of relevance is the 97% who have never looked at the IPCC science. The 3 % who have, were shocked. For example, Emeritus Professor of physics, the late Hal Lewis wrote in his resignation letter to the American Physical Society (APS) in October 2010 “the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, and has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist.” German meteorologist and physicist Klaus-Eckart Puls had a similar experience as he explained. “Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data – first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it.” For most, it is so bad they think they are misreading it, so they reach out to others for confirmation. This was the experience of people like Albert Jacobs who contacted me several years ago to speak to a small group of Albertans. Their concern about the proposed Kyoto Protocol led to examining the scientific justification and found it wanting.  I met the group at the Calgary airport and after convincing them that the science was worse than they surmised the discussion turned to the real issue. Should they stick strictly to the science or be aware that the issue was science corrupted and used for a political agenda. The other issue was making the science understandable to the 80% of the public who are Arts students. To their credit, they stuck to the science and did it with great success. A few years later I got a call from Malcolm Roberts a recently retired Australian engineer and businessman who also looked at the climate science. I helped him work with others to create the Galileo Movement, an organization that has achieved the same impact as Friends of Science. Malcolm wanted to become proactive, and as we communicated, he became aware that the real problem was in the deliberate use of bureaucrats. He learned that Maurice Strong set up the IPCC through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and as Strong knew the politicians and public would not challenge the bureaucrats. This culminated in Roberts running for office under a new Australian Party banner – One Nation. Meanwhile, he also learned that everything presented to the public was computer generated; there was not a shred of empirical evidence to support the AGW hypothesis. His campaign as the Senator from Queensland was successful, and his maiden speech started the search for empirical evidence. To my knowledge, it is the first open challenge to the bureaucrats who control the global warming agenda by a politician. He asked the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), the agency responsible for climate change, to produce empirical evidence for global warming. They produced a report that failed to provide any evidence. Instead, they countered with English TV celebrity Brian Cox showing a temperature graph from NASA GISS showing the temperature rising. Apparently, he didn’t know that a temperature graph is not empirical evidence of AGW. Worse, he didn’t know the graph was altered to exaggerate the gradient. If he had done even minimal research, he would have come across Tony Heller’s explanation of what and how the ‘adjustments’ were made to create exaggerated warming. Because of these events Senator Roberts arranged for Tony and me to appear with him at the Australian Parliament with a public presentation. The Senator spoke about the failure of CSIRO to provide empirical evidence. Tony explained the extent of the corruption of the temperature data, and I provided the entire development and objective of the AGW deception from the Club of Rome through Agenda 21 and the IPCC. Then, as the ancients would say, the stars aligned. While in Australia with Senator Roberts Donald Trump won the US Presidential election. It will change everything, but especially with the climate corruption. A measure of Trump’s acumen and developer’s sense was that he appointed various people to head transition teams before the election. He knew you need everything ready to go on the first day of construction. Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), who both Tony and I knew, was appointed to lead the transition team dealing with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and climate change. He invited the three of us to appear at a meeting on Capitol Hill to make similar presentation to those we made in Australia. We appeared on the Hill on December 12 before Senators, Congressmen, Aides, and members of the public. We then went to the CEI to participate in discussions with a group called “Cooler Heads” that included other members of the EPA transition team. Considerable discussion ensued with many questions related to positive actions. President-elect Trump wants clean air and water, so some form of EPA is required. What is not needed are bureaucrats creating regulations and enforcement without scientific evidence for a political agenda. It is likely Trump will advocate withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.  Ironically, because of Obama’s need to bypass the US Senate, it was an Agreement, not a Treaty. Then, to satisfy less committed nations and reach an agreement for the publicity it was made non-binding. This means the US can walk away and there is nothing any other nation can do. The exploitation of environmental concerns and global warming to push a political agenda is coming to an end. Control of bureaucracies is critical because they are the massive army of unaccountable control. As American author and social commentator, Mary McCarthy said, Bureaucracy, the rule of no one, has become the modern form of despotism. Two actions are required to drain the Washington environmental and climate change swamp; reduction of funding and changes to legislation. Both are scheduled for implementation by the Trump administration under the guidance of the transition teams. Nothing cleans out a swamp better and quicker than a tsunami.~~~~Dr. Ball’s latest book is available on Amazon.http://drtimball.com/Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'Uncategorized']",2017/01/03

We Complain to CRA,"  OverviewOn Dec. 17, 2016, The David Suzuki Foundation, a registered Canadian charity, sent an email to subscribers claiming that “Pipeline approvals expose broken environmental assessment process” – that same day Ecojustice Canada Society, a registered Canadian charity, sent an email to subscribers claiming “Research shows that approving the Kinder Morgan pipeline will be a death sentence for the Salish Sea orcas.”  No factual support was offered for either statement. No balanced statements were provided regarding the benefits of this economic activity. Readers were requested to donate.Registered charities are given the privilege of issuing tax receipts to donors on the principle that the charities are performing a public benefit, and this privilege comes with certain obligations which include presenting balanced and factual information.  Likewise, there are certain guidelines and rules about activities that affect public markets and national policies.Consequently, in our opinion, the messages these charities sent are not simple matters of Freedom of Speech – especially when their tax-subsidized activities are blocking taxpaying workers and industries from performing federally approved activities.Thousands of Canadians are out of work. The federal approval of the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion and Enbridge Line 3 have been subject to detailed review.We have two reports on moving oil by pipeline and tanker.  We hope the Canadian public will review this factual information.MOVING OIL BY PIPELINEhttps://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/moving-oil-by-pipeline-examining-the-facts/MOVING OIL BY TANKERhttps://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/moving-oil-by-tanker-in-canada-the-facts/Both charities also claim in these and related documents that building pipelines will prevent a ‘low-carbon’ future when such a thing is not in the realm of reality. According to the International Energy Agency:“In 2014, the shares of primary energy supply by energy source were: oil, 31.3%; coal, 28.8%; natural gas, 21.0 %; biofuels and waste, 10.3%; nuclear, 4.8%; hydro, 2.4%; and “other”, including all renewables energy sources, 1.4%.”https://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/facts-and-fallacies-on-world-fossil-fuel-use-vs-renewables/ Likewise, renewable energy will not replace fossil fuels anytime soon.https://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/why-renewable-energy-cannot-replace-fossil-fuels-by-2050/Climate change and energy policies have significant consequences for individual people as well as for the nation’s economy.  The discussion should be based on facts and evidence.One fact is that no wind or solar devices can exist without massive volumes of oil, natural gas and coal.  So, if we follow the logic of these charities to “keep it in the ground,” we will have no power or energy sources at all.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/12/11/the-energy-subsidy-debate-some-additional-fuel-for-the-fire/,,The Energy “Subsidy” Debate – Some Additional Fuel for the Fire," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2016One of the recurring side debates that always seems to rage between those who favour large public spending to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and those who argue that such expenditures are not justified concerns whether energy markets are already “distorted” by existing subsidies to fossil fuel industries.There are many complex elements to this debate, including the question of what actually constitutes a “subsidy”, who benefits from it (producers or consumers?), whether the costs of environmental effects caused or avoided should be included in the calculations, whether tax subsidies (i.e. deductions and credit that provide incentives for investment) should be weighed against the revenue received by governments when the investments occur, and so on. There are few simple answers.With that preamble, I think John Petersen, a lawyer and investment analyst with special expertise in energy storage technologies, has provided some valuable additional information in his recent article on the subsidies provided by United States governments to Tesla Corporation and its counterpart SolarCity (both owned largely by Elon Musk). Tesla manufactures electric cars (EVs) and SolarCity manufactures the batteries needed by EVs and other users. The details of Petersen’s calculations can be found in his article here:http://seekingalpha.com/article/4028003-teslas-subsidy-shuffle-big-public-costs-public-benefitThe combined U.S. federal subsidies to Tesla and SolarCity per vehicle sold in 2015 include $2,400 for the solar panels, $2,100 for energy storage technologies, $2,250 for GHG emission credits, and $7,500 for EV investment tax credits, for a total of $14,250. In addition, in states like California that offer zero emission vehicle (ZEV) tax credits, each vehicle sold qualifies for a $7,750 tax credit. The combined federal-state subsidy is thus $22,000.If you assume that an average EV will save 600 gallons of fuel per year during a ten-year useful life, the combined subsidies work out to $3.67 per avoided U.S. gallon in ZEV states and $2.38 per avoided gallon in non-ZEV states. That is equivalent to $413 per tonne of GHGs avoided in ZEV states and $268 per tonne avoided in non-ZEV states.Petersen also offers some comparative information on federal subsidies provided to different energy sources produced in the United States, based on data from the Energy Information Administration for 2013 (the most recent year available).The following table shows the subsidies paid, the energy produced in 2013 from that source, and the subsidy per million British Thermal Units (BTU) to provide a common standard of comparison.U.S. Federal Subsidies to Energy Production 2013Energy Source                       Subsidies        Energy Production    Subsidies per(millions)            (trillion BTU)              MMBTUCoal                                            $1,085                     20,209                    $0.05Oil and Natural Gas              $2,346                     43,695                    $0.05Hydropower                                $395                      2,579                    $0.15Nuclear                                      $1,660                      8,117                    $0.20Biofuels                                     $2,445                      4,495                    $0.54Geothermal                                  $345                         220                     $1.57Wind                                           $5,936                      1,549                    $3.83Solar                                           $5,328                         286                   $18.63For comparison, the current spot price of natural gas in the United States is $2.96 per MMBTU.Petersen notes that it is not entirely fair to compare subsidies in one year to the production in that year, as the subsidies are intended to increase production over time, and it takes several years in some cases before the up front investment results in production. Still, the difference in magnitude between the per-BTU subsidies to conventional fossil fuels and the renewable fuels is striking. For example, the per-BTU subsidies to wind producers are 76 times as high as the subsidies to coal, oil and natural gas.It is unfortunate that comparable information is not available for Canada. ~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'energy subsidies', 'Uncategorized']",2016/12/11

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/12/11/a-tale-told-by-numbers-world-vehicle-trends/,Howard Dewhirst ,A TALE TOLD BY NUMBERS – WORLD VEHICLE TRENDS," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2016Those who believe that humans are causing catastrophic global warming often claim that the world will soon no longer need oil as a transportation fuel because of increased fuel economy, reduced vehicle ownership and the emergence of all-electric “plug-in” vehicles as a major share of the world vehicle market. To achieve their goals, they insist that all-electric vehicles must constitute 60% of new vehicle sales by 2040, 24 years from now. There is no doubt that, during the past decade, there have been significant improvements in the fuel economy of new light-duty vehicles. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, since 2004 the fuel economy of cars has increased by 23% and that of light duty trucks (SUVs) by 27%.  These improvements will probably continue and extend to heavy-duty trucks, although not at the same rates. To test the other claims, however, one can refer to the statistics published by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA). On its web site(http://www.oica.net/category/about-us/), OICA publishes a wide range of data, including those showing the trends over the past ten year period for which full information is available (2005 to 2014) on vehicle use and sales. To simplify the results, I summarize in the following tables the data under different categories for years 2005, 2009, and 2014. 2009 is both the mid-point of the period and the year during which the effect of the 2008 global crisis was very strongly felt. Table 1Personal Vehicles in Use (millions)Region                                2005               2009               2014                  Europe                                 277                  298                  328NAFTA                                 165                  173                  168South and CentralAmerica                                 37                    47                    63Asia, Oceania&Middle East                           157                  207                  318Africa                                      18                    23                    29World                                    654                   748                 907 These figures reveal several interesting points. The trends in terms of personal vehicle (PV) use vary widely from one region to another. In the NAFTA area (i.e. Canada, the United States and Mexico), total vehicle use grew from 2005 to 2009, but then the consequence of the financial crisis and perhaps other trends (such as the increasing tendency of younger people to live in city cores without owning cars) have been a reduction in PV use. North American PV use still increased by 3 million, or 1.8%, over the decade. In every other region, PV use consistently grew. Even in Europe, about which one hears so much about energy transformation, PV use grew by 51 million vehicles, or 18.4%. The largest growth by far was in Asia, Oceania and the Middle East, where PV use grew by 161 million vehicles, more than doubling the 2005 total. The growth in this region’s PV use in one decade almost equaled the total number of vehicles in use in the NAFTA region in 2005. For the world as a whole, total PV use grew by 253 million, or about 39%. This was during a period marked by the worst recession since the Great Depression. Trends in PV use, of course, do not tell the whole story. One should examine also the trends in the use of all road motor vehicles including light and heavy trucks and buses. The following table shows statistics on the use of all road vehicles over the 2005-2014 period. Table 2All Road Vehicles in Use (millions)Region                                 2005               2009               2014Europe                                    322                 348                  382NAFTA                                    278                 299                  317South and CentralAmerica                                    50                   64                    87Asia, Oceania &Middle East                            217                 276                  408Africa                                        26                   34                    43World                                     893               1,021                1,236The number of trucks in use is a good index of the volume of commercial trade, so it is notable that, while the statistics for all regions show growth (especially in Asia), in most cases the rates of growth for commercial vehicles (CV) is slower than for PVs. OICA also publishes a set of statistics that provide an insight into the potential for future growth in vehicle use. This is the “motorization rate”, or the number of vehicles (i.e. both PVs and CVs) per thousand inhabitants. Table 3Motorization Rate (2014)Region                                     RateEurope                                   464NAFTA                                    661South and CentralAmerica                                  176Asia, Oceania &Middle East                            100Africa                                          44World                                       180 This shows how “vehicle-centric” the North American economies are, with two-thirds as many vehicles as there are people. The reduction in PV use there from 2009 to 2014 made only a small dent in the high use rates. In Asia, even the immense increases in vehicle use over the past decade have not raised vehicle usage rates there anywhere close to the motorization rates of even Latin America, let alone Europe and the NAFTA region. The potential for growth in vehicle usage in Asia and then Africa is enormous, economic conditions and government policies permitting. The final set of OICA statistics to note show trends are new vehicle sales. These are shown in Table 4. Table 4Total New Vehicle Sales (million)Region                               2005               2009               2014   Europe                                 21                    19                    19NAFTA                                 20                    13                    20South and Central America                                  3                      6                       6Asia, Oceania &Middle East                          20                    28                     43Africa                                      1                       1                        2World                                    66                     66                    88 These sales figures show more clearly how the global financial crisis dampened new vehicles sales in Europe and North America, while sales continued to grow in all other parts of the world. Even in North America, however, new vehicle sales have fully recovered to their pre-crisis levels. The final set of figures to consider is those of all-electric vehicles. OICA does not report on vehicle sales to distinguish sales of internal combustion engines from all-electric or hybrid vehicles. Most online sources of statistics on EV sales focus on monthly changes, especially in the U.S. and European markets, so it is difficult to get an accurate sense of global EV sales. The Statistics Portal is one source that provides data on the worldwide number of electric vehicles since 2011 when EVs began to be sold in large numbers. The global totals this source quotes are 100,000 in 2012, 200,000 in 2013, 405,000 in 2014 and 740,000 in 2015. Probably the best source of free data is available online through Clean Technica here:https://cleantechnica.com/2015/08/03/electric-car-infographic-with-ton-of-fun-stats/Clean Technica reports that global annual sales of plug-in electric vehicles were 206,000 in 2013, 307,000 in 2014 and 430,000 (forecast) in 2015. In six countries (Norway, the Netherlands, Iceland, Estonia, Sweden and Japan) do all-electric vehicles have more than 1% of market share. This extremely rapid growth in sales from small beginnings has been aided by generous taxpayer subsidies in North America and Europe, including U.S. $7,500 per vehicle in the United States, up to CDN $14,000 in Canada, and up to 5,000 pounds in the United Kingdom. The duration of those subsidies is increasingly in question, partly because of taxpayer resistance in European countries and because of the new Trump Administration in the United States. What can one make of the available statistics on sales of internal combustion vs. all-electric vehicles? Of 907 million personal vehicles on the road worldwide in 2014, 405,000 were EV’s. EVs constituted 0.04 % of the PVs on the road globally.Sales of all-electric trucks and buses are negligible.Of 88 million new vehicle sales in the world in 2014, 307,000 were EVs. That is, the EV share of new vehicle sales was 0.35%. In 2015, that probably rose to one half of one percent.To reach 60% of present PV sales by 2040, EV sales would have to increase to 120 times today’s level.The potential growth in total vehicle sales globally is immense, especially in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The likelihood that EV sales will constitute 60% of the much-increased sales of all vehicles by 2040 approaches zero.Internal combustion engines, powered by petroleum fuels, will be the dominant source of motive power for a very long time. ~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP-22', 'COP21', 'electric vehicles', 'Uncategorized']",2016/12/11

The overall multi-billion dollar financial risks of coal phase-out were publicly known and were brought up in the televised election debate of April 23, 2015 and specifically addressed to candidate Rachel Notley, by then Premier Jim Prentice, who, as former federal environment minister, had negotiated the federal coal phase-out schedule. [5] On Nov. 30, 2016, the Calgary Herald reported that the government is borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to cover losses in the power market, due to the Power Purchase Agreements contracts for coal, which were held by major companies and were returned to the Balancing Pool when the carbon tax legislation triggered the ‘more unprofitable’ Change of Law clause. [6] [7] As predicted by Mr. Prentice, billions of dollars must be paid out in compensation for stranded coal assets. [8] Change of law clauses are a normative feature of power purchasing agreements, as outlined by the World Bank. [9] The lack of due diligence and duty of care on this matter by the NDP government, indicates a breach of the public trust and may be driven by conflicts of interest outlined below.FULL PDF of Letter to Ethics Commissioner:dec-5-lt-to-ethics-commissioner-trussler-re-conflict-of-interest-final-blogFootnotes of opening of the letter:[1] http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-ethics-commissioner-asked-to-probe-possible-mciver-conflict-1.3864777[2] “Decisions furthering private interests2(1) A Member breaches this Act if the Member takes part in a decision in the course of carrying out the Member’s office or powers knowing that the decision might further a private interest of the Member, a person directly associated with the Member or the Member’s minor or adult child.” http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/C23.pdf[3] http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/C23.pdf[4] http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/osi/economic-impact-analysis/economic-multipliers/2011/Alberta-Economic-Multipliers-2011.pdf[5] https://youtu.be/5oV5rfzffMc  (27:34)[6] http://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/government-borrowing-hundreds-of-millions-to-cover-losses-in-power-market[7] http://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/yedlin-writing-on-wall-for-coal-fired-power-purchase-arrangements[8] http://www.nationalpost.com/capital+power+upgraded+alberta+compensation+stranded+coal+assets/12434729/story.html[9] https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sector/energy/energy-power-agreements/power-purchase-agreements “..Change of law – PPA should address impact on tariff in event of a change in applicable law and the mechanism for tariff adjustment.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/11/27/moving-oil-by-pipeline-examining-the-facts/,george parr watts ,MOVING OIL BY PIPELINE: EXAMINING THE FACTS," Friends of Science Society is dedicated to presenting evidence over ideology, usually related to climate science and policy. Climate change and environmental concerns are often cited as a factors in pipeline development. This material is offered to provide information to the public for informed debate on important economic and environmental issues in Canada.Full Report: MOVING OIL BY PIPELINE: EXAMINING THE FACTS SUMMARYDecisions about the permitting or construction of pipelines should be based on facts, not fear. Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2016The purpose of this paper is to examine the actual safety performance of oil pipeline systems in Canada and the United States, especially as this relates to oil spills. The paper will also describe the measures now being taken by the petroleum industry and governments to prevent oil spills and to ensure that, if they occur, the results are minimized and mitigated. Finally, it will discuss exactly what happens when, despite best efforts, a large spill occurs. In 2015, the federally regulated oil pipeline system in Canada consisted of 38 companies, including 11 that transport both oil and natural gas. In 2015, they transported 1.4 billion barrels of oil along 21,637 kilometres of pipelines. Under Canada’s Constitution, pipelines entirely within the boundaries of a province are regulated by the government of that province. In Alberta, the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) regulates 886 licensees operating approximately 415,000 km of pipelines within the province. These pipelines carry various gases and fluids and vary in length and size. Crude oil pipelines constitute about 20,000 km of the total. The British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (OGC) regulates 120 licensees operating approximate 39,000 km of pipeline within the province. Of these, crude oil pipelines constitute about 2,400 km. In Saskatchewan, the Ministry of the Economy regulates 25 licensees operating about 23,000 km of pipelines, of which about 4,200 are crude oil pipelines. In both Canada and the United States, the oil pipeline industry has a remarkably good record of avoiding spills. Of the total volume of oil moved annually on federally regulated pipelines in Canada in 2015, 99.999% of the oil was delivered safely with no spills. Of the 1.4 billion barrels of oil transported, less than 400 were spilled. In the United States, the same 99.999% record of safe delivery applies. The number of accidents and incidents on crude oil pipelines has been declining for many years. Similarly, in Alberta, where most of the intra-provincial oil pipeline capacity is located, the number of pipeline incidents and spills has been stable or declining for at least 20 years. The reason for this is that governments and industry have implemented a comprehensive system of regulation, standards, management practices, and planning to ensure pipeline integrity, to avoid or at least minimize the risk of spills and to ensure effective cleanup if a spill occurs. Within that system, industry bears the primary responsibility to ensure the safe design and operation of pipelines. It exercises this responsibility through constantly researching and applying new technologies; sensing and detecting leaks through systems that operate 24 hours a day; investing in pipeline safety ($1.4 billion per year in Canada); and carrying out regular inspections and audits of pipeline safety systems. If an incident occurs, the National Energy Board holds the company responsible and accountable for cleanup and site remediation. The federal Pipeline Safety Act sets out absolute liability of $1 billion for companies operating major pipelines. If the pipeline company is at fault or negligent, the liability is unlimited. This provides a powerful financial incentive for companies to operate their pipeline facilities safely. Of course, it is not possible to entirely eliminate the risk of a spill, any more than it is possible in every other aspect of life to reduce risks to zero. This paper describes the consequences of a major spill near Marshall, Michigan in 2010. In one of the worst cases in twenty years, there were no injuries to people. The use of surface waters affected by the spill for drinking, irrigation and watering of livestock was interrupted for one month. 52 birds, 40 muskrats, 106 turtles and snakes and 42 fish died. The company responsible was required to pay almost $900 million in fines and other expenses to ensure that this does not happen again. Millions of people depend upon the supply of refined oil products for transportation, industrial production, petrochemicals and the thousands of products and services that people use in our modern industrialized society. Further, hundreds of thousands of people work very hard to ensure that the transportation of crude oil and refined oil products moves across our lands with the utmost care given to oil spill prevention, preparedness and response. Comprehensive liability, compensation and governance regimes are in place to make sure that companies have a strong financial incentive to avoid spills and to clean them up as soon as possible if they do occur. Decisions about the permitting or construction of pipelines should be based on facts, not fear.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/11/27

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/11/25/confusing-development-with-delusion-and-destruction/,Jeffery Green ,Confusing Development with Delusion and Destruction," A quick review of Canada’s submission to the UNFCCContributed by Rob Pearce ©2016Have you ever seen the buzzword or jargon generating games, where various phrases, nouns, verbs etc are combined to make serious sounding yet obscure statements?  Welcome to Canada’s latest contribution to the GHG reduction commitment stampede. Scheduled to coincide with the termination of the COP22 conference in Marrakesh, the Federal Government just released its fantasy document submitted to the UNFCCC under the Paris Agreement: Canada’s Mid-Century Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Development Strategy. Oddly, even now several days after the document was released, it does not appear to be available on Environment Canada’s website, but rather only on the UNFCC website. To start us off, it’s both ironic and sad that one of the very beautiful photos in the beginning of the document (page 3) is Moraine Lake and Valley of the Ten Peaks, in Banff National Park. For background information, the Valley is a glacial valley, with ten peaks over ten thousand feet in elevation, and is a spectacular and popular destination.  It has also appeared on two issues of our $20 bill, again ironically as this document proposes massive destruction of Canadian wealth disguised as “green development”.  It is ironic because this document includes “long-term” in its title, yet cannot come close to the long term found in this iconic place.  Not long ago, the overwhelming power of continental and alpine glaciation carved it out of hundreds of millions of years of sedimentary rock deposits, the formations themselves recording and representing the truly long term, with corresponding immense variations in climate, geography and ocean/atmospheric composition, of course completely unaffected by humans. The government submission (and I use that phrasing very deliberately) is both important and meaningless at the same time, being a description of a possible (actually not in reality) pathway to achieving Canada’s stated goal of reducing GHG emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by 2050, or just 34 years from now.  An excellent description of the challenges and downsides of the “80 by 50” concept is provided in a report by Robert Bryce at the Manhattan Institute: https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/your-land-look-at-80-by-50-9346.html. The Canadian government submission is about a 90-page document, making a detailed study of it a rather daunting task to tackle in a short time.  And life is too short, particularly since pretty much every paragraph (possibly every sentence) contains various combinations of outright falsehoods, misconceptions, exaggerations or naïve hopes. Fortunately, (though sadly) it is highly repetitive (and tiresome) in terms of both jargon and the “big lies”, which is the approach I have taken to categorizing its many shortcomings. Selected Jargon Count (from the pdf file)Greenhouse 156GHG 190Pollutants or pollution 32Warm or warming (and warmers!) 35Mitigate or mitigation 90Climate 186Clean or cleaner 149Sustainable 48Carbon or Decarbonization 295Emission or emissions 458Development ~72Jobs, Employment 27 The Big LiesFortunately, the document itself makes it easier to categorize and summarize its Big Lies, by neatly using them as section headers within the Executive Summary and also throughout the document.  Examples include:– Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to avoid the increasing threat presented by climate change.– Net emissions falling by 80% in 2050…is consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 2C to 1.5C goal.– Today’s technologies and knowledge can significantly reduce emissions,…– A cleaner more innovative economy that reduces emissions and protects the environment, while creating well-paying jobs and promoting robust economic growth.– Regional cooperation will be key to our success. So let’s have a quick discussion on each of these five Big Lies, which form the foundation of the call to support actions which will ruin Canada’s economy, disproportionately hurt the poor and have no measurable effect on the world’s climate.  Please note that this article is not intended as a thorough debunking of the submission, just a simple discussion of why it’s so ridiculous and dangerous at the same time.  There are many, very thorough critiques of each of the Big Lies in the submission, and I urge readers to follow up with these as they see fit. Big Lie #1: Carbon dioxide is a pollutant and is causing global warming Carbon dioxide is a foundation of all life on Earth as a vital part of the food chain.  The Earth is currently at long term historically low levels of CO2 and is now benefitting from the minor rise now taking place.  The Earth is greener and more agriculturally productive, benefitting the environment and humankind.  The globe has been warming naturally in fits and starts since coming out of the last ice age, so any warming is largely a natural part of that cycle.  Warming concerns are driven by simplistic climate models which have demonstrably failed badly in their predictions of global warming, sea level rise and other harbingers of doom. Big Lie #2: Forcing Canada’s emissions down by 80% will help the globe Canada’s emissions of CO2 are approximately 1.6% of global emissions.  Even eliminating ALL our emissions will have no measurable effect, except to destroy our country.  This is simply because CO2 is not a pollutant – and because other countries continue to raise their emissions at far higher rates than we are cutting ours.  See also Big Lie #5.  A very recent example is China alone stating it will raise coal-fired generating capacity by 200 gigawatts, or more than Canada’s entire generating capacity, over the next five years. Big Lie #3: Today’s technologies are largely sufficient to eliminate fossil fuels Today’s technologies are simply incapable of providing the reliable, low cost energy needed to power our modern world and lift billions out of poverty.  Windmills and solar panels are inefficient, unreliable and expensive, and they require 100% backup from reliable fossil fuel generation – they survive only because of massive government subsidies and other complex interventions, dragging down the real economy and ordinary people with them.  These technologies fail badly by every measure; they should simply not be installed until research and development bring them up to the standard we deserve. Big Lie #4: We can largely eliminate fossil fuel use while growing the economy This is perhaps the greatest lie of all, as it tells people they can have it all.  It’s the broken windows fallacy taken to an extreme.  There are no examples of any modern economy achieving this imaginary state; even within Canada, we need only look at the example of Ontario’s disastrous green energy policy train wreck.  A few reference articles related to this Big Lie include: Why renewable energy cannot replace fossil fuels by 2050: A reality check.  Robert Lyman.  May 2016. https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Renewable-energy-cannot-replace-FF_Lyman.pdf Green jobs – rhetoric or reality: A brief review of the evidence.  Robert Lyman.  March 2016. https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Green-Jobs-Rhetoric_Lyman.pdf Climate crazy Ontario’s no place to grow, but to get the hell out of.  Ross McKitrick.

These include the Northern Gateway Project to the port of Kitimat, British Columbia, the Trans Mountain Expansion Project in the lower British Columbia mainland, and the Energy East Project from Alberta to Nova Scotia. As a result, there has been increased public scrutiny of the safety of the marine oil transportation components of these projects. The projects’ opponents claim that increased oil tanker movement will lead to unacceptably high risks of oil spills that will have major environmental effects. What follows is a summary of a much longer paper that I have prepared on this subject.Full Document Download link: moving-oil-by-tanker-in-canada-finalThe Issue in ContextOver half of the world’s crude oil production of roughly 90 million barrels per day moves to market by seaborne tanker, of which there are about 3,500 moving daily on the world’s oceans. The tanker is the most cost-effective way to move oil. The cost of transporting crude oil by tanker from the Middle East to Canada’s east coast is only half a cent per litre at the pump. The world’s fleet of tankers has changed greatly over the last fifty years. Despite the immense volume of oil moved, the number of spills and the quantities of oil spilled has declined dramatically. In the 1970’s, 3.2 million tonnes of oil were spilled during an era when large spills gained public attention. In the 2010 to 2013 period, only 22,000 tonnes were spilled worldwide, about one one-thousandth of the annual volumes spilled in the 1970’s. Each year, 80 million tonnes of oil are shipped off Canada’s east and west coasts. There are about 20,000 tanker movements, 85% of which are on the east coast. Contrary to public perception, large or even medium oil spills are very rare in Canada. The largest oil spill in Canadian history was 46 years ago, in 1970, when the Arrow spilled 10,000 tonnes off the coast of Nova Scotia. The International and Canadian Regimes Governing Marine Safety Today’s tanker industry is governed by a comprehensive set of international conventions and domestic laws and regulations that affect every aspect of tanker design, operation, performance standards, safety practices and environmental protection, much of it determined by agreements under the International Maritime Organization (IMO). For example, more than half the tankers that operate world wide today are double-hulled to eliminate or reduce spills in the event of a collision or grounding; as of 2015, all tankers operating within North American waters must be double-hulled. Within Canada, the Canada Shipping Act, 2001 and a wide range of other legislation enable Transport Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, Environment and Climate Change Canada and other federal organizations to implement the National Oil Spill Preparedness and Response Regime. This regime is based on three pillars: preventing spills from happening; preparing for and responding to spills quickly and effectively; and ensuring that the polluter pays for any damage caused. The regime ensures that Canada is prepared to respond to a marine spill up to 10,000 tonnes. The regime sets clear roles and responsibilities. The polluter is first and foremost responsible to avoid spills, to take action when they occur, and to pay for the costs of cleanup. They do this by equipping every vessel to deal with spills, and by hiring private Response Organizations located in each region to have available on standby the equipment, resources and trained personal to deal with any spills beyond the vessel’s capability. Transport Canada is responsible for preparedness, including establishing requirements with which Response Organizations must comply. The Canadian Coast Guard is the operational arm of the Canadian government responsible for ensuring an appropriate response to pollution incidents in Canadian waters. It monitors the polluter’s response and will assist if asked, but also stands ready to step in and manage the response itself if it considers that the polluter is unable or unwilling to respond properly. Federal Port Authorities are responsible to maintain safe navigation and environmental protection within port boundaries, including directing and controlling vessel traffic. Ship owners and operators have a strong financial incentive to avoid spills and to clean them up quickly if they occur. Beyond that, in the rare cases when a spill occurs, there is a multi-tier system to determine liability and compensation. The ship’s insurer pays the first tier on behalf of a ship owner. Ship owners are strictly liable for oil pollution damage up to $145 million. The second tier is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, 1992, which provides an additional maximum amount of compensation of $180 million. The third tier is paid by the Oil Pollution Compensation Supplementary Fund, up to an additional $875 million. Finally, Canada has its own Ship-source Oil Pollution Fund, which provides liability coverage up to $166 million for a single incident. Thus, the total amount of compensation for a tanker spill in Canada would be up to $1.48 billion. Quantifying the Risks – The Results of Recent Studies There have been three recent studies done that examine the marine risks associated with proposals to increase tanker movement in Canadian waters. In 2013, Transport Canada contracted with GENIVAR, a leading professional services firm, to conduct a Canada-wide (south of 60 degrees north) risk assessment to determine the national risks associated with oil spills by region.  In 2010, Det Norske Veritas (DNV), an international certification body and classification society, performed a marine shipping quantitative risk analysis of the proposed Northern Gateway marine shipping component. In 2013, DNV completed a general risk analysis for the proposed Trans Mountain Expansion Project. The studies differed to some extent in the methodologies followed, but they all examined the risks associated with oil spills of different sizes and they portrayed the risks in terms of “return periods”, or the average number of years expected between spill occurrences.  The GENIVAR study used international spill rates to calculate the probability of spills, even these are far higher than what has happened in Canada in the past. It projected the overall Canadian crude oil spill frequency for spills of 10 to 100 cubic metres (by far the most common) to have a return period of 0.4 years, a spill of 100 to 1,000 tonnes to have a return period of 1.4 years, a spill of 1,000 to 10,000 tonnes to have a return period of 20.2 years, and a spill of over 10,000 tonnes to have a return period of 242.3 years. That, again, is for all of Canada. The DNV study of the marine risks of the Northern Gateway project compared the risks with and without a number of mitigating measures that it recommended. The subsequent National Energy Board recommendations concerning the Northern Gateway project would have made these mitigating measures a requirement if a certificate were issued. The study concluded that the mitigated return period of a medium oil spill (up to 5,000 tonnes) during the marine transport component would be 350 years; that of a spill exceeding 5,000 cubic metres would be 550 years; that of a spill exceeding 20,000 cubic metres would be 2,800 years; and that of a spill exceeding 40,000 cubic metres would be 15,000 years. The Trans Mountain Expansion Project involves a pipeline and marine component that has operated for 63 years. The project, if approved, would result in an increase of tanker traffic from 60 to 400 tankers per year, in an area in which tanker traffic represents a small portion of the overall vessel traffic. The DNV report concluded that the increase in vessel traffic resulting from the project would have “a negligible effect on the total incident frequency for the region”. The report further concluded that the frequency of accidents resulting in an oil cargo spill of any size, assuming the adoption of risk-reducing measures recommended in the report, would be 237 years. The frequency of a worst-case oil spill (estimated to be 16,500 cubic metres), assuming risk-reducing measures are taken, would be one in every 2,366 years. The National Energy Board report recommended that a certificate be issued with 157 conditions, including the requirement that the marine risk reducing measures be taken. Opponents of oil pipeline construction that would lead to an increase in oil tanker traffic rarely base their arguments on an objective analysis of the risks of spills occurring, and they usually postulate the worst-case scenarios as though these were the most likely cases. This seriously undermines the quality of the public discussion and it tends to politicize decisions.  Canadians should be able to expect, and indeed they should demand, that decisions about new oil transportation projects be based upon the best evidence available and a cool-headed examination of Canada’s interests from economic, environmental and social perspectives. ~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'Energy East', 'Uncategorized']",2016/11/18

It posts its data online, and each year publishes a report on “key energy statistics”. The following, from the 2016 IEA report, are some notable statistics that call into question the theses that the countries of the world are dedicated to reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions and that wind and solar energy sources will soon replace coal, oil and natural gas. The world total primary energy supply by fuel rose steadily from about 6,100 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 1971 to about 13,700 Mtoe by 2014. In 2014, the shares of primary energy supply by energy source were: oil, 31.3%; coal, 28.8%; natural gas, 21.0 %; biofuels and waste, 10.3%; nuclear, 4.8%; hydro, 2.4%; and “other”, including all renewables energy sources, 1.4%. (Message: Fossil fuels now account for 81% of the world’s energy supply and renewables just over one per cent. That situation will not change soon, easily or cheaply.) In the OECD countries, total primary energy supply rose from 3,740 Mtoe in 1971 to 5,269 Mtoe in 2014. It actually peaked in 2005 and has declined slightly since then. (Message: Even in the OECD where the most significant and expensive measures have been taken since 1990 to reduce emissions, and in the wake of the most serious recession since the Great Depression, OECD primary energy supply has changed only slightly.) In 2015, the shares of OECD primary energy supply by energy source were: oil, 36.1%; natural gas, 26.0 %; coal, 18.0%; nuclear, 9.8%; biofuels and waste, 5.8%; hydro, 2.2%; and other, 2.1%. (Message: In spite of trillions of dollars spent subsidizing wind and solar generation around the world, it barely registers as a supply source.) Apart from a short dip from 1978 to 1982, world crude oil production has risen steadily from 2,869 million tonnes (Mt) in1971 to 4,331 Mt in 2014. (Message: We are not even close to “peak oil”.) The United States remained in 2014 the largest net oil importer in the world, importing 344 Mt a year. China was second, with 308 Mt, followed by India with 189 Mt, and Japan with 165 Mt. (Message: The U.S. still needs to develop its own oil supplies and rely on secure foreign sources like Canada.) Natural gas production has risen steadily from 1,224 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 1973 to 3,590 bcm in 2015. (Message: Natural gas is plentiful, reasonably cheap, and clean. It will be used.) World coal production grew significantly from 1971 until 2013, after which it began a slow decline. In 1973, the world produced 3,074 Mt and in 2015 it produced 7,709 Mt. (Message: Coal remains a tremendously important energy source despite the many efforts to vilify it.) India is the largest coal importer in the world, with 221 Mt in imports in 2015, followed by China with 199 Mt and Japan with 192 Mt. (Message: Regardless of the complaints of European and North American environmentalists, the Asian countries continue massively to rely upon cheap coal supplies to feed their economies.) The shares of world electricity generation by fuel in 2014 were: coal, 40.8%; natural gas, 21.8%; hydro, 16.4%; nuclear, 10.6%; other (geothermal, wind, solar, etc.) 6.3%; and oil, 4.3%. (Message: Coal is still king in world electricity production.) The 2014 ranking of countries that produce the most electricity from coal combustion is: China (4115 TWh); United States, 1,713 TWh; India (967 TWh); Japan 349 TWh; and Germany (285 TWh). (Message: Asia is leading the way on electricity production based on coal combustion, but even Germany, which has invested over a trillion dollars on wind and solar, is still committed to coal.) World total final consumption by fuel in 2014 was: oil, 39.9%; electricity 18.1%; natural gas, 15.1 %; biofuels and waste 12.2%; coal 11.4%; and other 3.3%. World oil consumption by sector in 2014 was divided as follows: transport, 64.5%; non-energy use, 16.2%; other (agriculture, commercial, residential, services) 11.3%; and industry 8.0%. (Message: No oil, no transportation. Also, oil is important to far more than transportation.) World carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion have risen steadily, aside from a very brief downturn after the 2007 financial crisis, from 15,458 Mt in 1973 to 32,381 Mt in 2014. (Message: Despite all the rhetoric, GHG emissions continue to rise steadily.) In 1973, the OECD accounted for 66.6% of global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion; by 2014, the OECD share had declined to 36.6%. (Message: All, or almost all, of the emissions growth is occurring outside of the OECD.) In 1973, Asia accounted for 8,7% of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion; by 2014, Asia’s share had increased to 40%. The IEA report can be found here:https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP-22', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/11/14

Many of thousands of others could not be at the rallies – they were out in the field harvesting the food that you and I rely on to eat.  But they were there in spirit and they will be signing the petition.Calgary banner at MacDougall Centre.Reported figures from Alberta Wide Rally are:“8-9,000 in attendance‎7-8000 signatures Hundreds of volunteers wanting to help with petition drive Next step for the “Alberta Wide Rally ” movement is to organize petition committees in every hamlet, village, town and city in the province.   We’re actively seeking volunteers.”  #gallery-7 { margin: auto; } #gallery-7 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-7 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-7 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */          Calgary rally attracted more than 800 people; protestor with signs.  #gallery-8 { margin: auto; } #gallery-8 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-8 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-8 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */          Lethbridge rally attracted 300 people.Video of phasing out coal electrical plants and replacing lost coal generation with ineffective and costly renewables  https://youtu.be/UI6ipel6qQkMost of the people at the rallies were concerned about energy policies.  The carbon tax sounds innocuous when described as ‘revenue neutral.’   It sounds to some like a benefit – when the government suggests the rebate will be substantial to those below a certain income level.  But few people appreciate the cumulative nature of this tax, which, as economist Ross McKitrick and others have pointed out, should only be applied if other taxes are relieved. Further, how can the tax be described as ‘revenue neutral’ when most of the tax will be paid out as subsidies and for transit expansion, both of which are expenditures, not tax reductions?  It is not ‘revenue neutral’.  The carbon tax is a vehicle to subsidize crony ‘green’ capitalists for building solar and wind farms to produce intermittent, costly power, or will be used for other pet government projects.Likewise, the “Social Costs of Carbon” – the term used to describe the carbon tax, is based on skewed accounting.  Environmental groups claim that a number of catastrophic climate events are on the rise, but the evidence does not show that. The one economic climate change accounting model that uses an actual cost-benefit analysis shows there is significant financial and societal benefit from the use of coal, natural gas and oil – and little irreparable damage.Business and government policies are decided based on evidence-based cost-benefit analysis. Why are climate policies and carbon taxes based on predicted costs and crystal ball projections by doomsday ‘climateers’ seeking donations from you to ‘stop climate change’ or ‘global warming’ …that mostly happens naturally; with nominal human impact.https://judithcurry.com/2014/01/16/senate-epw-hearing-on-the-presidents-climate-action-plan/In fact, there has been no increase in hurricanes, tornadoes or droughts over the last 35 years and warming makes storms less severe. Increasing CO2 has caused a greening of the earth equivalent to adding a green continent twice the size of the continental USA.http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth/Claims that global warming causes more wildfires is also not supported by the evidence. The Flat Top Fire Complex Review of the Slave Lake wildfire showed that Alberta’s tinder dry, aging conifers put us at a cyclical risk of fire. Last year’s mild winter and natural El Nino and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (two natural, powerful weather forcings) led to extremely dry conditions in May.  Compare the maps below.  These naturally occurring factors will not be stopped by carbon taxes.May 4, 2016 fire danger map.Map of 30 year mean for fire danger conditions May 1961-2010.June 12, 2016 fire danger map shows the situation after spring rains.May wildfires are common in Alberta during the gap between snow-melt and spring rain.Earth has naturally warmed in the past – a few times. An example is the Medieval Warm Period (850-1250) when civilization flourished as harvests were bountiful and as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, temperatures were about the same as today. That warm time was followed by a naturally caused Little Ice Age, a 500-year cooling cycle, fraught with wild, unpredictable weather, crop failures, famine, social chaos and where thousands of people, deemed to be witches, were burned at the stake for the alleged crime of ‘weather cooking.’ Dr. Sallie Baliunas on “Weather Cooking” https://youtu.be/wcAy4sOcS5M Australia had a carbon tax – after a couple of years, that government went down to defeat and the carbon tax was repealed.  The UK and EU have carbon taxes and have added subsidized wind and solar farms to the grid while phasing out coal.  Now millions suffer in heat-or-eat poverty – a growing problem in Ontario.None of the climate change measures in the world have reduced carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions.  Heavy industry has just moved offshore to places with fewer environmental controls and carbon traders have had a field day.  Interpol’s guide-to-carbon-trading-crime reports sometimes emissions are upped, just to make more money.In a 2007 Baker Mackenzie power point on how to make money using Certified Emissions Reduction credits shows that the World Bank and a private fund made $1.2 billion 23 minutes trading carbon from Chinese factory pollution.  No wonder no one wants to reduce emissions in China – the dream of turning dross to gold has come true – to earth’s detriment.Also good background – Conning the Climate: http://citizensclimatelobby.org/files/Conning-the-Climate.pdf Ordinary people get poor from the carbon taxes and paying wind/solar subsidies, while institutional investors, who are deeply invested in wind, solar and clean-tech (despite clean-tech being called an “L-for-Loser” investment by the past chief investment officer of CalPERS), can profit from 20 year contracts that take subsidies from your pocket for little electrical power in return.“According to Mr. Dear, a Calpers fund devoted to clean energy and technology which started in 2007 with $460 million has an annualized return of minus 9.7% to date….[ he said] “What’s going to make these markets really take off is if the price of alternative energy drops below the price of a carbon-energy equivalent. You will no longer need incentives or anything else….If that’s not going to happen, somebody has to step in and either raise the price of carbon or lower the cost of the alternatives.”http:// www. wsj. com/articles/SB10001424127887324557804578374980641257340Indeed, in Alberta, one can see in 107-submission_nei-investments_-investor-collaboration_signatories to the Alberta Climate Plan signed by 120 institutional investors, some of whom financed environmental groups to denigrate the oil sands and coal use, are directing government policy, over the desires of the Alberta electorate.https://www.neiinvestments.com/documents/Marketing/Transitioning%20to%20a%20Low-carbon%20Energy%20System.pdfThey don’t live here. They won’t have to pay. They won’t face the risk of blackouts as Alberta loses affordable, reliable power capacity from coal.

Jean Charest, who was at that time acting on behalf of the Energy East pipeline proponent, was said to have potentially compromised the integrity of the process.If this is the expectation of integrity nationally for Canadians, how much higher must we hold the process of setting international targets for climate change actions; how much greater the need for clarity on the science and avoidance of conflicts of interest or politics?Commercial Conflicts of Interest Must be ChallengedWe ask that you consider that World Resources Institute of the United States claims on its web-site that it helped three-quarters of the countries participating at Paris, to set their Indicated Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). We are concerned to find that on the website of Generation Investment Management, a company part-owned by Mr. Al Gore (star of the error-ridden  video “An Inconvenient Truth” and the most prominent promoter of the theory of Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming and carbon trading), there is a stated ‘global collaboration’ with World Resources Institute, Natural Resource Defence Council, The Climate Reality Project, Mistra Foundation, and Global Impact Investing Network.Since 2007, a group of American foundations banded together as “ClimateWorks” and have actively funded numerous Canadian ENGOs and some of the foregoing groups with the intent of shifting energy policies.Design to Win http://www.climateworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/design_to_win_final_8_31_07.pdf  Natural Resource Defense Council has begun demonizing the Energy East pipeline, which, unlike Keystone XL which was slated to cross US territory, is wholly in Canada.  We find on an NRDC blog post that the NRDC present the ‘dirty tar sands’ image, contrasted by the ‘white and clean and free’ image of a wind farm.[1] In one post, the headline reads “Tar Sands in the Atlantic Ocean” – as if tankers of American-owned and other foreign oil are not running up and down both coasts and up the St. Lawrence to Montreal refineries every day.[2]  How will any wind turbines be built if coal, natural gas and oil are not used? This is impossible.Yet even many of our own leaders express a mistaken and indeed even mythological point of view that there is an ‘alternative’ of some kind to ‘dirty’ energy[3] – advocating for ‘clean’ energy like wind and solar which are entirely made from ‘dirty’ energy and backstopped and maintained with…conventional oil, natural gas and coal.Far from ‘dirty,’ fossil fuels have freed society from the perils of unsanitary conditions, provided the power for modern medical care, liberated people in the West from hard labour and abject poverty, given each of us the automated equivalent of dozens of servants, and allowed us to explore the outer reaches of space and the depths of the ocean.Without oil, natural gas and coal, modern society would descend into chaos within days.[4] In fact, the most wasteful and unsustainable energy forms are wind[5] and solar.  Prof. Kelly of Cambridge calls a continued focus on these energy forms a form of ‘total madness’ that does not address climate change or the needs of a modern society.[6] We ask you to review our report “Why Renewable Energy Cannot Replace Fossil Fuels by 2050.” [7]Canada’s, and Alberta’s environmental standards are some of the highest in the world and we have substantially improved air and water quality here, as evident on www.yourenvironment.caCall Out the Cloaked-in-Green Trade War Against CanadaCanadian resources are under siege. A simple way to see this is via two maps. This first map shows where the most oil reserves are in the world.  The second identifies the actual location. As you can see on the second map, it is simple to keep Canadian oil and gas off world markets by blocking pipeline access in all directions. This has been done by co-opting many First Nations communities through activist sessions such as the International Funders of Indigenous Peoples conferences.[8]  In their 2010 report, it is clearly stated that such groups intend to collaborate with ENGOs at home and offshore to block resource development.  Indeed, in the IFIP document, the stated modus operandi is to ‘create so much conflict the government had to do something’. We ask you to review our economic study by energy economist and former public servant, Robert Lyman, on the “math” related to the previous 2 degree Celsius target set by the previous government. The implications of achieving that target would be the destruction of the Canadian economy. [9]  Our economy would be reduced to that of Chad, with its GDP per person of US$1,000!Current Climate Catastrophe Fears Driven by Crony Capitalists, Social Media, and ENGO Agendas, Not ScienceIn the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group I Physical Sciences Technical Summary, the “Key Uncertainties” (pg. 114, 115) make it clear that the IPCC experts scientists themselves say that they do not have enough data to make confident predictions.The claims of ‘imminent catastrophe’ have mostly been driven by Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations who find this a helpful method of fund-raising and activism. At the LIMA COP-20 conference, NGOs with their vast social media networks of followers and advocates outnumbered scientists three to one! [10]Some of these groups have been funded by ‘crony capitalist’ renewables investors.[11]  At least one such group of investors boasts it has influenced Canadian and Albertan energy policies[12] – outside the needs, wishes and best interests of Canadians.We ask you to stop this anti-Canadian trade war and the abuse of our charitable tax laws by various ENGOs who are presenting a biased and deeply flawed story on energy use and who use tax dollars to block taxpaying jobs and industry.In Alberta, such foreign funding has supported efforts to demonize coal-fired power plants with misinformation on alleged coal-health risks and deaths based on computer models. These computer simulated health problems are not supported by the evidence of Alberta Health Services actual health statistics.[13]Only a Strong Economy can Help Aboriginal People Move ForwardThe cry of “No pipelines. No tankers. No problem.” as witnessed during the recent Royal Visit is patently false.  As described in Calvin Helin’s book “Dances with Dependency” Canada faces a tsunami of aboriginal financial obligations as the baby boomer generation with its large tax-contributing base passes on, leaving a growing youth aboriginal population.  Canada needs employment opportunities and income from access to world markets to have the financial resources to help resolve long-standing issues on the aboriginal front. However, we find foreign groups like the International Funders of Indigenous People[14] are pursuing a strategy of ‘divide and conquer’ – or leading First Nations people on with claims of generating funds through non-development as a ‘carbon sink.’  This approach may make carbon traders rich, but it won’t offer First Nations people skills, education or new work markets.By contrast, in Alberta, the oil and gas industry has funded mobile training units and worked with NAIT to teach hundreds of young aboriginal people practical trade skills like welding, electrician, carpentry etc., taking the training to First Nation reserves with great success.[15]Regarding proposed coal phase-out Coal is universally recognized as the most affordable form of power generation; in Alberta, our coal use is led by modern emissions management and high-efficiency technology, some of the most advanced in North America. Where hydro is king in many provinces, in Alberta it is coal – we have little hydro that would be accessible without significantly disturbing key natural environments (and at burdensome cost to the public). In a cold country, affordable, reliable power should be a human right.  Coal is being demonized by foreign market competitors via funded campaigns by ENGOs who are acting as proxies for wind and solar as ‘clean’ when as noted above, these energy sources are not. There is little environmental benefit of switching from modern coal operations to wind and solar backed up by natural gas.[16]The demonizing claims against coal alleging negative health impacts claims are not supported by evidence. [17] The original Canadian federal coal phase-out legislation was intended to take older more emissions-intense plants offline while driving innovation for new plants and the development of clean coal technology. It was not to stop coal use entirely.  It was intended to be a money-maker for Canada. Indeed, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan is employing advanced emissions mitigation and recycling technology, where the captured nitrogen and sulfur can be recycled into useful fertilizer.Cost of health care in Canada Funding today’s modern health care is deeply reliant on affordable electrical power and to support growing needs, we must have a strong economy.Thus, with our aging boomers and growing health care demands, it is incumbent upon all of you to ensure that we have affordable, reliable power.  We cannot get to the point, like the UK, where heat-or-eat poverty is increasing health problems and where the power grid has no spare capacity.  Hospitals may have diesel generators (far more polluting than any other ground level hydrocarbon) but these are intended for short term power disruptions, not long term power crises.  We ask the federal government and our Canadian ministerial colleagues to appreciate that the reason Alberta uses a lot of coal is that we have a lot of high-quality coal and high efficiency power plants equipped with filters such that they emit only one-thousandth of the particulate emissions of forest fires in Alberta.  If we want to maintain or reduce health costs, the cost of power is a factor – both in individual patient health and in health services delivery, as well as in the country’s general economic health which pays for the system.COP-21, Marshall Islands and 1.5 degree Celsius “challenge”When the Hon. Catherine McKenna returned from Paris, Canadians were told there was some urgency to do the Paris deal because the lives of people in the Marshall Islands were at risk due to sea level rise.  If anything, these tiny islands are growing. Aerial and satellite images show that the Marshall Islands are growing in area. A paper reports “Between 1976 and 2006, 73 of 87 islands [Jaluit Atoll, Marshall Islands] increased in size.”[18]  We should look at the evidence over the ideology before destroying the Canadian economy based on inaccurate (but emotionally compelling) claims.In 2015, Canada sent some 383 people to COP-21. Rather than fight for our country, it appears that this large delegation gave in to foreign demands upon us.In reviewing the comments of IPCC philosopher John Broome,[19] it is probably better for us to send 383 delegates to the next IPCC Summary for Policy Maker writing session.  It seems that the large Saudi Arabia delegation present at the last event was quite effective because we do not see or hear of any sanctions, threats, caps, or constraints on Saudi Arabian oil production.Thus, we question whether we are applying our people’s talents in the right places.Considering the costs and significant GHG emissions related to travel (for which the guilt-reducing and costly purchase of so-called “offsets” does absolutely nothing), we look forward to the Canadian delegation communicating to the upcoming Marrakech COP-22 event by Skype, facebook or Google. On the Science: The Sun is the major direct and indirect driver of climate change Some 400 years of observations, along with space-era data show that the sun’s cycles and orbital patterns of planets have dramatic effects on the earth’s atmosphere, geomagnetism, ocean currents, tides, and changing temperature cycles. It is folly to think that human efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a miniscule amount will ‘stop climate change’ – though there is much we can do to continue to reduce harmful pollutants like mercury, NOx and SOx.In SummaryWe have pointed out several concerns related to conflicts of interest, geopolitical trade warfare and commercial interests, likely responsible for blocking economic freedom and development in this country.We do agree that real pollution should be taken seriously and that humans have some effect on climate change – yet, as Richard Tol, lead author of the IPCC Working Group II report states:“..a century of climate change is not worse than losing a decade of economic growth.”We expect you, our leaders, to stand up for our people and our industries in this global trade war and to not be fooled by naïve, simplistic or catastrophic claims on climate driven by crony capitalists or their openly and clandestinely funded ENGO echo chambers.Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETYAbout UsWe are Informed Experts – We represent a group of some ~400 people, over half of them Canadians and most are experts in earth, atmospheric, and solar sciences, professional engineers, economic advisors, business people, along with many concerned and well-informed citizens.  We have studied the science and issues since 2002 when we formed to counter the Kyoto Accord, which we saw as scientifically unfounded and economically disastrous, especially for Canada.  We ask you to act in the interests of the Canadian public.[1] https://www.nrdc.org/experts/josh-axelrod/another-unpopular-pipeline-canadians-prefer-protecting-climate-over-building[2] https://www.nrdc.org/resources/tar-sands-atlantic-ocean-transcanadas-proposed-energy-east-pipeline[3] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/30/no-long-term-future-in-tar-sands-alberta-rachel-notley?CMP=share_btn_fb[4] https://achemistinlangley.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/the-husky-oil-spill-its-effects-on-the-pipeline-debate-and-a-thought-experiment-about-a-world-without-fossil-fuels/[5] https://www.masterresource.org/windpower-problems/wind-power-least-sustainable-resource/[6] http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10333234&fulltextType=RV&fileId=S2329222916000039[7] https://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/why-renewable-energy-cannot-replace-fossil-fuels-by-2050/[8] http://internationalfunders.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IFIPConferenceReport2010.pdf[9] https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/climate_change_implications_Lyman.pdf[10] i.e. Suzuki Foundation ad campaign “Where will Santa Live?” suggesting that this children’s favorite will drown because of human-caused global warming.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/10/23/china-india-and-cop21/,Jeffery Green ,"CHINA, INDIA AND COP21"," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2016Robert Lyman is an energy economist and  formerly a public servant for 27 years and a diplomat for a decade.In December 2015, at the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Changes in Paris (COP21), the parties reached agreement on the desirability of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous global warming. Subject to ratification by the parties, it will be legally binding. However, it will not legally bind the signatories to specific emission reduction limits either at the global or national levels. It will bind them instead to respect an aspirational goal of holding the increase in the average global temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It also will bind them to submit “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDC) to emissions reduction and to update these plans every five years. The world media has devoted very little attention to the remarkable difference in the commitments outlined in the agreement between the developed and developing countries. Article 2(2) of the agreement provides that: “This Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, in the light of different national circumstances.” This statement is based on the principle that has emerged from 21 years of climate change discussions that responsibility, both for historical emissions and for reducing emissions now, should be placed on the developed countries as a matter of “climate justice”.  Article 4(7) of the Agreement adds a proviso that makes clear the benefit intended for developing countries: “The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention …will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties.” The major industrializing developing countries, such as China and India, are classed as developing countries and thus exempted from the costs of emissions reductions placed on developed countries like Canada. This differentiation is reflected in the INDCs that were submitted by China and India before COP21 and in bilateral agreements that they subsequently signed with the Obama Administration in the United States. China is already the largest emitter of GHGs in the world. In its INDC, it made no commitment to reduce emissions. Rather, it promised to aim at a target of peaking its GHG emissions by 2030 at the latest, and to lower the carbon intensity of its GDP by 60 to 65% below 2005 levels by 2030. It also agreed to increase the share of non-fossil primary energy supply (i.e. nuclear, hydro and other renewables) to around 20% by that time. Different estimates have been published as to the levels of Chinese emissions by 2030. Climate Action Tracker, a private source, projects that China’s emissions will be between 13.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) and 16.9 GtCO2e by 2030. According to the International Energy Agency, by 2030 China’s emissions will be two and a half times those of the United States. Those emissions will continue to grow after 2030. India is now the third largest GHG emitter, after China and the U.S. In its INDC, India also made no commitment to reduce emissions. Instead, like China, it cast its commitments in terms of lowering the emissions intensity of GDP, in this case by 33% to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030. India also promised to increase its share of non-fossil based power generation to 40% of capacity by 2030. Climate Action Tracker projects that the policies India is adopting will increase emissions to 3.6 GtCO2e in 2020 and 5.4 to 5.5 GtCO2e by 2030. This would mean a doubling of GHG emissions from 2010 levels by 2030. By then, India’s emissions would match or exceed those of the United States. The countries of Southeast Asia are not far behind, according to a recent Special Report by the International Energy Agency. Russia also indicated that its emissions will continue to grow for at least the next 15 years. In fact, it is far from clear that even these commitments will be met. Representatives of developing countries, and especially India, have said that their ability and willingness to reduce emissions intensity will depend heavily on the developed countries honouring their promises to build up a Green Climate Fund. The Green Climate Fund, established initially at a level of $100 billion per year, is supposed to rise with time and come from contributions over and above existing foreign aid levels. The citizens of developed countries, already coping with the additional costs of carbon taxes will be asked to pay increased income taxes to pay for the Green Climate Fund. In the name of “climate justice”, China, India, and other developing countries will increase GHG emissions to 2030 and beyond, increasing the global level, while citizens in developed countries like Canada incur the financial burden. The environmental benefit, if any, which will result from this is unclear. For how long will the people in the developed countries see justice in that?***Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'COP21', 'green climate fund', 'Uncategorized']",2016/10/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/10/20/albertas-first-climate-leadership-plan-was-established-in-2002/,,Alberta’s First Climate Leadership Plan was Established in 2002," “The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.” ― George OrwellPremier Notley said in her “State of the Province” address on Oct. 19, 2016, that “On few files was our province more poorly served than by elected officials, from this province, who claimed – with a straight face – that there was no need to act decisively or effectively on climate change.”It seems the Premier is unaware of the 2002 “Albertans and Climate Change: Taking Action” or the 2008 Alberta government report “Moving Forward” [LINK: 8066-albertans-and-climate-change-moving-forward ] that records the many ‘firsts’ and leadership shown by the previous Progressive Conservative administration of Alberta on climate change and pollution reduction.Though the Premier went on to claim: “This failure to attend to the fundamental strategic interests of Alberta is a key reason why we remain landlocked today, despite ten years of promises that the issue was going to be addressed effectively.”In fact, as reported by Vivian Krause and others like CounterPunch, Alberta has been the target of a nasty smear campaign by numerous foreign-funded activist groups which appear to be acting as proxies for competing oil/gas/resource exporting nations or on behalf of wind and solar commercial interests, as reportedly has occurred with the Sierra Club in the United States.Indeed, in Canada, in 2005, the Sierra Club gave Alberta an F while giving Ontario a B+Ontario aggressively began wind and solar development on the advice of environmental groups who claimed that phasing out coal and going to wind and solar would be cheaper and cleaner.  As reported by Terence Corcoran the same day as Premier Notley’s speech (with the Premier touting wind and solar and declaring that coal will be phased out in Alberta) the Kingston solar project provides little power for a lot of costs – some 42 cents per kilowatt hour.Alberta’s coal-fired power costs about 2 cents per kilowatt hour at the gate.Wind and solar can never compete with the low cost and reliability of coal, so demarketing of coal through demonizing it is a key strategy in implementing wind and solar, which effectively means the power system relies on the typically more expensive, volatile market-priced, natural gas. The “Moving Forward” report also documents the many energy efficiency programs that were in place at the time, disputing the Premier’s claim that no such programs had previously been in place in Alberta. These included a furnace rebate program, “Soak up the Savings” – to replace old washer/dryers with more energy efficient models, “Exit to Savings” – to replace multi-residence exit lights with LEDs, OnFarm Energy Efficiency audit, the ME First $30 million municipal efficiency interest-free loan program, Hail a Hybrid for taxi companies, Reduce Idling campaign, Car Heaven – to get old polluting cars off the road, and the adoption of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard for all government buildings, the adoption of “Go Green” national certification of the Building Owners and Management Association (BOMA) for all government buildings.Failure to address the trade war conducted against Alberta and Canada by foreign-funded “environmental” activists cloaked in green, while ideologically pursuing the adoption of large-scale wind and solar in Alberta, along with rapid coal phase-out, will, in our opinion, lead to DIRE CONSEQUENCES.Depending on the approvals and development of new natural gas capacity, Alberta could soon see a lack of power capacity as old coal plants close early when the carbon tax makes them unprofitable.  The outcome could be like that of the UK – rolling blackouts, ineffective stop-gap measures, and wide-spread heat-or-eat poverty.The claim for “Climate Change Action” is often based on the alleged sole authority of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but the Non-governmental Panel on Climate Change reports are equally authoritative on the science, far less politicized and exhibit a thoughtful review of the evidence. Findings include:The “Physical Science” report finds that negative feedbacks in the climate system reduce the  model-derived temperature sensitivity to values an order of magnitude smaller. Earth’s surface temperatures are largely driven by variations in solar activity, which may have contributed as much as 66% of the observed 20th-century warming.The “Biological Impacts” report finds that rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels are causing “no net harm to the global environment or to human health and often finds the opposite: net benefits to plants, including important food crops, and to animals and human health.”Further, the activists who claim they will grant ‘social license’ for pipelines and LNG processing facilities if we just comply with ‘going green’ (such green-energy policies shown to be a failure in Europe) have historically demonstrated that they just want ‘more’ – no matter how much progress is achieved.  The ‘state of the province’ and the nation is being devastated by these fifth columns.  When will someone in authority address this issue?Contributed by Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager of Friends of Science Society.  Stirling worked at Alberta Environment in 2005 when the Sierra Club awarded Alberta an F for failing grade.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Alberta', 'climate change', 'COP21', 'Energy East', 'solar energy', 'Uncategorized']",2016/10/20

BalgordReprinted with permission Richmond (VA) Times-DispatchThe Union of Concerned Scientists, a not-for-profit advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass., recently issued a report that drew immediate response from news outlets. UCS projects 17 U.S. military facilities, including Norfolk Naval Base, will have to deal with frequent flooding events from rising seas by the year 2050, and suggests the bases may be awash in 2100.Dire predictions are based on model projections suggesting a future atmospheric temperature rise of 2 degrees or more accompanied by partial melting of the massive glaciers that cover Greenland and Antarctica. But climate models, not yet validated, deserve criticism because of poor correlation between increasing CO2 and a global temperature that has not risen in close conformity with model predictions. Absent global temperature increases, significant melting of either polar icecap would not occur.Warming oceans contribute to rising sea level, since volume expands as upper ocean layers warm. For several thousand years sea levels have risen at a rate of about 7 inches per century, with a dip during the Little Ice Age. Reports of accelerating sea level rise (SLR) may be attributed to a switch in instrumentation (tidal gauges to satellite measurements).Shifting weather patterns and changes in ocean-atmospheric circulation such the El Nino/La Nina events in the equatorial Pacific are also responsible for short-lived changes. A five-inch rise projected from historic trends would be entirely manageable for the DOD. The Dutch have battled a rising North Sea for centuries.UCS’ report does not properly refer to on-shore tide gauge measurements as Relative Sea Level (RSL). RSL reflects average sea level of the nearby open ocean as measured at the shoreline referenced to a permanent stationary structure usually located in a harbor.Relative Sea Level Rise (RSLR) is phenomenon whereby sea level appears to rise if either or both the ocean rises or the land settles. The latter is called “subsidence.” To determine what contributes to observed changes requires detailed analysis of coastal features aided with satellite altimetry. RSLR determines the increased risk of flooding during spring tides and more dramatically from tidal surges accompanying hurricanes or tsunami.Norfolk Naval Base is located near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, an embayment encompassing the drowned river valleys of the James, Potomac, and Susquehanna Rivers (and tributaries). It is a prime example of land undergoing subsidence accompanying the relaxation of the forced downward tilt of the North American tectonic plate now returning to its position before the previous glacial age.Subsidence along the bay’s perimeter is proceeding at a rate of half an inch to as much as two inches per decade. Research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science also concluded somewhat more than half the RSLR observed from 1976 to 2007 resulted from subsidence.Increasing sea levels projected by UCS depend on an appreciably accelerated melting of polar ice and thermal expansion of the oceans, not yet observed in the 21st Century. Consistent departures of actual temperatures from EPA model projections raise further questions and relegate predictions of future ice melt and ocean expansion to the status of speculation.Many experts had predicted sea ice in the Arctic Ocean would melt completely by 2008. Yet the ice remains in late summer. Although fluctuating somewhat year to year, it does not show indications of disappearing. The Arctic Ocean refreezes each winter.Sea ice surrounding Antarctica has been expanding for nearly two decades despite earlier predictions to the contrary. It is generally agreed that for melting of landed ice to proceed, contributing to SLR, Arctic sea ice and that ringing Antarctica would need to disappear. The extent of sea ice, although not affecting sea level directly, is considered a bellwether for potential melting of the icecaps.Perceived threats posed by rising oceans to U.S. bases in 2050 hinge on climate models that have not been validated. The threats remain speculative. And with CO2 sensitivity revised down one degree Celsius for a doubling of CO2, there is reasonable doubt that warming this century would induce sufficient melting or enough thermal expansion to fulfill USC’ predictions.Yet subsidence causes problems wherever coastal lands are sinking, whether in Norfolk, New Orleans or Venice, and will proceed independently of any global warming alleged from the combustion of fossil fuels.The Department of Defense is advised to plan accordingly.William D.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/10/14/energy-payback-from-solar-pv-systems-in-northern-countries/,Massimo Ippolito ,ENERGY PAYBACK FROM SOLAR PV SYSTEMS IN NORTHERN COUNTRIES," Contributed by Robert Lyman ©2016Many people believe that renewable energy sources will be able to substitute for fossil fuels or nuclear energy to meet the needs of modern economies in future. There exist, however, very few scientifically sound studies that substantiate this impression. In a paper published in the journal Energy Policy in October 2016, Ferruccio Ferroni and Robert Hopkirk examine the case of photovoltaic (PV) power sources in Germany and Switzerland, areas of moderate insolation (the amount of solar radiation that reaches the earth’s surface) by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROI). Their findings are relevant to the use of PV systems in countries like Canada. The paper draws upon an analysis published in 2013 by Dale and Benson of 28 published reports on different PV installations using one of the currently available technologies. Dale and Benson found widely divergent energy demands required by these technologies.  The cumulative energy demands range from a minimum of 300 kWh per square meter of module area to a maximum of 2000 kWh per square meter. This is an indication that the reports were not using the same criteria in determining the boundaries of the PV system (i.e. the sources of energy demand associated with the construction and operation of the system). According to official Swiss energy statistics (Swiss Federal Office of Energy, 2015), the average electricity production per square meter of PV module in Switzerland for the last 10 years was 106 kWh per square meter per year. While vendors of PV modules quote a lifetime of 30 years, the average lifetime of the modules has been about 17 years. On average, efficiency and hence performance degradations have occurred at the rate of about 1% per year. Assuming, however, that the modules operate for a life of 25 years, Ferroni and Hopkirk estimate the total energy returned over plant lifetime to be 88.1 times 25, or 2203 kWh per square meter. The energy produced varies considerably by time of day and season. In Germany, the PV module produces during winter at its peak power for the equivalent of only 1.7 hours per day on average; in the summer period, it produces for only 3.3 hours per day. Due to the intermittent nature of the electricity production, a parallel electricity supply infrastructure has to be provided. Ferroni and Hopkirk examine the energy costs of the PV modules in terms of the material, labour, capital and energy required to supply them. The average weight of a PV module is 16 kg per square meter and the weight of the support system, inverter and balance of the system is at least 25 kg per square meter (not including the weight of the concrete). The components are mainly steel, aluminum and copper. In addition, production requires the use of 3.5 kg of concentrated hydrochloric acid. PV systems are also quite labour and capital intensive. In calculating the EROI, Ferroni and Hopkirk depart from the methodology used by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA’s methodology is based on information provided by companies in the photovoltaic industry and, in their view, is more suitable for comparing different PV technologies than for determining the efficiency and sustainability of the PV system as an energy source. Ferroni and Hopkirk list a number of other deficiencies of the IEA approach. Other experts, who use the IEA guidelines, found the EROI of PV system to range from 4.95 to 5.9. Ferroni and Hopkirk use an “extended” definition of EROI based on the work of the ecologist Howard Odum. In Odum’s book, “Environmental Accounting: Energy and Environmental Decision Accounting” (1995), he showed that, considering the energy integrated in the construction, operation and decommissioning of a PV system, no “net energy” is obtained. The total energy required to produce a PV system and integrate it into the grid, plus that invested for the labour, capital and energy to build and operate the module totaled 2662 kWh per square meter. The energy returned per square meter of module is 2203 kWh and the energy invested is 2662 Kwh, for a ratio of 0.82. Ferroni and Hopkirk estimate these numbers to have a possible error of plus or minus 15%. In other words, an electricity supply system based on today’s PV technologies cannot be termed an energy source, but rather “a non-sustainable energy sink or a non-sustainable energy net loss”. To read the main references to this summary, see here: https://collapseofindustrialcivilization.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ferroni-y-hopkirk-2016-energy-return-on-energy-invested-eroei-for-photo.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23441588Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'solar energy', 'Uncategorized', 'war on climate']",2016/10/14
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/10/07/carbon-tax-redundancy/,,CARBON TAX REDUNDANCY," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2016Ross McKitrick, professor of economics at the University of Guelph and research chair at the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, has studied and published articles concerning carbon pricing for over 20 years. He recently wrote a paper for the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy called A Practical Guide to the Economics of Carbon Pricing, in which he set out a few concepts that are well known in the academic literature but are largely overlooked in the public and political discussion.In recent articles published in the Financial Post, he summarized some key messages from his Guide, which the following quotes indicate:“First and foremost, carbon taxes are meant to be used instead of, not on top of, traditional regulations. Since Canada has a slew of greenhouse gas regulations, they must be removed before introducing a carbon tax. Otherwise, there is nothing in economic theory that says the carbon tax will remove the inefficiencies of the regulations. It will just increase their costs.The existing Canadian policy framework includes a host of command-and-control regulations that have imposed carbon dioxide abatement at far more than any reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax rate. The economic efficiency of a carbon tax comes not from setting a floor price, but a ceiling price. Policies like the federal biofuels mandate, energy conservation programs, renewables subsidies and coal phase-out rules might reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but they do so at marginal costs of hundreds of dollars per tonne. Adding a carbon tax on top of that does nothing to make the overall policy mix more efficient. But replacing those policies with a carbon tax would. In the process, it might also lead to higher carbon dioxide emissions, something that promoters of carbon pricing need to be upfront about.”If I may supplement professor McKitrick’s message for a non-economist reader, when he writes about “inefficiencies”, he is describing actions that, in economic terms, reduce the efficient allocation of resources in society. In everyday language, these government programs and regulations waste taxpayers’ money and make all of us poorer.When he referred to a “slew” of greenhouse gas regulations and a “host” of command and control measures, he was scratching the surface. There is not in Canada a comprehensive list of the policies, programs, and regulations that have been implemented by the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These programs and regulations have been building in number, reach and cost since climate change became a noticeable public policy issue in 1988. Today, there are huge bureaucracies established to design, implement, and (less frequently) evaluate these programs and regulations. They stretch like the tentacles of some vast octopus across every aspect of the Canadian economy and touch everyone’s life. As no one has ever established an inventory of the measures now in place or of those under consideration, no one knows how much these measures already cost Canadians. Two things are certain – they cost billions of dollars annually, and they are not going away soon, regardless of the taxes imposed on carbon.To illustrate, here is a partial list of the measures that have already been implemented or are now being contemplated by the federal and provincial governments.Electricity Generation Imposition of caps on GHG emissions from coal-fired power plantsRatepayer subsidies (e.g. feed-in-tariffs) to solar, industrial wind and biomass plantsIntroduction of time-of-use rates to raise electricity costs when demand is highestFunding of carbon capture and storage in coal-burning power plantsRemoving regulatory scrutiny over the land use, environmental and consumer cost impacts of renewable energy generation plants (Ontario)TransportationRaising fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucksIntroducing fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks and commercial vehiclesSubsidizing the production of ethanol and other biofuels research, development, production and manufacturingExempting biofuels from excise taxesImposing renewable fuel standards for gasoline and diesel fuel contentMunicipal preferences for the purchase of biodiesel and electric buses costing three times as much as diesel busesHuge subsidies (up to $14,000 per vehicle in Ontario) for the purchase of electric vehiclesEstablishing province-wide targets for vehicle manufacturers to sell electric and hydrogen vehicles by 2020Taxpayer subsidies for electric vehicle recharging stationsRequiring municipalities to add more cycling lanes at the expense of vehicle lanesTaxpayer subsidies for the replacement of older vehiclesRequiring all new homes and townhouses with garages to be constructed with a 50-amp, 240-volt receptacle (plug) in the garage (Ontario)Taxpayer subsidies to businesses that use alternative-fuel vehiclesBuildingsIntroducing much tougher (and more expensive) requirements for fuel efficiency in building codesEver-more-stringent regulations concerning the energy efficiency of appliances, ranging from dishwashers and clothes dryers to lawn mowersMuch increased taxpayer funding of energy efficiency in social housingProviding taxpayer subsidies for apartment building energy retrofitsMuch increased taxpayer funding for energy retrofits in all public buildings, including offices, schools, hospitals, and museums as well as privately-owned heritage buildingsTaxpayer funding of energy audits for pre-sale homesForcing the retirement of existing wood stoves and wood-burning fireplacesEstablishing a “low-carbon content” standard for natural gasBanning the use of natural gas furnaces (proposed)Much more restrictive land use planning to force development into denser patterns and integrating climate change as a priority consideration in land use planningIndustryIndustrial targets for energy efficiency improvementsTaxpayer subsidies for the use of renewable energy and high efficiency technologiesEstablishment of “service standards for the use of alternative fuels in energy intensive industriesTaxpayer subsidies for retro-fitting of agri-food industry low-carbon technologies and companies engaged in food and beverage productionTaxpayer subsidies to First Nations communities, including large taxpayer and ratepayer subsidies to build electricity transmission lines to small, remote aboriginal communitiesR&D tax credits for high efficiency and low-carbon technologiesAccelerated capital cost allowances for investment in high efficiency or low-carbon capital improvementsAlmost every one of these measures has a large budget and a supporting bureaucracy.Many programs or regulatory measures are of a type funded by two or three levels of government in a duplicative and uncoordinated way. There is no federal-provincial-territorial committee to ensure coordination and avoidance of duplication. Governments at all levels are falling all over themselves to be “green” with no agreement on what should be addressed at which level of government or common standards as to which measures are most effective.The failure of the federal government to coordinate and to develop a strategic approach to coordinated management of climate change regulations and programs has been documented several times – specifically, in the audits of the Commissioner on the Environment and Sustainable Development (a branch of the federal Auditor General agency) in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006, 2011 and 2012. As stated in the most recent (2012) report:“The federal government has not created effective governance structures for managing climate change activities designed to meet greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Our reports identified weaknesses in horizontal governance, accountability, and coordination.” “Environment Canada has no overall implementation plan that indicates how different regulations and federal departments and agencies will work together to achieve the reductions required to meet the 2020 target. The Department has not provided an estimate of the emission reductions expected from each sector or a general description of the regulations needed in each of the described sectors. The regulatory approach does not identify which specific industries within each economic sector the regulations will target, or how these regulations will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” With respect to the long list of federal programs and regulations, the Commissioner found that Environment Canada had failed to exercise responsibility with respect to determining the cost of the measures.“Environment Canada does not know how much the regulatory approach will cost the Canadian economy… Environment Canada has not conducted a comprehensive analysis to estimate the combined cost of the sector-by-sector approach to regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Nor has it estimated the impact on or costs to the Canadian economy of aligning its approach with the United States, or examined whether this is the most cost-effective option. These analyses are important in order to establish whether Canada faces proportionately higher costs than the United States in adopting an aligned regulatory approach.”In theory, every one of the programs and regulations implemented by the federal and provincial governments has been subjected to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. With some exceptions, such as the regulations applying to fuel efficiency for light duty vehicles, it is difficult to find these. A central issue in cost-benefit analysis of greenhouse gas emission reduction measures is the valuation of the marginal benefit of emissions reduction, sometimes referred to as the “social cost” of carbon. The programs have involved no common test as to the value of a tonne of carbon dioxide avoided, or a check as to whether this value is realistic in terms of the alleged damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions. There is no evidence that the methodologies used to calculate emissions reductions to be obtained are credible. In other words, more often than not, the approach taken has been to say that it does not matter what it costs, because we are “saving the planet”.There are few published reports that measure the performance of these programs and regulations in attaining their stated objectives; most of those that have been evaluated this way and have proven embarrassingly ineffective or expensive for the results achieved. The federal ethanol mandate is one example. Doug Auld and Ross McKitrick published a study showing that greenhouse gas reductions from corn ethanol production cost between $400 and $3,300 per tonne. The Ontario Green Energy Act cost $4 billion per year to eliminate 8 million tonnes of emissions; that equates to $500 per tonne.  Subsidies for electric vehicles cost more.The fundamental objective of all these programs and regulations, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will be duplicated by the proposed carbon pricing and cap and trade systems. We will all be paying twice, if not three or more times, to achieve the same questionable objective.***Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['climate change', 'COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Uncategorized']",2016/10/07
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/10/04/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-trudeau-carbon-taxes/,Judy Cross ,FIVE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE TRUDEAU CARBON TAXES," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2016  Robert Lyman is an energy economist, former public servant, and diplomat.On October 3, the Trudeau government announced the broad outlines of its proposed carbon tax regime. It is a tax that will be designed to apply in areas of Canada in which the provincial or territorial government has not established a carbon tax or implemented a carbon cap and trade system that has the equivalent effect of a carbon tax. The rate of the tax will be uniform nationally, starting at $10 per tonne in 2017 and rising by $10 per year each year to $50 per tonne in 2022. This is an enormous tax According to the National Emissions Inventory published by Environment Canada, national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2014, the most recent year for which figures are available, were 732 million tonnes per year. Assuming a carbon tax applied to all emissions, and ignoring the growth in emissions almost certain to occur, this means that the annual revenue from a carbon tax to governments would increase from $7.32 billion in 2017 to $36.6 billion in 2022. This makes the proposed carbon tax, by 2022, roughly equal to the federal portion of the HST. The promise of revenue neutrality cannot be believed The only regime that has honoured its promise to return to taxpayers all the revenues raised from carbon taxes is British Columbia. The Federal Finance Department and the provincial treasuries of provinces like Ontario and Quebec will be certain to use the funds from a carbon tax to supplement general tax revenues. Almost all provinces are incurring huge deficits as a result of profligate spending and desperately want an additional source of funds so that politicians can spread them among favoured programs, projects and lobby groups. Ontario, for example, has already promised to spend the funds on transit and other programs that have little or no bearing on GHG emissions and that should be funded by the municipalities in any case. The claim that this will create jobs ignores the experience of other countries. The effect of a carbon tax will be to take revenues from individual taxpayers and from companies that are efficient and profitable and transfer them to certain favoured “green” enterprises that are uneconomic or that sell products based on immature technologies. Studies of experience in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy show that the effect of increased electricity prices due to subsidies to wind, solar and biomass plants was to reduce employment by two to three jobs for every one created in the renewables industries. Further, the claim that higher taxes on carbon will increase employment completely ignores the likely adverse competitive effects on Canadian companies that must pay the higher costs while competing with companies in other countries that do not bear this burden. To impose such major costs on Canadian companies without even waiting to find out what our competitors, especially in the United States, will do is irresponsible. Even onerous carbon taxes will not meet the government’s emission goals. No GHG emission reduction goal set by governments since they began doing so in 1988 has yet been met. The current Canadian government goal is to reduce emissions from 2005 levels by 30%, which amounts to 186 million tonnes per year, or 26% from current levels. That is equivalent to completely eliminating emissions from electricity generation and from energy intensive industries like mining, steel, auto manufacturing and petrochemicals, as well as sharply reducing transportation emissions.  Contrary to the claims of the New Democratic Party and some journalists, this is not a “moderate” goal. Yet, even a tax of $50 per tonne, which is equivalent to 11.5 cents per liter, will have only small effects on energy consumption and emissions, especially in transportation. This is why the Ecofiscal Commission and others who accept the global warming thesis have called for a tax of $300 per tonne or more. The present tax is just a “foot in the door” to much more onerous levies in future. The goals proposed cannot be achieved without severe damage to Canada’s economy. It is all for nothing. The reality is that not one single claim of environmental catastrophe made by those who believe in human-induced global warming has yet turned out to be true. The relatively small increases in average global temperatures over the past 25 years are far below what the modelers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have projected. Even if this were not so, the best analysis available from the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy information Administration and authoritative industry sources like British Petroleum and Exxon-Mobil indicates that, in the period to 2040, almost all the growth in global GHG emissions will occur in the developing countries like China, India and Southeast Asia. Canada’s emissions constitute 1.65% of global emissions and are declining over time. Canada literally could disappear overnight and it would have a small effect on current global emissions, while those emissions continued their inevitable upward trend. The Asian countries and others, in judging whether to incur economic costs to reduce emissions, care not one bit what Canada does or does not do. Carbon taxes, like so many expensive “green” measures, are nothing more than extremely costly symbolism.***Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'decarbonization', 'Energy East', 'Leap Manifesto', 'Trudeau carbon tax', 'Uncategorized']",2016/10/04
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/10/02/establishing-a-scorecard-for-electric-vehicles/,,ESTABLISHING A SCORECARD FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES," Contributed by Robert Lyman @2016Debates between those who claim humans are causing catastrophic global warming and those who dissent from this thesis often include questions related to whether technologies that today are immature or limited in commercial use will be much more quickly disseminated in future. For example, the advocates of the catastrophe theory argue that the world’s transport sector soon will be radically transformed through the rapid dissemination of electric vehicles (EVs), generally including electric hybrids (PHEVs) and all-electric cars (BEVs). Typically, in debates of this nature, the dissenting side points to statistics concerning actual consumer purchases in the past. Catastrophe theorists brush that aside by pointing to ever more optimistic claims by technology marketers and government agencies committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the extensive use of “policy measures” (i.e. massive subsidies and product mandates). For further “evidence”, they point to the rapid penetration of computer and information technologies as a model and the significant growth in percentage sales (from very low levels) that have characterized EVs over the past decade. As the debate is about the future, neither side can prove its thesis. In these circumstances, it would seem useful to at least establish a scorecard, or basis for determining statistically whether the sales of EVs are increasing at rates that justify the “optimistic” or “pessimistic” views. Where are we now? According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), there were 1.25 million electric cars on the world’s roads at the end of 2015. 80% of the electric cars in the world are located in the United States, China, Japan, the Netherlands and Norway. Consumer acceptance of EVs, while growing, remains quite low; EVs constituted 1% or more of new vehicles sales in 2015 in only seven countries: Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, France, China and the United Kingdom. In all these countries, large taxpayer subsidies (e.g. up to $7,500 per vehicle in the U.S.) provide the incentive to increase purchases. Today, EVs account for a negligible share (0.1%) of the global stock of personal and commercial vehicles. What is the “policy” goal in terms of future sales? There is no single answer to this question. The IEA has established a process called Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) that seeks to define the objectives and the technology “roadmaps” that would achieve emissions reductions consistent with the objectives of the OECD countries. The IEA Vision is one in which global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will fall from 33 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2013 to about 15 Gt in 2050 and continue to fall after that. This (allegedly) would be consistent with the goal of maintaining the rise in global average temperatures at 2 degrees C. or less from pre-industrial levels. Today, the transport sector accounts for about 23% of global GHG emissions. The ETP 2DS scenario that the IEA uses as a basis for analysis foresees the transport sector accounting for 18% of the GHG emissions reductions needed to meet the IEA Vision. EVs are projected to constitute significantly to this objective. Specifically, the ETP 2DS foresees EVs constituting 150 million (10%) of the total light duty vehicle stock by 2030 and nearly 1 billion (40%) of the total light duty vehicle stock by 2050. In 2009, several governments (including Canada) formed a multilateral policy forum called the Electric Vehicle Initiative (EVI) to accelerate the deployment of EVs worldwide. The goal of this group is the global deployment of 20 million EVs by 2020. The Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change was announced (with virtually no fanfare or media coverage) at COP21 in Paris in December 2015. The declaration sets targets of more than 400 million electric two-wheelers and more than 100 million EVs by 2030. Other “expert” organizations have weighed in with their educated guesses as to how many EVs will be on the roads by 2020. Bloomberg Business News (almost always optimistic about the ease of attaining GHG emission reduction goals) projects 7.4 million. Adam Whitmore, a prominent independent expert who strongly favours EVs, projects somewhere between 7.8 to 13 million vehicles. OPEC, in its oil market analysis, projects only 1.7 million. British Petroleum, in its usually well-regarded February 2016 global energy forecast to 2040, foresaw almost no significant uptake of EVs until at least 2035. These projections are based on different assumptions as to whether governments will continue the current high level of taxpayer subsidies. According to the current U.S. program subsidies will end after 200,000 EVs are sold there. Other important assumptions concern the rates at which new battery technologies can be developed and commercialized, future vehicle prices and the rate at which sales will grow from current levels. This provides at least a range of estimates that one might use as a way of measuring whether EVs are on track to meet the goals claimed by their advocates. By 2020, if the global inventory of EVs is three million or less, it will demonstrate conclusively that the technology is facing serious market barriers that may limit its role in reducing GHG emissions for decades. Continuation of the present relatively fast rate of growth in sales plus some acceleration could yield a global stock of 7.4 to 13 million EVs by 2020. While this would be impressive, it would still be an afterthought in a global vehicle population of about 1.3 billion. A 2020 EV population of 20 million (i.e. a 1600% increase from present levels) would match with current policy aspirations. By 2030, the COP21 and IEA policy prescriptions are for 100 million to 150 million EVs on the roads, a quite remarkable range of goals for only 14 years from now. This would be evidence that EVs had largely overcome the initial market barriers and were potentially on a path to becoming a large share of the vehicle stock. Still, at 150 million, EVs would only constitute 10% of the global vehicle stock; 1.35 billion vehicles would still be oil-fueled. If the IEA ETP scenario were to be attained, by 2050, (i.e. 34 years from now), EVs would come close to parity with oil-fueled vehicles in new car sales, but they would still represent only 40% of the global vehicle stock. We are asked to believe that these goals will be achieved during a period of time when lower oil prices and continuing improvements in the technology of internal combustion engines are making oil-fueled vehicles ever more competitive. No target set by western governments for the expansion of the EV fleet has yet been met. However, there is a first time for everything. With the figures set out in the preceding paragraphs, we have a yardstick we can use in future to debate the validity of the projections.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'decarbonization', 'EU', 'Uncategorized']",2016/10/02

Our review of international and provincial patient studies shows that health problems and premature deaths increase when there is a lack of affordable, reliable power.  Accelerated coal phase-out and a rush-to-renewables have put the UK at risk of blackouts, created socio-economic and health problems, and burdened industry.Is that what we want for Alberta?Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['EU', 'Uncategorized']",2016/09/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/09/25/climate-change-the-totalitarian-temptation/,Jeffery Green ,Climate. CHANGE! The Totalitarian Temptation," Contributed by Drieu Godefridi, Ph.D., lawyer  ©September 2016English version of “La tentation totalitaire de l’écologie”In 2010 I published a modest essay in epistemology (IPCC: A Scientific Body? ) characterizing the IPCC – UN study group on climate – as a political organization (and not a scientific one).At the time, I was virtually alone in supporting this thesis. Talk television at the time denied me a platform, seeing me as some kind of denier of science, or a shill for Big Oil.  Shortly thereafter, I was joined in this critical view by Canadian journalist Donna Laframboise (“IPCC: The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert”), and many others, until this thesis was also adopted by the US Republican Party in its latest version, and today Nicolas Sarkozy (BBC, September 14, 2016). Does this mean that reason has triumphed? Does this mean that the IPCC reports will now be recognized for what they are, that is to say, political documents – and not scientific reports- making them the most disheveled liaison vehicle of environmentalist ideology? It is too early to tell. For, according to a conventional intellectual schema, as they are discredited, the proponents of the dominant thesis tend to become more radical.Thus the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which is the largest organization of Economic Research of the United States, has just published a study on how the US economy should adapt to climate change. This study has been largely picked up by the American press under the theme of: “the US Economy in WWII as a Model for Coping with Climate Change” (NBER Working Paper, September 2016). To fight climate change, the effects of which are compared to the bombs dropped on Europe by the Nazis (sic, page 4), this report suggests that to succeed in the fight against climate change one must transform the US economy into a ‘climate war’ economy. This implies, among other things, the limitless growth of government spending (“gold rush economics”), government control of the means of production, administrative control over economic factors (prices, rates, rents) and of course, rationing. A package which indeed defines the economy of a country at war. Considering that war is a situation analogous to the “ecological disaster” that we know, the author of the report shows how, in 1941, the American economy was converted into a war economy, how many new infrastructure projects were built by the government (including pipelines), how many new materials were invented such as synthetic rubber, and how new aluminum deposits were exploited.Rationing of metals, privileges for the arms industry: this is the picture of a war economy. The best example, according to the author of the report, of what a government can do in a time of war, is the “Manhattan Project” that is to say the development of the nuclear bomb. Funding was provided by taxes and by borrowing.The author continues to wonder why, with the success of the administered economy, why this “war socialism” (sic) was rejected after the war. The author’s conclusion? It was mainly due to communication problems because we let strikes settle and spread corporate propaganda for the “free market”. In that author’s view, there is, therefore no structural obstacle to the establishment of a planned economy in peacetime.This planned economy would differ from previous as its objective, which would not be producing as needed, but to limit human production of greenhouse gases. The idea is that by assigning everyone a rightful place, the government would have the means to reduce CO2 emissions and to manage the consequences of extreme weather events (supposed to multiply, p. 3).Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek showed that the control of economic activity involves the control of the life of every individual in all its aspects, not only in the economic aspects. The one who decides what can be produced, by whom and where; what can be consumed, by whom and in what quantities, this one does not only control the lives of citizens but is also the one that sets the scale of values. All at once the omniscient demon of Laplace, the Hobbesian Leviathan, and Big Brother, the master planner becomes the master of souls.Moreover, the report of the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests, as an aperitif, the rapid, mandatory, displacement of the population (p. 5 and 17) and the prohibition of strikes (p. 35). This will pose no difficulty since the government will be freed of all financial and legal constraints (p. 15). This grand ‘climate change war plan’ will obliterate the basic freedoms of the public very effectively, since the intended enemy — “climate change” – is unlikely to be defeated.Such delusional projects as this one, which is in line with the recommendations of the IPCC’s Malthusian view, are the mark of a debate that was believed to have been based on science, whereas it was rooted in ideology.If we are to go ‘to war’ on these grounds, would it not be appropriate that following the American parliamentary majority, European politicians hold public hearings on the politicization of climate science? Drieu GodefridiPh.D., lawyer ***Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['decarbonization', 'Uncategorized', 'war on climate']",2016/09/25
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/09/20/a-tale-of-two-places-denmark-alberta/,Jeffery Green ,A Tale of Two Places – Denmark + Alberta," Researcher/writer William Kay, of the blog Ecofascism, wrote a research trilogy last year (2015) on the geopolitics of climate change.  Part three – “A Tale of Two Places” is instructive for Albertans and Canadians at this time as there is a push to incorporate renewables and be ‘green like Denmark.’  But is Denmark ‘green’?  If so, why are they still using so much coal?  And if Denmark has Alberta’s wealth of high-quality coal, would they be building wind farms at sea?Download “A Tale of Two Places” via the link below :tale-of-two-places-one-part-sept-19-2016In a Calgary Herald report of Sept. 14, 2016, Alberta’s NDP government claims it will have “30 percent renewable power by 2030” – but despite Denmark’s massive offshore wind resources, it had only managed to get 17% power from wind, and then only because it has a unique power grid configuration that is split in half, with one-half connected to Norway’s hydro and the other half connected to Sweden’s nuclear – both of which can handle the ebb, flow, and spill of wind power.  Conventional grids backed up with natural gas could not.Though Denmark effectively generates more power from wind than the 17% or so that it uses, it usually has to spill this highly subsidized power offshore to Sweden and Norway which are pretty much ‘carbon neutral’ anyway.World Nuclear Association has some interesting discussion on the power mix in Denmark and may include some more up-to-date figures than “A Tale of Two Places” – but in principle, the fact remains that Alberta does not have equivalent wind resources to Denmark, and Alberta does have lots of very affordable coal.Wind power is an erratic and unpredictable force that must be backed up 24/7 by equivalent fossil fuel (or hydro) resources and ‘peaking’ gas powered plants must be at the ready to ramp up or down power production to fill the sudden drops in power.  This natural gas back-up was found by Ontario Professional Engineers to actually increase carbon dioxide emissions (Ontario has nuclear back-up and hydro).Data Source: AESO – graph shows erratic nature of wind power in the 3rd quarter of 2012 Geopolitics are a key factor in the climate change game, as noted by Prof. Dr. Istvan Marko in numerous blog pieces on this weblog.  Albertans should think carefully before going down an expensive path that does not result in a more reliable or affordable power system.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/09/19/the-rocky-road-to-emissions-reduction/,renewableguy ,THE ROCKY ROAD TO EMISSIONS REDUCTION," Contributed by Robert Lyman @2016Governments of the Group of 20 (G20) countries have declared their intention to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to address the alleged threat of human-induced catastrophic climate change. With the enormous government and media attention to this issue, it is perhaps easy to lose sight of the actual changes occurring and whether they are making a significant difference in terms of the proclaimed goal of achieving a carbon-free world. Roger Andrews, a retired geophysicist who writes extensively on climate and related issues on his blog “Energy Matters”, has examined the actual emissions reductions in the G20 over the period 1985 to 2915, using data drawn from the 2016 BP Statistical Review of World Energy. On September 18 2016, he posted an article entitled, “Electricity and Energy in the G29”. Andrews starts by noting that the G20 governments have fixated on first reducing emissions in the electricity sector and generally have ignored or under-emphasized how to reduce them in the non-electricity sectors. One reason for this is that in most G20 countries, electrical energy is produced and transmitted by government –owned and regulated firms and it has been comparatively easy to legislate changes in this sub-sector, but far more difficult to do so in the non-electricity sectors where there are far more actors and decisions to influence. Further, the generation technologies needed to reduce emissions (nuclear, hydro, wind, solar) already exist in electricity generation, whereas many of the technologies that would be needed to significantly reduce GHG emissions in the non-electricity sectors either do not yet exist or are commercially unproven. Further, many of the energy demand changes governments and environmentalists seek can only occur with the wholehearted participation of the public, much of which remains unconvinced of the need and resists the higher prices and costs involved. Green non-governmental organizations fixate on electricity, which is why the public is “bombarded” with reports of a new solar generation record in Germany or a new wind generation record in Scotland, etc. Andrews makes a number of distinctions that are often not made in the media – between electricity and total energy consumption, between electricity generation by non-carbon sources and electricity generation by renewable energy sources, and between percentage changes in renewable energy generation and percentage changes in the share of total generation represented by renewable energy. He also offers some innovative approaches to inter-country comparisons. Here are some highlights of his analysis. The best measure of “progress” in reducing the carbon-intensity of electricity generation is not the increase in the production or share of renewables; it is the share held by all non-carbon sources. In this regard, France is the world leader, with 93% of its generation from non-carbon (mainly nuclear) sources. Canada is in second place, with 83% and Brazil in third, with 77%. All other countries are far behind. This point seems lost on most of the Canadian media.If one asks, “How much progress have the G20 countries made towards decarbonizing their electricity sectors since 1985?” the answer is “none”. The low-carbon generation percentage in 1985 was 26.8% and in 1995 it peaked at 28.8%. Since then, the share has declined, with a percentage of 26.5% – 0.3% lower than the 1985 share – in 2015. What has happened has been that low-carbon nuclear has been replaced by wind and solar, which of course does nothing on a net basis to reduce emissions.In 2015, electricity supplied only 41.5% of total energy consumption in the G20 countries. If one could totally decarbonize electricity generation, it would not even halve carbon emissions.If one examines electricity generation by source as a percentage of total energy consumption in individual G20 countries, France takes first place, with electricity generation accounting for 50% of all energy consumption. Canada again is second, with 36% and Brazil third with 34%. In most G20 countries, generation accounts for less than 20% of total energy consumption.Viewed over the period 1985 to 2015, low-carbon energy consumption has increased from 11.2% to 14.4% of total energy consumption in the G20, almost all caused by growth in renewable energy generation. At this rate of growth, total decarbonization of G20 energy will not be achieved until 2250 or thereabouts. Someone better tell the environmentalists. Roger Andrews’s article can be read here:  http://euanmearns.com/?s=G20Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'decarbonization', 'EU', 'Ontario', 'Uncategorized']",2016/09/19
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/09/14/whats-one-more-electricity-scandal/,,WHAT’S ONE MORE ELECTRICITY SCANDAL?," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ Sept. 2016By now, the Ontario public may have become numb to the shock effects of yet another story about how the McGuinty and Wynne governments have so mismanaged the electricity generation and sales system in the province that it has cost consumers billions of dollars per year in extra costs for little if any benefits. Perhaps one more example may be like water off a duck’s back.However, the Liberals’ conversion of the former Thunder Bay and Atikokan coal-burning power plants to biomass-burning plants resembles a Keystone-cops tale of colossal errors that would be comedies if the results were not so tragic for Ontario electricity ratepayers.Here are the highlights:In August, 2010, the Minister of Energy directed that the Ontario Power Authority negotiate with Ontario Power Generation (two electricity Crown corporations that no longer exist) to convert the Atikokan coal-burning power plant to a peaking plant (i.e. a power plant that supplies energy only when adequate supplies are not available from other plants) burning biomass fuel. No one evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this conversion in advance.The conversion proceeded. The plant is expected to operate the equivalent of 29 full-capacity days per year, while employing 64 full-time staff. At best, it will generate 140,000 megawatt hours (MWh) for $74 million per year, putting the cost of electricity at this facility at $528/MWh – about eight times higher that the cost of producing electricity from existing biomass plants in Ontario, and ten times more than the cost of power from natural gas peaking plants.In December 2013, the Minister of Energy directed the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) to convert a coal-burning power plant at Thunder Bay to a biomass peaking plant, in spite of an OPA study that found this would not be cost-effective. This was justified as a way to “facilitate growth and job creation in the Ontario forest industry and in the Thunder Bay region”.The conversion proceeded. The plant is expected to operate the equivalent of five full-capacity days in a year while employing 60 full-time staff. At best, it will generate about 15,000 MWh a year at a cost of $40 million per year. This puts the cost of the electricity of this plant, at best, at around $1,600 per MWh – 25 times higher than the average cost of existing biomass energy from other facilities in Ontario.Wet biomass catches on fire. Or explodes. So, Ontario Power Generation decided to use “advanced biomass pellets” treated to withstand exposure to rain at the Thunder Bay plant. OPG has to buy the wood pellets from Norway. As the Ontario Auditor General drily observed in her 2015 report, “we are concerned this might not be able to facilitate the volume of job growth in Ontario’s forestry industry as the Ministry intends”.Parker Gallant, the retired banker who monitors and comments on the financial performance of Ontario’s electricity-related Crown Corporations, has commented that “collectively, both of these conversions will produce almost no power but will add approximately $65 million annually (i.e. $650 million per decade) to ratepayers’ bills.”Wait. It gets worse. It turns out that the total carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the production, transportation to the power plant and combustion of coal average 295 pounds per million BTUs of output, but the comparable figure for advanced biomass pellets moved from Norway to Canada is 1,010 pounds, more than three times as much.So try to figure out the logic of killing Norwegian forests and then shipping the wood pellets by vessel and train to Ontario to burn in a resurrected coal power plant at 25 times the cost of alternative sources.Only in Ontario!***Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Ontario', 'Uncategorized']",2016/09/14
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/09/12/confusion-muddle-obfuscation-and-racism/,Climatism ,"Confusion, muddle, obfuscation and racism"," As Obama, UN and EPA seek to dictate our lives and livelihoods, the real issue is green racism  Guest Contribution by Paul DriessenWinston Churchill called Russia a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. We could say Obama’s energy and climate policy is confusion wrapped in muddled thinking inside obfuscation – and driven by autocratic diktats that bring job-killing, economy-strangling, racist and deadly outcomes.President Obama was recently in China, where his vainglorious arrival turned into an inglorious snub, when he had to use Air Force 1’s rear exit. He was there mostly to join Chinese President Xi Jinping and UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon, to formally sign the Paris climate treaty that Mr. Obama insists is not a treaty (and thus does not require Senate “advice and consent” under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution) because it is not binding – yet.However, once it has been “signed and delivered” by 55 nations representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it will be hailed as binding. China and the US alone represent 38% of total emissions, so adding a few more big nations (Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan and Germany, eg) would reach the emission threshold. Adding a bunch of countries that merely want their “fair share” of the billions of dollars in annual climate “adaptation, mitigation and reparation” cash would hit the country minimum.Few if any developing nations will reduce their oil, natural gas or coal use anytime soon. That would be economic and political suicide. In fact, China and India plan to build some 1,600 new coal-fired power plants by 2030, Japan 43, Turkey 80, Poland a dozen, and the list goes on and on, around the globe.Meanwhile, the United States is shutting down its coal-fueled units. Under Obama’s treaty, the USA will be required to go even further, slashing its carbon dioxide emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. That will unleash energy, economic and environmental impacts far beyond what the Administration’s endless, baseless climate decrees are already imposing.Federal agencies constantly harp on wildly exaggerated and fabricated “social costs of carbon” – but completely and deliberately ignore the incredible benefits of carbon-based energy.The battle is now shifting to natural gas – methane. Hillary Clinton and Democrats promise to regulate drilling and fracking into oblivion on federal lands. California regulators are targeting cow flatulence!EPA continues to expand ethanol requirements, even though this fuel additive reduces mileage, damages small engines, uses acreage equivalent to Iowa, requires enormous amounts of water, fertilizer, pesticides, gasoline, methane and diesel fuel – and releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it removes.Wind turbines, photovoltaic solar arrays and their interminable transmission lines already blanket millions of acres of farmland and wildlife habitats. They kill millions of birds and bats (but are exempt from endangered species laws), to provide expensive, subsidized, unreliable electricity. Expanding wind, solar and biofuel programs to reach the 28% CO2 reduction target would increase these impacts exponentially.But all this is necessary, we’re told, to prevent climate cataclysms, like an Arctic meltdown. “Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone,” the Washington Post reported. Icebergs are becoming scarcer, in some places seals are finding the water too hot, and within a few years rising seas “will make most coastal cities uninhabitable.” The situation could hardly be more dire. Oh, wait. My mistake.That was in November 1922! Recent warming and cooling episodes are not so unprecedented, after all.However, all this climate confusion, obfuscation, fabrication and prevarication are merely prelude, a sideshow. The real issues here are eco-imperialism, racism and racially disparate impacts.Not the kind of racism the Washington Post alludes to by putting a front-page story about Donald Trump going to a black church in Detroit next to a piece about a black soldier being horrifically lynched at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1941. Nor absurd claims by Detroit Free Press writer Stephen Henderson that Trump is racist for daring to go to that church to “boost his stock among white middle-class voters,” when he has “no interest” in addressing inner city problems.This racism is the sneaky, subtle, green variety: of government policies that inflict their worst impacts on the poorest among us, huge numbers of them minorities – while insisting that the gravest risks those families face are from climate change or barely detectable pollutants in their air and water.In the Real World, soaring energy prices mean poor families cannot afford adequate heating and air conditioning, cannot save or afford proper nutrition, and must rely on schools, hospitals and businesses whose energy costs are also climbing – bringing higher prices, reduced services and lost jobs.Workers who are laid off, dumped on welfare rolls or forced to take multiple lower-paying part-time jobs face greater stress and depression, reduced nutrition, sleep deprivation, greater alcohol, drug, spousal and child abuse, and higher suicide, stroke, heart attack and cancer rates. That means every life supposedly saved by anti-fossil fuel policies is offset by real lives lost due to government actions.Unemployment among minorities, especially black teens, is already far higher than for the population at large. Crime and other inner city problems are far worse than elsewhere. Policies that further cripple economic growth, job creation and revenue generation will make their situation infinitely worse.Of course, legislators, regulators, lobbyists, eco-activists, crony capitalists, judges and celebrities are rarely affected. Their communities are far from those that bear the brunt of their edicts, so they’re shielded from most impacts of policies they impose. They know what is happening, but are almost never held accountable for actions that are racist in their outcomes, if not in their supposed “good intentions.”To them, a planet free from inflated, hypothetical dangers from modern technologies is more important than lives improved or saved by those technologies. In Earth’s poorest countries, the outcomes are lethal on a daily basis. There, billions live on a few dollars a day, rarely or never have electricity, and are wracked by joblessness, malnutrition, disease and despair. Millions die every year from malaria, lung infections, malnutrition, severe diarrhea, and countless other diseases of poverty and eco-imperialism.And yet, President Obama, the UN, its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and myriad environmental pressure groups tell impoverished dark-skinned people they should rely on “clean energy strategies” to improve their lives, but not “too much,” since anything more would not be “sustainable.”“If everybody has got a car and air conditioning and a big house,” Mr. Obama told South Africans, “the planet will boil over.” He can jet, live and golf all over the planet, but they must limit their aspirations.Thus his Overseas Private Investment Corporation refused to support a gas-fired power plant in Ghana, and the United States “abstained” from supporting a World Bank loan for South Africa’s state-of-the-art Medupi coal-fired power plant. Meanwhile, radical environmentalist campaigns limit the ability of African and other nations to use DDT and insecticides to control malaria, dengue fever and Zika – or GMO seeds and even hybrid seeds and modern fertilizers to improve crop yields and nutrition.No wonder Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said his country will not ratify the Paris climate treaty. “Now that we’re developing, you will impose a limit? That’s absurd,” he snorted. He’s absolutely right.These anti-technology campaigns are akin to denying chemotherapy to cancer patients. They result in racist eco-manslaughter and must no longer be tolerated – no matter how “caring” and “well-intended” supposed “climate cataclysm prevention” policies might be.If we’re going to discuss race, racism, disparate impacts, black and all lives mattering, and protecting people and planet from manmade risks, let’s make sure all these topics become part of that discussion.Paul Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (www.CFACT.org) and author of Eco-Imperialism: Green power – Black death and other books on the environment.http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2016/09/10/confusion-muddle-obfuscation-and-racism-n2216102Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/09/12
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/09/06/climate-the-show-must-go-on/,,Climate: the show must go on.," István E. Markó *En francais: http://www.contrepoints.org/ 2016/09/05/264875- ratification-de-cop21-grand- barnumThe climate agreement drafted during the COP21 meeting is dying. In what looks like a desperate attempt to save it, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Barack Obama have announced this Friday, September 2nd, their joint decision to ratify the climate treaty drawn in Paris and acclaimed by all. This news has been proclaimed with great fanfare before the G20 meeting to be held two days later in Hangzhou. There was a grand ceremony, at the extent of the event, with vigorous handshakes, brilliant smiles, signatures relayed by all televisions advertising a historic day in our long journey towards saving the planet (that does not need it, really) and endless congratulations. But don’t be fooled. This show for the media has only one goal: trying to influence some countries, especially Western and English-speaking nations, and persuade them to ratify the Paris treaty that is, for the time being, a resounding failure. Indeed, only twenty-three small countries, eager to receive the subsidies associated with this contract, have endorsed the agreement. The amount of CO2 produced by all these nations is in the order of 1.1% of all the anthropogenic CO2 (0.04% of the total CO2). Recall that this treaty will become binding only if 55% of the countries sign the agreement. In addition, it also requires that the quantity of CO2 generated by the signatory parties be equal to 55% of the CO2 emitted by humans. As you can see, we are far, far away from such a binding perspective. Therefore, it is imperative to impress and try to convince other countries, especially those who imitate and follow the US. Likewise, it is important – though not too difficult – to convince the countries of the European Union, who will be all too happy to sacrifice their economy and the welfare of their citizens on the altar of the environmentalist ideology. For trying to save the world from a hypothetical global warming due to human activity would cost a huge amount of money. Neither China nor the US will pay. As for the poor countries, they obviously want to receive money, not give it away. This is the real crunch of the matter: money and political power. Climate and CO2 are just scarecrows intended to divert public attention from the real aims pursued. To be successful in this gruesome endeavor, the UN and its minions did not hesitate to propose ineffective, but terribly expensive solutions to solve a non-existent problem. The ratification by China and the US has no value and is not binding in any way. Indeed, China continues to invest heavily in coal and nuclear power. It has no intention whatsoever of slowing down this expansion before 2030, when its population is expected to reach a plateau and stabilize. Xi Jinping does not care one bit about CO2 (China produces four times more CO2 than the West) and his signature is essentially a gimmick. Indeed, future signatory countries will see their competitiveness vis-à-vis China seriously compromised. To maximize energy efficiency, China, which already benefits from carbon credits, will pursue relentlessly its installation of coal power plants. With nuclear and hydropower, these energy sources generate about 97% of China’s total energy; the “renewable” painstakingly filling up the gap. The stamp of Obama is not even worth the paper on which it is affixed. Without approval by the Congress – who will not ratify this treaty because it will harm the economy and the competitiveness of the United States – this document is null and void. While Obama might attempt to sneak this agreement through, in the form of guidelines promulgated by the EPA (Agency for Environmental Protection), a government organization that has been shaped entirely to his will, there’s a good chance that nothing will happen before he is leaving the White House. The Trump phenomenon, in turn, creates a huge discomfort among climate alarmists and their minions since Trump clearly declared its willingness to cut all funds dedicated to UN agencies involved in one way or another with the climate, including the IPCC. As for the Green Fund, which was to receive $ 100 billion annually to help countries fight against global warming, it has been endowed so far by just over $ 550 million (0.55%). Despite promises loudly voiced in Paris, the politicians finally realized the enormity of the amount requested and are simply ignoring the supplications of the UN. The Green Fund is such a blatant failure that its President has recently resigned. Whilst China and the US will try to convince us, Citizens of the so-called “rich countries” (for how long?) to open our wallets and simultaneously scuttle our economy, India has already indicated that it will not sign the agreement within a foreseeable future, if ever. One of the reasons is the stubborn refusal of China to allow India to join the Nuclear Producer Group. Moreover, Prime Minister Modi wants to raise his country out of poverty and give everyone access to cheap and reliable energy, which will be impossible if he signs the agreement of the COP21. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte speaks in a similar manner and recently announced that he will not honor the promises made in Paris. As for Russia and Brazil, they are patiently waiting and analyzing the extent of the juicy profits they could make if they sign this treaty. As always, these international agreements are never going to “save” our climate – climate has indeed no need of them and is doing fine, thank you – but will result, as usual, in increased CO2 emissions, industries relocating to Asia where the leaders are more rational.* The article expresses the Author’s personal opinionInterview with Prof. Dr. Marko en francais – Professeur Istvan Marko explique que COP21 résulte en rien que l’accord est non contraignant. Interview with Prof. Dr. Marko:Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/09/06
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/09/03/what-did-it-cost-ontario-to-replace-coal/,,WHAT DID IT COST ONTARIO TO REPLACE COAL?," Contributed by Robert Lyman @September 2016Parker Gallant is a retired banker who does a public service by regularly analyzing and reporting on the financial performance of the Crown Corporations responsible for managing Ontario’s electricity system. In August 2016, he published two informative articles in which he assessed the results of actions taken by the Ontario government to transform electricity generation over the period 2011 to 2015. The government’s announced intention in 2011 was to eliminate the four coal-fired generating plants that then operated in Lambton, Nanticoke, Atikokan and Thunder Bay, allegedly to improve air quality and achieve the related health benefits. In 2011, the coal plants’ maximum generating capacity (i.e. ability to produce electricity) was 4,484 megawatts (MW). However, the plants operated only occasionally, producing 4.1 terawatt hours (TWh) of power – just 10.5% of their capacity. The 4.1 TWH cost electricity ratepayers $135 million (3.3 cents per kWh) in 2011. The government never disclosed how much it would cost to end coal-fired power generation. Gallant shows that the Ontario government did three different things:It added significant additional generating capacity from nuclear, hydro, natural gas, wind and solar power sources;It converted two of the coal plants (at Atikokan and Thunder Bay) to burn biomass (wood chips) instead; andIt spent, and continues to spend, a large amount of money on programs to reduce electricity consumption. The nuclear power added was 1,532 MW at Bruce Nuclear, which can operate at a capacity factor of 90% to supply 12.08 TWh. This alone easily covered the loss of the 4.1 TWH of coal-fired capacity and added an additional 8.7 TWH for new demand growth. The electricity produced by the Bruce Nuclear alone cost ratepayers $800 million per year. New industrial wind turbines added 2,580 MW of capacity. Wind turbines usually operate, on average, at a capacity factor of 30%, because the wind does not blow all the time. New solar power capacity added 2,078 MW of capacity, which also runs at low capacity rates because the sun does not shine all the time. Wind and solar thus are “intermittent” energy sources, and they operate out-of-phase with the times when electricity is most needed. However, the Province gave wind and solar priority in the form of “first-to-the-grid” rights over other, cheaper energy sources. Consequently, the province needs additional power generation from “peaking’ plants, mostly natural gas, to provide the power sometimes needed when demand is high and the power produced by wind and solar is not enough. Wind produced 10.2 TWh of electricity in 2015 and solar produced 3.04 TWH, for a combined cost of $2.7 billion a year. The new natural gas peaking plants added 602 MW of capacity to the 9,549 MW that was available in 2011 to reach a 2015 generation capacity of 10,151 MW. In 2015, the average capacity factor of the gas plants was only 17.5%. This added $100 million annually to ratepayers’ costs. The 754 MW of hydropower capacity added since 2011 came mainly from the modifications to the Niagara tunnel (150 MW) and the Mattagami run-of-river project (438 MW). These were hugely expensive, costing $4.1 billion in capital costs alone, not counting interest or operating costs. Without counting operating costs, these additions now cost ratepayers about $200 million per year. In a move that has received virtually no media attention, the Government brought the historical hydro generation from Ontario Power Generation out from “unregulated” (i.e. subject to market rates) to “regulated” rates, thus adding $474 million annually to ratepayers’ bills. The conversion of coal plants to biomass generation was also enormously costly; if they operate at all, they will add about $65 million to ratepayers’ bills. When electricity production from all generation sources exceeds provincial demand, the Independent Electricity Systems Operator (IESO) acts to cut back (“curtail”) production from natural gas, hydro and nuclear power sources. The curtailment costs were about $400 million in 2015. When even that is not enough, IESO must dump power at depressed rates on export markets. Currently, the government requires IESO to allocate about $433 million annually to local distribution companies like HydroOttawa to promote reduced electricity use. If the distribution utilities lose sales as a result, they can apply to the Ontario Energy Board to be reimbursed through higher rates charged to consumers. Thus, when consumers as a group reduce electricity use, the rates go up. In total, nominally to replace 4,484 MW of coal-generating capacity costing $135 million per year, the province has added 8,037 MW of new, mostly wind and solar generating capacity, thus increasing ratepayers’ bills by more than $4 billion annually. That does not include any losses on export sales nor the costs of cancelling two natural gas plants during the 2011 election campaign. $4 billion a year spent otherwise would have bought a lot of improvement to health care. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/09/03
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/08/29/the-levelized-cost-of-electricity-from-existing-generation-sources/,renewableguy ,THE LEVELIZED COST OF ELECTRICITY FROM EXISTING GENERATION SOURCES," Contributed by Robert Lyman, Energy Economist @August 2016In July 2016 the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Research (IER) released a study prepared by Thomas Stacy and George Taylor of the levelized cost of existing and new electricity generation sources in the United States. This is a summary of that study.The value of studies that examine the levelized cost of electricity is, in large part, because they allow utilities and policy makers to compare on a consistent basis, in terms of dollars per megawatt hour ($/MWh), the costs of building and operating different types of generation equipment, over the lifetime of that equipment. Thus, one can compare a natural gas generating plant with relatively low capital costs but higher and varying fuel costs to a wind or solar plant with relatively high capital costs but lower operating costs. Most existing American work in this area uses the results of analysis performed by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA, however, compares only the projected costs of new generation that will come into operation within the next few years.The absence of information in the EIA’s analysis about the costs of electricity from existing generation sources means that policy makers and lawmakers sometimes make decisions about replacing that capacity without a clear understanding of the costs of doing so.The data used in the IER study on the fuel costs of current generation and on the capacity factors at which they operate are drawn from reports submitted by utilities to U.S. federal government agencies. The following table compares the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), in U.S. 2013 dollars per megawatt-hour, from different generation sources. Generation TypeLCOE of ExistingLCOE of New*LCOE of New**Conventional coal39.9N/A95.1Combined Cycle Gas34.455.375.2Nuclear29.190.195.2Hydro35.4122.283.5Combustion TurbineGas (peaking)88.2263.0141.5WindN/A107.473.6PV SolarN/A140.3125.3* This column shows the LCOE of new generation sources at actual 2015 capacity factors and fuel costs.** This column shows the LCOE of new generation sources at the EIA-assumed capacity factors and fuel costs.The IER study notes that the LCOE figures shown for wind and solar generation do not include others costs of $25 to $50 per MWh for transmission and subsidies, which also are not considered by EIA in its calculation of LCOE. Further, the EIA makes no distinction between the 20-25 year expected lifespans of wind and solar facilities vs. the 50+ year lifespans of most other technologies.A number of key points emerge from this analysis:On average, each resource category’s existing power plants have lower fixed costs and similar variable costs compared to the most likely replacements.The fleet average costs of electricity from existing power plants is less than the fleet average cost of electricity from new power plants of the same type.Existing conventional coal plants, providing dispatchable full-time capable resources, cost U.S.$39.90 per MWh, 58% lower than comparable new coal plants, 63% lower than new wind generation at 2015 fuel costs and capacity factors and 72% lower than new PV solar generation at 2015 fuel costs and capacity factors.Using 2015 actual capacity figures for EIA “best case” capacity factors has a considerable impact on the costs of different sources.The reason the costs of generation from existing sources is so important is that U.S. government mandates, regulations, and subsidies, like those in Canada, are driving the construction of new generation sources. The IER, in a separate paper, identified more than 110 gigawatts of coal and nuclear generation capacity set to close as a direct result of U.S. federal regulation. With little or slow growth in electricity demand, most existing coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydroelectric generation resources could continue producing electricity for decades at far lower cost than could any potential new generation resources.The IER study can be read here:http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IER_LCOE_2016-2.pdfShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/08/29
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/08/16/are-the-media-fairly-reporting-on-coal-phase-out-in-alberta/,knittingwithheart ,Are the Media Fairly Reporting on Coal Phase-out in Alberta?," by Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager @August 2016In the fall of 2015, two Edmonton media outlets ran articles about coal emissions that wildly exaggerated the source evidence they used. We objected to both media outlets. The Edmonton Journal refused to run our rebuttal statement. To be fair, they had recently published another article of ours on the topic headline as: “Opinion -Scare quality versus air quality.” however, we felt the errors in the “Hot spots” report (see links below) in question were so glaring, that either the Journal should write a retraction, or they should accept our rebuttal.They did not. The editorial management at the time declined our rebuttal. We saw no retraction or correction.We also sent a letter to the taxpayer-funded CBC Edmonton, which had similarly mis-reported the information. They said they would look at it and get back to us. They did not.The Journal had also published a letter to the editor days after our first item which was headlined “Friends of Science don’t deserve ink.” and laden with unsubstantiated smears by a renewables activist (who apparently doesn’t know that all wind and solar devices are made from lots and lots of fossil fuels!)As the coal phase-out discussion continues, we now publish our proposed rebuttal letter of the time as a matter of public interest.Why Friends of Science Deserves Ink – Edmonton Media Misinforms Public on Environment Canada ReportBy Michelle Stirling @2015Two recent (Oct. 2015) Edmonton media stories took information from a spring workshop of the Joint Oil Sands Monitoring group and turned it on its head, to misinform the public.The Edmonton Journal headline of Oct. 8, 2015, claimed: “Hot Spots depict how coal plants contribute to Edmonton pollution in new Environment Canada images.” In fact, the new Environment Canada data showed the coal-fired power plants as blue dots and indicated that there were significantly reduced emissions. Research scientist in charge of this project, Heather Morrison of Environment Canada (EC), in her video presentation on the matter, states at 4:09 that there has been a decrease in sulfur dioxide concentrations from the coal-fired power plants “which aligns very nicely with the mitigation that has happened over that time period…” (2005 to 2013)The Journal ran a colorful image of emissions with Alberta lit up as if as air polluted as Ontario. Scary!  But Heather Morrison said: “..what you can see is the measurements are sparse across the landscape and look disproportionately large because they had to make the dots big enough that you can see them.”On the same day, CBC Edmonton ran a similar story on this headlined:  “Computer-generated video shows pollution spread across the Prairies” Oct 8, 2015.Again, the reporter is overstating the case. The images are from a computer model, not real emissions. Outputs from models are not data. The real life empirical data shows a decrease of pollution, despite a population increase.Alberta’s population grew from 3.256 million in 2006 to 4.120 million by 2014. If sulfur and nitrogen oxides – SOx and NOx – emissions are at about the same levels in 2014 as they were in 2006, that means in real terms a reduction of just over 26% per capita by industry.The CASA Data Warehouse air quality monitoring records show no exceedances of NO2 or SO2 (the substances studied) during the time frames of the modeling study except occasional short-term exceedances at Redwater, far from coal-fired power plants.Further, NOx and SOx are essential for a healthy eco-system. In 2011, Mother Nature’s wildfires in Alberta alone, emitted the equivalent of 448 million diesel truck emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), along with 30 million tons of SO4 (sulfates) and 16 million CO2e tons of nitrogen oxides.It seems the misinformed media slant comes from the phase-out coal activists at Pembina Institute and the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), whose representatives are quoted in the stories.Pembina and CAPE are trying to foist more wind and solar on Albertans by demonizing coal. One has to question this blatant misrepresentation of the facts, especially as Pembina Institute is influentially represented on Alberta’s climate panel.If Pembina Institute and CAPE are so keen to phase-out coal, maybe they should write the first estimated $11.1 billion compensation cheque, plus $11 billion to transition to natural gas, plus millions more for power grid interties and infrastructure. Maybe they should pick up the tab for you and I of the tripled power costs that would be the end result if they succeed in foisting renewables – wind and solar – upon us.There is a federal coal plant retirement program in place. If we wait 10 years, most of the coal-fired power plants will retire on their own and it won’t cost taxpayers these billions, often presented as only “pennies a month.”Google engineers have shown that wind and solar are not effective for power generation, they are ridiculously expensive, they mess up the grid, and they do not address climate change or air pollution.Friends of Science, maligned by many, appear to be the only watchdog ferreting out the evidence over climate change ideology. That’s why we deserve ink – to clear the air of eco-smog.– 30 –RE: Edmonton Journal “Hot spots depict how coal plants contribute to Edmonton pollution in new Environment Canada images.” Oct. 8, 2015 http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/hot-spots-depict-how-coal-plants-contribute-to-edmonton-pollution-in-new-environment-canada-images“Computer-generated video shows pollution spread across the Prairies” Oct 8, 2015 http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/computer-generated-video-shows-pollution-spread-across-the-prairies-1.3261783To read the full letters to both outlets, read this blog post.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/08/16
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/08/14/lies-misinformation-and-demagoguery/,,"LIES, MISINFORMATION, AND DEMAGOGUERY"," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ August 2016 – Energy economist.On Saturday, August 20, 2016, a coalition of environmental groups in Eastern Ontario will demonstrate in Ottawa to oppose Trans Canada Pipeline’s proposed Energy East Pipeline project. Like previous campaigns waged against the Keystone XL Pipeline and others in Canada, the information being disseminated and endlessly repeated by Ecology Ottawa and many of the other organizers is blatantly wrong and misleading, and the exercise itself represents an attempt to severely politicize a decision-making process that should be left to the National Energy Board.It would take a book to adequately explain all that is wrong with the opponents’ objections to Energy East. Within Canada, the main substantive claims come down to two – that the construction and operation of the Energy East Pipeline will threaten the quality of water supplies and that building additional oil pipeline infrastructure will harm the global climate. Alleged Threats to Water QualityThe effects of a pipeline on the water quality along its route will be determined by several factors, the most important of which include the route chosen, the design of the pipeline, the special precautions taken by the pipeline operator to avoid, detect and respond to any spill that might happen, the likely size of the spill, and the diligence of the regulators that approve the initial construction of the pipeline and regulate it throughout its operational life. It is extremely unlikely that any of the environmentalists who will demonstrate on August 20 have any expertise in these subjects. The National Energy Board is an independent, expert, quasi-judicial regulatory body that will review these facts and come to a recommendation for the federal Cabinet.Are pipelines safe in general? There are hundreds of thousands of miles of oil pipelines now operating in Canada and the United States, most of which underlie rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands of all kinds and sizes, and have done so safely for many decades.Opponents love to focus on the worst possible cases of potential oil spills and present these in their propaganda as the most likely cases. This is, of course, flagrantly dishonest, but they seldom get called out for doing it. In fact, oil pipelines are by far the safest way to transport oil and refined products. According to the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, between 2002 and 2012, over 99.999% of oil transported by pipeline in Canada was delivered safely and without incident. During that period, 14 pipeline accidents occurred involving the release of crude oil. Of these, 57% involved the release of less than 6 barrels of oil; 14% between 6 and 160 barrels; 21% between 165 and 6,300 barrels, and 1% over 6,300 barrels.Trans Canada Pipelines (TCPL) has committed that the pipeline will be designed, built and operated in ways that meet or exceed industry standards. In operation, it will be monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year from TCPL’s operations control centre. It will use a leak detection strategy using multiple real-time leak detection methods including real-time transient modeling, pressure-flow monitoring, software-based line balance checks, in-line inspections, and periodic aerial and ground monitoring. Alleged Effects on the Global ClimateIf one accepts the thesis that catastrophic climate change may be caused by human-made GHG emissions, how much difference to the world’s emissions would be made if the Energy East pipeline were not built? This can be demonstrated in percentage terms. Canada produces 1.6 % of global GHGs. All current oil sands production accounts for 6.5% of Canadian emissions. The emissions associated with the oil that would be transported by Energy East would, at most, represent about 20% of the production from the oil sands. If you multiply those figures (i.e. 1.6 x .065 x .2), you can calculate that the production of oil for the Energy East project would contribute 0.02% of global emissions. In other words, it is one five thousandth of annual global emissions. That is much less than the rounding errors used for statistical analysis. So, in the worst case, the emissions that would be avoided by rejecting the Energy East project can hardly be measured.What difference does one pipeline make in global terms? Despite the recent decline in oil prices, infrastructure investment is booming.  In 2015, 1,115 miles of new crude oil pipelines were constructed in the United States and 352 miles in Canada out of a global total of 1,886 miles. Crude oil pipelines under construction now that will be completed in future years total 3,885 miles in the United States and 2,968 miles in Canada out of a global total of 10,626 miles. Total onshore oil and natural gas pipeline construction worldwide in 2015 totaled more than $40 billion. The people of North America and the world are demonstrating that they want access to modern energy services and do not believe the radical environmentalists’ rhetoric.The opponents of this one pipeline among the many others being built in the world today do not seem to realize that 85% of the emissions associated with the oil fuel cycle occur at the final consumption, or tailpipe, stage. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently projected world oil consumption to increase by 36% above 2010 levels through 2040, with demand growth strongest in the less developed countries, and especially in China and India. With lower oil prices, the demand increases may be even faster.Energy East is a $15.7 billion investment, 100% privately financed. It would create thousands of person-years of employment during the construction stage and billions of dollars in revenue for the federal and provincial governments over its operating life. It would reduce Canada’s oil imports by 566,000 barrels per day and increase our oil exports by almost as much, thus significantly improving our balance of payments. This means nothing to the pipeline’s opponents, but it should mean something to those who care about Canada’s people.– 30 –Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Energy East', 'Uncategorized']",2016/08/14

Included is a short discussion of the coal phase-out and some of the significant unintended consequences.LAYMAN Alberta’s Proposed Climate Plan w AUG 09 2016 NEAR FINAL REVHere is a more complete and more complex powerpoint that was presented at our information night. “Alberta’s Climate Plan.” This presentation also includes climate data that disputes the claims of an increase in extreme weather events. As well, more details and references to the various economic models used to calculate the “Social Costs of Carbon” form part of this presentation.There is a short written report version that is 8 pages long. Alberta Climate Plan report is  (8 pages)   more technical version with referencesFor analysts, an even more technical version with references.Dr. Ross McKitrick, professor of economics at the University of Guelph, assisted Friends of Science in compiling a layman’s look at the Social Costs of Carbon.He also did a series of short video clips that discuss costs, benefits, consequences, and perceptions of Social Costs of Carbon.We hope you find these useful and informative.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/08/08/an-open-letter-to-clients-and-investors-of-nei-investments/,renewableguy ,An Open Letter to Clients and Investors of NEI Investments," So you really think your investments are ethical, or for that matter, secure?Albertans are rightfully concerned about 107. Submission_NEI Investments_ investor collaboration_Signatories made by NEI Investments to the Alberta Climate Panel and a supporting document Transitioning to a Low-carbon Energy System NEI [1] Your group has been identified in Submission 107 suggesting that, by proxy, your group is in agreement with the views presented in this submission.Your group is influentially affecting the economy of Albertans and Canadians in what we believe to be damaging and unethical ways.Examples:Focus List 2016 EN (1) NEIAffecting Energy Policies outside of Electoral Process NEI Investments – Federal Sustainable Development StrategyActivist Shareholders Suncor Energy NEI investments lobbying of suncorIt is our understanding that bodies dealing in securities and investments must employ continuous disclosure related to material evidence and must state uncertainties. We believe NEI to have failed in this regard on the issue of climate change and ‘carbon risk’ and other market factors.Outdated climate information: Are your investments at risk due to reliance on outdated scientific premise and extreme assessment of carbon risk? In the document “Transitioning…” NEI notes that since 2001 you have accepted a catastrophic view of human influence on climate and you relied on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claims that Greenhouse Gases (especially carbon dioxide) must be reduced to prevent harmful consequences.15-year hiatus in global warming, now 18+ years despite a rise in carbon dioxide By 2013 the IPCC reported there had been a 15-year pause (now 18+ years) in warming despite a significant rise in Greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) which was thought to be the principle ‘knob’ controlling climate change;Natural influence on climate recognized as driver: In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change modified its definition of climate change to include natural or human factors as drivers of climate changeEquilibrium Climate Sensitivity revised downward by IPCC: The IPCC revised the low end of the  “Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity” (ECS) likely range downward by half a degree in the AR5 (2013) report,2 meaning that in their opinion warming might only reach 1.5 °C due to a doubling of CO2 concentrations.[2] The climate sensitivity based on observational evidence using the latest estimates of greenhouse and aerosol changes and including long-term natural warming since the Little Ice Age and urban warming is 1.0 ºC, which is a third of that reported by the United Nation’s climate panel. The climate model warming trend from 1980 of the bulk atmosphere is 2.5 times greater than the warming measured by weather balloons and satellites. The climate models are wrong. Judith Curry discusses these uncertainties in climate forecasting in her US Senate Testimony of 2014.[3]Consensus – In “Transitioning…” you reference ‘consensus’ on climate change. This misleads investors, politicians, and the public. There is only a consensus that warming has occurred since ca. 1850, leaving the cold climate cycle of the Little Ice Age.[4] There is no consensus[5] on the cause of the Current Warm Period (human or natural) which appears to be in the range of the Medieval Warm Period of (800-1250AD). There is no consensus on the ratio of causation, nor on effective mitigation if any, nor cost-benefit of same. Richard Tol, economist and lead author of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment (AR5) Impacts and Mitigations notes that he and many other economic experts agree that “..a century of climate change is not worse than losing a decade of economic growth.” [6] Numerous qualified climate scientists dispute catastrophic claims; your documents should rightly reflect these uncertainties.Carbon risk: The US Office of Management and Budget recommends using a range of discount rates from 3% to 7%. The Alberta Climate panel quotes social cost of carbon (SCC) values using a 2.5% discount rate. The FUND model estimates the SCC in 2010 drops from US$29.69 using climate model simulated climate sensitivity to CO2 emissions and a 2.5% discount rate to -US$0.87 using climate sensitivity from the recent peer-reviewed paper Lewis & Curry (2015) and a 5% discount rate. The negative value indicates that CO2 emissions are net beneficial. Taking into account a new 2016 estimates of aerosol forcing, natural warming from the Little Ice Age and urban warming, the SCC drops to about -$15 at a 5% discount rate.Market Manipulation and Interference in Fair, Efficient, and Open Competition Regulations for power generation in Alberta. NEI investment organization has become a political activist. According to your “Transitioning…” document you have materially affected Alberta and Canadian government policy, based on your reliance on this out-of-date information.This may put your existing investments in various companies and banks at risk as the measures being imposed due to your advocacy and influence, are detrimental to industry, consumers and the overall economy. The cost of phase-out of coal is estimated to be more than $22 Billion.[7]It may also put your group at risk for meddling in power generation markets, specifically in Alberta. Your document Getting Real About The Energy Transition ETHICAL INVEST PART OF NEI  [8] you state “Furthermore, denouncing one industry has the potential to reinforce political divisions and stifle rather than advance change.”  Yet on the same page, you say of coal companies: “Coal is the most damaging fossil fuel and we have therefore set the highest expectations for this industry.” Clearly, you are creating discriminatory practices in the Alberta market where some 64% of our power generation (2015) comes from coal. (By contrast both ‘green’ Germany and Denmark operate on some >40% coal which Denmark must import at $60/t. Alberta has an abundant coal supply, a competitive advantage for local industry in terms of low-cost power generation.)Likewise, in accordance with Fair, Efficient, Open and Competitive (FEOC)[9] regulations in Alberta, it seems that you are distorting the markets with your undue influence, in possible violation of the spirit of FEOC if not the fact, particularly in light of your focus on pushing wind and solar, and carbon pricing, suggesting a Conflict of Interest.Your claims of being a socially responsible, ethical investor are contradicted by the fact that coal phase-out will result in the loss of at least 7,000 jobs and the destruction of 30 Alberta communities, not to mention burdensome rise in power prices for Alberta consumers and businesses. Similar policies in other jurisdictions have led to double and tripled power prices and wide-spread heat-or-eat poverty. How is this ethical or socially responsible?The IPCC does not make any recommendations;[10] does not provide supporting evidence for claims on decarbonization versus wide scale renewables. Recent peer-reviewed paper by Cambridge profession Michael J. Kelly illustrates that a ‘low-carbon’ economy will decimate society;[11] analysis by Vaclav Smil shows that all ‘low-carbon’ devices like wind and solar require massive amounts of fossil fuels in their production,[12] making the claim of a ‘low-carbon’ economy an oxymoron and inherently untrue.Future fossil fuel demand suggests there will be a shortfall in supply unless current investors step up and ensure future supply. [13]In closing, we believe your investment organization is acting on unsupported ideological claims about climate science, carbon risk, and a non-existent low-carbon economy and your claims are not supported by the evidence or by authoritative bodies.Further, by aggressively interfering in energy markets regarding the use of coal in Alberta, and by manipulating provincial and federal climate and carbon policies through your investment influence, you put the nation of Canada and your own investments, at risk of economic decline overall.The current drop in solar activity suggests an imminent solar minimum,[14] which historically has led to unstable weather extremes and a significant drop in regional and even global temperatures.  There is significant uncertainty about climate science predictions and society should be prepared for the possibility of warming or cooling.  In the event of cooling, fossil fuels will be the most valuable stocks.In our opinion, the market interference by NEI Investments puts the nation’s economy and energy security at risk by an unelected, unaccountable body.  We do not believe this to be in the interests of your investors or the electorate.  We do not believe this to be in keeping with due process, due diligence related to investment offerings, or democratic principles.FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETYAboutFriends of Science has spent a decade reviewing a broad spectrum of literature on climate change and have concluded the sun is the main driver of climate change, not carbon dioxide (CO2).

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/08/07/on-appointing-a-social-justice-lawyer-to-a-science-portfolio/,renewableguy ,On appointing a social justice lawyer to a science portfolio," By Albert Jacobs,   Geol.Drs,  P.Geo. Albert Jacobs is one of the co-founders of Friends of Science Society.  Albert Jacobs is one of the co-founders of Friends of Science Society.  Until very recently he was editor/publisher of Friends of Science Society’s very popular “Cli=Sci” climate science bi-weekly round-up of recent academic papers offered to members.The Honourable Catherine McKenna, appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as our new Minister of Environment and Climate Change, has been in the news. Politicians like that, as long as the news is good. But the Minister has been under fire on the social networks. Two items drew our attention in the past weeks. In one Twitter encounter, she reportedly called someone a climate “denier” and advised them to get another hobby. I know of no scientist who “denies” that the earth climate varies; it also does not behove a Minister of the Crown to use expressions related to the Holocaust.  By her using the expression, I must also conclude that social justice lawyer McKenna has no idea of how science works. However, if she does, then it is she who is the denier.In addition, she advertised a job opening for a “climate change communication Special Assistant”, bilingual, with an English or journalism degree and experience in writing communication material on public policy matters. Those qualifications are exactly what she does not need.(See full text of ad below)As a Professional Geologist and – consequently – a student of climates past, present  and future, I can claim some knowledge of the science related to changes in climate, which have been happening on all time scales during the existence of our planet. Yes, in essence, climatology is part of the earth sciences, a fact the IPCC has barely acknowledged. In fact, astronomy and solar physics are also playing a dominant role in those changes, a fact recognised in the science literature by researchers as much as a century ago.IPCC has been created by the UN and its meteorological body (WMO) to focus on the perceived influence of increasing human-contributed carbon-dioxide (CO2 or “carbon” as they call it because that is conveniently dirty and black) and the effect of industry and power usage on warming of the atmosphere. CO2 occurs in the atmosphere as four molecules in ten thousand. It is being exhaled by homo sapiens and his vertebrate friends at a rate of a hundred times as much. Seven billion human beings and untold numbers of animals do this day and night. Talk about anthropogenic causes.Well, it’s of course part of the life cycle of CO2, one of the most useful non-polluting gases in our atmosphere. Life depends on it.We are told we have to cut down on CO2 because of a perceived relationship between CO2 levels in the atmosphere and increasing  Global Mean Temperature (GMT).  I will not go into the never-ending discussions about the minutiae of happenings in our atmosphere, except for a few main points:The actual GMT is an elusive beast. Density of observation stations and accuracy of measurements vary wildly and 70% of the surface is ocean. Its assumed values are the result of multiple, rather subjective statistical adjustments and manipulations as brought to light by the published evidence from ClimateGate.In this aspect ,the variations of decimal portions of a degree Celsius are near irrelevant. They’re in the error band of statistics.Accuracy of sea levels and water temperatures measurements are equally low and there is a great discrepancy between satellite readings and coastal gauges, probably due mostly due water movement.A causal basis of the relationship between CO2 and Temperature only exists in that CO2 follows changes in global temperature on all scales of geologic time. Not the other way around.The earth’ climate changes over time, due to multiple natural forces in the planet itself and in the solar system. While this has been recognised by scientists for a long time, the IPCC deliberately ignores or trivialises these forces and depends only on atmospheric physics to prove its political point.Those forces are orbital and magnetic in character and mostly cyclic in nature; they influence each other and set up a near-chaotic dynamic system that the linear equations of the IPCC’s computer programs cannot deal with.The result has been a wide divergence between the IPCC’s projected temperature increase and the reality of empirical data, the observed temperatures of the last twenty years. The computer simulations don’t come close to reality.This goes to prove that climate science is not an open and shut case.Obviously, “The Science Is [Not] Settled”.  But the computer projections are taken as “proof” and we are now building a worldwide trillion dollar carbon tax/subsidy scheme on what is an unproven hypothesis.Scientists are educated to reason and to question. The research scientist posts a hypothesis or a theory and expects critique. He discusses with his critics. The critics try to falsify his theory. If they succeed, the theory is no more.  The word denier is absent from this process.The IPCC does not even engage in such a process. It does not accept criticism and it does not discuss.However, there is ample material to draw from.  While the IPCC has been accused of having the main science periodicals in its pocket, there are dozens of other journals (not to speak of internet blogs) that have published critical papers, “peer-reviewed” and all.Even the IPCC’s own publications are a fertile ground for doubt. In the thousands of pages of the Working Group I (“The Physical Science”) reports one can find many expressions of doubt and uncertainty by the actual scientists it depends on for its work. Their doubt and uncertainties never make it into the “Summary for Policy Makers”, which publications are distributed to politicians and media. Scientists have been known to resign because of the distortions.Now to Minister McKenna.She is a lawyer and an economist, specialised in social justice, human rights and international trade. She has had a great career so far and is undoubtedly a clever lady.  But why is she so terribly miscast in her cabinet position?She has no science in her background to speak of.  She has lived her life on one side of C.P. Snow’s dividing line in his “The Two Cultures”.Has she read any of the critical summaries on her assigned file? The independent NIPCC reports come to mind. Does she understand that this is still a politics-burdened, scientifically uncertain project that she is on? Very uncertain? With billions of citizen’s dollars at stake?Does she feel comfortable having to depend solely on the advice of her own civil servants for decisions of this magnitude in a field with which she is unfamiliar?If she labels scientists-opponents to her pre-conceived ideas about climate change with the obnoxious label “deniers”, it’s high time she gets herself educated on this file from the other side of Snow’s cultural divide.  I know a few professors in Ottawa who may be pleased to put her straight.That brings me to the other item mentioned above: Her job opening for a Special Communication Assistant. I can’t see that the requirements for such a job should be anything less than that of a B.Sc. who can write well. With the slump in the resources industry, there must be many candidates to choose from.What we do not need is more pablum for the masses.-30 –Full text of ad from Minister McKenna’s facebook page:Job Posting for The Office of the Minister of Environment and Climate ChangePosition: Special Assistant, CommunicationsAre you passionate about our environment and tackling climate change?Are you a talented writer that is able to communicate complex issues to a broad audience?

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/07/30/the-2016-u-s-democratic-party-platform/,Kelly Carter ,The 2016 U.S. Democratic Party Platform," Note: This is a technical update to an old post.  A reader notified us of a dead link to the Democratic Party platform in one of our linked stories. The platform document has been loaded here for historical reference (see bottom of the page).Contributed by Robert Lyman ©  July 2016I don’t know whether you have read the 2016 Democratic Party Platform* setting out what Hillary Clinton and her party are pledged to do if she is elected President. I am sure that 99% of Americans have not.The platform is full of promises to expand the social entitlements system, including offers to have taxpayers pay all the cost of university and college tuition, expand health care insurance, guarantee against any reductions in current programs, and implement new programs to benefit women, visible minorities and LGBT individuals. There is a promise to move towards legalizing marijuana, to expand public funding for abortions, to close private prisons and privately-operated schools, to close the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, to abolish the death penalty, to increase gun controls, and a host of other liberal-favoured causes. The Democrats would refuse to sign the Trans Pacific Trade Partnership, and take a skeptical approach to all future trade agreements. They would impose even more stringent controls on banks and other financial institutions, sharply raise corporate taxes (U.S. corporate taxes are already among the highest in the world) and place high surtaxes on anyone who earns more than $1 million per year. Overall, there is no doubt that the effect would be to increase spending far more than revenues, and thus to increase U.S. indebtedness.It is the areas of energy and the environment that the platform is especially striking. It states that a Democratic Party Administration would (1) meet 50% of U.S. electricity generation by renewable energy sources within a decade; (2) phase down or end hydrocarbon drilling on federal lands and in the offshore areas; (3) force a 40 to 45% reduction in methane emissions from oil and gas production and transportation; (4) severely restrict the construction of new oil and gas pipelines, possibly by subjecting them to a “climate change test” to ensure that they do not add to net emissions; (5) institute federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and (6) most significantly, reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 2005 levels by 2050, just 34 years from now. The platform guarantees massive federal funding to promote wind, solar energy, and electrified transportation systems.Bernie Sanders was quoted as saying that he was pleased with the platform, as it contains 80% of what he wanted in every area. In the field of energy, Sanders was mainly disappointed that the platform did not commit to end all hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production. I suspect that he hopes this can be achieved by regulatory means.Many political commentators are shocked by the promises made by Donald Trump. I don’t think I have seen any Trump promises that are as dangerous as the ones contained in the Democratic Party Platform. The commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 80% would mean the virtual ending of coal use, even for metallurgical steel, and the drastic reduction of oil and gas production and use to levels equivalent to those now in countries like Afghanistan. One wonders how environmental extremists could so achieve control of a major political party that it would formally embrace the ruin of a nation’s economy. However, the Bernie Sanders supporters who now control the Democratic Party agenda are deadly serious. They believe that replacing the 85% of U.S. energy now supplied by hydrocarbons with wind, solar and other green energy sources can all be done and funded by the taxpayer.The platform does not state how much global temperatures will be reduced as a result of the proposed measures.  Bjorn Lomborg, an environmental policy expert and statistician, recently published a peer-reviewed article in which he calculated the effects of the emission reduction commitments made at COP21. The U.S. commitment, he estimates, could reduce global temperatures by somewhere between 0.008 and 0.031 degrees Celsius by 2100. Reducing emissions by 80% might actually decrease global temperatures by a larger amount, but it would be unlikely to exceed 0.1 degree. Meanwhile, by 2030, China’s emissions will be four times those of the U.S., and global emissions will continue to rise inexorably regardless of what the United States does. It is all for naught.-30-*democratic party platform 2016The above Democratic Party platform document found at: http://templatelab.com/democratic-party-platform/ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/07/30
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/07/21/the-end-of-hydrocarbons-hows-that-working-out/,renewableguy ,THE “END OF HYDROCARBONS’ – HOW’S THAT WORKING OUT?," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ July 2016For those who believe the theory that humans are causing catastrophic global warming, a central tenet is that the world is quickly moving away from the use of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) and, within a few decades, will be completely converted to non-nuclear renewable energy sources. Global energy markets indeed are undergoing major transformations, but are they really changing in the way environmentalists claim? To find out, I checked the most recent reports from the two most authoritative sources of data and analysis on world energy supply and demand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).OverviewThe trends in energy supply and demand are closely related to the changes occurring in the world economy. Since 2000, the world economy has experienced a period of modest growth, followed by the financial crisis and economic recession starting in 2008, and a period of uncertain recovery during which the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have experienced slow growth rates while several developing countries, notably in Asia, have experienced quite rapid growth rates. Environmentalists’ concerns have increasingly shaped the policies of governments, so that many OECD countries have embarked on programs to replace fossil-fuel-based electricity generation by wind, solar and biomass energy generation and some countries have shut down nuclear power plants in reaction to the tsunami that disabled the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan.These developments have coincided with major changes in energy markets. Technological advances made possible the widespread development of new oil and natural gas supplies in non-OPEC areas, especially in the United States; in their efforts to regain market share, OPEC countries over-supplied the petroleum liquids markets and drove prices down to levels that, while welcome for consumers, threatened the viability of new higher-cost production. The general decline in economic activity reduced demand for all energy sources. At the same time, government policies promoted increased energy intensity and used regulations or ratepayer and taxpayer-funded subsidies to increase the use of more expensive renewable energy sources to back out coal-fired power generation.  In 2015, the prices of oil, natural gas and coal all declined significantly.In December 2015 at the COP21 Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention in Paris, several countries committed to introduce action plans with a goal of limiting the increase in average global temperatures. Subsequently, some governments stated that this entailed virtually eliminating the use of fossil fuels by 2050.Given these developments, are global energy consumers following the environmentalist script? Let us examine the most recent trends. OilWorld oil demand grew from 89 million barrels per day (mmb/d) in the first quarter of 2011 to 96 mmb/d in the second quarter of 2016. Both EIA and IEA expect 2016 oil demand to grow by 1.4 mmb/d. The IEA foresees a further growth of 1.3 mmb/d in 2017, while EIA foresees a 1.5 mmb/d increase. Most of this growth is taking place in non-OECD countries.OPEC crude oil production averaged 31.8 mmb/d in 2015, an increase of 0.8 mmb/d over 2014. Another 0.8 mmb/d increase is expected in 2016. The increases are coming from Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia.Non-OPEC production appears likely to fall by 0.9 mmb/d in 2016, before staging a modest recovery in 2017.Oil supply is not constrained by resource limitations, but by demand and competition from lower-cost OPEC sources of supply. Natural GasWorld demand for natural gas grew for most of the post-2000 period at the rate of 2.2% per year. Since 2012, growth has slowed to 1.0% per year. The IEA projects total demand to increase at a faster rate of 1.5% per year to 2021, and to reach 3.9 trillion cubic metres per year then.Within the United States, gas prices are unlikely to fall much further from the very low level of 2015. This largely exhausts the potential for economically motivated switching from coal to gas for electricity generation. Thus, increases in gas-fired generation from 2015 levels will probably be limited to the need to replace some of the coal-fired capacity that retires.In China, gas demand growth averaged 15% per year between 2009 and 2014, but slowed to 4% in 2015. This is due to lower economic activity. Over the longer term, natural gas demand is expected to grow sharply (in the range if 9% annually) if the Chinese carry though with their announced intentions to reduce coal consumption for air quality reasons.The IEA projects that gas demand in India will grow at 6% per year into the early 2020’s.The IEA foresees a period of global gas oversupply extending into the early 2020’s. This is largely due to the expansion of global LNG export capacity, forecast to be 45% between 2015 and 2021, 90% of which will originate from the United States and Australia. A substantial amount of capital has already been allocated for these projects; the investment decisions have been made. CoalCoal remains the second-largest energy source used worldwide – behind only petroleum liquids – and, according to the EIA, this will remain the case until at least 2030.The EIA projects world coal consumption to increase from 2012 to 2040 at an average rate of 0.6% per year, from 153 quadrillion BTU in 2012 to 169 quadrillion BTU in2020 and 180 quadrillion BTU in 2040. Ninety per cent or more of this increase will occur in the non-OECD countries.Over the period to 2040, EIA projects that China, the United States and India will represent 70% of world coal use. India’s coal use will surpass that of the United States somewhere around 2030.This does not take account of the possible effects of the Obama Administration’s proposed “Clean Power Plan”, which would significantly reduce coal-fired electricity generation. Early in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a “stay” on the enforcement of the Clean Power Plan regulations until the courts have dealt with the many lawsuits against them. Even if this plan were to proceed, however, it would only reduce U.S. coal consumption by 3 quadrillion BTU in 2040, so that global coal-related energy use would only rise to 177 quadrillion BTU instead of 180 quadrillion BTU. ConclusionAccording to the most authoritative energy forecasting organizations in the world, the demand for oil, natural gas and coal will continue to increase beyond the end of their projection periods. These projections are based upon realistic assessments of the likely changes in the global energy marketplace as a result of current government policies, including those intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through subsidies, mandates and regulations.There is a profound difference between the future as projected by these experts and those prescribed by advocates of dramatic and costly actions to reduce GHG emissions. The latter demand a virtual 100% reduction in fossil fuel use by 2050; the former foresee continuing increases in emissions driven largely by the aspirations of people in the developing countries for a higher standard of living and greater energy security.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/07/03/hey-you-get-out-of-my-car/,oldbrew ,"HEY, YOU! GET OUT OF MY CAR!"," Contributed by energy economist Robert Lyman @ July 2016Environmentalists across Europe and North America seem determined to wage war on oil-fueled motor vehicles, including private cars, light trucks and heavier trucks used for freight. The most recent example of this is the announcement that Norway and the Netherlands, heavily influenced by the European Green Party, may ban car manufacturers from selling cars and light trucks fueled by gasoline or diesel fuel by 2025. It wasn’t enough to raise fuel taxes and carbon taxes to punishing levels; an outright ban was called for. The Environment Minister for Germany was quoted as saying that Germany might do the same, but quickly retreated from that after a strong public reaction. This is all allegedly to “save the planet”, the often repeated mantra of those who believe in the theory that humans are causing catastrophic climate change and that this can be stopped if we all just stopped emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Of the many false premises that underlie this view, this note will address three that can be tested empirically: first, that private motor vehicles, including passenger and commercial vehicles, constitute a large share of the global emissions; second, that significant reductions in vehicle ownership are occurring in developed countries, and specifically in Europe and North America; and third, that the number of vehicles owned and operated globally is declining in line with the Green agenda. The most authoritative source of data on international energy supply, demand and emissions is the International Energy Agency. In 2015, it published its analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion, measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent, that occurred in 2013, the most recent year for which full information is available. The global total was 32.2 gigatonnes. Of this, 7.4 gigatonnes were from transport, and only 5.5 gigatonnes were from road transport (i.e. cars, trucks, buses, etc.). In other words, road transport constituted only 17% of the total emissions from fuel combustion. 83 % were from other sectors – electricity and heat production, manufacturing and energy production, residential and commercial, and others. Cars and trucks are not the “villains” environmentalists make them out to be. The best source of data on worldwide vehicle ownership is the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA). Every year, OICA publishes online statistics on the numbers of personal vehicles (PV) and commercial vehicles (CV) owned. The most recent report includes information on the ten-year period 2005 to 2014. The following table compares the situation at the beginning and end of the period.WORLDWIDE VEHICLES IN USE(Million units)Area                                        2005                                       2014                                                 PV       CV       Total               PV       CV       Total            Europe                        277     45        322                 328     54        382Europe (newMembers)*                 32        5          37                    43        7          50Eastern Europe**      42        10        52                   68        15        83North America           165     113     278                    168     148     316Central and SouthAmerica                      37        13        50                    63        24        85Asia/South Pacific     157     60        217                 318     90        408Africa                          18        8          26                    29        13        42World                         654     239     893                 907     329     1,236* includes former centrally planned economies in central/eastern Europe** includes Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and othersIf one examines the changes over the decade, a number of points emerge:North America comes closest to the “Green” goal of reducing PV ownership, as PV ownership has stabilized (at a high level of ownership per capita).Despite the hype about Europe, PV ownership both in the traditional European Union and in the new members combined has increased from 309 million in 2005 to 396 million in 2014, a 28% increase.Ownership of PV’s is increasing at a remarkably rapid pace in the Asia/South Pacific areas, more than doubling in a decade from 157 million to 318 million PVs. The increase in PV ownership in Asia/South Pacific over the decade came close to equaling the total number of PVs in North America at the beginning of the decade.The rate of growth in commercial vehicle ownership has been much slower, reflecting the effects and aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Still, CV ownership has increased by 50% in Eastern Europe, Central and South America, Asia and Africa.The ownership of oil-fueled vehicles globally has increased by 38% from 893 million to 1.2 billion in a decade. The figures in the table do not indicate China’s role. There, personal vehicle ownership increased from 21.3 million PVs in 2005 to 115.9 million PVs in 2014, an increase of 444%. The record is clear. The emissions associated with road transport globally are only about one-sixth of the total. Left to their own free choices, the people of the world are deciding to increase their ownership and use of personal and commercial vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel fuel.  With current political leadership, it is possible that the exercise of state power to ban such behaviour and to police against it could change this pattern in Europe and North America. It certainly will not in Asia or the other fast-growing regions of the world.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['EU', 'Leap Manifesto', 'Ontario', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/07/03
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/06/25/promises-promises/,,"PROMISES, PROMISES"," Contributed by energy economist Robert Lyman @ June 2016In a previous post (Climate Change Targets for Canada: Examining the Consequences June 2015), I examined the history of climate change agreements prior to last December’s Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention (COP 21) in Paris. I noted that previous agreements have included a series of targets for national and global greenhouse gas emissions reductions. In each case, countries failed by a considerable margin to meet the targets; nonetheless, in each succeeding agreement the parties set an even more demanding target. The targets, in effect, were made to be missed; their purpose was mainly political. At COP 21, the Parties finally realized that agreeing on another yet-more-stringent target was not credible, so they adopted a new strategy. They agreed to not set explicit goals to cut their emissions. Consequently, the COP 21 agreement is not a treaty, there are no binding legal requirements, there is no formula for determining what each country’s obligations are, and there are no penalties for non-compliance. Prior to the conference, however, the Parties were asked to submit “intended nationally determined contributions’ (INDCs) to the collective political goal of mitigating and adapting to climate change. 186 countries submitted INDCs. These eventually will be given some degree of higher political (though not necessarily legal) status as five-year plans. For the time being, they represent the public’s best source of information as to what countries plan to do, how much they plan to spend, and which conditions they will place on future compliance with the political agreement. The United Nations Environment Program provides the most objective source of information available as to the contents of the INDCs and what they might mean. On October 30, 2015, the UN secretariat published a Synthesis Report on the aggregate effect of the intended nationally determined contributions. Here are some highlights from that report. The INDC’s submitted represented 75% of the Parties and 86% of global emissions in 2010.Many INDCs contained quantified emission reduction targets, which took a variety of forms and were set in relation to a variety of baselines (e.g. 1990, 2000, 2010, etc.)Some Parties indicated that they reserved to right to revise their INDCs in the light of the outcome of discussions on the financing of the efforts of the less developed countries.Several of the INDCs highlighted the link between the implied actions to reduce emissions and their development priorities, including social and economic development and poverty elimination.If all the countries perform in accordance with the plans set out in their INDCs, this would result in aggregate global emission levels of 55.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GTCO2e) in 2025 and 56.7 GTCO2e in 2030. Global emissions would be 34-46% higher than 1990 levels by 2025 and 37-52% higher than 1990 levels by 2030. Emissions would be 8-18% higher than 2010 levels by 2025 and 11-22% higher than 2010 levels by 2030.Even if all INDC actions are taken, total GHG emissions will be 8.7 GTCO2e (19%) higher in 2025 and 15.1 GTCO2e (35%) higher in 2030 than what would be required to stay on a path towards the IPCC goal of restraining post-industrial average global temperature increases below 2 degrees C. The INDCs of some countries are of special interest. The Obama Administration in the United States submitted an INDC stating it would reduce net GHG emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels in 2025. This compares to the U.S.’s previous commitment at Copenhagen to reduce net GHG emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. China’s INDC stated that country’s intention to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 60% to 65% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to peak its CO2 emissions by 2030 at the latest. The peak would be at an emissions level of around 13.6 GTCO2e by 2030, according to Climate Action Tracker, a website that follows and promotes actions to reduce global emissions; the carbon intensity target would imply a 2030 emissions level of 15-16.9 GTCO2e. That means by 2030 China’s GHG emissions could be four times those of the United States. India’s INDC stated that it would lower the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil based power generation capacity to 40% of installed electric power capacity by 2030. Carbon Brief, another website that monitors and advocates for emissions reductions, in September 2015 began tracking and calculating the financial implications of the pledges made in the INDCs, based largely on what the developing countries say they will need from the developed countries. This does not include the huge amount of money that would be spent by the developed and developing countries from their own resources in attempting to reduce emissions. The call on developed countries for financial assistance now adds up to U.S. $3.5 trillion. Of this, $2.5 trillion has been requested by India alone. The remaining $1 trillion is made up of financial estimates of aid required by 72 other developing countries. Developed countries have “promised” to provide $100 billion per year by 2020. Only a small fraction of that has been committed to date, and there are questions as to whether the U.S. Congress will approve the expenditures promised by the Obama Administration. The post-COP 21 agenda will include a difficult (perhaps impossible) negotiation over how much the developed countries will commit in future and how the global total of $100 billion will be shared among both the contributing countries and the receiving countries. A total requirement of $3.5 trillion to 2030, if accepted, would mean that developed countries would have to contribute $350 billion per year from 2021 to 2030. As many of the developing countries’ INDCs are contingent on receiving the funding they consider necessary, a failure to meet their demands would almost certainly mean that the countries where the highest emissions growth is occurring would not meet even their limited emission reduction goals. For governments that accept the theory of human-induced catastrophic global warming, the COP21 agreement has served as a rallying point around which they have harangued their publics with the need for urgent action on climate change. They have used it to push extraordinary measures including carbon taxes, regulations, mandates, and subsidies. The credibility of these measures rests in part upon the public’s acceptance that this is a global action to which all countries are committed. If past performance on targets is any guide, it should become clear fairly soon that developed and developing countries alike are unlikely to accept the financial pain involved. Developed countries like the United States and Canada may face an ultimatum from the developing countries. If we don’t pay, they won’t play. COP 21 easily could end up just like all the other empty promises.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['EU', 'green climate fund', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/06/25

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/06/21/geothermal-for-alberta-a-case-for-caution/,4TimesAYear ,Geothermal for Alberta? A Case for Caution.," CANGEA – the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association – has been making a concerted case for the development of direct utilization of geothermal in Alberta. They propose to use existing abandoned oil wells and repurpose them for geothermal electricity power production (at low temperatures) and as sites for geothermal heat exchange for local heating – such as building a greenhouse above or adjacent to the well.In this report,  Geothermal Alberta A Cause for Caution June 21 2016 REV Friends of Science Society reviews the potential of geothermal in Alberta and explores the differences between geothermal in well-known spots like Iceland and the differences in Canada that make geothermal a less likely power producer for Alberta.Additional literature is reviewed regarding various Enhanced Geothermal Systems around the world.This is intended to be a plain-language document for the average reader though the information has been compiled with the assistance and direction of expert Professional Geophysicists, Professional Geologists, Professional Engineers and energy economists.In general, there may be some potential in repurposing old wells, however due to serious concerns that are unique to the Alberta geology – specifically the risk of deadly hydrogen sulfide (H2S) leaks along with deep well high-pressure risks– we strongly recommend that reasonably long-term pilot work on a demo project that properly evaluates all costs and risks, be undertaken before proceeding down this path.Though somewhat different in nature, Australia’s Geodynamics “Cooper Basin” Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) 1 project offers numerous lessons. MIT reviews a number of EGS projects.2 We would hope a similarly thorough assessment of any Alberta pilot project be documented, reviewed and approved or rejected, before any further initiatives on the CANGEA proposals for geothermal for Alberta or Canada.Geothermal Alberta A Cause for Caution June 21 2016 REV Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Leap Manifesto', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/06/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/06/20/the-unseen-costs-of-wind-generated-electricity/,Rod Hailey ,THE UNSEEN COSTS OF WIND-GENERATED ELECTRICITY," A report summary contributed by Robert LymanOn April 16 2016 the Institute of Political Economy at Utah State University published a report entitled The Unseen Costs of Wind-Generated Electricity. The report was written by Megan Hansen, BS; Randy Simmons, PhD; and Ryan York, PhD. The study analyzed the findings of studies by prominent experts of the cost of wind-generated electricity in the United States. This is a summary of that report. The experts’ studies identify several factors that affect the cost of wind generation. These include capital cost, operation and maintenance cost, capacity factor, transmission costs, base load cycling, social and environmental costs, and the cost of government subsidies. Other factors are more difficult to quantify but nevertheless add to the costs; these include the opportunity cost of taxpayers’ dollars, the reduced reliability of the grid, and the effects on consumers and the economy of higher electricity prices. Federal SubsidiesData collected by the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that federal wind subsidies grew by an average of 32% each year from 2000 to 2014. Of those subsidies, the Production Tax Credit (PTC) is the largest. It was originally introduced in 1992, and then provided a subsidy of $15 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to wind energy producers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 made small wind producers (those with a capacity of 100 kilowatts or less) eligible for refunds of up to 30% of total investment cost. Producers can opt to accept this in lieu of the PTC. The ARRA also provided $31 billion for clean energy research, development and deployment. In 2013, Congress increased the amount of the PTC from $22 per MWh to $23 per MWh. According to the Institute for Energy Research, this equates to $38 per MWh in post-tax subsidy. In 2014, Congress extended the PTC further so that any project that began work before January 1. 2015 was eligible for the credit. The ARRA also established the 1603 Treasury Program, which allowed taxpayers who are eligible for the PTC, a tax benefit for producing energy from certain sources, or the Investment Tax Credit to receive a payment from the Treasury in lieu of a tax credit. The 1603 cash grant program applies to wind, geothermal, biomass and solar among other forms of renewable energy. Through May 2012, the 1603 program provided almost $8.4 billion to wind projects and in total awarded about $11.6 billion to over 37,000 renewable energy projects. That is not all. Including the PTC, Congress has created 82 initiatives overseen by nine different federal agencies to promote the production of wind energy. Wind and solar energy both receive 20 times more federal subsidies than coal or natural gas in terms of average electricity generation. Since it was expanded in 2009, the PTC has cost an average of $5 billion per year. Recent IRS decisions expanded eligibility so that costs will increase. A hidden cost of these subsidies is the opportunity cost – the cost of opportunities that could have been paid for by taxpayer money that was instead spent on policies such as the PTC. If those subsidies did not exist, the government could have used the funds for higher value economic or social programs, or it could have left the funds in taxpayers’ hands, where as consumers they could have been free to make decisions about energy consumption based on their own choices about what was the most highly valued use. Another opportunity lost is that of other existing or potentially new energy sources that might supply electricity but are not eligible for taxpayer subsidies. State-level Wind PolicyThe Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency categorizes state policies into roughly 30 specific types of incentives and policies. Many of these are grant and loan programs that finance renewable energy expansion and performance-based incentives that provide cash payments based on the amount of energy generated. States also offer rebates for installation of new renewable energy systems and equipment. Thirty-eight states have at least one rebate program for renewable energy. The most common policies used are Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), tax credits, and transmission improvements.  An RPS is a state policy intended to increase the percentage of a state’s electricity that is generated from renewable sources. It might require utilities to supply 15-25% of a state’s total electricity from renewables by 2020 or 2025. As of early 2015, 29 states and the District of Columbia have binding RPS requirements. As producing electricity from renewable sources is more expensive than producing it from conventional ones, RPS entails costs that fall to electricity consumers.

This is an important factor in comparing the costs of wind and solar generation to conventional energy generation whose operation can be controlled by the utility to match variations in demand. The estimates of the average market capacity factor of wind vary widely from report to reportTABLE 3AVERAGE CAPACITY FACTOR (%)Lazard                                    41NREL                                      38EIA                                          35Hamilton                                34Giberson                                33Tanton/Taylor                      33 Both Giberson and Taylor and Tanton note that established studies on the cost of wind energy neglect to include the total cost of building new transmission lines once the existing infrastructure is occupied. Wind, however, is a location-specific power source, and wind-friendly sites are often far from centres of consumption. They argue that the extra cost of building transmission lines should be included in the cost of wind energy. Giberson refers to a Berkeley Labs 2009 technology review that found the median cost to build transmission lines was $15 per MWh. Taylor and Tanton calculated a $27 per MWh added cost. When wind represents a high proportion of generation capacity, or where the contractual arrangements give wind generators “first-to-the-grid” rights, utilities will use wind-generated energy first. As wind is an intermittent source of supply, while demand varies with time of day and the seasons, utilities must maintain sufficient standby “dispatchable” generation to meet needs when the wind does not blow. The back-up generators, usually natural gas or coal-fired generation, cycle between use and non-use, hence the terms “base load cycling” or “load balancing”. Base load cycling increases operation and maintenance costs. Giberson considers this to add $2 per MWh to the costs of wind, while Tanton/Taylor consider that it adds $23 per MWh. As the subsidies and mandates constitute the main factors in utilities’ decisions to use renewables over conventional energy generation, Hansen, Simmons and York conclude that the cost of these subsidies should be included explicitly in the cost of wind-generated electricity. The NREL, EIA and Hamilton studies state that they have included the value of subsidies in their cost calculations; they do not give any explicit values.  Table 4 shows the cost of subsidies in the other studies. TABLE 4COST OF SUBSIDIES ($/MWh)Lazard                                    19Giberson                                23Tanton/Taylor                      19 In principle, one should add social, environmental and health costs and premia to the calculation of energy costs. This, however, is a very controversial area. While there is extensive anecdotal evidence of adverse health impacts associated with industrial wind turbines, most of the studies to date do not assign a health, or more general social, cost. The one exception is Hamilton, who calculates the added social cost of a new wind project to be $9 per MWh. The calculation of the “social cost of carbon” is, if anything, even more contentious. In this case, such a cost would constitute a premium for wind in terms of the carbons dioxide emissions avoided. However, the estimates for the correct social cost of carbon vary from $5 to $100 per tonne. Economist Robert Pindyck of MIT considers that given all the uncertainty concerning the relationship between human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and future climate changes, attempts to quantify the environmental cost or benefits of different actions are unlikely to produce useful estimates.Table 5 shows the estimated total costs of onshore wind energy, priced low to high.TABLE 5TOTAL COST OF WIND ENERGY ($/MWh)Lazard                                    59NREL                                      72EIA                                          80.3Hamilton                                97Giberson                                149Tanton/Taylor                      151 Hansen, Simmons and York’s work shows that the growth of wind energy in the U.S. is not the result of new technology and favourable market forces. Rather, wind energy’s rapid emergence is largely a response to generous federal and state subsidies intended to boost the technology and shift the U.S. energy portfolio away from fossil fuels. In 2012, wind energy represented 43% of all new electricity-generating capacity, more than any other type of energy. Environmentalists like to quote these figures as a sign of success. This growth, however, comes at a substantial cost to taxpayers and competitors in the energy marketplace. Government subsidies and state mandates are responsible for this growth. However, these incentives do not seem to be generating substantial returns in terms of electricity production. In fiscal year, 2010, for example, wind energy received 42% of direct federal subsidies for energy, more than any other type of electricity generation. Despite this, wind produced only 2 % of U.S. electricity. In 2013, that figure grew to 4%, while still receiving 37% of direct federal subsidies for energy. The costs remain far out of proportion to wind’s contribution to energy supply. One can debate how much wind-generated electricity actually costs, based on the different studies. What seems clear, however, is that the actual cost of wind-generated electricity is higher than most published cost estimates indicate. Mandates requiring the use of wind energy increase electricity costs for consumers, and subsidies mask the actual cost of doing so, while penalizing taxpayers. See the Utah State University paper here:http://www.usu.edu/ipe/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Reliability-Solar-Full-Report.pdfFor additional information on the extraordinary subsidies provided to renewable energy sources, especially since 2009, see the U.S. Congressional Budget Office report of November 2015:https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50980-EnergySupport_1.pdf Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Ontario', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/06/20
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/06/14/ontarios-subsidies-to-all-electric-cars-make-no-sense/,renewableguy ,ONTARIO’S SUBSIDIES TO ALL-ELECTRIC CARS MAKE NO SENSE," Contributed by energy economist Robert Lyman @June 2016The Liberal government led by Kathleen Wynne in Ontario recently announced a major new subsidy program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in the province. The stated goal of this taxpayer and consumer-funded program is to increase the number of electric vehicles (EVs) purchased in the province to one in twenty new car sales by 2020. In 2015, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, car dealers sold 760,511  passenger vehicles in Ontario, so the goal is sales of about 38,000 EVs by 2020. Today, there are 5935 EVs in Ontario out of a total of 18,451 EVs in Canada. Total new EV sales in Canada in 2015 were 6,933, out of total new car sales of 1,898.000. EV’s now represent 0.36 % of new car sales (roughly one in every 300 cars sold). First, consider the costs and benefits from the consumer’s perspective. The Nissan Leaf was the first “battery electric vehicle”. It uses state-of-the-art lithium batteries. In the U.S. the Leaf costs more than twice as much ($35,430 vs. $17,250) as a comparable Nissan Versa. At current electricity rates and gasoline prices, a consumer would have to drive the Leaf at least 164,000 miles to recover its initial purchase costs. Driving the Leaf 60 miles a day, it would take the consumer more than nine years to attain payback (including interest). Apart from the upfront capital cost, there are three major problems with the Leaf compared to the Versa – range, refueling time and performance in cold weather. Nissan claims that the Leaf has a range of about 100 miles. However, in a three-month road test, Car and Driver magazine obtained an average range from a full charge of 58 miles. It takes perhaps five minutes at a gas station to refuel a conventional car that will achieve 300 to 400 miles of range. In contrast, it takes 20 hours to completely recharge a Nissan Leaf from 110V house current. (A 240V charger would shorten this time to eight hours; purchase plus installation will cost from $2000 to $2600 in Canada.) Running out of gas can be an inconvenience, but running out of an electric charge would be a major headache. A dead EV would have to be loaded on a flatbed truck and taken somewhere for many hours of charging before it could be driven again. The risk might be low in sunny California, but what would happen in a major snowstorm and cold weather that snarled traffic in a city like Toronto for three hours? If there were a hundred thousand EVs on the road at the time, every one would have ended up on the side of the road, dead. What about all those environmental benefits? Well, first, you have to believe in the theory that humans are causing catastrophic global warming, a theory being undermined every day by the failure of global temperatures and weather to behave in accordance with the models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, let’s set that aside for the moment because it is not necessary to disprove either the science or the modeling of alleged global warming to show how foolish EV subsidies are. The greenhouse gas emissions associated with an EV can be calculated over its entire life cycle by including the emissions due to its manufacture. That produces 13.7 tonnes of GHGs, including 5.2 tonnes just for the battery, compared to 6.5 for a conventional car. The benefits of lower emissions during operation of EVs depend on what value one places on the emissions avoided, compared of course to the costs of avoiding them.  The Montreal Economic Institute performed an analysis of the emissions that would be avoided by replacing conventional vehicles by EVs. It assumed that each new EV would replace an average gasoline-powered car that travels 15,581 km per year (quite high given their limited range) and consumes 8.2 litres per 100 km. In this case, the use of an EV would lead to an annual reduction of 2.6 tonnes of GHG emissions. Under the Quebec program that offers $4,000 in subsidy per vehicle, the cost of the subsidy would be $1,560 per tonne avoided. Taking into account the extra tonnes of emissions related to the manufacture of an EV, the cost per tonne of the subsidy rises to $1,912. The Ontario subsidy program for EVs has been up to $8500 per vehicle; effective February 16 of this year it was raised to a ceiling of $14,000 per vehicle. That means that the cost per tonne could be up to $6,692. How large of a subsidy would be justified, assuming again that one accepted the need for any at all? One way to determine this is to compare the value of the subsidy to the market price of carbon credits traded on international markets or within cap and trade systems. The price of a tonne of GHG emissions on the Western Climate Initiative carbon market to which Ontario belongs was U.S. $12.73 per tonne for the most recent auction. On June 10, 2016 the price per tonne on international carbon markets was U.S. $5.96. Another way of calculating the maximum value of a subsidy would be to use the controversial concept of the “social cost of carbon”. This is a cost calculated as the present value of avoiding future global warming effects 100 years hence; it depends upon many assumptions, perhaps the most important of which are the discount rate (i.e. the time value of money) and the sensitivity of the climate to increased carbon dioxide concentrations. The current range of estimates of the social cost of carbon used by international institutions and governments is from $10 to $100 per tonne today, rising to $50 – $800 per tonne by 2050, depending on the discount rate used. A paper recently published by Ross McKitrick, Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation, using empirical (as contrasted with model-simulated) estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity to rising carbon dioxide levels, produced a much lower estimate of the social cost of carbon. Their estimate was in a range of $3.33 to $19.52 per tonne in 2020, depending on the parameters used. No estimate of the value of carbon as determined by actual market trading or academic estimates of the present value of future climate effects comes remotely close to justifying a subsidy for EVs as large as the one Ontario has introduced. In other words, the social costs far exceed the benefits by any reasonable standard. If one used the former Ontario subsidy of $8,500 per EV as indicative of the average subsidy under the new program, attaining the target of 38,000 EV sales in 2020 would cost $323 million. That would reduce Ontario’s annual emissions by 98,000 tonnes, compared to Canada’s annual emissions of 732 million tonnes. This is simply expensive symbolism.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'Ontario', 'Uncategorized']",2016/06/14
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/06/04/the-bp-energy-outlook-low-carbon-no/,renewableguy ,THE BP ENERGY OUTLOOK – Low Carbon? No.," Energy economist Robert Lyman summarizes the recent BP Global Energy Outlook report. Claims of a ‘low-carbon’ future are not upon us.Contributed by Robert Lyman @ June 2016British Petroleum, one of the largest energy companies in the world, recently issued its 2016 updated projections of global energy supply and demand to 2035. BP is a widely respected analyst of energy markets. Based in the United Kingdom, it is very sensitive to the demands of European governments that the alleged threat of human-induced catastrophic global warming be taken seriously, and so it accepts the presumption that the political commitments made by several governments at the COP21 Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015 will be honoured in practice. Its projections are therefore based on a combination of market-based analysis and politically influenced assumptions about international actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Given this, one might expect that BP’s projections about the changes that will occur in the world energy economy to 2035 might be closely in keeping with the political statements coming from European leaders. The European Commission has adopted the goal of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030 and is hoping to attain a reduction of global emissions by 60 to 70% by 2050. BP’s projections don’t entirely fit the script. BP projects that despite significant economic and population growth over the next 19 years, there will be an unprecedented improvement in energy efficiency, leading to much lower energy and emissions intensity per unit of GDP. It also assumes that governments will continue large subsidies to renewable energy sources and that the costs of these sources will decline sharply.  It endorses the need for carbon taxes as a way to accelerate the “progress”. Now, for the “bad news” – if you are dreaming of a ‘low-carbon economy’…according to BP’s projections: Fossil fuels, currently about 89% of global energy supplies, will provide around 60% of the additional energy and still account for 80% of energy supplies in 2035.Oil demand will increase by almost 20 million barrels per day over the Outlook.The increase in world energy consumption will be driven by the growing economies of Asia. China and India, followed by Southeast Asia and eventually Africa will drive energy and fossil fuel use significant higher. Total energy consumption will increase by 34% between 2014 and 2035.Natural gas is the fastest growing fossil fuel; its share in primary energy use will rise gradually over time.The growth in coal consumption will slow sharply, as the share of coal used in electricity generation declines from 43% to around 33%. Overall, however, coal consumption continues to rise at the rate of about 0.5% per year throughout the period.Oil, now about 97% of transportation energy demand, will constitute 88% by 2035; natural gas will provide 8%.Transportation energy demand declines in the OECD because of significant improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency, but the growth in vehicle ownership and use in the non-OECD area more than offsets this.The global vehicle fleet (commercial vehicles and passenger cars) more than doubles from 1.2 billion today to over 2.4 billion by 2035.While the rate of carbon emissions growth declines, the level of emissions continues to grow, increasing by 20% between 2014 and 2035.By 2035, global carbon dioxide emissions are projected to be about 38 billion tonnes, far above the targets set by the European Union and COP21. What the BP Outlook illustrates but does not state explicitly is that virtually all the growth in greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2035 will take place in the developing countries, in areas where the growth in energy use is driven by people’s desire for economic development and improvement in their standards of living. This growth is beyond the control of western governments or their environmental lobbies.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['EU', 'green climate fund', 'Leap Manifesto', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/06/04
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/06/02/first-nations-first-canadians-or-green-climate-fund/,,First Nations First? Canadians? Or Green Climate Fund?," There’s only one taxpayer – and we need to decide whether serving our own people’s needs should be the priority over external demands to fund ill-defined, ideological programs like the “Green Climate Fund” which has poorly defined objectives and seems to be a large slush fund. How much will we end up contributing? You’d be surprised. Read on. WHAT IS CANADA’S SHARE OF THE GREEN CLIMATE FUND?Contributed by Robert Lyman @June 2016At the COP 21 climate conference in Paris in December, 2015, the participating governments agreed that one of their priorities was to ensure that developing countries have enough funds to develop and implement “strategies, regulations, and action plans” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help their economies adapt to the effects of climate change. Paragraph 54 of the agreement states the intention of the Parties to continue and expand the Green Climate Fund, previously established at the Copenhagen conference. Specifically, paragraph 54 confirms that:“Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective mobilization goal through 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation; prior to 2025 the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement shall set a new collective quantified goal from a floor of USD 100 billion per year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries;” The COP21 agreement is, at this stage, a political agreement. It is not a treaty, there are no binding legal requirements, there is no formula for determining what each country’s obligations are, and there are no penalties for non-compliance. Nonetheless, the governments of certain countries have proceeded to act as though the agreement were binding. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, in one of his first acts after being elected, committed Canada to contribute $2.65 billion to the Green Climate Fund.Since then, outside of the Finance departments of various countries and the immense United Nations bureaucracy that supports the climate change apparatus, there has been almost no news or analysis published about what paragraph 54 of the agreement will mean.Which, for example, are the “developed countries” to which the paragraph refers? It is possible that this refers to the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), except that the OECD now includes 30 members, a number of which have recently joined or have GDP levels well outside the top tier of countries. One might define the developed countries in terms of those with the highest per capita incomes, but that would include several countries with extremely high incomes from petroleum production but relatively small economies overall. No doubt, the sponsors of paragraph 54 had someone in mind, but whom?In this note, I will speculate on the methodology that could be used to determine which countries would be considered “developed” and, more importantly, which share of the $100 billion (at least) per year each country would be responsible for.One way would be to consider as “developed” the 25 countries with the highest national incomes (GDP), and to attribute to each of them as their “share” of the Green Climate Fund a percentage equal to their share of the top 25 countries’ income. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the top 25 countries in the world had a combined GDP in 2015 of $61.4 trillion. The United States had the highest income, with $17.9 trillion and China was second with $11 trillion. Canada was in tenth place, with a GDP of $1.55 trillion (measured in U.S. dollars).A quick scan of the list indicates a possible problem. It includes a number of countries such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey, Argentina, Taiwan and Nigeria that have a high GDP but very large populations and thus low per capita incomes; many are usually considered to be “developing” countries.. Russia ranks in twelfth place and is a former superpower but it is a country now in deep economic difficulties; would it agree to contribute as a “developed” country? Even Poland falls into a grey area. Yet eliminating these countries from the list takes off 16.5 % of the potential GDP to be tapped.Canada’s share of the Top 25 GDP is 2.5%. Thus, Canada would be committed to contribute 2.5% of $100 billion per year. Assuming that the $100 billion are U.S. dollars, that equals CDN $3.26 billion per year at current exchange rates. The Trudeau contribution of CDN $2.65 billion announced in Paris would be considerably less than one year’s obligation. If a smaller list of donors were included in the list of “developed countries”, Canada’s contribution would be higher still.Canada’s Official Development Assistance, or foreign aid, of all kinds totaled U.S. $4.3 billion in 2014, the most recent year for which confirmed figures are available. As it is expected that the Green Climate Fund contributions will supplement, and not displace, current Official Development Assistance, that means Canada’s total contributions to developing countries would rise by 58% to U.S. $6.8 billion per year, or almost CDN $8.9 billion per year. That is more than is spent annually on Canada’s aboriginal peoples.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['green climate fund', 'Uncategorized']",2016/06/02

Nothing could be further from the truth. Energy economist Robert Lyman deconstructs the extreme costs and challenges of attempting to actualize the so-called “WWS – Wind Water Sunlight – vision of renewable energy.  Renewable NOT doable.FULL REPORT – Click the link below.WHY RENEWABLE ENERGY CANNOT REPLACE FOSSIL FUELS BY 2050 June 16 2016 FINAL REVA Reality CheckContributed by Robert Lyman @ May 2016  Humanity is owed a serious investigation of how we have gone so far with the decarbonization project without a serious challenge in terms of engineering reality.– Michael Kelly, Prof. Electrical Engineering, CambridgeA number of environmental groups in Canada and other countries have recently endorsed the “100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water and Sunlight (WWS)” vision articulated in reports written by Mark Jacobson, Mark Delucci and others. This vision seeks to eliminate the use of all fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) in the world by 2050. Jacobson, Delucci et. al. have published “all-sector energy roadmaps” in which they purport to show how each of 139 countries could attain the WWS goal. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the 100% goal is feasible.While a range of renewable energy technologies (e.g. geothermal, hydroelectric, tidal, and wave energy) could play a role in the global transformation, the world foreseen in the WWS vision would be dominated by wind and solar energy. Of 53,535 gigawatts (GW) of new electrical energy generation sources to be built, onshore and offshore wind turbines would supply 19,000 GW (35.4%), solar photovoltaic (PV) plants would supply 17,100 GW (32%) and Concentrated Solar Power plants (CSP) would supply 14,700 GW (27.5%). This would cost $100 trillion, or $3,571 for every household on the planet.Western Europe has extensive experience with investments in renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels. By the end of 2014, the generating capacity of renewable energy plants there was about 216 GW, 22% of Europe’s capacity, but because of the intermittent nature of renewable energy production, the actual output was only 3.8% of Europe’s requirements. The capital costs of renewable energy plants are almost 30 times as high as those of the natural gas plants that could have been built instead; when operating costs are also taken into account, onshore wind plants are 4.6 times as expensive as gas plants and large-scale PV plants are 14.1 times as expensive as gas plants. Wind and solar energy is not “dispatchable” (i.e. capable of varying production quickly to meet changing demand), which results in serious problems – the need to back up renewables with conventional generation plants to avoid shortfalls in supply, and the frequent need to dump surplus generation on the export market at a loss.The current energy system in the United States, Canada and globally is heavily dependent on fossil fuels – they generally supply over 80% of existing energy needs in developed countries and over 87% in the world as a whole. Currently, wind and solar energy sources constitute only one-third of one percent of global energy supply.The financial costs of building the 100% renewable energy world are enormous, but the land area needed to accommodate such diffuse sources of energy supply is just as daunting.Accommodating the 46,480 solar PV plants envisioned for the U.S. in the WWS vision would take up 650,720 square miles, almost 20% of the lower 48 states. This is close in size to the combined areas of Texas, California, Arizona, and Nevada.A 1000-megawatt (MV) wind farm would use up to 360 square miles of land to produce the same amount of energy as a 1000-MV nuclear plant.To meet 8% of the U.K.’s energy needs, one would have to build 44,000 offshore wind turbines; these would have an area of 13,000 square miles, which would fill the entire 3000 km coastline of the U.K. with a strip 4 km wide.To replace the 440 MW of U.S. generation expected to be retired over the next 25 years, it would take 29.3 billion solar PV panels and 4.4 million battery modules. The area covered by these panels would be equal to that of the state of New Jersey. To produce this many panels, it would take 929 years, assuming they could be built at the pace of one per second.The WWS roadmap for the U.S. calls for 3,637 CSP plants to be built. It would be extremely difficult to find that many sites suitable for a CSP plant. Packed together, they would fill an area of 8,439 square miles, about the area of Metropolitan New York. They would require the manufacture of 63,647,500 mirrors; if they could be manufactured one every ten seconds, it would take 21 years to build that many mirrors.A central component of the WWS vision is the electrification of all transportation uses. This is technically impossible right now, as the technologies have not yet been developed that would allow battery storage applicable to heavy-duty trucks, marine vessels and aircraft. Even in the case of automobiles, despite taxpayer subsidies of $7,500 per vehicle and up, the number of all-electric vehicles sold has consistently fallen far short of governments’ goals.The costs of electrifying passenger rail systems are so high that no private railway would ever take them on. Electrification of a freight railway system makes even less sense, and would cost at least $1 trillion each.The diversion of crops to make biofuels already is raising the cost of food for the world’s poor. The World Resources Institute estimates that if this practice is expanded, it will significantly worsen the world’s ability to meet the calorie requirements of the world’s population by 2050.Scientists and governments have been guilty of the “Apollo Fallacy”; i.e. of thinking that the space race is a model for the development of renewable energy. The Apollo program cost billions of dollars to demonstrate U.S. engineering prowess during the Cold War; costs, and commercial considerations, were secondary considerations, if they counted at all.The proponents of WWS grossly under-estimate the costs of integrating renewable energy sources into the electricity system. The additional costs of backup generation, storage, load balancing and transmission would be enormous.The WWS scenario calls for 39,263 5-MW wind installations in Canada at a cost of $273 billion for the onshore wind generation alone. Building a national backbone of 735 kV transmission lines would cost at least CDN $104 billion and take 20 years to complete.The WWS includes a call to shut down all coal, oil and natural gas production. It implies the closing of all emissions intensive industries, such as mining, petrochemicals, refining, cement, and auto and parts manufacturing. The political and regional backlash against such policies in a country like Canada would threaten Confederation. In short, the WWS vision is based on an unrealistic assessment of the market readiness of a wide range of key technologies. Attaining the vision is not feasible today in technological, economic or political terms.Robert Lyman is an energy economist with 27 years’ experience, former public servant and he served as a diplomat for a decade.  ~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['COP21', 'EU', 'Leap Manifesto', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/05/31

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/05/26/la-rule-of-law-comme-rempart-face-au-sectarisme-academique/,,La Rule of law comme rempart face au sectarisme académique," par Drieu Godefridi (*)Le 1er septembre 2015, un groupe d’académiques américains écrivait au président Obama et aux autorités judiciaires US une lettre pour les enjoindre à poursuivre le Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI, Washington) sur pied de la législation RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations), qui permet la poursuite d’organisations de malfaiteurs.Leur argument était que le fait pour le CEI, de promouvoir des thèses sceptiques sur la science du climat et le GIEC (groupe d’experts de l’ONU sur le climat), en étant financé par des intérêts privés — comme si le fait de ne pas dépendre de l’argent public était en soi suspect —, est équivalent à de la criminalité au sens de la législation RICO.Ensuite de quoi le CEI, jouant pleinement et fort intelligemment le jeu de la Rule of law (ce que nous appelons en français l’Etat de droit) a exigé de la George Mason University (GMU) — à laquelle certains de ces académiques appartiennent — qu’elle produise les documents établissant la façon dont ce groupe d’académiques s’est organisé, en usant d’argent public, pour entreprendre sa croisade judiciaire contre les dissidents du climat. Cela sur le pied d’une législation spécifique à l’Etat de Virginie — où git la George Mason University — le Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA), qui contraint les institutions bénéficiant d’argent public à assurer la transparence de leurs opérations.À quoi les autorirés académiques de la George Mason University répondirent que de tels documents n’existaient tout simplement pas !Saisie par le CEI, la Virginia Circuit Court vient de rendre une décision qui fera date, Christopher Horner and CEI v. George Mason University (22 avril 2016), dans laquelle le juge constate que l’université n’a pas mené les recherches qui s’imposaient pour produire les documents requis, que de toute évidence ces documents existent, et qu’ils doivent être transmis au CEI !Sur ce chapitre, la défaite de ces académiques — dont la démarche n’est pas sans évoquer la contrainte administrative dont usait le scientifique soviétique de sinistre mémoire, Lysenko, pour réduire ses adversaires scientifiques au silence — est donc totale.Dans l’autre volet de cette croisade judiciaire contre le CEI et d’autres organisations privées, plusieurs attorneys généraux — l’équivalent de nos procureurs — tous démocrates sauf un, se sont ligués pour exiger du CEI qu’il produise une décade (sic) de documents attestant de toutes ses activités, financement, communications internes, etc. en rapport avec le climat. Tout cela sans la moindre trace de la possibilité d’une quelconque infraction dans le chef du CEI.Constatant la tentative d’intimidation, le CEI décida de porter plainte. Avec efficacité, puisque l’un des attorneys généraux concernés, celui des Virgin Islands, vient de renoncer à poursuivre la procédure contre le CEI — qui s’appelle, en droit américain, un subpoena.À ce stade, la victoire du free speech paraît donc sans partage. Puissent s’en inspirer les académiques, en Europe et au Canada, qui font mêmement l’objet de tentatives d’intimidation de la part de certains collègues. Laissons le dernier mot au CEI : All Americans have the right to support causes they believe in.(*) PhD (Sorbonne), juriste (universités de Louvain & Bruxelles)~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/05/26

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/05/21/ontarios-climate-plan-vis-a-vis-wws/,,Ontario’s Climate Plan vis a vis WWS," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ May 2016Robert Lyman is an energy economist and former public servant with 27 years experience in the field and a decade of experience as a diplomat.On May 16, 2016, The Globe and Mail has recently published the details of a proposed climate change plan that the Kathleen Wynne government in Ontario proposes to implement. Public reaction has focused largely on three proposed measures – the ban of natural gas use in the province, the requirement that all new houses be heated by electrical energy, and the subsidies of up to $14,000 per vehicle and other measures designed to force the pace of electric vehicle sales. All of these measures and more are to be funded by a large carbon tax imposed on consumers.These measures, in fact, are fully consistent with the broader, long-term plan that Canada adopt the goal of “100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water and Sunlight (WWS) by 2050”. The WWS vision calls for converting all energy use (electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, industry, and agriculture/forestry/fishing) to be powered by wind, water and sunlight. It further seeks the closing of all energy production and consumption associated with fossil fuels (i.e. coal, oil and natural gas) and nuclear energy.The WWS vision includes a detailed proposal for the energy sources Canada should use by 2050. The primary supply would come from onshore wind (37.5%), offshore wind (21%), and solar photovoltaic (PV) (17.7%). Residential and commercial rooftop solar panels would add 3.4 %. Hydroelectric energy would still play an important role, supplying 16.5% of national needs. The rest would be provided by a combination of wave, tidal and geothermal energy. Along with fossil fuels, nuclear energy would be banished.This vision is based on highly questionable assumptions and expectations.In the next 34.5 years, Canada would have to install 60,000 wind turbines. That means 1,764 per year or 5 units a day every day between now and January 1, 2050. The prominent role assigned to offshore wind turbines is striking: to meet the WWS goal, we would have to build 21,155 offshore wind turbines. As of today, we have precisely none.The costs of the onshore wind facilities will range from $1.35 million to $1.8 million per MW and considerably more for offshore turbines. As the 100% WWS scenario calls for over 10 million MW of new capacity in Canada, the cost would be at least $10 trillion, and possibly as high as $18 trillion, for generation facilities. That is before considering the costs for transmission lines, grid upgrades or roads to access the facilities. Considering that Canada’s GDP is around $1.8 trillion per year, we would have to dedicate our entire economic output for 5.5 to 10 years just to pay for the wind facilities.The WWS foresees generation from hydroelectricity doubling its share of electricity supply, from 8 to 16.5 %. According to the National Energy Board 2016 report on Canadian energy supply and demand projections to 2040, hydro-based generating capacity, including small hydro and run-of–river facilities, will increase from 77 GW in 2014 to 87 GW in 2040. Due to faster growth in other forms of generation, such as wind and natural gas fired generation, the share of hydroelectricity generation is expected to decline from 59 per cent in 2014 to 57 percent in 2040. The question is, “Where in the world do the believers in WWS think the additional hydro generation is supposed to come from?”According to the WWS plan, Canada will need 27,323 wave power devices and 1,980 tidal turbines. We have zero wave devices installed in Canada at the end of 2015; indeed, there are only a few small wave power devices installed worldwide because the technology is so immature. We have not yet even begun to design or test such systems commercially in Canada.The transmission costs would be immense as the generation facilities would all be located hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometers from the main centres of electricity consumption. Even the most optimistic view puts the cost of a national backbone of 735 kV transmission lines at around CDN $104 billion and taking 20 years to complete. Once that were built, we would have to start on an equally, if not more, expensive network of collector and feeder transmission lines to every city, town, and hamlet. This simply could not be done in 35 years.The WWS roadmap calls for the shutting down of all coal, oil and natural gas production, preferably before 2030. Coal, oil and natural gas are extremely important components of the economies of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.In Canada, there are about 150,000 hybrid electric light duty vehicles on the roads. The most recent data on electric vehicles sales are to the end of June 2015. At that point in time, there were 14,300 plug-in vehicles registered in Canada, half of which were plug-in hydrids and the other half battery powered all-electric vehicles. The sales of plug-ins during the first half of 2015 were 2,779. Of the total number on the roads, most were small vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt or the Nissan Leaf; there were only 394 Teslas. As of the end of 2014, plug-in electric vehicles had 0.27 of total vehicle market share in Canada — roughly speaking, one out of every 300 cars sold in Canada is an EV.  By comparison, in 2015, total light duty vehicle sales in Canada in 2015 were 1,900,000. Plug-ins barely register.Canadian buyers are showing considerable resistance to all-electric vehicles, preferring the more user-friendly hybrids. Factors such as high prices, uncertain resale values, the inconvenience of plugging the vehicle in, the recharge time and limited range are difficult for consumers to ignore.It is difficult to imagine that moving even partially in the direction proposed by the WWS would be accepted without enormous political resistance in Canada. Business and labour groups would unite to fight against the existential threat to their incomes and future wellbeing. Consumers and taxpayers would confront governments over the high costs imposed by carbon taxes and the limitations imposed on choice. Canada’s regional divisions, already aggravated due to the uneven effects of economic recession and globalized trade, might not be containable. In these circumstances, one wonders how Confederation would survive.~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ","['Ontario', 'Uncategorized', 'WWS']",2016/05/21

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/05/18/an-ipcc-expert-reviewer-speaks-out/,Mr Jan E Christoffersen ,An IPCC Expert Reviewer Speaks Out," For the IPCC Third Assessment Report (“TAR”) I was appointed Expert Reviewer.To the IPCC I sent our report “Atmospheric CO2 and global warming: a critical review” by Jaworowski, Z., Segalstad, T.V. & Hisdal, V., published by Norsk Polarinstitutt [The Norwegian Polar Institute], 76 pp. [first edition 1991; second edition 1992].To the IPCC we also sent our peer-reviewed paper “Do glaciers tell a true atmospheric CO2 story?” by Jaworowski, Z., Segalstad, T.V. & Ono, N. (1992), published in the top international environmental scientific journal “Science of the Total Environment”, Vol. 114, pp. 227 – 284.None of these two papers were considered by the IPCC, and neither of the numerous comments which I submitted. I got the impression that the TAR draft was supposed to be final, and that the expert reviewers were there to simply give support to the report “as is”, giving the impression that a large number of researchers were supporting the IPCC report without objections. I also reacted to the deletion of 3 Norwegian meteorological stations as basis for the global temperature curve used by the IPCC TAR. For their Second Assessment Report (“SAR”) there had been 4 Norwegian stations. I checked with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, and found out that the 3 deleted Norwegian stations all had shown a decreasing temperature trend since the SAR. Hence they couldn’t be used as part of a steadily increasing temperature trend, of course! The only Norwegian station left for the use in the TAR global temperature curve was Utsira, which had shown a rising temperature trend. [I commented to the IPCC that this was indeed “cherry-picking” the temperature data, to make them fit a preconceived idea of global warming.] Because none of my comments or none of our papers were considered by the IPCC, I asked IPCC to delete my name from the list of contributors to TAR. This was refused, so my name still figures as a contributor to the TAR. Later I heard that others also experienced the same, when trying to have their names deleted, because their criticisms had been ignored by the IPCC. The only ones successful in having their names deleted, were the ones threatening with legal actions… Tom V.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/05/03/national-observer-and-desmogblog-attempt-to-rewrite-history-in-attack-on-exxon/,Graydon ,National Observer and DeSmogBlog Attempt to Rewrite History in Attack on Exxon," by Michelle Stirling @ May 02, 2016Note: This commentary is based on our reflections alone and does not intend to answer or respond on behalf of any industry or corporation.On April 26, 2016, the National Observer and DeSmogBlog had a field day with material from the Glenbow Museum archives, boldly claiming that “Imperial Oil described its climate-warming business as ‘anti-social’ “ – when such a statement is not to be found in the referenced paper.The Exxon internal paper referred to is entitled “Pollution is Everybody’s Business” and was written by H.R. Holland in 1970.  The author Holland is talking about pollution, not climate change as we know it in today’s context. DeSmogBlog-Imperial Oil Archive-Pollution-Everyone-Business-1970 (1)Indeed, the first Climate Conference in Canada was hosted by Stephen Lewis in the fall of 1988 after the June session of the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere, according to “Climate Alert.”   [Note: This link was working until May 4, 2016, or so – fortunately, we have the document in the link below. ]CIALERTVOL1-3FALL1988 climate alert climate instituteLike a Greek chorus, the same climate catastrophe cast we’ve seen over the years appear in the 1988 “Climate Alert” document, all saying the same old thing they say today – featured are James Hansen and concluding speaker – Senator Albert Gore Jr. [Net worth – then and now: http://www.climatechangedispatch.com/what-is-al-gores-net-worth.html ]It is difficult to believe that any oil company in 1970, some 18 years prior to this first Canadian ‘climate’ conference, was referring to ‘climate change’ – a term introduced to the scientific glossary only in 1975, according to NASA  and indeed there was only a firm statement on the potential for warming the planet in the Charney Report of 1979.Consequently, it appears that the National Observer is simply misapplying contemporary understandings of climate to words written 46 years ago to mislead the public and in the process they end up smearing the reputation of a corporation.Such attacks can drive share prices down and affect social license. For those who are unaware of other geopolitical pressures, there may be an effort to try and force the corporation into some kind of carbon trading? (see below)  Indeed, Exxon (the US mother corp) did suffer a hit in its credit rating recently.Looking at “Pollution is Everybody’s Business” reveals that Exxon/Imperial Oil engineer H.R. Holland was examining the broadest effects of pollution as “the addition of foreign matter to an ecological system in such quantity that the system cannot adjust successfully and suffers and undesirable change.”Carbon dioxide is not a foreign matter as it is naturally produced by humans exhaling (40,000 ppm per breath) and in huge volume by Mother Nature through out-gassing of oceans, warming soil and decomposing matter. Human industrial contributions are negligible by comparison – though the point the engineer appears to be making is that “pollution is everybody’s business’ and he describes (pg 15) how Imperial invested some$16,000,000 million from 1960 to 1967 to ‘prevent, reduce or eliminate pollution’ and another $28,000,000 in plant improvements that would substantially protect the environment. Sounds like they took their obligations fairly seriously long before a legal requirement to do so.On page three the author states: “..the total production of pollutants from natural sources dwarfs man’s contributions as shown in Table 1. Fortunately, the concentrations usually are far below the critical level.”Indeed, the climate sensitivity of carbon dioxide was not known until later in the 1970’s satellite era.  Even Svante Arrhenius, who is cited as the grandfather of the ‘hothouse theory’ had amended his much quoted catastrophic view in 1906 in a German paper entitled “The Probable Cause of Climate Fluctuations” and thought warming due to carbon dioxide emissions would not be significant; he also thought it would be beneficial.Holland insightfully states on page three that “4. The individual is conscious of pollution mainly as it affects his own interests; e.g. a swimmer thinks of pollution in terms of a beach closed because of contamination with sewage; to a naturalist it is the disappearance of a species of bird or flower; to an asthmatic, a choking spell; to a sociologist, slums or juvenile delinquency.”On page five, talking about “Legal Controls on Pollution” the author states: “A problem of such size, complexity and importance cannot be dealt with on a voluntary basis. The protection of the interests of society as a whole requires the establishment of legal controls on pollution and on other anti-social acts.”  This appears to reference the “anti-social acts” outlined in the previous statement 4.If anything, Holland appears to take an even-handed approach to discussing the challenges and the need to address pollution.Amusingly, Holland refers to another paper by Mr. A. H. Phelps who points out the problem of well-intentioned citizens running amok with numbers and terms beyond their understanding, then suddenly demanding that new standards be met, resembling the climate hysteria approach to reporting of the National Observer in this story.Similar climate hysteria is driven by ENGO charities who use fear of catastrophe to drive fund-raising.  Behinds the scenes, other vested interests are at work as well.DeSmogBlog has been funded by Oak Foundation.Oak Foundation has a statement on its website regarding its mission.Oak is part of ClimateWorks – a group of philanthropies that in 2007 issued “Design to Win” wherein they laid out their plan for changing the world’s energy economy by funding and employing local environmental groups to demonize fossil fuels.  Central to the plan seems to be to push renewable energy, which many philanthropies, pension funds, and institutional investors are heavily invested in today – despite these being described by CalPERS CIO Joseph Dear in 2013 in the Wall Street Journal as… a ‘noble way to lose money.’One way to try to ‘win’ if you have bet on a loser is to demonize fossil fuels and to label anyone who questions human-caused climate science as a ‘denier.’That’s what DeSmogBlog did to us many years ago.We all agree that climate changes. What is in question is the cause, ratio of human vs natural influence, impact, mitigation and cost-benefit of proposed mitigations.  Dr. John D. Harper, former director of the Geological Survey of Canada discusses 600 million years of climate change. “Carbon dioxide concentration is a consequence of the earth’s climate, not a cause.”VIDEO: Dr. John D.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/05/03/alberta-government-subsidies-to-wind-and-solar-will-cost-you-billion/,renewableguy ,Alberta Government Subsidies to Wind and Solar Will Cost YOU Billion$," By Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager @May 2015 in consultation with power generation industry expertsPembina Institute recently blogged that:“The challenge for renewable energy projects is not securing the fuel, the sun and wind are free. [Bold added]…”Pembina goes on to explain that the Alberta Climate Leadership plans says:“two-thirds of Alberta’s [existing coal-fired power] generating capacity will be replaced by renewable energy, one-third will be replaced by natural gas.”Stop right there. That might be what the Climate Leadership plan says, but practically speaking Alberta’s existing coal-fired capacity will have to be replaced 100% by natural gas, because wind and solar are intermittent forms of power generation.  Sometimes wind and solar can generate 100% power – and sometimes nothing at all. But consumers expect on-demand power 100% of the time – with no power quality issues like surges, drops or brown-outs.Pembina makes a point of saying:“By 2030, renewable sources like wind and solar will account for up to 30 per cent of electricity generation.” That’s what Alberta’s Climate Leadership plan says. “That ‘free’ wind and solar will end up costing YOU billions.Why?  The Pembina blog outlines how low the current power prices are in Alberta. The only way for wind and solar companies to make it in this market is to have government subsidies in the form of “Renewable Energy Certificates.”Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) are subsidies – tradeable certificates of value – rather like printing paper money in return for power generation from wind, solar, geothermal, biomass or other deemed ‘renewable’ source that is not directly from hydrocarbons.We asked industry experts about what this would mean in real dollars from Alberta taxpayers’ pockets. Here’s an example.If the REC value was set at $35/MWh and the Government of Alberta wants to replace 4,500 MWs of existing coal output with 2/3rds renewables, that means 3,000 MWs equivalent.So 3,000 MWs subsidized at $35/MWh = approx. $900 million a year in cost subsidies paid by the Government of Alberta – you, the taxpayer.Based on this very rough calculation, it seems this amount could be over and above the costs included in the Alberta budget released in the spring of 2016. If so, the deficit forecasts would increase by almost another $1 billion per year.And for what? Power that is not clean, green or free. Why would we want to go to power generation systems that increase costs and risks and reduce reliability?~~~Activists call coal and natural gas ‘dirty and polluting’ sources of electricity. They forget to mention to you that wind and solar need 100% back-up from conventional generation.  And remember that every wind or solar device consumes masses of materials and fossil fuel energy, just to make and install each turbine or panel. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/05/03
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/05/02/how-ontario-saved-the-planet-the-2015-auditor-general-report/,,HOW ONTARIO “SAVED THE PLANET” – THE 2015 AUDITOR GENERAL REPORT," Contributed by Robert Lyman @2015On December 2, 2015, Bonnie Lysyk, Auditor General of Ontario, released her 2015 annual report on the value for money received by Ontario residents from the operations of the Ontario provincial government. Chapter 3 of the report contained a blockbuster – an extraordinarily damning assessment of the actions of the Liberal government of Ontario with respect to electricity power system planning over the period from 2003 to the end of 2014. Since that time, despite the great importance of the subject, the report has received almost no follow up media attention, and prominent supporters of the present government have attempted to deny the Auditor General’s findings. The purpose of this note is to highlight the most important points in the report. Electricity power system planning involves projecting the long-term demand for electricity and deciding how to meet that demand through adding more generation and transmission facilities and/or trying to “manage” demand through conservation measures. The Electricity Act, 1998 requires the Ontario government through its main electricity generating utility (today the Independent Electricity System Operator, or IESO) independently to plan and prepare an “Integrated Power System Plan” based on the best technical analysis available and to submit this plan for review by the Ontario Energy Board, the semi-independent regulatory body responsible to protect electricity consumers’ interests in terms of power costs and reliability of supply. Since 2004, however, the Ontario Minister of Energy has ruled the electricity planning and decision-making process through a series of political decisions issued as directives to the utilities, depriving the Ontario Energy Board of its role in assuring that decisions made were prudent, cost-effective and in the best interests of consumers.Here are the key findings of the AG’s report:The Ontario Minister of Energy issued 93 directives between 2004 and 2014, many of which went against the technical advice of its officials, resulting in significantly higher electricity costs to consumers.From 2004 to 2014, the portion of residential and small commercial customers’ bills covering electricity generation costs increased by 80%, from 5.02 cents per kWh to 9.06 cents per kWh. The overall cost of electricity to consumers increased by 56%, from $12.2 billion in 2004 to $18.9 billion in 2014.Generation costs increased by 74%, from $$6.7 billion in 2004 to $11.8 billion in 2014, and they are expected to grow to $13.8 billion by 2022.Electricity consumers have had to pay $9.2 billion more for renewable energy (wind, solar and biomass generation sources) over the 20-year contract terms under the Ministry’s current guaranteed price (i.e. feed-in-tariff) program than they would have under the previous program under which renewable energy was purchased through competitive bidding.Nuclear energy provides the backbone of the generation system, in 2014 providing almost 60% of the production at 52% of the costs. Hydro followed at 23.8 % of the production at 16.2 % of the cost. Wind provided 4.9% of the production at 8.3 % of the cost, solar energy 1.1 % of the production at 7.8 % of the cost, and biomass 0.3 % of the production at 0.9 % of the cost. Natural gas generation provided 9.3 % of the production at 20.2 % of the cost, largely because the natural gas facilities produce sporadically and are needed to back up the wind and solar facilities that produce intermittently. The “Green” energy sources (wind, solar and biomass) thus provide 6.3 % of the production but represent 17% of the production costs, not counting the share of the electricity system costs due to the need to back them up.“Global Adjustment” fees that cover the costs of newly contracted generation capacity from all sources grew from 2006 to 2014 by a total of $37 billion.Consumers are expected to pay another $133 billion in Global Adjustment fees from 2015 to 2032.Ontario has long had an over-supply of electricity generation capacity. Annual electricity consumption decreased from 151 million MWh in 2006 to 140 million MWh in 2014. Despite this, Ontario’s generation capacity increased by 19%. From 2009 to 2014, Ontario’s electricity supply exceeded its maximum hourly consumption by 5,160 megawatts (MW) per year, on average. A significant over-supply is projected for the next decade.Although the average generation costs for new solar and wind technologies internationally have declined substantially from previous levels (78% for solar and 58% for wind since 2009), Ontario’s guaranteed prices remain high (around 28 cents per kWh for solar and 12.8 cents per kWh for onshore wind).Because of the mismatch between when wind and solar generation provides power and when consumers want it, Ontario increasingly has had to curtail generation from other sources (i.e. pay generators not to produce) and dump surplus generation on the export market. From 2009 to 2014, Ontario exported 95.1 million MWh of power; the total cost of producing this power was about $3.1 billion more than the revenue Ontario received for exporting it.Despite a near doubling of costs of the Lower Mattagami hydro project, the Minister of Energy directed the utility to build it anyway to meet the government’s renewable energy targets and “invest in Aboriginal communities”. The final costs of this project, completed in December 2014, were $2.4 billion; the power costs will be 13.5 cents per kWh, about three times the cost of other recent hydro projects in Ontario.In August 2010, the Minister directed the utility to convert the Thunder Bay coal plant, intended to provide backup (peaking) capacity, to biomass. This will cost $40 million per year, or about $1.60 per kWh, 25 times higher than the average cost of other biomass facilities. The government claimed that it would help the Ontario forestry industry, but the wood pellets needed by this plant have to be imported.In 2008, the Minister directed the utility to build a gas-fired generation plant in Oakville. In 2011, he directed that another plant be built in Mississauga. The subsequent cancellation of these plants during the 2011 election campaign and the construction of replacement plants elsewhere cost $1.2 billion. This is the only item in the AG’s report that has received much media attention.Despite the persistent over-supply situation, Ontario spent $2.3 billion promoting electricity conservation from 2006 to 2014, and has committed to spending another $2.6 billion from 2015 to 2020.The lack of a structured, coordinated planning process has meant that there are significant gaps in the availability of transmission lines to move electricity from generators to areas where it is needed. A number of regions, including Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge-Guelph and Windsor-Essex have problems in terms of capacity and reliability. A total of 2,545 small renewable projects initially could no proceed because there was not enough transmission capacity to accommodate the flood of project applications that were received in response to the high guaranteed rates.In summary, since 2003 successive Liberal governments in Ontario have pursued an environmentalist agenda that has aimed to “save the planet” by increasing renewable electricity production. They have done so by disregarding the legislative requirement to have electrical utilities use coordinated and integrated planning procedures subject to professional technical standards and proper public oversight by the Ontario Energy Board. The result has been a significant over-building of capacity relative to Ontario’s needs at the cost now approaching $40 billion, payment to wind and solar generators of $9.2 billion more than what could have been paid through competitive procurement, much increased reliance on intermittent sources of electricity generation (with the attendant back-up costs), and losses on export sales now averaging over $1 billion per year. They have completely politicized the decision-making process that governs electricity planning, construction, and operation in the province. The government intends to continue along this path for the foreseeable future.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/05/02

The Friends of Science Society story is selectively placed on-line according to its digital schedule for specific audiences.   The advertorial recounts some of the Friends of Science activities over the past few years and announces that Dr. John D. Harper, former director of the Geological Survey, and Ezra Levant, will be speaking at Friends of Science May 10th event in Calgary.Tickets on Eventbrite: http://ezra-levant-climate-leadership-catastrophe.eventbrite.ca However, PressProgress was quick to recycle old news, attacking Friends of Science for a previous very successful, low-budget ad campaign wherein Friends of Science Society’s billboards won international attention – first, for its provocative concept that climate change might be affected by more than humans, the ‘biological moss’ of the earth.  One of the billboards featured a dramatic sun flare and a tiny earth in near relative proportion. This was intended to give the viewer a clue that perhaps the sun, a dynamic body that is a million times the size of the earth (so big that it affects earth’s tides, geomagnetism, atmospheric concentrations of gases, ocean currents, winds, and other planetary bodies) might also affect climate on earth.  The ad campaign stated the opinion of Friends of Science that the sun is more influential on climate change than ‘you’ or CO2 – carbon dioxide.Second, the media and some members of the public were so incensed by this notion that humans might NOT be the main cause of climate change, that the ad and the story were widely repeated in international media, drawing the scorn of Anthropogenic (human-caused) Global Warming proponents. Numerous complaints were filed with Ad Standards Council of Canada.Third, the original print ad copy won an international marketing award, with its sidebar telling the audience that “…there is no 97% consensus, they’re fooling you.”At the time of the Montreal billboard campaign in the fall of 2014, the National Program Director of the Sierra Club Canada Foundation published a blog condemning Friends of Science and encouraging Sierra Club followers to engage in a point and click cyber harassment attack on the billboard media provider. Other ‘charitable’ organizations also started a petition against Friends of Science Society’s media provider.Friends of Science issued a press release and letter demanding that the Sierra Club Canada Foundation stop this harassment of a legal business operation, saying that, in the opinion of Friends of Science Society, charities are granted their special status to do things to the ‘public benefit’ – and that cyber harassment did not appear to fit that category.A concerted campaign by several activists to try and shut down Friends of Science Society’s democratic right to hold a dissenting view on climate science continues to this day.  Most recently, a group of prominent Canadians via the tax-subsidized charity Ecojustice filed a request for inquiry through the Competition Bureau claiming ‘deep pockets’ are funding Friends of Science alleged ‘denialism.’  In fact, Friends of Science Society has a nominal annual budget as noted by Wikipedia’s authors.As shown below, a quick glance at the financial power behind the environmental movement in Canada gleaned from the CRA and related public records, expose the claims of Ecojustice that Friends of Science Society has some kind of financial influence on markets to be a laughable, disproportionate claim.Ironically, Friends of Science Society reports its tiny annual budget is one tenth that of the interest earned by the investment fund of the David Suzuki Foundation. Most of the taxpayer-subsidized ENGO Charities are in favor of blocking taxpaying, job creating pipelines and resource/energy development while they advocate for renewable energy like wind and solar, all of which can only be produced and installed on the grid with fossil fuels. One might wonder if this activity is addressed by the Competition Act.According to a thesis by McLevey (2013) pro-renewables, anti-oil sands activist groups like David Suzuki Foundation and Pembina Institute have had disproportionate influence in the media.Furthermore, Friends of Science is, in fact, a group of scientists and science-minded citizens who have reviewed climate science over the past 14 years on a voluntary basis, and issued relevant reports, much like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does – in fact, some of the Friends of Science Society scientists have been expert reviewers of IPCC reports.MLK Rotary slides April-May 2016  [Dr. Khandekar would like to especially thank Shalan Khandekar for her assistance on the power point.]In December 2015, Friends of Science filed a request and issued an open letter to PEN International addressed to Margaret Atwood, Canadian author, human rights and free speech activist and Vice President of Pen International for assistance in their bid for continued freedom of speech and scientific inquiry.  Neither PEN nor Ms. Atwood has replied to the request for assistance to this point in time (April 22, 2016).Friends of Science notes that freedom of speech is a Canadian Charter Right and a fundamental principle of scientific inquiry and democracy.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/04/22

This is not about a ‘conspiracy’ because none of this is happening in secret. It’s all right out there in the open.Our new report “Undue Influence – Markets Skewed” Undue Influence Markets skewed april 5 2016 FINAL ic bl reviews how financial markets and philanthropies are making claims that are not supported by climate science evidence, and some parties are moving to dramatically alter investment and reporting methods.  Some of these parties appear to have significant conflicts of interest. While this information is widely available in the public domain, the average banker, investor or individual might not be able to spend the time researching the various actors and outcomes or connect the dots as we have in this report.The parties are unelected and unaccountable – yet they wield significant control over governments and industry through their extended echo-chamber of their well-funded ENGOs who drive ‘social license’ or who harass banks. The US Senate issued a report entitled: “The Chain of Environmental Command: How a Club of Billionaires and their Foundations Control the Environmental Movement and Obama’s EPA”Ironically, they report that anti-capitalist Naomi Klein is one of the fundees of this billionaire’s club.At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, Stuart Gulliver of HSBC Bank implored ENGOs to stop demonizing fossil fuels.  This has resulted in a full-on point and click email attack on Mr. Gulliver by “Moveyourmoney.org” with a long harangue about fossil fuel investments.This group claims: “We are funded by the Friends Provident Foundation, and previously by the Barrow Cadbury Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust.” Let’s look at one of these – the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust is a Quaker organization that appears to not mind putting people out of work in its demand for “climate justice.” In its “Divest Invest Philanthropy” pledge (which opens with climate catastrophe predictions and references to Noah and his ark),  they go on to cite Mark Carney as a climate authority, despite Mr. Carney’s widely publicized speech to Lloyd’s having been fact-checked and found wanting by Steve Kopits of Prienga Energy Advisors.One has to ask – is it right for international philanthropies and charitable organizations who benefit from special tax rules and are effectively subsidized by taxpayers, to be funding efforts to demonize necessary energy industries, resulting in skewed financial markets,  destruction of market value of shares, the hyping of climate catastrophe thinking that is not supported by the evidence, with the end result that governments adopt climate change policies that are not based on a Cost-Benefit Analysis, and industries face exorbitant energy prices. This ends up putting taxpayers out of work. And energy shares are snapped up by speculators at low market prices.This appears to violate several principles of fair trade and competition. Many Canadians see these agenda-driven activities as nothing more than a trade war cloaked in green.These are our opinions based on available material in the public domain.Undue Influence Markets skewed april 5 2016 FINAL ic bl Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/04/09
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/04/09/ndp-lookb4uleap/,Scott Drysdale ,NDP – LookB4ULeap," We found the #LEAPManifesto to not reflect our views of Canada. So we came up with the “Look Before You Leap” – or #LookManifesto. Comments welcome.Read our tumblr page or the text below.LookB4ULeap video: https://youtu.be/JKPNNIIVGOgClimate Justice video: https://youtu.be/uRdXDFFXNmU Big Rock – Nothing New Under the Sun video: https://youtu.be/RAtH5JPeacYWe start from the premise that Canada is a great country facing a world in crisis – no matter what our past sorrows or successes, only by working together as one people, can we heal wounds and face the challenges ahead.Thanks to our industrious and inventive people, we survive in this extreme climate in comfort – we feed the world with farm goods, house the world with our lumber and minerals, power the world with our oil, gas and coal, enhance the world with our hi-tech, aerospace, geo-sciences and bio-tech innovations, and so we can afford to be the third most generous, charitable nation in the world. As well, we welcome Foreign Workers whose earnings send some $24 billion dollars back home annually, directly to family members who need this help. Little or none of it is lost in the pockets of corrupt intermediaries.We honor and respect our scientists, engineers, policy-makers and monitoring agencies who, together have reduced Canada’s emissions and set high standards for environmental quality in air, land and water. We have a vast, modern, industrialized nation. We are distant from world markets and feature a sparse population, widely spread out, meaning transportation emissions are a given – yet, per capita GDP, our GHG emissions are less than those of the tiny Pacific Islands.         To have a healthy environment, we need a strong economy.Some people claim we could live in a country fueled 100% by renewables, they say that we should ‘leap’ into that. We say to them – look before you LEAP. Take the advice of power generation engineers and experts, Think common sense. “If it sounds too good to be true, it is.”Canada is the country most nations would love to be We do have current and historic challenges. However, through thoughtful policy, born out of respectful dialogue and careful consideration of public concern, and by applying the evidence-based Scientific Method, we will address and resolve these one by one.All countries have sovereign equality under the UN Charter (Article 2.1)—we should guard our own rights carefully; the UN is not accountable to us or elected by us. The UN is an external body made up of a majority countries that do not share our democratic, economic or social-cultural values.Canada is rich in resources, making us a target in international trade wars, often fronted or disguised as environmental issues (not applied anywhere else!)Careful assessment in advance can reduce or eliminate unpleasant or disastrous unintended consequences. Take time to do things right the first time.Climate change science is filled with uncertainties that are reported by the IPCC. Environmental groups and news media hype a catastrophic scenario, not supported by the evidence. Climate change is a largely natural process that is affected by humans. Carbon dioxide is a nominal factor in warming; it is necessary for life itself. Pollution and poverty are more important issues to address.Look at the evidence over the ideology. Haste makes waste. Look before you leap. PDF: look manifesto draft two feb 6 2016 w hawk ~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/04/09

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/03/22/after-math-a-comment-on-a-recent-article-published-by-the-pembina-institute/,davidgraham08 ,After Math: A comment on a recent article published by the Pembina Institute," Contributed by Rob Pearce @ March 2016This is a rebuttal to the Pembina Institute article “The sun doesn’t always shine? No problem for renewables” by Sara Hastings-Simon on their blog dated March 16, 2016.  The article itself is stated to be refuting comments made by Robin Campbell, President of the Coal Association of Canada regarding the poor reliability of wind and solar power.It is a shame really, when one needs to challenge an author with a PhD in physics on her assessment of the long-established and very well understood physical process of generating electrical energy.  It is in part why this article is titled “After Math”; once you get the math wrong, the errors are borne by the taxpayers and ratepayers, particularly the poor.Let’s start with her opening few paragraphs, which describe the merits of a diverse grid in providing secure, reliable power, implying that somehow wind power provides that diversity and security.  This is simply not true; in fact, it is wind power which is unstable and unreliable and requires backup by hydro and, yes, reliable, low-cost and long life fossil fuel energy.  She talks of a “complete misunderstanding of our electricity system”, which is true.  Unfortunately it is her misunderstanding.  And more unfortunately, that misunderstanding is being deliberately propagated by misinformation such as this article.Allianz Insurance notes that huge investments in the power supply infrastructure are required to put unreliable, intermittent wind and solar on the grid. These do not result in a beneficial increase in power but are required to manage and reduce the risk of grid black-out.For example, she states “changes in wind or solar energy energy can be easier for grid operators to manage as they can be predicted quite accurately through weather forecasting”.  So three things about this statement.  One, for those readers who live in the real world, stop laughing and wipe the tears from your eyes.  Two, has she actually checked with grid operators about the immense challenges of managing to maintain a stable grid with variable, unreliable energy from wind and solar? And three, anyone living in the real world is aware that weather forecasting is an enormous challenge, to say the least.  Don’t we have a saying in Alberta:  “If you don’t like the weather, just wait a minute”?  Simply look at the data freely available on various websites, including the AESO (Alberta Electric System Operator), where charts show wind power regularly (actually, irregularly) varying wildly by 500-1,000 MW over periods of a few hours to a couple of days.AESO – Screenshot taken Dec 29, 2015 shows Total Net Generation of wind in Alberta of 128 Megawatts out of a possible 1,463.   Coal is doing all the heavy-lifting followed by Natural Gas.In the five years from 2010-2014, wind capacity factor during annual peak demand varied from 0.0% (not a typo – nil) to 50%, with an average of about 14%.  In four of the five years, it was less than 14%.  In other words, it cannot be counted on at any time, let alone when needed the most.  Yet we don’t see that variability because we have highly skilled and dedicated operators and, as importantly, reliable fossil fueled generation to back them (and us) up.She mentions casually that coal plants are designed to run about 80% of the time, implying that this is a low level of reliability, putting consumers at risk of sudden blackouts.  In fact, the system operates at very high levels of reliability.  When was the last time you suffered a blackout and for how long?  Perhaps a few minutes or maybe a few hours, at most.  And probably due to a local event, such as a downed tree, rather than a system-wide interruption.  The reason for high reliability is the fundamental nature of the vast majority of our generating fleet: natural gas and coal.  Yes, plants are taken offline for maintenance; these events are typically planned and scheduled months and even years in advance, whereas wind or solar power fluctuate by the minute.  There is simply no forecasting system on the planet capable of replicating the reliability and resulting economy of fossil fuel energy.Blackouts are a threat from renewables, raising insurance rates as power surges can seriously damage equipment and put people’s lives at risk.Excerpt of Allianz Insurance document showing “increased vulnerability due to wind and solar power” as an insurance risk.  (See more below)Ms. Hastings-Simon mentions: “the types of renewables that can be turned on, on command”.  I am curious about these types of generation and wish that she would share what they are.  Certainly wind power cannot be commanded to turn on if the wind is not blowing, and solar, well you get the idea.Speaking of commanding, she comments on the high capabilities of grid operators, while implying that they like having renewables as part of their generating portfolio.  They are extremely capable; however, the author neglects to point out that many have expressed grave concerns about the stresses and costs imposed upon our reliable, efficient grids (and passed through to us, the owners and users) by adding unreliable, low-quality renewable energy.AESO reported years ago that ‘wind needs conventional generation as backup” and that “wind power and load do not correlate well.” (i.e. wind blows and produces power at times when there is low public demand for it). One of our previous blog postings discusses the challenges of wind-hydro and related costs and why a national wind-hydro grid is technically infeasible and even if possible, undesirable.Ms. Hastings-Simon’s closing statements imply that investment in renewables is growing implying it is a good investment because it’s so good when in fact it’s growing (slightly) because it has been mandated into being. The lousy economics of renewables are subsidized by ratepayers and taxpayers around the globe.  She states renewable investment was up 4% in 2015 compared to 2014.  Answer me this, if with all the subsidies and mandates renewables require and enjoy, and if it’s so damn good, why was it up only 4%?  At that rate, it may never catch up to simple replacement, let alone global growth, in the real generation business.In closing, it is sad that it is necessary and takes this long to rebut such a willfully simplistic and misleading article as that written for and published by the Pembina Institute. From rationalwiki.org, and attributed to Alberto Brandolini: “The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it”.~~~How lack of power following a catastrophic grid black-out would affect a region or nation simply in terms of access to pumped water.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/03/22
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/03/15/what-will-the-climate-agreement-cost-the-world-economy/,,WHAT WILL THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT COST THE WORLD ECONOMY?," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ March 2016How much of your money are they planning to take to ‘save the planet’? Lots!  … read on.The December 2015 Paris “Conference of the Parties” on Climate Change resulted in an agreement in principle to take actions to ensure that global temperatures do not increase by more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100. The agreement contained no new target in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions for the world or for each country. Instead, each party is committed “to prepare and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve” and to pursue the related domestic emission reduction measures and report on them every five years. After three years, a Party may withdraw from the Agreement with one year’s notice. Despite these limited legal commitments, the United Nations, the International Energy Agency and several national governments (including those of Canada and the United States) have chosen to interpret the Agreement as posing major new commitments to massively reduce GHG emissions. To understand what this will all cost, one has to look beyond the vague commitments in the conference agreement and communiqué to what was included in the commitments submitted by the participating countries before the conference began. One hundred and fifty-four countries responsible for 85% of global annual GHG emissions submitted “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs). Rodney Boyd, Joe Turner and Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment published an analysis of the contents of these INDCs. They also compared the effects of the INDCs with the estimates of the United Nations Environment Program (2014) of the global emissions in 2030 that would be consistent with the “pathways” that offer a reasonable (i.e. 50-66%) chance of avoiding more than a 2 degree C average global temperature rise. The UN projected that the global emissions in 2030 without further action would be 68 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2).  A “median value” pathway to the 2 degree C target would be 36 GtCO2 (i.e. a 47% reduction). The emissions levels that would be reached based on the INDCs ranged from 56.6 GtCO2 to 52.8 GtCO2 depending on global GDP growth. That is, the INDCs, if completely implemented as promised (a very important condition), would reduce GHG emissions from the 2030 preferred pathway by somewhere between 17% and 22%. According to this analysis, the regional pattern of emissions will change significantly by 2030. China and India will account for around 36-41% of global emissions, the United States and the European Union around 13%, and a group consisting of Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa for about 11% of emissions. Boyd, Turner and Ward concluded optimistically that the emissions pathway consistent with the INDCs “offered a reasonable chance of limiting the rise in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees C”. As they have no way of knowing whether the commitments will be honoured and whether countries will continue and expand emission reduction efforts over the 70 years between 2030 and 2100, this seems like a bit of a stretch. This has not prevented the International Energy Agency (IEA) from coming up with an estimate of what countries will have to spend to honour their INDC statements – $13.5 trillion to 2030. Lest one think that this was a lot of money, the IEA has reassured us that the world would probably have spent $68 trillion to meet its energy needs to 2040 anyway, and therefore it is simply a matter of spending more on renewables and less on hydrocarbons. Not to be outdone, on February 27, 2016, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G20 major economies committed to find ways to stimulate $90 trillion in investments over the next 15 years to achieve climate objectives. Its plans include the implementation of 14 proposals covering fiscal, regulatory, judicial and institutional “innovations” to encourage (force?) more spending by private firms. These numbers need to be placed in context. The IEA claims that the world needs to spend about $1 trillion per year on renewable energy. The G20 Finance leaders say that spending on “green initiatives”, whatever those are, must occur at the rate of $6 trillion per year.  In 2015, investments in renewables totaled $380 billion, a record, but far shy of the IEA’s admonition, and there is increasing resistance to higher solar and wind energy costs in Europe and elsewhere. The IEA one year ago, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, British Petroleum, and EXXON more recently, published world energy supply and demand projections to 2040 showing that coal, oil and natural gas are likely to constitute 80% of world energy supply by then. This is down from 86% today, but still far above the level implied by the “pathway”. Oil, natural gas and coal prices are much lower today than they were two years ago; that will surely not make implementation of the INDCs any easier. The wealthier countries are expected to give the poorer ones one hundred billion dollars per year starting in 2020 to help them pay for all this; taxpayers in the wealthier countries may not be enthusiastic. If the G20 Finance Ministers’ efforts are successful and are continued at the same rate to 2100, the world would spend $510 trillion pursuing climate change objectives. The GDP of Germany, Europe’s highest income country, was about $3.9 trillion in 2015. Global spending on climate initiatives to 2100 would thus equal 131 years of German national income. At the risk of enormous understatement, I think we need to consider some alternatives to following this path.~~~~Robert Lyman is an energy economist of 37 years experience, former diplomat and public servant.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/03/15
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/03/15/keep-canada-in-the-black/,,Keep Canada in the Black," The “Green Budget Coalition” is pushing the “Green Budget 2016.”  A group of some 16 influential ENGOs – non-profits and registered charities – are demanding that Canada move to a ‘green’…low-carbon economy.As part of this process, these groups engage in demonizing oil and gas, especially claiming that oil and gas operations in Canada are highly subsidized – that’s just not true.Friends of Science Society has reviewed parts of the “Green Budget” related to the claims regarding  fossil fuel subsidies and we dispute the claims of this group in our new report “Keep Canada in the Black.”A Business Review of Green Budget 2016 FINAL Mar 11 2016According to industry experts, Alberta also benefits from income drawn from oil and gas leases when times are good.  These are in addition to taxes that all corporations and individuals pay on their taxable income.Land sale revenue paid to the Alberta government for the leases and licenses required for the exploration and production of oil and gas in the province are very significant. Here is a summary of annual tallies of these sales. These numbers do not include oil sands leases.Industry experts note that1                 In 2010 and 2011 the Alberta government collected almost $5 billion in bonus payments,2                 So far in 2016 bonus payments are a pittance of the long term average. The government will be fortunate to collect a total of $100 million in bonus payments in 2016,3                 So far in 2016  bonus payments per hectare are 42% of the long term average, and4                 In the first 15 years of the 21st century the government collected an average of $1.189 billion per year.Renewables do not garner bonus payments or royalties for the government. The spreadsheet (above) does not account for government royalties on production.Likewise, the cascade of jobs, value-added products and industries from oil and gas are very large.The world wants oil and gas and coal.Why are there tax-funded groups in Canada trying to block these in-demand products?

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/03/13/reality-bites-the-likely-effect-of-ghg-emissions-reduction-is-next-to-nothing/,,REALITY BITES – THE LIKELY EFFECT OF GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION IS NEXT TO NOTHING," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ March 2016Robert Lyman is an energy economist of 37 years experience, a former public servant and diplomat.Over the last 100 years, average global temperatures have risen by ~0.75 degrees C. As a result of both natural climate variations, solar activity and the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The IPCC models,* which focus entirely on the alleged effects of increased carbon dioxide concentrations, suggest that temperature increases will accelerate and could reach somewhere between 2 degrees and 7 degrees by 2100. The UN has therefore sought and obtained the agreement of countries to pursue an arbitrary target of 1.5 to 2 degrees C increase by 2100. The countries have made commitments in principle to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in the hope of stopping warming. The Kyoto Accord of some 20 years ago was supposed to accomplish a similar objective – but carbon dioxide concentrations continued to rise (from human activity) …while temperatures stagnated for more than 18 years.  (*Observed temperatures are far lower than models; models do not reflect reality according to this IPCC scientist “none of the climate states in the models correspond even remotely to the current observed climate.”)With every passing day, it seems that there are more “sunny ways” declarations by western political leaders concerning the extraordinary success that they expect to achieve in addressing the threat of human-induced catastrophic global warming. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Barack Obama just concluded a meeting after which they claimed that their joint efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would make a major contribution to keeping global warming by 2100 below 2 degrees Celsius ( C ), and, with luck, below 1.5 degrees C. Attaining this goal will involve many billions of dollars in expenditures within North America alone, as well as the radical transformation of how energy is produced and consumed.HOW WILL GHG REDUCTION COMMITMENTS AFFECT WARMING?Against the background of such significant commitments, it is important to draw attention to a February 2016 article by the noted environmentalist and statistician Bjorn Lomborg in the journal Global Policy, published by Durham University. This note will attempt to summarize in laypersons’ terms the highlights of that article. Lomborg’s article can be read online here:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12295/fullMr. Lomborg set out to assess the magnitude of the GHG emissions (often described in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent) reductions that will be made in the period from now to 2100. To do this, he used the commitments that were made by countries in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) filed with the United Nations prior to the recent 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the Climate Change Convention. While these are not legally binding commitments, they represent the most up-to-date bases upon which to judge what countries might actually do in the period to 2030. Then, using different assumptions about what countries might do after 2030, Mr. Lomborg used the standard MAGICC climate model developed by the U.N. Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to calculate what will be the effects of the emissions reductions in terms of global temperatures.Every analysis of this kind is dependent upon the assumptions that underly it. Mr. Lomborg was careful to specify his assumptions clearly, the most important of which are these:The basic methodology to be used to calculate emissions reductions should be based upon that developed by T.M.L. Wigley in 1998 to estimate the likely effects of the Kyoto Protocol; this involved establishing a baseline of the emissions that would have occurred in the absence of international agreement and then calculating the difference between that baseline and what the commitments could reasonably be expected to produce;Lomborg chose as the baseline scenario the worst case scenario (i.e. the one involving the highest level of emissions) used in the most recent IPCC report, AR5;There would be no carbon leakage – in other words, the emissions reduction efforts in some countries would be considered to have zero effect in encouraging the transfer of economic activity from the emission-reducing countries to the developing countries with less stringent policies (the actual leakage effect is expected to offset emissions reductions by at least 40% through increased emissions elsewhere);All of the countries that made INDC commitments will do as they promised (this is counter to the actual experience under the Kyoto Protocol in which most countries fell considerably short of their commitments).With these assumptions, Lomborg then analyzed an optimistic and a pessimistic scenario. In the optimistic scenario, the countries making commitments would maintain their emission reduction promises indefinitely (i.e. to 2100 at least); this means that they would take whatever measures were necessary to ensure that emissions did not increase above the commitment level, even as their economies and populations grew. In the pessimistic scenario, the countries were still assumed to meet their commitments to 2030, but after that the countries will trend back towards higher emissions.For the United States, the main commitment is to reduce emissions under the Clean Power Plan to 1.642 megatonnes (Mt) by 2030, a 535 Mt reduction from 2015 levels. The U.S. has further promised to reduce CO2 equivalent emissions 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. This is the largest absolute reduction in GHG emissions by any country in the world. It is clear in its submission, however, that this is a one point promise in 2025. The target is for a single year, with no promises after that.For the European Union (EU), its INDC commitment was to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 by 2030. This is extremely ambitious, as it represents a reduction in EU energy-related CO2 emissions reductions twice as fast as the EU has achieved since 2000.China made two promises: first, that it would peak its emissions around 2030, and second, that it would reduce its 2030 CO2 intensity by 60-65% compared to 2005. Using the median of various forecasts of the Chinese economy, Lomborg estimated that China will reduce its CO2 intensity by 54% by 2030.ARE TINY REDUCTIONS WORTH ECONOMIC DESTRUCTION OF NATIONS?The changes in the global average temperatures as projected by the MAGICC model are just incredibly small. All the emissions reductions that the European Union and China have committed to over the period to 2100 are estimated to reduce global average temperatures by 0.05 degree C.! 2 degrees C. is the completely arbitrary target that the IPCC has posited and countries have accepted, and that temperature change has no scientific basis for measuring whether global warming (or climate change) is likely to be harmful to humans. So, 0.05 is 2.5% of the “warming reduction” target, and the target itself is baseless. Natural influences, like a massive volcanic eruption, might significantly reduce temperatures in the short-term – or a dramatic natural phenomenon like this past year’s El Nino may increase temperatures, by still nominal degrees.There are different public estimates of the emissions reductions that would be achieved if all countries adhered to their INDCs. The most optimistic is that by Boyd, Turner and Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. This estimate was that the 2030 global emissions cut would be between 5.3 and 7.5 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent. The US, EU and China would contribute 4-6.1 Gt, or 75-81% of that., leaving about 1.5 Gt from other countries.Using the MAGICC model, this means that in the optimistic case the EU and China will reduce global temperature by 2100 by about 0.05 degrees C. and the US and the rest of the world would each reduce temperatures by a bit more than 0.03 degrees C.Globally, under a pessimistic scenario, temperatures would be 0.048 degrees C. lower than they would otherwise be. Optimistically, global temperatures on average would be 0.17 degrees C. lower.How much is 0.17 degrees C.? It is roughly the same as the difference in temperature from your feet to the top of your head as a result of the rise in altitude. That is what trillions of dollars in expenditure to reduce emissions will achieve. Canada’s share of that is too small to measure. ~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/03/13
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/03/07/getting-you-out-of-your-car/,,GETTING YOU OUT OF YOUR CAR," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ March 2016The recent First Ministers’ Conference in Vancouver resulted in a communiqué stating that they “committed to transition to a low carbon economy by adopting a broad range of domestic measures, including carbon pricing mechanisms”. To understand what they mean by a low carbon economy, one must look at the communique’s reference to the outcome of the COP 21 meeting in Paris at which several countries agreed in principle to eliminate the use of all fossil fuels as early as 2050. Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, largely from the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) totaled 726 megatonnes in 2013. These emissions came from all sectors of the Canadian economy, including industry, resource development, transportation, electricity generation, buildings, agriculture and waste. Transportation, upon which so much public attention focuses, represented only 23% of emissions; emissions from light duty vehicles (cars and SUVs) constituted about 15%, with the rest coming from trucks, trains, buses, marine vessels, and aircraft. Canada and the United States have passed regulations that will force vehicle manufacturers to significantly increase the fuel efficiency of light duty vehicles in the period to 2025. By then, the average new vehicle will have a fuel economy of 4.4 litres per 100 kilometres, a 50% increase from 2013 levels. Even with this significant and costly increase in vehicle design, the increase in vehicle sales will still offset much of the regulation’s effect. Governments and environmentalists consider this a central challenge of the climate change agenda. So, to get people out of their cars, they are increasingly pinning their hopes on making fuel much more expensive by imposing carbon taxes. How high would carbon taxes have to go to force Canadians out of their cars? To estimate this, it helps to consider three things: the cost per litre of a carbon tax defined in terms of dollars per tonne; the effect of higher fuel prices on people’s tendency to drive; and international price comparisons showing how effective high gasoline prices have been in other countries in reducing or eliminating eliminating the use of light duty vehicles. At this point, one can only speculate on the level of carbon taxes that might be applied in Canada. British Columbia now has a carbon tax of $15 per tonne. The NDP government in Alberta has committed to introduce a carbon tax of $20 per tonne in 2017and to raise that tax to $30 per tonne in 2018, with subsequent increases at the rate of inflation. Each $10 per tonne equates to 2.3 cents per litre. In 2008, the former National Round Table on the Economy and the Environment (NRTEE) issued a report on how Canada could reduce GHG emissions by 60% by 2050. It estimated that a carbon tax of at least $300 per tonne (i.e. 69 cents per litre) would be needed. This is a good indication of where carbon taxes, once accepted, are going eventually. Here’s the problem with that in terms of achieving the policy goal. The NRTEE used, as the basis of its estimate, a fairly high calculation for how much gasoline consumption would decline in response to higher pump prices. Their “elasticity of demand” was about .06. In fact, more recent studies show that gasoline demand elasticity is only about one third of that, or .02. That means that even a 69 cent per litre carbon tax will not come close to getting people out of their cars and SUVs. International price comparisons tend to bear this out. At the end of February, 2016, GlobalPetrolPrices.com published the prices of gasoline in several countries. The prices were all listed in terms of U.S. cents per litre. Canada’s average gasoline price was 74 cents per litre. Prices in Europe, in contrast, were much higher: $1.28 per litre in Germany, $1.34 in France, $1.42 in the U.K., and $1.63 in Norway. In other words, even if governments impose a 69 cent per litre carbon tax on gasoline in Canada, the resulting price of $1.43 per litre (in U.S. dollars) would only equal what Britons now pay and would be 19 cents per litre less than what motorists pay in Norway. In The UK, gasoline consumption is virtually the same as it was in 2000; in Norway consumption is higher. In short, even punishingly high carbon taxes will not accomplish governments’ goals of getting Canadians out of their cars. To greatly reduce gasoline consumption, governments will have to place severe restrictions on who can own and operate a vehicle or when and where vehicles could be used.That should be really popular.~~~~For more on GHG transportation reductions and the challenges, see Robert Lyman’s brief: “You Can’t Get there from Here”  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/03/07
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/03/06/about-that-low-carbon-economy/,Jeffery Green ,About that Low Carbon Economy….," Recently the media has been full of stories about how Canada must jump on the ‘low-carbon’ economy bandwagon or be left behind.  Eco-activists are claiming 100% renewables is possible.Robert Lyman, energy economist of 37 years experience, has reviewed a recent EXXON report on future demand and summarizes it as follow. “Love ’em or hate ’em” this corporation is well-positioned to provide clear and accurate assessments of market realities. To make thoughtful policy decisions, it is important that we understand the reality of market demands and global growth.EXXON’S VIEW OF GLOBAL ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND TO 2040Contributed by Robert Lyman @ March 2016EXXON Corporation, one of the world’s largest energy enterprises, recently published its updated projection of energy supply and demand to 2040. The International Energy Agency, the United States Energy Information Administration, and British Petroleum have recently issued similar projections. Projections of these kinds are interesting for several reasons, among which is the fact that they offer informed judgments about the trends in the world economy and energy sector that one may compare to the political aspirations of governments that the world sharply reduce fossil fuel consumption as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the recent Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention in 2015 in Paris, several governments committed in principle to the goal of eliminating the use of fossil fuels by 2100 and aiming to do this in the developed (OECD) countries by 2050. In short, several governments have claimed that they will eliminate all use of oil, natural gas, and coal by 2050. Environmentalists seek to do while also prohibiting any growth in the use of nuclear energy, the most reliable source of non-carbon base load electricity generation. A question, therefore, is how do EXXON’s projections square with the goals articulated at the COP 21 meeting? Generally, EXXON has accepted that the political push to reduce GHG emissions will have significant impacts in the OECD countries over the period to 2040, especially in terms of altering the sources of electricity generation and requiring fuel economy improvements in light duty vehicles and other energy-using equipment. The following are the main observations that come from the EXXON report as to the changes that will occur from 2014 to 2040: World population will grow 25% from 7.2 to 9 billion people. Global income will more than double, with developing countries leading the growth. Global energy demand consequently will grow by 25%. China and India together will account for almost half this increase. The world middle class will grow from 2 billion to nearly 5 billion; the new members will want to have the cars, quality residences and appliances enjoyed by the middle class today. By 2040, oil, natural gas and coal will not fade away as hoped by governments. In fact, they will continue to meet about 80 % of global energy demand. Natural gas demand will grow more that any other source. Substantial gains in energy efficiency will see the carbon dioxide intensity of the global economy cut in half by 2040. Global demand for transportation will increase by about 30%. Today there are about 1 billion light-duty vehicles (cars and SUVs) in the world. This number will rise by close to 800 million vehicles by 2040, with about 90% of this growth outside of the OECD. Hybrid vehicles will increase from 2% of new car sales today to 40% by 2040, but all-electric plug-ins are likely to account for less than 10% of new car sales by 2040. Demand for heavy-duty vehicles (i.e. trucks and buses) will increase by 45% by 2040, with about 85% of the growth coming from non-OECD countries. Energy demand from ships, planes and trains will grow by 65%. Over 90% of transportation demand will still be met by oil in 2040. Global demand for electricity is expected to rise by 65% by 2040; 85% of electricity demand growth will comes from developing countries. By 2040, the share of electricity generated by natural gas will rise to 30% and be about even with coal. (In other words, despite claims that coal will be eliminated, it will still be a major source of electricity supply globally.) The amount of electricity generated by coal in India will rise 150% from 2014 to 2040. The amount of electricity from nuclear power will double from 2014 to 2040, with much of this growth coming in China. Wind and solar energy will account for about 10% of electricity generation in 2040, up from 4% in 2014. (This projection is entirely at odds with the predictions of environmental groups that wind and solar energy will replace all other energy sources by 2030.) Carbon dioxide emissions will rise from about 30 billion tonnes per year in 2014 to a peak of about 37 billion tonnes by 2030, before slightly declining thereafter. By 2040, global emissions still will be about 35 billion tonnes, even though emissions in the OECD will drop by 20%. By 2040, China’s per capita CO2 emissions will be close to OECD levels.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/03/06

Thank you.  We are member funded and operate on about $150K a year with the help of dedicated volunteers and a few contracted helpers. Many of our volunteers have worked with little recognition since our formation in 2002. We do not represent any industry and are only member funded.In February 2016, we ran half page ads in the Calgary Sun and Edmonton Sun countering the people who want to stop the use of coal-fired power plants in Alberta, much earlier than the existing federal phase-out program, which is already in progress.Calgary SunWe asked – ‘Why would we close a handful of Alberta coal-fired power plants, when more than 2,000 are being built world-wide,’ mostly by countries who were at the COP-21 Paris Climate Change talks?http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/environment/article4629455.eceWe said that industry experts thought that compensation to the coal industry alone would cost Albertans (i.e. YOU and ME) some >$11 billion.  Here’s that source on ‘stranded assets.’Above table: Estimate of valuation and ‘stranded assets’ of proposed coal phase-out in Alberta. Prepared by retired power generation industry executive for Friends of Science Society and based on publicly available documents for reference.We also said it would cost more than $11 billion to transition from coal to equivalent natural gas capacity for Alberta. We got that information in 2014 from Evan Bahry, Executive Director of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta (an organization that represents all forms of power production, conventional, intermittent wind-solar, biomass, geothermal).Here are his comments in our Troy Media article: “Benefits of coal-fired power outweigh nominal health risk.”We are very concerned that the move to natural gas as an ‘entire’ back-up for the Alberta power grid could turn into an expensive and devastating nightmare. Although Alberta has lots of natural gas at low prices today, natural gas is a market commodity, subject to wild swings.We do not like to ‘scare-monger’ – but practically speaking, the transition to natural gas is not in isolation. The US is also moving some generation from coal to natural gas.  We in Canada are looking at LNG – Liquefied Natural Gas export stations to serve foreign markets. As the world demand for natural gas grows, prices WILL be affected. How will that affect us?  Natural gas is a market commodity, subject to wild swings.  Coal is not.  And let’s look at how much coal generation we have to replace.You can see above that Alberta’s total power generation in 2014 came almost ENTIRELY from fossil fuels – 55% coal + 35% natural gas = 90%.It is worthy to note that Alberta has NO public utility debt for electricity because of our market-driven, industry financed market.The Alberta Climate Panel advocates adding 30% renewables (wind and solar) to replace coal and the balance with natural gas.  In reality, we would have to add 100% natural gas to replace coal because…. wind and solar are not reliable. Likewise, it is advocated that these would be subsidized to make them competitive. With your money.  However, wind and solar may provide ZERO….or even MORE than 100% power generation.  But you cannot predict this, and at present, you cannot store the power that wind and solar generate in a cost-efficient way.So. Natural gas would be the ‘go-to’ 100% provider of power to replace coal.The AESO (Alberta Electric System Operator) did NOT forecast this kind of ‘mono-power’ generation. (2013)  They are experts in power generation and they keep the grid ‘on’ all the time.  The AESO people know that you need a balanced mix of power generation and they know the power grid is very complex.  Being dependent on a sole type of power can leave you exposed to price hikes or power failures. For a modern, industrialized society, that won’t do.In our ad, we also challenged the notion that it is reasonable or appropriate for the government of the day to be putting some 7,000 people out of work and destroying some 30 coal-industry related communities!  Especially when the federal government had already established a practical, thoughtful schedule to phase-out old coal plants, and allow the new low-emissions plants to operate unimpeded to the end of their useful life and investment schedule (meaning NO cost to Albertans for compensation).Please review our researched and reviewed reports and commentaries at the end of this post to understand the factual distortions and manipulations going on.Based on our review of the evidence, there will be no perceivable health benefit to Albertans from closing coal fired power plants – to the contrary, as in the EU and UK many people will be pushed into ‘heat-or-eat’ poverty, resulting in MORE demands on a health care system that can’t afford to pay…because money will be diverted to compensation or wind-solar subsidies.And in every jurisdiction we have reviewed, wind power is 3 times or more the price of conventional power for less reliability and more costs to the grid.How novel that in the Edmonton Sun ad, the headline beside Quotes Don Cherry (on another matter) saying “It’s appalling.”We concur. Edmonton and Calgary Sun adsWe have done a LOT of research and reporting work on this issue over the past 3 years. We did this because we look at the evidence over the ideology. (see below)Albertans live in a part of the world that is very cold and dark more than half the year. Affordable power is a necessity.  We have LOTS of high quality (cleaner burning, low sulfur) coal that is surface mined.Meanwhile Denmark, the ‘bastion of green wind power’ imports coal at $60/tonne and generates some 40-48% power from….COAL.Images courtesy Wikipedia creative commons.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/03/04/the-vancouver-declaration-on-climate-change-an-overview-and-comment/,,THE VANCOUVER DECLARATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE – AN OVERVIEW AND COMMENT," Contributed by Robert Lyman @2016Robert Lyman is a former diplomat, public servant and an energy economist of 37 years’ experience.Editor’s note: We have added bold emphasis to one or two sentences of significance.Following their meeting in Vancouver in March 2016, Canadian First Ministers (i.e. the Prime Minister and the provincial and Territorial Premiers) issued a public “declaration on clean growth and climate change”. The document is worded similarly to international declarations. It contains five sections all preceded by general preambles, lists of commitments, a list of “early actions” to be taken by the federal government and a description of the follow-up work to be done by four federal-provincial-territorial working groups on specific topics. This is a brief summary of the more substantive elements of the declaration. The preambles set the framework. The specifically “recognize” the recent Paris Agreement of the U.N. Conference of the Parties to the International Climate Change Convention that calls for “significant reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels.” The preambles also “recognize” that this will “require global emissions to approach zero by the second half of the century”. The commitments are worded in elaborate bureaucratic terms. The following is a layperson’s summary of the main ones: To implement policies to meet or exceed Canada’s 2030 target of a 30% reduction below a 2005 level of emissionsTo increase “the level of ambition of policies” in order to drive to greater GHG emissions reductionsTo better coordinate GHG emission reporting systemsTo foster and encourage investment in clean technology solutionsTo transition to a low carbon economy by adopting a broad range of domestic measures, including carbon pricing mechanisms, adapted to each province and territory’s specific circumstancesTo foster investments in clean technologiesTo encourage the sharing of information and expertiseTo work together to enhance carbon sinks, including agriculture and forestryTo implement strong, complementary adaptation policiesTo support “climate resilient” and green infrastructureTo strengthen collaborationTo strengthen public communications The federal government’s early action will include: Investing in green infrastructure, public transit infrastructure and energy efficient social infrastructureLevering investments through the Low Carbon Economy FundDoubling investment in clean research and development over the next five yearsAdvancing the electrification of vehicle transportationFostering dialogue and development of regional plans for clean electricity transmissionInvesting in clean energy solutions to get indigenous, remote and northern communities off diesel fuel Four working groups will “identify options” in the areas of: clean technology, innovation and jobs; carbon pricing mechanisms; specific mitigation opportunities; and adaptation and climate resilience. The working groups will report to Environment Ministers by September 2016, and Environment Ministers will report to First Ministers in time for the First Ministers to meet on this again in October 2016. Comment At one level this is little more that a public relations document, i.e. an “agreement to agree” and to establish a process with few substantive commitments. However, for those concerned about the directions that Canadian climate change policies are taking and about the costs that these policies will impose on Canadians, there are some ominous points. The first is the explicit linkage of Canadian actions to the U.N. goal of reducing GHG emissions to zero by 2050. This goal is arguably impossible in economic and technological terms and pursuing it will impose immense costs on Canada as well as other countries with which we trade. Even attaining the 2030 goal is highly unlikely, so the only purpose of endorsing an even more unattainable goal is to raise environmental objectives above all other public policy goals. While the language appears quite bureaucratic and vague, there are some terms that are intended to alter the nature of the public dialogue. For example, we must wonder what is meant by “increasing the level of ambition of policies”; this may be intended to commit Canadians to constantly over reach by setting emissions reductions goals that are far more costly than the public would generally accept. The frequent use of the term “clean” to refer only to energy uses and technologies that reduce GHG emissions is both inaccurate and prejudicial to non-carbon energy sources. One must wonder how to distinguish “clean” electricity from other types in inter-provincial transmission. Similarly, the reference to “green” infrastructure is confusing and misleading; there probably is no less cost-effective way to reduce GHG emissions than to spend billions of dollars on light rail transit systems. The commitment to “strengthen public communications” is code for a substantial increase in climate propaganda by all levels of government. On the topic that has gathered the most media attention, the setting of a carbon tax, the declaration kicks the ball down the road, but its acknowledgment that the tax or carbon price will be “adapted to each province and territory’s specific circumstances” seems to open the door to a patchwork of different tax rates in each part of Canada, hardly the “sunny ways” approach. We are led to believe that four intergovernmental working groups can be established, carry out detailed analysis of options, meet a few times to discuss and prioritize these and produce a consensus report in seven months. When a much less ambitious process was started in 1997 (the famous “Climate Change Table process”), it took the better part of two years and still was unable to complete its work well. Setting a seven month period for analysis and consultation, followed by only one month to report to First Ministers basically means that the discussions will be far more political than substantive in nature. This is one area in which we need more thought, and less politics.~~~~Read more of Robert Lyman’s assessments:Implications of Climate Change Targetshttp://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/climate_change_implications_Lyman.pdfYou Can’t Get there from Herehttp://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/you-cant-get-there-from-here-robert-lyman-final-rev-nov-09-2015.pdfWho Cuts?

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/02/24/plug-in-electric-cars-do-they-merit-the-hype/,Jeffery Green ,PLUG-IN ELECTRIC CARS – DO THEY MERIT THE HYPE?," Contributed by Robert Lyman @2016Many western governments, having embraced the thesis that humans are responsible for catastrophic global warming, have sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transportation by subsidizing the sale of partially electric (i.e. hybrid) vehicles and all-electric (plug-in) vehicles and by embracing ambitious targets for the market penetration of these vehicles. In the United States, for example, President Barack Obama introduced programs that provided billions of dollars in subsidies for the manufacturers of the vehicles and the electric storage batteries that power them and offered consumer subsidies of $7500 per vehicle to those who would buy them. The Administration’s goal was to have one million electric vehicles (hybrids and plug-ins) on U.S. roads by the end of 2015. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel similarly offered large industry and consumer subsidies and declared a goal of having one million electric vehicles on German roads by 2020. While Canadian governments have not published such lofty goals, buyers of all-electric vehicles qualify for taxpayer subsidies of Cdn $8500 each. Along with these well-publicized commitments by governments, the manufacturers of electric vehicles have made many announcements of technological advances and of new research initiatives (almost always partially or totally funded by taxpayers) that they confidently predicted would lead to increased sales and consumer acceptance. Perhaps the most widely publicized claims have been made by Tesla and its charismatic Present, Elon Musk. Tesla has produced a number of high-performance expensive luxury cars that are powered entirely by electricity. Famously, Tesla has claimed that it is on track to produce a U.S. $35,000 to $40,000 all-electric car with a range of roughly 200 miles by 2017. Many young people accept Tesla’s prediction that, with the introduction of a mid-priced all-electric vehicle, the days of the internal combustion engine are soon coming to an end. The reality of the marketplace is strongly at odds with these perceptions. In a December, 2015 program entitled “Electric Cars Running on E”, U.S investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson delved into this subject. The program can be viewed here: http://fullmeasure.news/news/politics/electric-cars-12-04-2015 She found the U.S. electric vehicle program’s achievements are actually way behind its targets, and that the goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by the end of 2015 had fallen woefully short. Only about one-third that many electric cars, heavily subsidized with tax incentives, have been sold. Further, six of the 11 main manufacturers have gone belly up or stopped manufacturing. Tesla Motors got half a billion dollars to make the Model 2 electric vehicle. It was one of the few success stories. The Model 2 went from 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds, and strong sales helped it pay back its $10 million government loan early. Others, like the Volkswagen E Golf, and the Chevy Volt, have not been so successful. One of the most serious problems concerns the limitations of current battery technology. In the 1990s, GM used cheaper lead-acid batteries for its electric EV-1; each battery weighed a bulky 600 kilograms and delivered only 55 to 95 miles before it had to be recharged. When Tesla Motors introduced one of the first lithium-ion-powered electric cars in 2008, it could go 250 miles on a charge, roughly three times farther than the EV-1. But the vehicle cost over $100,000, in large part because the batteries were so expensive. To cut costs, the lithium-ion-powered electric cars made today by companies such as Nissan and GM use small battery packs with a range of less than 100 miles. While countless breakthroughs have been announced over the last decade, time and again these advances failed to translate into commercial batteries. One difficult thing about developing better batteries is that the technology is still poorly understood. Changing one part of a battery—say, by introducing a new electrode—can produce unforeseen problems, some of which can’t be detected without years of testing. Yet for electric cars to account for a significant portion of the roughly 60 million cars sold each year around the world, batteries will probably need to get considerably better. After all, 200 miles is far short of the 350-plus miles people are used to driving on a tank of gasoline, and $35,000 is still quite a bit more than the $15,000 price of many small gas-powered cars. So what has been the actual experience of electric vehicle sales in North America? What has billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies achieved? In the United States, by the end of 2015 there were about 320,000 electric vehicles on the roads, less than a third of Obama’s goal. In 2015, total electric drive vehicle sales were 498,000, of which plug-ins constituted 114, 000, or 23%. By comparison, total light duty vehicle sales in the United States in 2015 were almost 17,400,000. Electric vehicles represent only 2.87% of total light duty vehicle sales. Worse, electric vehicle sales in 2015 were actually down from the 571,000 (119,000 plug-ins) achieved in 2014. In Canada, there are about 150,000 hybrid light duty vehicles on the roads. The most recent data on electric vehicles sales are to the end of June, 2015. At that point in time, there were 14,300 plug-in vehicles registered in Canada, half of which were plug-in hydrids and the other half battery powered all-electric vehicles. The sales of plug-ins (all-electric and hybrids) during the first half of 2015 were 2,779. Of the total number on the roads, most were small vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt or the Nissan Leaf; there were only 394 Teslas. As of the end of 2014, plug-in electric vehicles had 0.27 of total vehicle market share in Canada — roughly speaking, one out of every 300 cars sold in Canada is an EV. By comparison, in 2015, total light duty vehicle sales in Canada in 2015 were 1,900,000. Plug-ins barely register. What about the much hyped “affordable” Tesla coming in 2017? The lower price will help, but it will not change the fact that American and Canadian buyers are showing considerable resistance to all-electric vehicles, preferring the more user-friendly hybrids. Factors such as high prices, uncertain resale values, the inconvenience of plugging the vehicle in, the recharge time and limited range are difficult for consumers to ignore. For all the hype, and even assuming that the taxpayer subsidies will continue indefinitely, it seems highly unlikely that electric vehicle sales will rise to even 5% of total light duty vehicle sales for several years. In other words, the internal combustion engine will be the norm for the foreseeable future. We will still need the oil.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/02/24
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/02/03/why-satellite-measurements-provide-better-data-than-surface-measurements/,John Beare ,Why satellite measurements provide better data than surface measurements," by Norm Kalmanovitch, P. Geoph.The global temperature is determined by the net amount of energy that the Earth receives from the sun because a portion of the sun’s energy is reflected back into space by clouds the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface (called Albedo) reducing the amount of energy that actually contributes to global temperature.The percentage of energy reflected away is approximately 30% divided among the three components by around 20% from clouds 4% from the rest of the atmosphere and the remaining 6% from the Earth’s surface. The reflection from clouds and the atmosphere remains more or less constant over the course of a year but because of snow cover in the large northern hemisphere landmass the 6% portion of the albedo resulting from reflection from the Earth’s land surface changes dramatically resulting in global land surface temperature measurements changing by over 10°C over the course of a year.The oceans are not affected to the same extent so when temperatures over the oceans are added the global temperature range is reduced to around 3.9°C over the course of a year.Global temperature change has averaged around 0.6°C/century so detecting this rate of change on a year to year basis would require doing the impossible and identifying a 0.006°C temperature change against a 3.9000°C background. To get around this problem, monthly temperatures derived as the average 24hr daily temperatures over the month is subtracted from a long term average temperature for that month and the difference is displayed as a global temperature anomaly value for that month.The accuracy and precision of these monthly global temperature anomaly values is dependent on the accuracy and precision of both the land surface measurements and the measurements over the oceans as well as the uniformity of the grid over which they are measured.Land surface measurements suffer from the sampling bias of having more weather stations in densely populated urban areas than less populated rural areas and very few stations in isolated remote wilderness areas. In addition to this as cities grow their average temperature increases and with these warmer temperatures in urban areas called urban heat island effect; land surface measurements are biased towards warmer temperatures. These biases have been well, but not perfectly, addressed with the application of corrections resulting in land surface based temperature values consistently higher than values derived from satellite measurement.The biggest changes to the overall global temperature occur from changes in the ocean surface temperatures and the resulting changes to the air temperature above the oceans.Air temperatures over oceans are measured by sparsely spaced weather stations, measurements made by ships and sea surface temperatures provided by the Argo Buoy measurements. These provide enough data for temperature mapping on a 5° x 5° grid representing 500km by 500km grids each with an area of 250,000km2 .The area of the oceans is 361,132,000km2 so ocean measurements are limited to just 1445 grid points as demonstrated by the 1444 large grid squares in this map of ocean temperatures:Any surface warming resulting from ocean currents less than 500km wide will not be accurately measured severely detracting from the global temperature measurement. The highlighted area is where the current el Niño formed and with this coarse grid it is not possible to accurately measure the influence that el Niño conditions have on global temperature.Satellites on the other hand measure on a 0.5° x 0.5° grid of 50km by 50km with a grid area of just 2500km2 providing 144,400 evenly spaced grid points over the Earth’s ocean surface improving the resolution by a factor of 100.The highlighted area is the current January 2016 el Niño conditions precisely mapped by satellite data in a way that the coarse grid of surface based measurements are not able to achieve.The difference between satellite measurement and the surface based measurement is clearly evidenced by the way the 1998 and 2010 el Niño conditions are represented on the satellite and NCDC surface based global temperature datasets. The satellite measurement of sea surface temperature is described herehttp://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/sst/oper/Welcome.htmlIt is rather curious that NOAA’s NCDC dataset does not use this SST data.~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/02/03
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/01/23/un-reseau-national-hybride-denergie-hydroelectrique-et-eolienne-le-plan-est-techniquement-irrealisable/,,Un réseau national hybride d’énergie hydroélectrique et éolienne: Le plan est techniquement irréalisable," INFORMATIONS EN MATIÈRE DE PRODUCTION D’ÉNERGIE SUR LES DIFFICULTÉS D’INSTAURER LE RÉSEAU NATIONAL HYDRO-ÉOLIEN PROPOSÉ DANS LE RAPPORT «AGIR SUR LES CHANGEMENTS CLIMATIQUES» Aspect technique Perspective de production Le rapport «Agir sur les changements climatiques»,publié par McGill Trottier au printemps 2015, propose la création d’un réseau national hydro-éolien qui, selon les auteurs, pourrait être mis en place d’ici 2035. L’organisme Friends of Science a demandé à des spécialistes albertains en production d’énergie si ce projet serait réalisable et à quel prix. L’un des documents cités à l’appui de la proposition, rédigé par Danny Harvey et al., fait référence à l’Alberta comme une importante ressource en énergie éolienne. Voici l’analyse technique. Même si nous partons du principe que le potentiel éolien est suffisant, il y a d’importants problems techniques liés à l’utilisation d’un réseau national hybride d’énergie hydroélectrique et éolienne pour alimenter tout le Canada en énergie. Le plus gros problème avec l’éolien, c’est qu’il ne répond pas à la demande. En effet, en Alberta, il est négativement corrélé à la demande de pointe. Notre pointe de consommation hivernale a lieu quand il fait extrêmement froid et, dans ces cas-là, il y a TOUJOURS une absence de vent. Le même phénomène pourrait s’observer en Ontario, mais aucune recherche dans ce domaine n’a été incluse dans ce document d’observation. L’AESO publie régulièrement un rapport intitulé Long Term Adequacy Metrics visant à surveiller l’approvisionnement en électricité à long terme en Alberta. Dans les calculs d’adéquation, l’énergie éolienne n’est pas prise en compte pour la raison mentionnée plus haut.Consultez le lien suivant:www.aeso.ca/downloads/Division_202_-_Section_2026_Adequacy_of_Supply_(Oct_1_2014).pdfsection 4(2)(b)(v) et 4(2)(c)(v) à la page 3 (en anglais) pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements.La méthodologie exclut l’énergie éolienne des calculs. Actuellement, en Alberta, nous consommons environ 80000 GWh d’électricité par année et la production éolienne de la province présente un facteur de charge d’environ 30%. Consultez les pages 19 et 10 du lien suivant:http://www.aeso.ca/downloads/2014_Annual_Market_Stats_WEB.pdf(en anglais). En théorie, pour que l’Alberta devienne autosuffisante en matière d’énergie, nous aurions besoin d’installer 30 GW de capacité éolienne. Même avec une capacité de production éolienne de 30 GW, il est fort possible que le vent ne contribue ABSOLUMENT PAS à l’approvisionnement. Dans ces cas-là, nous aurions besoin d’importer 100% de notre électricité auprès d’autres provinces. Par temps venteux, nous produirions plus de 3 fois l’électricité que nous en consommons. Cela signifie qu’il nous faudrait exporter ou perdre jusqu’à 20 GW de capacité éolienne. La déperdition (absence d’utilisation) est une réelle possibilité, car rien ne garantit qu’il y ait une demande pour cette quantité d’énergie. Dans le document de M. Harvey, il est question d’installer entre 18,4 GW et 25,8 GW d’énergie éolienne en Alberta, ce qui représente respectivement 31% et 28% de la capacité éolienne totale selon son plan. Cela montre à quel point ce plan dépend de notre province. L’Ontario est l’autre contributeur important à ce plan, représentant entre 45% et 48% de la capacité éolienne totale. Les auteurs utilisent également un facteur de charge de 40% pour l’Alberta, alors qu’en réalité elle n’est que de 30%. Ce document n’examine pas les autres régions du Canada, mais fait référence à des capacités de charge supérieures à celle de l’Alberta, dépassant 50% dans certaines provinces. Quelques recherches sur Internet démontrent que ces valeurs pourraient être exagérément optimistes, d’au moins 10%. Le document de M. Harvey s’appuie principalement sur l’énergie éolienne produite en Alberta et en Ontario. Bien qu’il soit vrai, comme le mentionnent les auteurs, qu’il y a des avantages à tirer de la diversification des sources éoliennes, les deux provinces affichent des tendances similaires: des vents plus forts en hiver et plus faibles en été. On peut le constater dans les statistiques de marché de l’AESO, plus haut, et dans le document suivant pour l’Ontario:http://coldaircurrents.luftonline.net/2013/01/monthly-capacity-factor-of-wind.html(en anglais). Il est certain qu’il y aura des periods où l’Alberta et l’Ontario auront simultanément une production d’énergie éolienne faible, voire nulle. Dans ces cas-là, la grande majorité du pays serait entièrement dépendante d’Hydro. Hydro dispose d’une certaine marge de manœuvre, mais ne pourrait pas répondre à la demande.Une grande partie de l’hydroélectricité provient de rivières dont le débit n’est pas contrôlable à volonté. D’importantes pannes d’électricité entraîneraient de graves conséquences pendant les périodes de froid ou de chaleur extrême.La partie « 4.1 Future Research Steps » du même document suggère de se pencher sur les correlations entourant les variations entre le vent et la consommation horaire. Le fait que les auteurs ne l’ai ent pas fait avant de rédiger ce document constitue l’erreur fatale. Peut-être que quand ils termineront leurs recherches, s’ils les terminent, la réalité les rattrapera. Perspective de transportÉtant donné le faible facteur de charge de l’éolien, de deux à trois fois plus d’équipements de transport sont nécessaires comparativement aux méthodes de production classiques. Dans le document de M.Harvey, les auteurs prévoient de transmettre l’énergie dans l’ensemble du pays au moyen de lignes CCHT connectées à des nœuds dans les grands centres de consommation. Ils prennent uniquement en considération la «partie à CCHT du système de transport et de distribution ». Ils ne tiennent pas compte de l’intégration de ces lignes CCHT dans les réseaux existants ni des problèmes éventuels de fiabilité du transport. Même si nous supposons que leur calcul pour les lignes CCHT est exact, ils sous-estiment grandement le véritable coût du transport et de la distribution. En Alberta, nous dépensons environ 1 million de dollars pour intégrer 1 MW de production éolienne. Consultez les pages 61 et 62 du document suivanthttp://www.ucahelps.alberta.ca/documents/ABE_TFCMC_Report_7_WEB_-_June_2014.pdf(en anglais) pour connaître le contexte et les coûts du projet de renforcement du réseau électrique dans le sud de l’Alberta(SOUTHERN ALBERTA TRANSMISSION REINFORCEMENT -SATR; PROJECT 787–To accommodate wind generation in southern Alberta).En résumé, l’Alberta devrait intégrer de 18,4 GW à 25,8 GW de production éolienne selon le document de M. Harvey. Des lignes CCHT devraient également être construites dans l’ensemble du pays et, pour être alimentées en électricité, les provinces devraient également renforcer leurs réseaux. L’Alberta aurait également besoin de renforcer le réseau afin de recevoir de l’énergie et de l’acheminer aux centres de charge quand le vent ne souffle pas. En fin de compte, M. Harvey sous-évalue considérablement les exigences de transport. Aspect économiquePlus haut, nous avons mentionné à quel point le plan est techniquement irréalisable. Toutefois, si nous ne tenons pas compte de ce fait et prétendons que ce projet pourrait être mené à bien, nous pouvons nous pencher sur l’aspect économique. Le document de M. Harvey estime que le réseau hybride hydro-éolien proposé permettrait d’alimenter tout le pays à un prix situé entre 4,5 cents et 6,39 cents par kWh, incluant les coûts de transport. C’est moins que ce que la majorité des pays paie actuellement uniquement pour l’électricité et soulève la question suivante: si l’énergie éolienne est si peu coûteuse, pourquoi ce projet n’a-t-il pas encore été mis en œuvre? Tout d’abord, M. Harvey declare que l’énergie de source éolienne coûte entre 3,75 cents et 4,97 cents par kWh. Cela exige un «financement des services publics garanti par le gouvernement » de 3%. Ensuite, il déclare que le financement privé est plus près des 12% ce qui reviendrait essentiellement à doubler le coût de transport de l’énergie éolienne. En réalité, il n’y a pas de «financement des services publics garanti par le gouvernement » en Alberta, et même les ressources éoliennes de l’Ontario sont exploitées par des investisseurs privés.Encore une fois, ce sont les deux provinces dans lesquelles Harvey s’attend à ce que la plus grande partie de l’énergie éolienne soit développée. De même, comme nous l’avons déjà dit, les coûts de transport sont vraisemblablement de deux à trois fois plus élevés que ce qu’il prétend. En fin de compte, l’énergie éolienne décrite dans son projet coûterait au moins le double de ses estimations.Si nous partons du prix qu’il donne, soit 2000$ par kW de puissance éolienne, et que le transport coûte environ 35% du prix de l’énergie éolienne (estimé d’après le tableau 1), cela exigerait un investissement d’environ 160 milliards à 200 milliards de dollars.Ensuite, si nous utilisons vraiment des hypothèses de transport réalistes, cela tournerait autour de 240 milliards à 380 milliards de dollars. Cela s’ajoute à l’infrastructure en parfait état dont nous disposons déjà. Où allons-nous trouver tout cet argent? Aspect philosophiqueLa société canadienne est fondée de façon générale sur le libre-échange, les transactions volontaires entre les gens. Le document rédigé par M. Harvey est une condamnation du libre-échange et defend une philosophie qui obligerait la société à payer des centaines de milliards de dollars pour un plan énergétique qui ne permettrait même pas de répondre à la demande en électricité. Il exigerait également des centaines de milliards de dollars d’actifs énergétiques inutilisables et risquerait de mettre des services publics en faillite.Cela causerait une perte de richesse considérable pour le Canada et le pays ne profiterait jamais de toutes les répercussions positives si l’argent était investi dans des actifs productifs plutôt que perdu en investissements dans l’énergie éolienne. Concernant la comparaison de l’énergie éolienne avec les méthodes de production classiques, l’analyse explique à quel point les ressources éoliennes sont vastes et comment un parc éolien occupant une très petite surface dans chaque région suffirait à remplacer la totalité de l’électricité actuellement générée par les combustibles fossiles et l’énergie nucléaire. C’est possible, mais ces parcs occuperaient néanmoins beaucoup plus d’espace que les méthodes de production classiques. De même, il faudrait aménager de vastes corridors dans l’ensemble du pays pour accueillir les lignes de transport d’énergie. Il n’est pas nécessaire d’aller trop loin dans la lecture de ce site Web pour savoir ce que les gens pensent vraiment des lignes de transport d’énergie:https://retasite.wordpress.com/ (en anglais).~~~~Notes supplémentaires (tous les documents sont en anglais) :Voici le lien vers le document complet Reality vs. Climate Change Uncertainties–Challenging the claims of “Acting on Climate Change”: https://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/reality-vs-climate-change-uncertainties-challenging-the-claims-of-acting-on-climate-change/ Analyse critique du document de travail de l’Ontario sur les changements climatiques:Ideology or Evidence–Asking Questions about Ontario’s Climate Change Policy Discussion Paperhttps://friendsofsciencecalgary.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/ideology-or-evidence-asking-questions-about-ontarios-climate-change-policy-discussion-paper/ Documents techniques et scientifiques exhaustifs :Analyse critique du modèle climatique canadien :Click to access CanadianClimateModel.pdfCompte-rendu de Friends of Science sur les sciences du climat :http://www.friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=681 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/01/23

Why doesn’t anyone report on that? Uncertainty won’t make headlines…won’t scare people into funding eco-charities to save the planet…won’t make people say ‘yes’ to public policies on renewables and carbon taxes that will make them poor.  Catastrophic predictions will.Contributed by David McGruer, Ottawa @2016For anyone who still believes man’s activities are causing a dangerous rise in global temperature that warrants a dismantling of civilization, please do some reading. The IPCC reports are highly biased due to the very mandate of the IPCC, which is to to focus on man-made changes and almost ignores powerful, nay, dominant natural cycles, and is politically driven and politically funded. The IPCC Summary For Policymakers (SPM) documents are patently ridiculous and contradict the Technical Summaries (TS) on which they are supposed to be based. The policy wonks who have their minds made up before they start writing the SPM documents massively distort the already distorted IPCC technical work.  To have a chance of understanding what the IPCC science report itself is saying, you have to read the technical documents and then go to the “Key Uncertainties” section – see page 114-115 in the 2013 Fifth Assessment Report, Technical Summary. There, you will read statements such as:“There is only medium to low confidence in the rate of change of tropospheric warming and its vertical structure. Estimates of tropospheric warming rates encompass surface temperature warming rate estimates. There is low confidence in the rate and vertical structure of the stratospheric cooling.”“Substantial ambiguity and therefore low confidence remains in the observations of global-scale cloud variability and trends.”“There is low confidence in an observed global-scale trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall), due to lack of direct observations, methodological uncertainties and choice and geographical inconsistencies in the trends.”“There is low confidence that any reported long-term (centennial) changes in tropical cyclone characteristics are robust, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities.”“Robust conclusions on long-term changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation are presently not possible because of large variability on interannual to decadal time scales and remaining differences between data sets.”“Different global estimates of sub-surface ocean temperatures have variations at different times and for different periods, suggesting that sub-decadal variability in the temperature and upper heat content (0 to to 700 m) is still poorly characterized in the historical record.”“In Antarctica, available data are inadequate to assess the status of change of many characteristics of sea ice (e.g., thickness and volume).”“On a global scale the mass loss from melting at calving fronts and iceberg calving are not yet comprehensively assessed. The largest uncertainty in estimated mass loss from glaciers comes from the Antarctic, and the observational record of ice–ocean interactions around both ice sheets remains poor.”“In some aspects of the climate system, including changes in drought, changes in tropical cyclone activity, Antarctic warming, Antarctic sea ice extent, and Antarctic mass balance, confidence in attribution to human influence remains low due to modelling uncertainties and low agreement between scientific studies.”“Based on model results there is limited confidence in the predictability of yearly to decadal averages of temperature both for the global average and for some geographical regions. Multi-model results for precipitation indicate a generally low predictability. Short-term climate projection is also limited by the uncertainty in projections of natural forcing.”“There is low confidence in projections of many aspects of climate phenomena that influence regional climate change, including changes in amplitude and spatial pattern of modes of climate variability.”To summarize:Low confidence in atmospheric temperature changeLow confidence in the understanding of cloudsLow confidence in drought cycle trendsLow confidence in storm cycle changesLow confidence in atmospheric circulation modelingPoor characterization of ocean temperature cyclesInadequate data to assess Antarctic ice changesLow confidence in attribution of climate change to human activitiesLow confidence in predictive value of models.Surely you can see that even the IPPC itself has no basis to claim there is an urgent need for massive government force of any kind, never mind the many scientists whose work contradicts much of what the IPCC claims as factual.Rats, now that we see their true nature, we will have to label the IPCC and all its supporters as an evil climate denier organization, attack their spokespersons, attack them for refusing to conform to the consensus of the so-called smart people, vilify their professional work, prevent them from achieving tenure, prevent them from receiving research grants, try to keep them from being able to publish in scientific journals, refuse to debate them in public and suppress their right to free speech.~~~~David McGruer is a financial advisor who has taken a passionate interest in philosophy and climate science.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/01/23/the-great-ontario-giveaway/,Canadian Climate Guy ,The Great Ontario Giveaway," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ 2016The final numbers for 2015 are now in and it’s official. Last year, Ontario exported 22.6 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity to New York, Michigan and other U.S. states. For that, the province charged an average of $23.60 per megawatt hour (MWh), so it received about $534 million. This is the “profit” that Ontario Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli will proudly announce. There is only one problem – a big one. To produce that exported electricity cost the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) an average of $101.40 per MWh, for a total cost of $2,293 million. The loss on export sales was therefore $1.759 billion. The good news is that the losses did not hit the $2 billion that was projected early in 2015. The bad news is that this is Ontario’s all-time highest loss on exports sales, not even taking account of the money paid out to curtail production so that exports, and the associated losses, would not be higher still. The further bad news is that this cost the average Ontario ratepayer $223 last year on his or her electricity bill. The worse news is that the never-ending addition of more wind and solar generation in 2016, despite the current surplus, will mean even higher losses for 2016. So happy new year, New York. Ontario just gave you its very own Powerball jackpot, compliments of Kathleen Wynne.~~~~Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/01/23
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/01/21/co2-and-the-climate-with-and-without-greenhouse-effect/,,CO2 and the climate with and without greenhouse effect," Contributed by Georges Geuskens, Ph.D.The consensusScientists interested in the climate, quite as many supporters as opponents of an anthropogenic climate change, agree on the following points:The climate can change as it has always done and will continue to doTo maintain a constant temperature the Earth must dissipate the energy received from the Sun and the energy balance of the Earth must take into account all different possible mechanisms.Part of the energy is dissipated by the Earth as thermal radiation also called “black body” radiation.Some gases in the atmosphere, namely CO2, can absorb a fraction of that thermal radiation.CO2 having absorbed a fraction of that radiation could have an influence on the temperature of the Earth’s surface or of the low atmospheric layers.The debate between supporters and opponents of an anthropogenic climate change would be closed quickly if we could give a quantitative basis to all these phenomena on which there is agreement from a qualitative point of view.To put the problem in quantitative terms requires the knowledge of:– the amount of solar energy received by the Earth at the top of the atmosphere,–  the fraction of the energy emitted by the earth as thermal radiation– the fraction of the thermal radiation absorbed by CO2.Several of these quantities are not well known and are often contested estimates. To put the problem in quantitative terms, however, it is necessary to accept some estimates even if uncertain. Then we will consider these as basic assumptions common to supporters and opponents of an anthropogenic climate change.Common basic assumptionsIt is essential to know the amount of solar energy received by the Earth. The value of 340 W/m2 at the top of the atmosphere is generally acknowledged. This value is not measured but calculated assuming a uniform distribution of energy over the entire Earth’s surface without taking account of an unlit hemisphere and a variation with latitude. It is certainly overestimated but a correct value taking into account the speed of rotation of the Earth and the inclination of its axis of rotation would lead to insurmountable computational difficulties. Without anything better we’ll use this value accepted by supporters of an anthropogenic climate change.The second hypothesis concerns the energy balance of the Earth. The most complete and often cited model is that proposed by NASA. Again it is accepted by the supporters of an anthropogenic climate change.  According to that model, 30% of the energy received by the Earth at the top of the atmosphere is reflected by the clouds, the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface (it is the albedo of the Earth). Then the atmosphere and the clouds absorb 19% of the transmitted solar radiation and finally only 51% are absorbed by the land and the oceans. This energy is then dissipated by evaporation of ocean water (23%), by air convection (7%) and thermal radiation (21%). While uncertainty remains high regarding the relative importance of these three mechanisms, we will use this assessment to quantitatively determine the influence of CO2 on the temperature of the Earth’s surface or of the low atmospheric layers.The third value required to achieve this goal is the fraction of the Earth’s thermal radiation absorbed by this gas. If we consider the Earth as a black body at 15 °C Wien’s law states that the intensity of the emitted radiation should be maximum at 10 µm and Planck’s equation allows calculating that 95% of the spectrum would be between 5 and 40 µm. Among the major atmospheric constituents only CO2 and H2O absorb radiation in that wavelength range. In particular, CO2 has an absorption band centered at 15 µm which enables the excitation of the initially linear molecule to a state of vibration involving deformation. By integrating Planck’s equation between 14 and 16 µm it can be calculated that 9.3% of the thermal radiation of the Earth at 15°C is emitted in that wavelength range. Ultimately CO2 could absorb only 9.3% of 21% or a little less than 2% of the total energy received from the sun at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere and thus about 6 W/m2.The difference of opinion between supporters and opponents of an anthropogenic climate change is fundamentally about the deactivation mechanism of CO2 molecules excited by absorption of a fraction of the thermal radiation from the Earth. The first, in fact, invoke the theory of the greenhouse effect in support of their thesis whereas the latter dispute this theory.The theory of the greenhouse effectLet us first recall the definition of the greenhouse effect proposed by supporters of the theory of an anthropogenic global warmingThe greenhouse effect is a radiative phenomenon caused by gases, such as water vapor or CO2, absorbing a fraction of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and then re-radiating part of it back in all directions including toward the Earth’s surface whose temperature is, therefore, higher than in the absence of infrared absorbing gas. These gases are therefore called “greenhouse gases”.If 2% of solar energy absorbed by CO2 is radiated back in all directions, as assumed by supporters of the theory of the greenhouse effect, there would be no more than half that fraction to reach the Earth’s surface i.e. about 3 W/m2. Knowing that a human being at rest dissipates 60-100 W as heat the temperature increase due to a possible greenhouse effect would be much lower than that resulting from the presence of a human being occupying a surface of one square meter.(this paragraph revised after first posting)Moreover, could the Earth’s surface specifically absorb infrared radiation of wavelength 15 µm radiated back by CO2 ? This could be the case for the surface occupied by the oceans since liquid water has an absorption band at that wavelength but it is not the case for the tip of the Earth’s surface since absorption could occur only between well-defined energy levels due to the quantification of the energy. CO2 could therefore restore the absorbed energy only to 71 % of the Earth’s surface. Reduced to the scale of the planet, this amount of energy is on average about 2 W/m2.  As a conclusion the greenhouse effect as defined above could not lead to an appreciable warming of the Earth’s surface.The kinetic theory of gasesAgainst the theory of the greenhouse effect it can be argued that the probability of radiative deactivation of CO2 (with emission of wavelength 15 µm) is practically nil given the enormous number of collisions between atmospheric molecules at a pressure close to one atmosphere and at a temperature of 15 ° C.The atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%) as bi-atomic molecules N2 and O2. The third component in order of abundance is argon Ar (about 1%). CO2 accounts for only about 0.04%. All these molecules have virtually no interaction between them except that being in constant agitation they come into collision with each other. The kinetic theory of gases allows calculating that at the temperature of 15 ° C atmospheric molecules are moving at speeds of the order of 500 meters per second and at a pressure of one atmosphere each undergoes several billion collisions per second. The kinetic theory of gases also calculates the average kinetic energy of bi-atomic N2 and O2 molecules which is Ec = 5/2 kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature in Kelvin). The energy of the CO2 vibration level is also known: it is Ev = hc / λ (where h is Planck’s constant, c the speed of light and λ the wavelength of the absorbed radiation, in this case 15 µm). A simple calculation shows that this value is only 30% higher than the average kinetic energy of the surrounding molecules. As the latter have a wide distribution of kinetic energy some have enough of it to bring the CO2 molecules to this vibration level during a collision. This conversion of translational kinetic energy of N2 or O2 molecules into vibrational energy of CO2 molecules is reversible. Not always the same CO2 molecules vibrate but their proportion remains constant at a given temperature because a dynamic equilibrium is established as a consequence of numerous collisions. Under these conditions CO2 molecules that have absorbed a fraction of the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth deactivate by collision and transfer of their energy to surrounding molecules and not by radiating back the wavelength of 15 µm. We can therefore conclude that the greenhouse effect, as defined by the supporters of an anthropogenic global warming, does not exist.Knowing the CO2 absorption coefficient and its content in air it can be calculated that the absorption of wavelength 15 µm is substantially saturated for radiation passing through an atmospheric thickness of 10 m. The absorption of the thermal radiation of the Earth between 14 and 16 microns (6 W/m2) is selective by CO2 molecules but due to collisions with the surrounding molecules that energy is distributed over all the molecules contained in an air column 10 m high. If the perfect gas law is used to calculate the number of molecules in 10 m3 of air at one atmosphere and 15 °C it appears that each molecule will undergo per second an increase of kinetic energy of less than 0.001%. This insignificant amount will increase the air convection movements that also occur in the absence of CO2 and could only lead to a local temperature increase of the order of ten thousandth of a degree. It is important to note that this value is calculated taking into account the totality of atmospheric CO2 and not only the anthropogenic fraction whose effect would be even smaller. Moreover, if the absorption of radiation of wavelength 15 µm is saturated by passing through an atmospheric thickness greater than 10 m the effect would be even smaller because it would be distributed over a greater number of surrounding molecules.ConclusionFrom this statement we can conclude that:The greenhouse effect, as defined by the supporters of an anthropogenic climate change, does not exist because CO2 molecules that have absorbed a fraction of the thermal radiation of the Earth deactivate by collision and not by back radiation of the wavelength absorbedThe absorption by CO2 of a fraction of the thermal radiation of the Earth results, as a consequence of numerous collisions with the surrounding molecules, in a very tiny increase of their average kinetic energy corresponding to a local temperature increase of the low atmospheric layers of the order 0.0001°C.CO2 can in no way lead to a warming of the Earth’s surface and its influence on the temperature of the low atmospheric layers is insignificant. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/01/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/01/21/2015-the-coolest-hottest-year-ever/,4TimesAYear ,2015 – the Coolest Hottest Year Ever!," The media is full of stories about 2015 being the hottest year ever.Tweeter Tom Nelson found out that’s a farce!  He tweeted:“.@NOAA bombshell: Earth COOLED 3.83F from 1997’s 62.45F to 2015’s 58.62F”along with these two images showing the stated temps of 2015….and those from the NOAA archive of 1997…. Friends of Science Society’s resident scientific adviser Norm Kalmanovitch, P. Geoph. explains a few other things about ‘hottest year on record…”Like…So What?Climate change is not about a single year, but about a pattern of climate over years and decades. Here’s what Norm had to say on the topic:——The issue is called “climate change” and climate is the long term weather so whether or not 2015 was the warmest year is irrelevant to claims of catastrophic global warming being caused by CO2 emissions. El Niño conditions occurred in 1998, 2010 and 2015 resulting in temperature spikes that have nothing to do with the possible effect from CO2 emissions so the question becomes why would those promoting the concept of CO2 emissions causing global warming reference temperature values that have no relationship to the issue at hand.El Niño conditions result from warm ocean currents at the ocean surface displacing otherwise colder water at the surface over a large enough area to affect the average global temperature. Satellites measure global temperature over an even grid above the ocean while surface based measurements only have an irregular spaced grid of ocean surface measurements resulting in surface based global temperature data not properly representing the same true rise in global temperature during el Niño conditions as the satellite based data.These graphs of GISS surface based data and UAH MSU satellite based data show the difference in representing el Niño in these datasets. In terms of reliability UAH MSU is class 1 while the GISS dataset is relegated to class 3 so any true climate scientist would use satellite based data to make claims of a particular year as being the warmest, so the question  is not which is the warmest year but why this claim is being made on the basis of surface based measurements instead of using the far more accurate and precise satellite data?  Norm Kalmanovitch, P. Geoph.———-Yale Climate Connection has recently made a video that appears to try and denigrate the quality of satellite records.  We countered their claims with this video clip on satellite data.  Then we explored the other types of temperature data and methods out there…. not encouraging!So – not the hottest year…and not the point!Comments welcome. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2016/01/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2016/01/01/media-accuracy-in-2016-please/,Jeffery Green ,Media Accuracy in 2016 – Please," Friends of Science Society is often maligned by our critics for allegedly spreading false and misleading information. We dispute those claims and show evidence herein that we are frequently pointing out significant errors in the press. Unfortunately it seems the press does not want to issue corrections. We waited to post this, to provide fair time to correct the stories. See our letters linked below for complete evidence.Why Friends of Science Deserves Ink – Edmonton Media Misinforms Public on Environment Canada ReportBy Michelle Stirling Communications Manager, Friends of Science SocietyTwo recent (Oct. 8, 2015) Edmonton media stories took information from a spring workshop of the Joint Oil Sands Monitoring group and turned it on its head, to misinform the public.The Edmonton Journal headline of Oct. 8, 2015 claimed “Hot Spots depict how coal plants contribute to Edmonton pollution in new Environment Canada images.” In fact, the new Environment Canada data showed the coal-fired power plants as blue dots, and indicated that there were significantly reduced emissions.Research scientist in charge of this project, Heather Morrison of Environment Canada (EC), in her video presentation on the matter, states at 4:09 that there has been a decrease in sulfur dioxide concentrations from the coal-fired power plants “which aligns very nicely with the mitigation that has happened over that time period…” (2005 to 2013)The Journal ran a colorful image of emissions with Alberta lit up as if as air polluted as Ontario. Scary! But Heather Morrison said “what you can see is the measurements are sparse across the landscape and look disproportionately large because they had to make the dots big enough that you can see them.”On the same day, CBC Edmonton ran a similar story on this headlined: “Computer-generated video shows pollution spread across the Prairies” Oct 8, 2015.Again, the reporter is overstating the case. The images are from a computer model, not real emissions. Outputs from models are not data. The real life empirical data shows a decrease of pollution, despite a population increase.Alberta’s population grew from 3.256 million in 2006 to 4.120 million by 2014. If sulfur and nitrogen oxides – SOx and NOx – emissions are at about the same levels in 2014 as they were in 2006, that means in real terms a reduction of just over 26% per capita by industry.The CASA Data Warehouse air quality monitoring records show no exceedances of NO2 or SO2 (the substances studied) during the time frames of the modelling study except occasional short-term exceedances at Redwater, far from coal-fired power plants.Further, NOx and SOx are essential for a healthy eco-system. In 2011, Mother Nature’s wildfires in Alberta alone, emitted the equivalent of 448 million diesel truck emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), along with 30 million tons of SO4 (sulfates) and 16 million CO2e tons of nitrogen oxides.It seems the misinformed media slant comes from the phase-out coal activists at Pembina Institute and the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), whose representatives are quoted in the stories.Pembina and CAPE are trying to foist more wind and solar on Albertans by demonizing coal. One has to question this blatant misrepresentation of the facts, especially as Pembina Institute is influentially represented on Alberta’s climate panel.If Pembina Institute and CAPE are so keen to phase-out coal, maybe they should write the first estimated $11.1 billion compensation cheque, plus $11 billion to transition to natural gas,* plus millions more for power grid interties and infrastructure. Maybe they should pick up the tab for you and me of the tripled power costs that would be the end result if they succeed in foisting renewables – wind and solar – upon us.*Compensation, transition costs and intertie costs from industry experts.This graph shows the more installed renewables in the EU, the higher the power prices.  US EIA puts EU residential power prices at ‘more than double’ that of the US, and rising.There is a federal coal plant retirement program in place. If we wait 10 years, most of the coal-fired power plants will retire on their own and it won’t cost taxpayers these billions, often presented as only “pennies a month.”Google engineers have shown that wind and solar are not effective for power generation, they are ridiculously expensive, they mess up the grid, and they do not address climate change or air pollution.Friends of Science, maligned by many, appear to be the only watchdog ferreting out the evidence over climate change ideology. That’s why we deserve ink – to clear the air of eco-smog.~~~~Our letter and evidence to the Edmonton Journal:lt to ed journal re pratt story on hot spots oct 28 2015 letterhead FINAL(1)Our letter and evidence to CBC Edmonton:lt to CBC edmonton oil sands monitoring pollution spread Nov 13 2015 FINAL (1)(1)We contacted both media outlets.

Today just one year ago, December 12th 2015, world leaders came to an agreement to finish climate change. Immediately construction works started in Paris, France, to build the new headquarters of the UN Climate Organization, which was completed today. (See picture.) It reaches just past the sun. This time united mankind succeeded unlike last time in Babylon in doing so by recruitment of UN interpreters. This office will house the authority in charge of the multi-trillion $$$$$$ project to limit the raise of global temperature until 2 oC.Quite relieved the editors remind you of the decisions taken on that memorable day:The really united nations joined toshut off all volcanoes;stop continental drift;stabilize the sun;remove the moon and the other planets;finish the change in ocean currents both horizontal and vertical;asphaltize the rain forests in Amazonia, Africa & Indonesiaprevent all comet impacts;kill all flying insects that produce 10 x as much CO2 as mankind with all its machines;arrest undermining carbonate formation;forbid procreation;zero tolerate forest firesandCall on all still functioning Gods to take those measures which mankind in its humility forgot.These decisions have now been put into action. Because of that this past summer and this autumn droughts and floods have been prevented and hurricanes have been banned for ever. Starting next year tsunamis are events of the past.Lengthening of glaciers and repair of polar ice need some more time. In order to accommodate eventual victims, during this year additional measures have been added to the agreement. By them polar bears, seals and penguins will receive food supplements such as ice cream and iced scones. For whales and other threatened species there are maternity wards under construction to safeguard the babies against premature death.Special thanks to: Dr C.(Kees) LePair for permission to repost!Reposted from: http://www.clepair.net/wereldredding-eng.html Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/12/29

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/12/18/insights-on-the-cop-21-paris-agreement/,Edward ,Insights on the COP-21 Paris Agreement," Contributed by Friends of Science Society member Rob Pearce @Dec. 2015A light hearted look at what the agreement really $ay$.  Really.Bafflegab: Incomprehensible or pretentious verbiage, especially bureaucratic jargon. (courtesy of Oxford Dictionaries online)Why does an 11 page document require a 19 page introduction or preamble?This preamble itself contains 140 sections calling for actions in the form of “Requests” (with variations such as “Further Requests”, “Urges and Requests” and “Also Requests” to break the monotony), “Encourages”, “Resolves”, “Decides”, “Invites”, “Recommends” and “Agrees”. So perhaps someone with legal training can tell me whether this 20 odd pages has any legal effect. And perhaps at the same time educate us on the subtle differences between: Emphasizing, Also Emphasizing, Stressing, Recognizing and Acknowledging, all used in the preamble to the preamble.This document is likely to be a useful tool and case example in several areas of academic study: English, Diplomacy, Law, Politics, Negotiations, others?And money.Thanks to PageTutor we can visualize 1 million dollars in 100 packets of $10,000 each consisting of one hundred $100 bills, in proportion to your average taxpayer. http://www.pagetutor.com/trillion/index.htmlSelected GemsThese are just from the preamble to the preamble (one needs to be selective for the simple reason that essentially every paragraph, sometimes every line, sentence or phrase, has a howler).“Also emphasizing that enhanced pre‐2020 ambition can lay a solid foundation for enhanced post‐2020 ambition.”Really!? How long did this language take to negotiate? Who insisted this be included?!“Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.”$100 Million.  Still something you can get a grip on.What more can one say, really?“Emphasizing with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties’ mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre- industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.”Note the “serious concern – not just regular concern. In short, even with all the time and effort we have expended (wasted) on this, nothing we promise to do here will change the temperature in any meaningful way. Also, note the fine tuning of temperature implied in the last phrase: keep the increase “well below 2 degrees C” and yet “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C”. Now, given the natural variation in temperature around the globe and across the seasons, do they really believe “well below 2 and above 1.5” is a rational statement of objectives? Further, I thought we had moved beyond “global warming” to climate change”; so why is the focus on temperature? There is a whole thesis available in just this narrow question regarding this document and its generation process!Just the fact that the Agreement is the “Annex” while the Preamble note (officially the “Proposal by the President”) appears to be the main document is telling. I would think that the agreement should be the main item with the 20 pages of description being appended as an annex.But that’s just me.The Agreement ItselfI do love the (intentional?) double entendre of some of the statements, for example:“Emphasizing the intrinsic relationship that climate change actions, responses and impacts have with equitable access to sustainable development and eradication of povertyAlso recognizing the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country PartiesTaking full account of the specific needs and special situations of the least developed countries with regard to funding and transfer of technology,Recognizing that Parties may be affected not only by climate change, but also by the impacts of the measures taken in response to it,Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity”Certain statements are more frightening, for example:noting the importance for some of the concept of “climate justice”Recall the idea of a “Climate Tribunal” was proposed for a while, and I suspect is still on the agendas of some parties.Selected Items of Concern (my emphasis)Article 2 is a mixed bag. It talks of a “global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of…efforts to eradicate poverty”.Talk about conflicting goals!Again, the reference to well below 2C but limit to 1.5C – as if it can be fine-tuned this way. It refers to “in a manner that does not threaten food production”, which implicitly recognizes the key role fossil fuels play in expanding food production and reducing hunger. It closes with a universal out for all parties by mentioning “differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances”; this phrasing occurs throughout, in various forms. One can easily see it being used approximately 190 different ways, depending on each country’s political and financial objectives at various points in time.Article 4, Paras 3 & 4“Each Party’s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the Party’s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.”“Developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. Developing country Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances.”In other words, the “Developed” countries must fall on the sword, while “Developing” countries continue to grow emissions.In Para 5 of Article 4, “Support shall be provided to developing country Parties”. “Support” being code for cash payments of various kinds being demanded by many countries, to allow for, as Para 5 states: “greater ambition in their actions”. I guess the fiery end of the world does not make them suitably ambitious.Para 7 presumably has some intent, though its not clear exactly what that might be, which is perhaps the point:“Mitigation co-benefits resulting from Parties’ adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans can contribute to mitigation outcomes under this Article.”Thinking cynically, though only slightly, one can imagine there is some financial benefit buried within this innocent looking statement.$1 billion. Now things are getting out of hand.Article 5 is short and focused (apparently) only on forest conservation – presumably this is for the benefit of various forest “conservation” schemes generating substantial GHG credit payments. Enough said.I note with concern, though no surprise, the use of code language to soften and delete any crude references to filthy payments. An example from Para 6: “the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes”.It is extraordinary to me that we spend enormous efforts on tracking and preventing illegal domestic and international flows of money, while here encouraging the trafficking of payments in respect of…nothing! Nothing but theoretical calculated future benefits of highly doubtful calculations.And of course this would not be achievable without a very large bureaucracy to oversee and build it. Article 6, Para 6 (too bad we don’t have a subsection 6 to make it 666) says the Conference of the Parties “shall ensure that a share of the proceeds from activities…is used to cover administrative expenses”.Maybe we can ponder here that great scene in Les Miserables where the nasty barkeep and his wife sing about skimming bits off their customers. Please see the annex to this note for selected lyrics.And empty statements such as Para 9 of Article 6:“A framework for non-market approaches to sustainable development is hereby defined to promote the non- market approaches referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article.”Article 7 deals with adaptation, which every country should be doing on its own anyway – humans adapt, which is why we have been so successful in populating the planet. This section includes a few oddball statements:“Parties acknowledge that adaptation action should follow a country-driven, gender-responsive, participatory and fully transparent approach”“Improving the effectiveness and durability of adaptation actions”“Each Party should, as appropriate, submit and update periodically an adaptation communication, which may include its priorities, implementation and support needs, plans and actions, without creating any additional burden for developing country Parties”Heaven forbid there should be a burden imposed. And of course there is the expected call for funding to help countries adapt:“Continuous and enhanced international support shall be provided to developing country Parties for the implementation of paragraphs 7, 9, 10 and 11 of this Article, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 9, 10 and 11”And of course Article 9 calls for much more “support”, again being the code word for cash. Don’t be alarmed. They only want $100 billion – 100 of these stacks of bills – every year, from you.Para 1 says developed countries are already obligated and so “shall provide financial resources”, while other parties “are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily”. Right.Para 3 suggests looking for funding “from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels” and notes “the significant role of public funds”. One might think the authors are realistically assessing the amount of non-public funding as de minimis; only the public can be bilked of the extreme levels of cash being demanded.Of course, the providers of funding should not have much say in how the funds are to be spent: “the priorities and needs of developing country Parties” will determine uses.Really the only saving grace of this article is its vacuity. However, it does state that the “financial Mechanism of the Convention shall serve as the financial mechanism of this agreement”. Is there cause to be worried?Read Robert Lyman’s report on the Green Climate Fund http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Lyman_Who_Cuts_Who_Pays.pdf Click to access Lyman_Who_Cuts_Who_Pays.pdfArticle 11 is particularly innocuous in its vapidity, with such illuminating statements as:“Capacity-building should be guided by lessons learned, including those from capacity-building activities under the Convention, and should be an effective, iterative process that is participatory, cross-cutting and gender-responsive.”This stuff is hard enough to read – how could anyone take any satisfaction in actually drafting it?!Article 12 is one of the shortest (by far) though with rather sinister implications if one chooses to think that way. It refers to: “climate change education, training, public awareness…”. In summary, let’s cooperate to brainwash the public since we need their acquiescence to make all this work.It is of course then followed by Article 13 – unfortunate numbering since it deals with transparency, trust and confidence! And of course any reporting will be subject to “technical expert review” – I wonder how these helpful experts will be selected and compensated?Developing countries will be eligible for “support” (again, cash) to help them build their “transparency related capacity”; in short, pay them to build up a bureaucracy capable of calculating to various degrees of precision endless figures and statistics to enable them to claim they are telling the truth.Perhaps not surprisingly, given the emptiness of many of the clauses in this agreement, Article 14 puts off the first “global stocktake” of progress until 2023. One might be surprised at this given the urgency of the matter, and the range of reaction to this time frame is likely to be quite wide, depending on one’s views of the entire process. Perhaps the end of the world isn’t as near term as promised?And what proper piece of nonsense would be complete without a committee? Especially one which is “facilitative…transparent, non-adversarial and non-punitive”? Sign me up!And of course we need to talk about how we will meet again and who can attend and all those important things, particularly how to maintain all the high-priced help in the secretariat, which is the reason we need Articles 16 through 19.Under Article 20 this is of course a time limited offer, open for signature for just one year, starting four months from now, although it appears the day after the offer closes in April 2017, countries can still sign up. Presumably those latecomers will not get the toaster offered for early commitment.Speaking of commitment, Article 20 then, with no trace of irony, calls for “regional economic integration organizations” to “declare the extent of their competence”. Unfortunate drafting.Notwithstanding about 190 countries are supposedly agreeing to this treaty, it requires only 55 countries emitting 55% of global GHGs to bring this Frankenstein creature into force.Now, “no reservations may be made to this agreement”, which is the entire content of Article 27, so that must be a very important item.However, given Article 28, any Party may withdraw from the agreement following three years after having agreed to be bound by the agreement (although the departure is only effective after one year following the Party’s resignation from the club). I am guessing there is some twisted logic in the numbers here, which will come to light at some point. Selected Lines from Les Miserables: “Master of the House”From Wikia, Lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer Sung by Thenardier, the InnkeeperSeldom do you seeHonest men like meA gent of good intent who’s content to beMaster of the houseDoling out the charmReady with a handshake and an open palmTells a saucy taleMakes a little stirCustomers appreciate a bon-viveurGlad to do a friend a favourDoesn’t cost me to be niceBut nothing gets you nothingEverything has got a little price~~~~ Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/12/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/12/18/can-solar-energy-replace-all-u-s-hydrocarbon-production/,Jeffery Green ,Can Solar Energy Replace All U.S. Hydrocarbon Production?," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ 2015Robert Lyman is an energy economist and former public servant with 37 years experience assessing energy issues.Environmentalists who adhere to the theory of human-induced catastrophic global warming are fond of saying that solar energy can soon replace all hydrocarbons in the energy systems of modern economies and that, indeed, this can be accomplished by 2050. This thesis can be tested with reference to the United States, about which there are abundant statistics available.The U.S. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in cooperation with the Department of Energy, publishes very accurate data concerning the sources and uses of energy in the United States economy. Oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear reactors produce most of the U.S.’s commercially distributed energy.  In 2013, the total energy consumed was 97.4 quadrillion BTUs (thousand trillion British Thermal Units). Of this total, solar energy accounted for less than 0.36% of total production.The leading solar energy candidate technology to produce significant amounts of power is Concentrated Solar Power with integrated storage. The largest American CSP plant currently built is the Crescent Dune plant in Tonopah Nevada. This plant uses a 540 foot high tower surrounded by 17,500 computer controlled mirrors, each 64 square meters in size, to precisely track the sun and focus the sun’s energy on the solar tower to convert that energy into 1,050 F degree heat to melt sodium nitrate based salts to turn an electro-magnetic generator. The facility takes up 1,600 acres or 6 square kilometers (2.32 square miles) of land. It cost about $1 billion to build and it has a nameplate capacity of 125 MW and a capacity factor of 52%. It can only produce about 485 GWh of power annually at a system cost of U.S. 48.5 cents per kWh (about eight times the cost of a conventional power plant). This plant garnered some unwanted publicity when, during a test of the system, it incinerated 150 birds that happened to fly over during the test.In order to produce the energy needed to power the United States by 2050 solely from Concentrated Solar Power would take approximately 60,000 plants the size of the Crescent Dune project. Simply to replace  the energy that would otherwise be generated by hydrocarbon sources would require almost 47,000 plants the size of the Crescent Dune project.This breaks down roughly as follows:20,687 CSP plants to replace current petroleum production & use15,676 CSP plants to replace current natural gas production & use10,609 CSP plants to replace current coal production & use4,87 4 CSP plants to replace current nuclear fission production & use2,646 CSP plants to replace current Biomass production & use1,508 CSP plants to replace current hydroelectric production & use4,000 CSP plants to allow for rotational shutdown and maintenance on a nationwide base of 56,000 operating plantsCritics of the Crescent Dune plant have observed that, even though located in the Nevada desert, it is still located too far north to make optimal use of the sun’s rays. There is virtually no way that one could find either 47,000 or 60,000 sites in the southern United States that would make sense. If you could place them all together (an impossibility), 47,000 plants would take up 108,000 square miles, almost the entire area of the state of Nevada, and it would cost U.S. $47 trillion. 47,000 plants with 17,500 mirrors each would require the manufacture of 822,500,000 mirrors. If we could manufacture one per second, starting right now, it would take 26 years to build that many mirrors.This is not going to happen. Not by 2050. Not ever.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/12/18
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/12/11/responding-to-a-letter-in-the-calgary-herald-dec-11-2015-re-its-about-honesty/,Donna Eliason ,"RESPONDING TO A LETTER IN THE CALGARY HERALD Dec. 11, 2015 RE “It’s about honesty”"," These are our opinions. Update Jan 09, 2016: Thanks to the sharp eye of a twitter follower, we note we had forgotten to link to the original letter. In the interests of honesty, we post a link to the letter in the Herald. http://calgaryherald.com/opinion/letters/letters-for-friday-dec-11 Friends of Science Society is in favor of honest debate. Consequently, we question why an honest debate was not called, in place of publishing charges against us in the media.Friends of Science Society agrees that one should not lie and deceive to make a buck. Consequently, we question why a taxpayer-funded charity, appears to be using their Competition Bureau claims against us as a means of a fund-raising “cause,” while employing images of billboard ads that we no longer use.  We have complied with past Ad Standards Council rulings and revised our text; the new billboard ads were acceptable to the media providers which are well aware of Ad Standards Council guidelines, otherwise our current billboards would not have gone up. Is that not misleading and deceptive that the complainants are portraying billboards that we no longer use?  Friends of Science Society is a small non-profit. So we never make a buck.Friends of Science Society agrees that the Competition Act is an important piece of legislation – and the act has certain requirements, one of them being that the submission of requests for inquiry and the subsequent process, are to be confidential.  Consequently, we question why damaging allegations against us were widely distributed in the public domain via the internet after being published online on the taxpayer funded charity’s website.  Is that honest?Friends of Science Society is in favor of informing the public of facts. To this end, we are telling you that there is no scientific consensus on climate change, as shown in our detailed report: “97%? No! Math myths and Social Proofs.”  http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf  We wonder why people are still claiming this fallacy.Note: This is an archival reproduction of our first ad.Friends of Science Society is informing the public of important information that the Alberta Climate Panel somehow omitted from their Climate Leadership document.  https://youtu.be/W3SGgrgbaK0Friends of Science Society is informing the public that the alleged health risk of coal-fired power plants is greatly overstated and the costs of early phase-out are barely discussed.  Our independent expert assessments suggest it would cost taxpayers:a)        $11.1 billion in compensatory payments to phase-out coal early; (unless the government attempts to unilaterally overthrow contractual agreements)b)      ~$11 billion to build equivalent natural gas plant capacity (8 x 800 MW plants equivalent to the new Shepard Energy Center which cost ~$1.4 billion).c)       If we are to add renewables like wind and solar to the grid, it would cost about $1 million per MW to connect these intermittent power sources to the grid, for very little return on power.d)      Likewise, there would be substantial costs incurred in new transmission lines to remote wind or solar farms – example the Southern Transmission Lines cost Albertans ~$2.2 billion and for this we only get 4% of our power, intermittently.e)      For this, we have been told by early phase-out advocates that Albertans would save $300 million in health costs, 4,000 asthma visits and 100 premature deaths – though all those figures come from a computer simulation which substantially over estimates impacts when compared to  actual patient records.  Further, as evidenced with the wildfire smoke of this summer, there is no guarantee there would be a reduction in health issues as most asthma/respiratory factors come from ground level emissions from cars and trucks or natural factors like dust, smoke, pollen and molds.f)        Does this simple cost-benefit analysis justify the case? We think not. But, we were and are willing to publicly debate this issue.  We also wrote a detailed assessment of the phase-out coal issue – “Burning Questions.”The experience in Ontario has been that phasing out of coal there has led to a 27% power price hike at hospitals (2012-2013) and presently doctor fees are being cut.  We think some $22 billion + millions of dollars in costs of transmission and integration of renewables could be better applied to human health and professional/support service salaries in Alberta. So we said this in a billboard.Ontario is burdened with some $44 billion in public debt for its power (probably much more now) while Alberta has zero public debt for power.  This is an “Alberta advantage” that we, as taxpayers and scientists, believe should be protected so as not to saddle our future generations of children with untenable debt. Consequently, we are outspoken on this issue.Friends of Science Society honestly informs the public of consequences of a rush to renewables as seen in the UK, EU and Ontario.  Power prices in Germany and Denmark are at least triple that of the US. Manufacturers like BMW left Germany for the US where power prices are much cheaper. The same is happening in Ontario where industrial power prices are some of the highest in North America.Friends of Science Society honestly points out to the public that countries like Denmark and Germany, touted as the esteemed nations of renewable power, still run on coal!  Denmark has 7 coal-fired power plants and uses 48% coal-fired power generation;* it has to buy coal from offshore at $60/t. We are blessed with a thousand years of coal supply in Alberta and Western Canada, and in Alberta, we the people, own it.[UPDATE Jan 09, 2016: We are told Denmark is planning to entirely phase-out coal by 2050 and that the 48% figure is out-of-date. The World Nuclear Energy assessment indicates that much of Danish wind is exported, and power is imported from Sweden (nuclear), Norway (hydro) and Germany (coal and nuclear and RE). Therefore the following figures may still include a high proportion of coal and nuclear: http://world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/Denmark/ TDenmark still uses lots of coal, and in terms of being ‘green’ they also operate the world’s largest marine transport service, including shipping oil. Marine diesel is the ‘dirtiest’ in terms of emissions and ship trails can be clearly seen from space. ]Note: These are all Wikipedia Creative Commons photos/map. See detailed credits at the end of this post.Look how many times Denmark fits into Alberta! They have SEVEN coal-fired power plants!  And Danes are in excellent health and live well into their 80s. How can it be?Friends of Science Society is honestly in favor of new, innovative technologies that might work and provide power with few or no emissions.  Some  of Friends of Science Society members are inventors or patent holders. Some are engineers – experts in assessing how things work.  Consequently, we are not in favor of technology that does not work or that imposes unreasonable burdens on taxpayers.  Contrary to statements by our accusers, we are agnostic on the source of power, as long as the outcome is affordable, reliable power, suitable for a modern, industrialized society.Google engineers, NOT Friends of Science, have made the determination that renewable energy like wind and solar do not address climate change and cannot provide power for contemporary society and are horribly expensive.  Here’s is a overview of why this is so. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/21/renewable_energy_simply_wont_work_google_renewables_engineers/Likewise, Friends of Science Society reviewed a proposed national wind-hydro grid, widely touted this spring as doable by 2035 in a report called “Acting on Climate Change,” and found it to be infeasible from a technical standpoint and even if possible to do, would be an absurdly expensive option that would put the country at risk of national blackouts.  Despite the fact that this idea was supported by ~70 scholars, few of them appear to have any qualifications in power generation engineering, transmission or distribution.  They cannot be faulted for not being experts in this area – but as academic scholars, why didn’t they do their research?It may have been unpleasant to have this widely promoted scheme deconstructed by Friends of Science Society’s power generation experts, as we did, but we were being honest with the public.  It seems irresponsible, in retrospect, that those behind “Acting on Climate Change” did not do a comprehensive technical review before championing this idea.  The operation of the power grid, which we all take for granted as we flip on lights, charge cellphones, power up computers and turn on the coffee-maker, is a very complex technical discipline. Operation of a reliable grid, at the ready to meet consumer and industrial demand, requires intense millisecond management of the ebb and flow of power.  It is not an area for ideologues, only for technical experts. So – that’s what we honestly do. Friends of Science Society examines the evidence over the ideology.  Is it really ‘clean, green, free?’ Does the scientific data actually support the claim of ‘Catastrophic’ or imminent climate change caused by human industrial activity?  No. We expose those fallacies and it seems that many people don’t like that. Which begs the question, who is funding them? We don’t know. But, about the facts in the foregoing, we are just being honest.Feel free to submit comments – they are moderated.UPDATE Jan. 09, 2016: This article appeared in the Financial Post Dec. 17, 2015:No justice in censorshiphttp://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/no-justice-in-censorship-30-Photo and Map Credits for Danish Coal-fired power plant montage -Wikipedia“Denmark physical map” by Urutseg – Own work.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/12/11/nettoyons-lair-de-paris-renvoyons-les-dans-les-cordes/,,Nettoyons l’air de Paris ! Renvoyons-les dans les cordes !," par Michelle Stirling(Traduction: http://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/stirling-lets-clear-the-air-at-paris-climate-talks )Il y a quelques jours, la nouvelle éclatait : Volkswagen aurait trafiqué les tests d’émissions d’une partie de ses voitures diesels de haut de gamme, soi-disant respectueuses de l’environnement. Les gens ont été scandalisés et le directeur général a démissionné.A la même époque, le premier ministre de l’Alberta Rachel Notley annonçait aux Chambres de Commerce de l’Alberta que nous ferions mieux de mettre de l’ordre dans notre « maison environnementale » sous peine de voir diverses mesures nous être imposées. Et d’ajouter que l’air de l’Alberta était « mauvais ».Vraiment? Je conteste vivement cette affirmation. En 2011, l’air au Canada a été jugé comme étant la troisième de plus haute qualité dans le monde. En 2006, Environnement Canada a indiqué que Red Deer était un point chaud inhabituel et que la mauvaise qualité de son air était liée aux particules fines résultant des émissions spécifiques se produisant dans ce couloir de transport, rien d’autre. Le manuel de Nav Canada, qui compile les conditions météorologiques pour les vols autour de l’Alberta, confirme que le temps et la nature du terrain jouent un grand rôle dans la qualité de l’air.De même, les émissions dues aux transports, à l’air stagnant et à l’humidité résidante sont des facteurs qui rendent Paris (France) – le site des prochains pourparlers de l’ONU sur le changement climatique – l’une des villes les plus sales d’Europe en termes de qualité de l’air. Les épisodes de stagnation associés à l’air humide ont conduit à des niveaux de pollution de l’air de Paris aussi élevées que 180 microgrammes de particules de 10 microns ou moins par mètre cube – plus du double de la limite de sécurité de 80 microgrammes. Au cours du printemps 2015, un niveau tellement élevé de particules fines a été atteint à Paris que le gouvernement français a interdit l’utilisation des voitures (Les Albertains ne rencontrent ce genre de pollution que durant les feux de forêts ou lors des inversions météorologiques). Quelle est donc la véritable raison de cette pollution terrible? Une politique climatique désastreuse, bien entendu ! Comme le souligne Bloomberg « View » le 23 septembre dans « la politique du climat et le scandale Volkswagen », l’Europe a poussé l’utilisation des véhicules au diesel parce que certains spécialistes avaient prédit à l’époque que ces voitures consommeraient, au final, moins de carburant. Hélas, le diesel émet non seulement davantage de suie, induisant la formation de brouillard de pollution, mais aussi plus d’oxydes d’azote. A cause des taux d’imposition préférentiels en faveur des véhicules au diesel, plus de la moitié du parc automobile européen fonctionne au diesel. La situation est encore pire en France où ce pourcentage atteint maintenant plus de 80 pour cent, créant ainsi un risque très important pour la santé publique et ce, sans préserver aucunement notre Terre.Ne ressort-il pas de la plus grande hypocrisie que 50.000 personnes, ayant soi-disant l’intention de sauver la planète, voleront, conduiront, prendront le bateau, le train ou la voiture, tout moyen de locomotion alimenté par des combustibles fossiles, pour se rendre à Paris et discuter de la réduction des émissions de CO2 ?Le Canada ne devrait-il pas leur imposer des solutions ? L’économiste Ross McKitrick m’a fait remarquer que le Canada n’a jamais obtenu le moindre crédit pour les progrès que nous avons faits dans la lutte contre la vraie pollution. De 1985 à 2011, nos émissions industrielles de monoxyde de carbone ont baissé de 26 pour cent, les émissions de particules de carbone ont diminué de 44 pour cent et les émissions de dioxyde de soufre ont chuté de 69 pour cent. En parallèle, la production économique totale a augmenté de 89 pour cent ! Qui dit mieux ?Lorsque nous irons à Paris, nous devrions exiger que toute autre nation réponde au minimum à ces normes. Tant qu’ils n’y sont pas parvenus, ils devraient se taire et ne rien dire sur les émissions canadiennes.L’ONU est basée sur le principe de l’égalité souveraine. C’est probablement la raison pour laquelle l’Arabie Saoudite peut être élue à la tête de la Commission des droits de l’Homme de l’ONU, même si elle aura décapité plus de gens cette année que l’ISIS. N’hésitez pas à souligner ce fait lorsque l’un de ces bien-pensants onusiens tente de vous imposer ses normes environnementales.Comme les ingénieurs de Google l’ont récemment révélé, le renouvelable est une utopie. Arrêtons sa promotion et le gaspillage qui l’accompagne. Quand au réchauffement climatique, il est aux abonnés absents depuis plus de 18 ans et 8 mois ; la variation de la température moyenne de notre planète affichant des valeurs “très proche de zéro», pour citer le climatologue allemand Hans von Storch.La véritable raison – cachée, bien entendu – derrière la conférence de Paris est liée à l’échange de crédits carbones, pas au changement climatique, pas à la qualité de l’air et certainement pas pour « protéger» la planète. Il faut plutôt sauver la face et éviter la banqueroute de ceux qui ont investi massivement dans les énergies  renouvelables et qui, comme Volkswagen, ont été pris de court et piégé. Il ne faut pas que ces profiteurs/voleurs arrivent à nous imposer un système de commerce mondial du carbone et nous obligent à payer la facture salée de leurs mauvais investissements.Le barnum du changement climatique émet beaucoup de relents nauséeux et de brouillard toxique.  Nettoyons l’air de Paris !

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/12/10/an-open-letter-to-margaret-atwood-vice-president-pen-international/,Jerry Eber mcphee ,"AN OPEN LETTER to Margaret Atwood, Vice President, PEN International"," Dec 10, 2015PEN InternationalATTN: Ms. Margaret AtwoodVice PresidentAN OPEN LETTERDear Ms. Atwood,RE: Public Trial – No JuryOn this December 10, 2015, the UN Human Rights Day, we appeal to you and PEN International for justice.On Dec. 8, 2015, the Hon. Kirsty Duncan, Minister of Science, stood in the Canadian House of Commons and declared “The war on science is over” to a standing ovation.However, for us, the war on science has just begun and the attack is against us.A Public Trial with No Due Process has OccurredLast week, our organization was publicly smeared by an organization, a taxpayer funded charity, of which you are an honorary director, which claims to defend justice, but which in fact unjustly denigrated our group of scientists, engineers and citizens, by publishing an extensive document in the public domain which made sweeping false, misleading and damaging accusations against us. This was allegedly filed as a complaint to the Competition Bureau of Canada, under a section of the Competition Act, an act which requires such complaints and inquiries to proceed in confidence. Claiming to represent the interests of several high profile Canadians, many of whom frequently speak out for human rights and free expression, this organization has since posted the document on-line and appears to be using it as a fund-raising cause for themselves, under the banner of “ACT NOW. Help advance an HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT climate change.”Honest conversation?  Ironically, that’s what we’ve been trying to do since 2002 when our group was formed.Our first foray was into the field of public debate.In November 2002, the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA/then APEGGA) published an open debate between members of the Pembina Institute and three experts, two of whom became our scientific advisers.The three arguing for our perspective, that the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change offered a scientific argument. The Pembina Institute proponents argued the political case of Kyoto. The scientific argument for the sun’s role still stands, and grows in importance as we see the solar minimum of today progressing with periods of a complete lack of solar activity. This is the quietest the sun has been in 100 years and is a likely harbinger of a time of imminent cooling, for which the world is not prepared as the focus has solely been on global warming – now known as ‘climate change.’Climate changes – we agree. For warmer or cooler.By NASA Goddard Space Flight Center [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia CommonsAs experts in this area of science, we are trying to have a fair and honest discussion about such issues, but our efforts fall on deaf ears.Now, with the publication of this damaging document, we have been coerced into a public trial, but with no due process, no judge or jury, and no means to properly defend ourselves.What ‘crime’ did we commit to be so excoriated in public?We spoke our minds.We expressed our views – our opinions and some scientific tidbits – in a series of public billboards.Ms. Atwood, those who have attacked us claim we are publishing false and misleading information, though the scientific billboards are based on actual scientific images or data.Those who have attacked us claim our statements are false and misleading because it does not fit a ‘consensus’ view.Those who have attacked us claim that we are simply promoting our message in order to beneficially gain from the outcome, when in fact our organization is based on volunteer work by professionals who, if anything have lost much by being publicly smeared and condemned, and who have volunteered for some 13 years.Those who have attacked us claim we are part of some greater ‘conspiracy’ of sorts; they intimate we have nefarious funding – when in reality our modest beginnings are based in the scientific expertise of an Oxford-educated astrophysicist, and several earth and atmospheric scientists who had the temerity to challenge what they believed was a flawed concept – Kyoto Accord – that would cost the public much, and not result in any benefit to the environment.A decade later, this has proven to be true.National Academies Press publication “On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research”We write against impunity. The impunity of a large, well-funded group, representing high profile individuals, to ‘jump the shark’ and depart from due process, proscribed by law, and publicly denigrate our organization.We write against mob rule. An on-line campaign by this charity now asks people to sign on and petition the Competition Act for an “honest conversation on climate change” – in this inherently dishonest way.We write against bullying – the kind of bullying that is acceptable in no other part of Western society, but one that flourishes, for some reason, in the world of climate science. And it is not simply name-calling, Ms. Atwood. One of our early scientific advisers, a very talented woman scientist, was driven from her role in the sciences by denigration, abuse and even death threats – to a safer profession. Dog walking.So. This is the liberation of women in the West? To reach the goal of scientific expert only to be driven out.We speak out against intimidation.In this is the field of ‘science’ – diverse intellectuals like an Austrian music professor and an American philosopher – people who have no professional standing to assess the science, have, with impunity, called for the death sentence for climate science ‘deniers.’The personal attacks on dissident scientific voices led to a public statement by the AAAS in 2011 – but these attacks still continue, as evidenced by last week’s public attack on our organization. You may say that as citizens of a Western democracy like Canada, we have legal tools and process to right this wrong. A glance at the ruinous state of affairs in the climate science legal battle between Mark Steyn and Michael Mann shows where such an effort will lead.Here we stand publicly accused – but “without charge or legal due process.”We represent “the many critical voices across the world currently being silenced.”Try to imagine the cost of our individual members speaking up. In the inquisitorial atmosphere around this topic today, people lose jobs and family members’ support. They are ostracized and called names.Science – which used to be about free and open inquiry – is now a matter of compliance!Your group claims “Ideas cannot be imprisoned.” But indeed they can.Perhaps behind the scenes there are other commercial forces working against us. No one considers this possibility.Biofuels – a Key Driver of the Refugee CrisisWe have spoken out against biofuel policies because they are driving human misery world-wide. Food prices have spiked dramatically because of climate policy. Yes, putting edible corn into gas tanks has driving up food prices and is certainly a key driver of the current refugee crisis across the MENA region.Renewables are not Clean, Green or FreeWe have spoken out against the costs and environmental damage of so-called Renewable Energy – wind and solar. Many Western citizens believe wind and solar to be ‘clean’ – we have exposed the dirty facts that wind farms kill millions of birds and bats a year, that bats die a horrible death with their lungs exploded by barometric pressure changes near the wind turbines, and that people in China, where the rare earth mines are located for wind turbine magnets, are slowly dying in an area that has no environmental controls whatsoever. In the Western world, the addition of wind and solar has driven up the cost of power so that vulnerable people have been pushed into fuel poverty – where their choices are literally reduced to deciding whether to heat their home….or to eat. In the UK, thousands of people died prematurely due to heat-or-eat poverty. These are human rights we are defending – the right to be informed. Our scientific and economic messages bring these issues forward to the public domain. We have published reports by energy economist and former public servant Robert Lyman showing that the climate targets our government is committing us to are simply ‘not doable’ without destroying our own economy. Shouldn’t Canadians know that?Commentary:http://www.troymedia.com/2015/06/22/what-signing-the-climate-change-targets-will-mean-for-you/Report:http://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/climate_change_implications_Lyman.pdfAffordable Power is a Human Right in a Country Experiencing -40°C/FWe have informed Albertans that they have been misled on statements about the impact of coal-fired power plants on health in Alberta. This began with a simple citizen’s visit to an evening discussion forum, where one of our people realized that a great deal of misinformation was being distributed about this issue.Sadly, despite our best efforts to publicize this information, we have found the Canadian media strangely reluctant to report on our factual, evidence based reports. But they like to pile on and call us names whenever a controversial opportunity arises.In any other context, Friends of Science Society would be considered a national treasure and honoured.But a taxpayer funded ‘charity’ wants to silence us, by denying us due process and effecting a public attack.Challenging Groupthink is not a Crime if Freedom of Expression is a Human RightSome will say – but there is a ‘consensus’ on climate science – others will claim that catastrophic outcomes are imminent and therefore our persistent efforts to open up this issue and actually have an ‘honest conversation’ represent a risk to society at large.Neither of these claims of ‘consensus’ or ‘catastrophic risk’ is true.Our report “97% Consensus? NO! Global Warming Math Myths and Social Proofs” shows that there is no consensus other than the self-evident fact that humans do affect climate, but cannot control climate.US Senate testimony by Dr. Roger Peilke, Jr. and long-term evidence in his document clarifies that there is no imminent risk of a climate catastrophe and that it would take decades before any particular trend of human-caused climate changes could be identified – and that it is possible natural factors would be more influential than human effect. We simply don’t know.Video: https://youtu.be/meoETyMA4K0Written Testimony: http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/2013.20.pdfUS Senate testimony by Dr. Judith Curry and critical assessment of the long-term trends clarifies that many of the IPCC’s more catastrophic predictions on climate are simply not coming true and that people suffer from ‘weather amnesia’ – that climatic conditions were worse in past times. Dr. Curry states that on the evidence, “carbon dioxide (CO2) is not the control knob that can fine tune climate.”The on-going, extra-judicial attacks on scientific dissident voices must end.It may be, Madame, that political forces are annoyed at our factual statement that “Politicians Can’t $top Climate Change.”We speak out to protect the interests of fellow Canadians – yes, we want an open and honest debateWe are very concerned about the 1.5°C target that has been set by representatives of our government as a climate change target. Based on the evidence, Canada’s economy will be destroyed in attempting to meet this target, particularly because carbon dioxide is not the control knob to fine tune climate, and the proposed mitigation measures based on present ‘clean-tech’ technology, will create mass unemployment and widespread heat-or-eat poverty.We appeal to you, Ms. Atwood, as Vice President of PEN International and champion of human rights, on this day, December 10, 2015, the UN Human Rights Day, to support our cause and champion freedom of speech in science.If, in Canada, the ‘war on science is over’ please help stop these extrajudicial attacks on us.Sincerely,Friends of Science Society#ScienceIsNotComplianceShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/12/10

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/12/04/friends-of-science-society-statement-on-ecojustice-complaint-to-competition-bureau/,Rick Walker ,Friends of Science Society Statement on Ecojustice Complaint to Competition Bureau," Friends of Science Society today  (Dec. 3, 2015)  received notice via twitter of a complaint apparently filed with the Competition Bureau of Canada.  This complaint was publicized in a story in the National Observer of December 3, 2015.  http://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/12/03/news/breaking-ecojustice-files-complaint-competition-bureau-against-climate-denial-groupsAccording to the Competition Bureau of Canada “The Bureau conducts its investigations in private and keeps confidential the identity of the source and the information provided.”  http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/h_00019.htmlThus, the publication of the complaint and attendant publicity, prior to Friends of Science Society receiving any official notice of such action, appear to violate the nature and intent of Competition Bureau work, and to unfairly and publicly make damaging allegations against Friends of Science Society and other parties named in the document, which are not founded on investigative outcomes.According to the Canadian Charter of Rights: Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:·         (a ) freedom of conscience and religion;·         (b ) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;·         (c ) freedom of peaceful assembly; and·         (d ) freedom of association. http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.htmlFriends of Science Society note that Ecojustice, the party launching this complaint, is a taxpayer funded federally registered charity and that charities are so funded for the purpose of ‘public benefit.’  http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/plcy/cps/cps-024-eng.html“Speaking for Friends of Science Society, we do not know what public benefit there is to a charity attempting to publicly denigrate a group of scientists and citizens who are expressing scientific information to the larger public. This would appear to go against the very essence of the Canadian Charter of Rights, the principles of scientific inquiry and public debate,” said Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, noting that climate change measures in the EU and UK have severely damaged those economies and put millions of people into heat or eat poverty. “We await any formal notice from the Competition Bureau.”AboutFriends of Science Society has spent a decade reviewing a broad spectrum of literature on climate change and have concluded the sun is the main driver of climate change, not carbon dioxide (CO2). Friends of Science is made up of a core group of earth, atmospheric, solar scientists, engineers, as well as citizens who challenge the catastrophic view of climate change.Friends of Science SocietyP.O.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/11/18/calgary-climate-change-billboard-campaign-lights-up-and-papers-the-city/,Mark J McCullough ,Calgary Climate Change Billboard Campaign Lights Up and Papers the City," Calgary is getting the climate change message with a series of digital and static billboards all over town, courtesy of Friends of Science Society!As the Alberta government contemplates a carbon tax, we think that everyone should know:So, why tax it?You see, despite a significant rise in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) there has been no warming in over 18 years – that’s before the Kyoto Accord was ever ratified! (Kyoto was supposed to ‘stop global warming’ by reducing GHGs – of which carbon dioxide was thought to be the biggest villain).You maybe don’t believe this.  Here is a newspaper article from Australia citing a 20 year hiatus!And here’s where the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) announced a 15 year hiatus (up to their press time of 2013).Now, the IPCC sets much of its work on climate models – computer simulations. What happens when you compare those simulations with reality? What are the real temperatures doing? Rising or staying about the same?  Well, as you can see in the billboard artwork below, the IPCC projected simulations go up….but the real temperatures do not.  This strongly suggests the IPCC climate models are faulty. We should not be relying on them for making climate policies.So, we are telling our politicians to avoid being coerced into any bad deals at the Paris COP21 (21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties).  We have submitted a bi-lingual report to the federal government and the Alberta Climate Panel in which we ask them to speak for the fact that Canada has reduced real pollution while improving our economy.  Everyone should have to meet Alberta’s standards and our standards of land reclamation.  Here are the links to our report and a short video in French offering an overview.French report :  http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/D%C3%A9contaminer_l%E2%80%99air_%C3%A0_Paris.pdfEnglish report :  http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Clear_The_Air_In_Paris.pdfVidéo : https://youtu.be/g9oxxGCfGmQFinally, people may be wondering if humans are not causing warming – or if there is no warming at the moment – then what causes climate change?  We have spent some 13 years reviewing climate science literature.  Our core science team has about 300 years of training and experience in earth, atmospheric, solar sciences and engineering.  Based on what we have reviewed, the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change.  Not you.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/11/11/courting-controversy-our-new-edmonton-billboard-campaign-complain-here-please/,Sue Muller ,Courting Controversy – Our New Edmonton Billboard Campaign! Complain here. Please.," With COP-21 Paris climate talks on the horizon, we thought it would be only fair to start a new billboard campaign and get our message out.We’re glad we have Freedom of Speech in Canada – we condemn the censorship of Phiippe Verdier, French TV meteorologist, who was fired after writing a book with dissenting views on climate.  We experienced similar attempts to shut us up when we ran our last billboard campaign – from numerous complaints to Ad Standards Council, to a group of students and professors in Montreal wanting to use the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to…. shut down our freedom!To all those on the witch hunt we say this:We have a digital billboard campaign running in Edmonton and another digital and static billboard campaign in Calgary. Let’s take them one at a time.Here are the Edmonton themes. We think our Edmonton media provider, OUTFRONT, has done a fabulous job. We love this creative! What do you think?This billboard tries to inform Albertans of the costs of the anti-coal campaign, and that there will be serious consequences.  Our report – “Burning Questions” demonstrates that the evidence does not support the claims of the anti-coal advocates.  According to industry experts, it would cost $11.1 BN in compensation for an early phase out of coal-fired power plants, plus >$11 BN to transition to natural gas plants (based  on 8 x 800 MW equivalents – i.e. the new Shepard Energy Center in Calgary at a cost of $1.4 Billion), plus $1 Million per MW to integrate any additional wind/solar to the grid and potentially billions in transmission lines.  If we stick to the conventional federal phase out, most of these plants will be off-line by 2030 anyway. Seems to us that the issue is a proxy for pushing renewables, maybe like this report out of the US about the Sierra Club having some big renewable investors as donors. What do you think?We also thought that citizens and the new Alberta government and the Alberta Climate Panel might not be aware of the 18+ year hiatus in global warming.And we are pretty sure most people are under the impression that ‘wind is free.’ The chart below (not a billboard) shows that in countries with the most renewables…the highest power prices. The US EIA confirms residential power prices are skyrocketing in the EU.We also wanted to tell the world that the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change and ask people to think about the…obvious.This magnificent image is by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons and its use does not imply endorsement of our message.Fantastic, isn’t it?Last but not least, for Edmonton, listen up Albertan and Canadian politicians!  In fact, politicians everywhere should think about this, and so should TAXPAYER$. One of our contributors, Robert Lyman, an energy economist of some 37 years experience has written a ‘do the math’ review of the implications of climate change targets for Canada.  We hope government officials are reading this – please feel free to send it along to your elected provincial and federal officials as well as your local major industries, senior executives and business groups or Chambers of Commerce. The implications trying to achieve the climate targets would be devastating for our economy and lifestyle. “Climate Change Targets for Canada – Examining the Implications.”http://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/climate_change_implications_Lyman.pdf And how do the Edmonton billboards look in real life?  Great!These are at a number of locations across the city, but all messages rotate through on the digital screen. This is the rotation at one location.We’d love to hear your comments – post them here on our blog! (Moderated, of course)If you like what you see and want to tell the world the same thing, please tweet and share with friends and elected officials.  If you don’t like, you can tell us, and why.

Dr. Istvan Marko of Université catholique de Louvain,Laboratoire de Chimie Organique et Médicinale, sent a letter to Mr Maroš Šefčovič Vice President of the European Union Commission. He was concerned that Mr. Šefčovič had certain scientific shortcomings in the discussion of various details regarding the future actions of the EU on climate change.  He received a perfunctory response and so has tried again, this time discussing Mr. Šefčovič’s visit to the province of Quebec in Canada.  Professor Marko has asked us to post both letters so that the general public have an opportunity to review climate change commentary from a qualified scientist, and to know that this politician has been provided with such information. These are his personal opinions, based on his expert knowledge. Click on the link below for the original letter or view the small jpegs. The more recent letter of Nov. 7, 2015 follows.letter sefcovicMr Maroš ŠefčovičVice-PresidentEuropean CommissionB-1049 BrusselsMaros.sefcovic@ec.europa.euDear Vice-President,Sometime ago, I sent you a letter concerning your keynote speech at the EU-Serbia High-level meeting on Climate Change in Belgrade, pointing out some of its shortcomings and attempting to explain in simple terms that EU was taking the wrong avenue as far as climate change and CO2 emission restrictions were concerned. As I expected, I received a kind of non-response from one of your underlings. Obviously, that person did neither properly read my letter, nor understood it, and he certainly did not inform you about its content since you repeated the same mistakes during your last visit in Canada, as the brief underneath, followed by the subsequent two tweets attest:LESSONS FROM QUEBEC: There is plenty the EU can learn about renewables and energy efficiency from Canada. Maroš Šefčovič, the Commission’s energy union chief, was eager to learn how Quebec, one of the largest hydro power producers in the world, integrated renewables into the electricity grid and manages its energy efficiency investments. Both Canada and the EU now hope to revive a joint energy council format, originally set up in 2007. Šefčovič knows a thing or two about Canada having been posted as a diplomat in Ottawa years ago.Maroš Šefčovič ‏@MarosSefcovicCongrat Quebec for being 4th largest hydropower producer in world. Gd exchange w @phcouillard on renewables,ETS+decarbonisation of transportMaroš Šefčovič ‏@MarosSefcovicConclud my visit to Canada with Quebec PM @phcouillard. Impressed to see Quebec’s commitment to fight climate changeAllow me to remind you a few things concerning ETS. As you may be aware, this is essentially a new financial tool whose sole purpose is dedicated at making money from the so-called “green” economy. In fact, we all know, you included, that this is just one more instrument devised to enable some big banks and international corporations to suck money from the population in the form of juicy state subsidies offered to support these non-renewable but intermittent energies. Obviously, this money has to come from somewhere and it originates from the citizens in the form of taxes. So much so for the social aspects of EU.Being the Commission’s energy union chief, you are certainly aware that Interpol has recently released an important report in which they link carbon trading deals with white collars and organised crime. In several countries already, these ETS have served the sole purpose of laundering dirty money. I am not sure that I should bring up to you some sore memories, involving people such as Lakshmi Mittal, who requested by law that the Walloon government of Belgium pay him several million euros for some unspent carbon credits after he closed down steel factories in this country and move them elsewhere. I am not convinced that endorsing and praising a system that favours thieves and organised crime will make you particularly popular among European citizens.As for the energy viewpoint, and since you are the Commission’s energy union chief, I would have thought that at least you would be able to make a difference between renewable energies and intermittent energies. Canada possesses a huge amount of hydroelectric plants that provide them with all the electricity they require in a controlled manner. Hydroelectric systems are truly renewable, after removing the damages done to nature by building the dams, and their electricity production can be modulated in a manner similar to that of nuclear power plants or gas-fired power plants. This has nothing to do with intermittent energies, such as solar and wind power, which depend solely upon the good will of the wind or the sun and the generous support of the States. These are clearly not renewable energies and such an answer from the part of any first year undergraduate student at any energy course examination would have resulted in a plain 0/20 mark.To make it painfully clear, whilst the Western Canadian province of Alberta, which has very limited hydro resources and no public ownership of power, has no electricity debt – amazing, isn’t it? – Ontario, who decided against all odds and under duress from some French electric companies to move onto wind power, has one of the highest energy liabilities of the entire nation of Canada. In fact, it has the highest sub sovereign (non-country) debt in the entire world, double that of California, which has three times the population of Ontario. The move into intermittent energies plays certainly a big part in this fiasco, and Ontario now has a 44 Billion Canadian dollars power utility public debt, second only to Quebec’s 63.7 Billion. Alberta has none. Every single windmill constructed in Ontario makes this province poorer by the hour and forbids the humbler people to access vitally needed energy. There is a beautiful linear correlation between the percentage of intermittent energy per country and the cost of this energy per capita: the more intermittent, the higher the cost. You can find all the pertinent data in the report of Eurostat.In addition, as you may recall, wind and solar energies being intermittent, they need gas-fired back-ups to supply energy when they are not producing it, which in fact happens most of the time. These supporting power plants go on and off constantly to compensate the fluctuating production of solar and wind and therefore overproduce CO2 and other gases. Any chemist can do a full life cycle analysis and demonstrate in a simple way that wind and solar energies actually increase the production of carbon dioxide. As an illustration, Ontario, with its current energy mix, produces electricity at less than 40 grams of CO2 emissions per kWh. Wind and solar energies, coupled with their natural-gas-fired backups, generate electricity at about 200 grams of CO2 emissions per kWh, 5 times more! Now that is a serious reduction in carbon dioxide production indeed!As the EU Commission’s energy union chief, I am bemused that you ignore this important aspect of intermittent energy production and praise Canada for choosing the worth possible avenue in term of electricity generation and CO2 emissions reduction. Moreover, I would have thought that the current tragic failure of the German EnergieWende – they are returning to the worst possible kind of coal (lignite) and are increasing their CO2 emissions – coupled with the recent decision of Denmark to retain their coal and gas-fired power plants and to abandon their utopic target of 100% renewable by 2050 – they finally realized it was a complete nonsense and it was destroying their economy – would have opened your eyes. Seemingly, this is not the case. “There are no blinder people than those who refuse to see”, as the saying goes, unless the power of lobbies, the level of corruption and the rampant ecologism, akin to a new religion, have all perverted the EU management up to its highest levels.How do provinces or nations arrive at such poor decisions? How can politicians be fooled into these unrealistic avenues? Could it have something to do with the IPCC reports? Here is an enlightening statement from AR5 WGIII Summary for Policy Makers 4.2.2.:“Decarbonizing (i.e. reducing the carbon intensity of) electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies in achieving low-stabilization levels (430–530 ppm CO2eq); in most integrated modelling scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry, buildings, and transport sectors (medium evidence, high agreement)”.  In this passage, the reader is told that decarbonizing (getting rid of coal and natural gas) will be cost-effective, a blatant lie in view of the above. Though the rest of the paragraph suggests strongly that wind and solar would be suitable replacement strategies, it ends up by reminding the Policy Makers that these intermittent technologies still need direct and/or indirect support, in other words, taxpayers money. Obviously, some important organisations are eager to collect their dividends on the massive, tough foolish, investments made in intermittent energies.In Canada, this notion caught the attention of some 70 scholars, who issued a report called “Acting on Climate Change” under the umbrella of the prestigious McGill/Trottier banner. They proposed to implement a national wind-hydro system only by 2035 for Canada, resting upon the IPCC report that says:“The simulations, based on the greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios of the IPCC, show that immediate global actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would successfully limit temperature increases in Canada. Because renewable energy resources are plentiful, we believe that Canada could reach 100% reliance on low carbon electricity by 2035.” This is an astonishing assumption. Even if such utopia were technically feasible, it would be impossible to acquire land rights and source materials for such a project within a 20 years time frame. Is this something you learned about while in Quebec? If so, be prepared to be sorely disappointed. Indeed, when this report was examined and evaluated by engineers working in the power generation business, the outcome proved to be shockingly negative. Not only is such a proposal deemed to be technically unrealistic, it would also cost hundreds of billions of dollars and would put Canada at risk of national blackouts –for no benefit at all.Whilst IPCC does NOT make any recommendation on any topic, it issues reports written in such a shrewd way that other people will read them as recommendations and assume that they are based upon research performed at the highest possible level, the only one obviously suited to the World’s “leading authority on climate science.” The disillusion is truly painful.With the advent of the COP21 in Paris, the position adopted by the EU probably places a heavy burden on your shoulders that does not allow you to adopt an honest opinion. However, it is incumbent upon you to make it clear to the general public that renewable intermittent energy is neither a magical nor a practical solution. As demonstrated by Google engineers, the physics are simply against wind and solar and various permutations of these. Intermittent energy cannot provide the power needed in our modern society and does not address climate change, its original objective.In view of your position of power as the EU Commission’s energy union chief and your obligatory commitment towards the welfare of the European citizens (after all, we elected you somehow), you should be the first one to defend our interests, to stand up against intermittent energies, to ask for a ban on wind power and to launch a review on why the IPCC has been claiming that getting rid of fossil fuelled power generation in favour of intermittent energies is in anyway a “cost-effective” or workable energy strategy for our modern, industrialized societies.Convinced that, once again, you will not read this letter and that one of your underlings will send me another non-response, I shall not wait for it and will make this letter directly public.With best regards,Yours sincerely,Pr.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/11/05/a-matter-of-public-interest-on-the-ipcc-does-it-recommend-or-not-recommend-that-is-the-question/,,A Matter of Public Interest on the IPCC – Does it Recommend or Not Recommend? That is the Question," On October 27, 2015, we issued a press release “Say NO to Climate Change CO2 Coercion at COP-21 Says Friends of Science Society in New Billboard Campaign”     to publicize our new billboard campaign and to point out that many negative consequences have been the outcome of adopting stringent climate change targets.  In that press release (now revised) we had referred to IPCC ‘recommendations.’  As you can see by the responses below, the IPCC claims that it does not make any recommendations.Unfortunately, it seems that many people understand IPCC reports as making recommendations and policies are being set on this understanding.  In particular, the Canadian economy has been severely damaged, and will be destroyed if Canada attempts to meet the climate targets presently being discussed.  This would be particularly dangerous if a legally binding provision or criminal tribunal penalties were to be included in the COP-21 agreements.After 20+ years of meetings, targets and threats of penalties, industrial carbon dioxide concentrations have increased significantly, several western economies have been severely damaged, millions of vulnerable people have been pushed into ‘heat or eat poverty’ by ‘decarbonizing’ schemes, the EU migrant crisis has been exacerbated by biofuels, as has global pollution – but the environment has not been helped; climate change has not been addressed. Real pollution has been reduced in some Western industrial nations – Canada is a leader in this regard as stated in our report – “Clear the Air in Paris.” [ English] [French] but we get no recognition for these efforts.Where did all these bad policies originate?  No one recommended them it seems.————————————From: Jonathan Lynn [mailto: jlynn@wmo.int]Sent: October-28-15 5:50 AMTo: contact@friendsofscience.orgCc: IPCC Media <IPCC-Media@wmo.int>Subject:  error in Friends of Science press releaseDear Friends of Science SocietyI’m writing about the Friends of Science Society press release issued today through PR Web which contains a serious error about the IPCC.Your press release refers to “IPCC recommendations” and “recommendations of the IPCC”.I’d like to point out that the IPCC does not make recommendations on any topic and you will not find any recommendations in any of our reports.Article 2 of the “Principles Governing IPCC Work” states “IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy, although they may need to deal o bjectively with scientific, technical and socio-economic factors relevant to the application of particular policies.”( http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles.pdf)We often express this (as we do for instance in our communications strategy) by saying that the IPCC’s work is policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive.( http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session35/IAC_CommunicationStrategy.pdf )I’d be very grateful if you could correct your press release and if necessary the posters on your billboards so that they do not state or imply that the IPCC makes recommendations.Thank you for your helpJonathan Lynn—Jonathan LynnHead, Communications and Media Relationsjlynn@wmo.intwww.ipcc.ch Facebook :  https://www.facebook.com/IPCCNews Twitter : @IPCC_CH———————————————-We revised our press release, however we wanted to ask more questions of Mr. Lynn about the IPCC and its role. We sent this letter by email.———————————————Dear Mr. Lynn,RE: Your email of Oct 28, 2015 concerning our Press Release of Oct. 27, 2015 http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13044767.htmThank you for contacting us.We have slightly amended the press release to reflect some of your request, but we disagree with the claim that “the IPCC does not make recommendations,” even if you have an Article 2 that says you do not.The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines “recommendation” as:“the act of saying that someone or something is good and deserves to be chosena suggestion about what should be done”From the Oxford dictionary:rec·om·men·da·tion/ˌrekəmənˈdāSH(ə)n/nouna suggestion or proposal as to the best course of action, especially one put forward by an authoritative body.What we think you are trying to say is that the IPCC does not make specific recommendations per country, such as saying “China should….” Or “Canada must…” or “The best route for Poland’s emissions reduction would be…”But clearly, in compiling three reports of several thousand pages combined, the last report being devoted to mitigation options, these all constitute ‘suggestions about what should be done’…recommendations, by an authoritative body. Since your organization/IPCC are producing these reports, various governments are taking ‘climate action’ accordingly, and the IPCC/UNFCCC/UN and ENGOs excoriate those who don’t fall in line with the….recommendations…these can only be seen to be recommendations.Now, before Paris, various UNFCCC and IPCC-associated parties are saying that countries are not ‘doing enough’ – enough what? Enough of the recommended mitigation measures. Where do those mitigation measures come from? The IPCC reports.The essence of recommendation – a suggestion about what should be done –is self-evident in the following example passage from the April 2014 Working Group III – Mitigation – report found in the Summary for Policy Makers (SPM).SPM.4.2.2. “Decarbonization…” Decarbonizing (i.e. reducing the carbon intensity of) electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies in achieving low-stabilization levels …” http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdfWhy would any party to the Conference of the Parties, or signatory to Kyoto, or member of the UNFCCC, government or ENGO address the issue of decarbonizing their society, unless it had been brought to their attention that this was “a suggestion about what should be done?”This SPM.4.2.2. paragraph clearly supports the phase-out of fossil fuelled electricity generation while falsely and not objectively (contrary to Article 2) stating that such a move is a “cost-effective mitigation strategy.”We ask you to please send us evidence that this is a “cost-effective mitigation strategy.”The paragraph continues, apparently “making a suggestion about what should be done” by saying that the use of Renewable Energy technologies are mature enough to be deployed “at significant scale…” but that they “still need direct and/or indirect support.”Presently, in our own province, there are people advocating for an early phase-out of coal-fired power plants. There is already a federal phase-out in progress, however the advocates appear to be following the IPCC (non) recommendations by citing the IPCC as an authority on climate science, and parroting statements about decarbonizing society targeting electricity generation first by an early closure of coal-fired power plants, claiming renewable energy can fill the gap and suggesting (and some stating as if fact) that it will also be more cost-effective because “wind is free.”According to power generation experts, Renewables like wind and solar are the most expensive forms of power generation and the least reliable, at least in our northern climate.We find ample evidence that most of the world sees the IPCC as making recommendations.The Guardian of Nov. 7, 2014 says: “IPCC recommendation to phase out fossil fuels by end of century to avoid dangerous global warming is categorically rejected by Poland and other eastern European countries.” http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/07/poland-rejects-ipcc-target-of-zero-emissions-by-2100Past chair of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri in the linked article here is busy telling people to walk more, eat less meat, and turn down their thermostat. These sound like recommendations by an IPCC senior official. http://www.progressive.org/intv0509.htmlIn this report of the Washington Post, it seems clear that the IPCC is making recommendations and pretty specific ones – phase-out coal and go to solar and wind power:“At a meeting in Berlin, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Sunday released a report that found that nations still have a chance to fulfill the goal but must aggressively turn away from relying largely on fossil fuels such as coal for energy and replace them with cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind power. To reach their target of 3.6 degrees(2 degrees Celsius) over preindustrial levels, nations must work together to lower emissions “by 40 to 70 percent” of what they were in 2010, the report said. “And further, that leading officials with the IPCC are recommending actions:“There is a clear message from science: To avoid dangerous interference with the climate system, we need to move away from business as usual,” said Ottmar Edenhofer of Germany, co-chairman of the group that produced the 2,000-page report.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/world-must-turn-from-fossil-fuels-to-cleaner-energy-to-avoid-climate-disaster-panel-says/2014/04/13/21bd2144-c273-11e3-b574-f8748871856a_story.htmlAs reported in The Register of Nov. 21, 2014, after years of effort Google engineers have concluded that renewable energy ‘simply won’t work’ – will not be able to supply appropriate power, will be phenomenally expensive, wasteful of precious resources and will not address climate change. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/21/renewable_energy_simply_wont_work_google_renewables_engineers/So, it seems that for the past almost 20 years, the IPCC has been (not) recommending a mitigation strategy that does nothing for the environment, nothing for the power grid except to complicate it and destabilize it, is wasteful of resources and is phenomenally expensive, destroys economies and pushes the most vulnerable into heat or eat poverty – at the same time not addressing climate change.While the Google engineers’ statement came out some months after the release of the AR5 WGIII IPCC report, it seems clear that an authoritative body like the IPCC, which had issued compelling mitigation strategies such as the one quoted above SPM.4.2.2. “Decarbonization” would promptly alert the member countries, their energy consultants and the taxpaying public that the mitigation option of “Decarbonization” found in SPM.4.2.2. is useless.The lack of an emphatic public declaration and correction to this section of the AR5 Working Group III SPM.4.2.2. would seem to violate a number of principles of Resolution 60/1 of the World Summit 2005, such as but not limited to:We reaffirm that development is a central goal in itself and that sustainabledevelopment in its economic, social and environmental aspects constitutes a key element of the overarching framework of United Nations activities.We acknowledge that good governance and the rule of law at the national and international levels are essential for sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger.…We pledge to enhance the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, accountability and credibility of the United Nations system. This is our shared responsibility and interest.http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/60/1Obviously, affordable, reliable energy is the power driving industry and economic development – therefore the IPCC’s proposing of an ineffective and exceptionally expensive mitigation that does not even address climate change breaches Article 10 noted above – particularly when it is also known that renewable energy device production has led to the complete devastation of the region of Baotou, China and serious harm to its residents, (an area where the rare earth minerals are mined for wind turbine magnets) meaning wind power is not a sustainable development, a fact that Google engineers also pointed out. Furthermore, in Spain, it is estimated that some 6 to 18 million birds and bats are killed annually by wind farms there, as reported in Nature, June 20, 2012 http://www.nature.com/news/the-trouble-with-turbines-an-ill-wind-1.10849 .Likewise, destroying the grid stability, affordable price and reliability of power through proposing faulty mitigation options like renewables defeats the goals noted in Article 11 and has the unintended consequence of increasing, rather than eradicating, poverty and hunger, as widely reported in the press in the UK and EU, and as we pointed out in our press release. Someone must bear the responsibility for these consequences. Who is the authority behind these policies? The IPCC.Finally, the absence of a clear public statement from the IPCC about the now known ineffectiveness of renewable energy breaches Article 15, demonstrating a significant lack of “accountability, effectiveness and relevance” by your organization(s).In fact, such repercussions have been known since 2006, shortly after the UK/EU implemented their climate targets. http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20081009/world/to-heat-or-to-eat-britain-in-court-on-fuel-poverty.228102   Things have gotten worse since – yet the IPCC blithely issued a 2014 report recommending Renewable Energy, without noting these devastating human consequences.Is this the IPCC’s disclaimer: (found in SPM.4.2.2)“Climate policy intersects with other societal goals creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate action.”We are concerned because your documents have created a hostile investment atmosphere that is infringing on the economy of our province of Alberta and that of our country, Canada, yet you apparently take no responsibility in this regard, because you claim the IPCC has not made any ‘recommendations.’ We have shown this claim to be a case of absurd sophistry.In addition to low oil prices, which have cyclically affected our provincial and national economies over the years, we are now also faced with a flight of investor capital, again driven by the (non) recommendations of your IPCC reports. Sections like SPM.5.1 for instance:“Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns.”And persistent references to the phasing out of fossil fuel use, or misleading statements like:“Regarding electricity generation alone, RE accounted for just over half of the new electricity-generating capacity added globally in 2012, led by growth in wind, hydro and solar power.”…which is found in the previously mentioned section on “Decarbonizing…” and which fails to mention that despite this apparently significant sectoral growth in RE, the world still relies on 3 cubic miles of oil-equivalent energy per year, of which two cubic miles are coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydro, while only 0.01 cubic mile is provided by wind and solar renewables. We still rely on one cubic mile of oil per year. No amount of ‘decarbonizing’ will change that in short order.[1]How is it responsible for your organization to tout the phasing out of fossil fuels and diversion of investment from them, for a replacement strategy of wind and solar, recommendations which you clearly do make, when this is an impossible option? Oil, natural gas and coal will be the driving forces of industrial economies for the foreseeable future, a fact that seems to be well-understood by China, India and many other Asian nations who don’t really want a solar panel that works sometimes – they want real power generation and a real economy.To suggest otherwise is to deceive unwitting policy-makers who likely have little or no idea of the power grid and transportation needs of the world. This is in breach of Article 15 … “relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, accountability and credibility.”Further, in regard to the issue of credibility, there is a substantial divergence between observed temperatures and IPCC modelled predictions. There has been a substantial rise in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere but no global warming of any significance for over 18 years.It seems that global warming ended ~18 years and 8 months ago and therefore global warming does not have to be mitigated so why does your organization continue to (not) recommend mitigation?The IPCC Working Group I Physical Scientists state in the Technical Summary on “Uncertainties” (pg. 114 and 115) that they do not have enough data to make any long-term predictions and essentially there is no imminent climate catastrophe forecast. But this is not what we repeatedly hear in the media. Are you personally contacting these misleading media reporters, as you contacted us, to correct their misinformation?Mr. Lynn, in our view, your organization is accountable for these misrepresentations and misdirection which have devastated national economies, and which have had other brutally negative consequences as outlined in our press release of Oct. 27, 2015.In Alberta, we see your organization as directly responsible for this misinformation, and also responsible for a failure to publicly clarify the ineffectiveness of renewables, as reported by Google engineers. It seems to be fraudulent misrepresentation to continue to advocate for a switch to renewables of wind and solar – as your associated agencies and the numerous ENGOs continue to do – when these do not address any of the fundamental issues the IPCC is said to be attempting to solve.In Alberta, your recommendations are damaging investor confidence in our national oil, gas and oil sands industries. Your recommendations are damaging investor confidence in coal-fired power generation, which underlies the cost-effective operation of our industrial base. Your recommendations are about to burden taxpayers with a completely unnecessary early phase-out of coal-fired power plants.The (non) recommendations of the IPCC are driving these moves – the costs of an early phase-out of coal-fired power plants are estimated at this time to be $11.1 billion for compensation for lost investment value and employee packages, plus $11.2 billion to transition to natural gas; this for a small population of only 4 million people. Natural gas input costs are presently double that of coal. If wind and solar are added to the grid, millions more of hidden costs for transmission lines and interties will come from taxpayers’ pockets.The province of Alberta is now facing a deficit budget of some $47 billion dollars, in part due to market collapse on the alleged ‘carbon risk’ of oil and coal…. stemming from IPCC “recommendations” such as SPM.5.1. Yet as indicated above, there is no viable alternative for these energy sources.To try and generate some money, the Province of Alberta has been talking about another one of the IPCC’s (non) recommendations – a carbon tax or cap and trade. This will further burden taxpayers as it has done in the UK and EU.As has been the outcome in the UK and EU, heat-or-eat poverty will set in, this in a region where temperatures in winter often drop to minus 40 ˚C/F.This socio-economic destruction is being wrought because of your organisation and the mitigation options and recommendations in your report, Mr. Lynn.Further, under the Rome Statute[2] Article 7 Crimes Against Humanity 1. (a)(b)(d)(e) and 2. (b)(c)(d) it seems clear that IPCC mitigation options have led to:“Extermination” includes the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population;”  Through the IPCC endorsement of biofuels as a means of reducing carbon dioxide, without any regard for the human consequences, which Jean Zieglar, Special Rapporteur to the UN on the matter of the human right of food, pointed out almost a decade ago, as noted in our press release.The deprivation of access to food by the diversion of edible food products to biofuel production, as discussed at length in this NECSI report http://necsi.edu/publications/food/ and it has had the visible consequence of the current EU migrant crisis, where millions of desperate people have ‘nothing to lose’ and thus make their way north from the MENA region, resulting in the cascading crimes against humanity – once restricted to subsistence level nations, now flooding across Europe and creating inequities, social and sexual crimes, human trafficking and resulting in tremendous further food and fuel poverty for migrants and EU citizens alike.Obviously, the IPCC has a clear role and responsibility in these outcomes because the IPCC publishes Summaries for Policy Makers that are be used by government officials around the world for the purpose of determining, from what the IPCC says “that someone or something is good and deserves to be chosen” and that records numerous “suggestions about what should be done” and “a suggestion or proposal as to the best course of action, especially one put forward by an authoritative body.”In other words, recommendations.As we have shown, your reports are not objective, they are directive and unmistakably do make recommendations, some of which are badly thought out and supported by inaccurate, rosy claims of “cost-effectiveness,” while selectively omitting crucial, relevant context, especially on energy issues.You began by telling us the following.Article 2 of the “Principles Governing IPCC Work” states “IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy, although they may need to deal objectively with scientific, technical and socio-economic factors relevant to the application of particular policies.”(http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles.pdf)We often express this (as we do for instance in our communications strategy) by saying that the IPCC’s work is policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive.(http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session35/IAC_CommunicationStrategy.pdf)We conclude by saying these foregoing statements are, in our opinion, false and disingenuous and that your organization and its Summary for Policy Makers documents are wreaking socio-economic havoc around the world.The IPCC is a force for chaos and should be disbanded. In our opinion, those responsible for these Summary for Policy Maker documents have knowingly misled and misinformed policy makers for decades, ultimately leading to the numerous breaches of the Code of Rome and Crimes Against Humanity that we have discussed herein.Who should be held responsible?Sincerely,FRIENDS OF SCIENCE SOCIETY[1] http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/09/energy-policy-coal-technology-oil.html[2] Done at Rome on 17 July 1998, in force on 1 July 2002, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2187, No. 38544, Depositary: Secretary-General of the United Nations, http://treaties.un.org—————————————–Following our letter, we received this response:—————————————-—–Original Message—–From: Jonathan Lynn <jlynn@wmo.int>To: Friends of Science <contact@friendsofscience.org>Date: Tue, 3 Nov 2015 11:25:33 +0100Subject: Re: error in Friends of Science press releaseDear Friends of Science,thank you for your mail and for correcting your press release. I think “statements” is a good neutral formulation.It’s difficult for me to comment on how media or other organizations refer to the contents of IPCC reports, but I do assure you that we make great efforts not to tell policymakers in general or individually what to do. Our mandate is to provide assessments of scientific knowledge, not policy recommendations. Our reports should however be relevant to policy-making, so we may provide options for policymakers to reach a goal that they have defined. But it is up to them to decide which option to follow or whether to follow any at all. An example of this would be the 2ºC limit that governments have said they want to remain within. The IPCC did not set that limit, but governments arrived at it on the basis of IPCC and other materials. In the Fifth Assessment Report, we then looked at the implications of a temperature rise of 2º, and of bigger increases, and what would be required to keep the rise in temperatures to 2º or other limits. That hopefully provides policymakers with the information they need to take policy decisions.IPCC reports do not involve original research, but are assessments of thousands of scientific publications. As you many know IPCC reports go through a rigorous process of repeated drafting and review, at the end of which the Summary for Policymakers is formally approved by our members, in dialogue with the scientists who are authors of the report. Approval of the Summary for Policymakers also denotes acceptance of the full report, although that is not formally approved by the members. This process, which is laid down in our procedures, makes it impossible to comment on individual reports or publications that come out after the finalization of the IPCC report (strictly speaking, after the cut-off date for inclusion of scientific literature in that particular assessment). We are not set up to comment on individual studies, but rather to look at the full spectrum of scientifically relevant material in a given period. That is why we have not commented, for example, on the conclusions of Google engineers about renewables that you mention. But if those conclusions are published in the scientific literature, they could be examined in a future IPCC assessment, which will surely continue to look at renewables in assessing solutions to the dangers of climate change. That process of review by both the scientific community (in it’s very broadest sense: expert reviewers register through a self-declaration of expertise) and governments, and endorsement by governments in dialogue with the scientific community underpins the IPCC’s accountability.best wishesJonathan Lynn———We welcome reader comments on this matter to our facebook page, twitter@FriendsOScienceor by email to: media@friendsofscience.orgShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/11/05
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/10/31/cop21-ou-lhypocrisie-de-lindustrie/,,COP21 ou l’hypocrisie de l’industrie," István E. Markó*Si vous pensez que la conférence sur le climat qui se tiendra à Paris en décembre 2015 (COP21) a quelque chose à voir avec le climat ou la protection de la nature, révisez votre copie. Vous avez tout faux. Les premiers qui s’en rendront compte, après avoir vainement fouillé dans les derniers recoins de ces futurs accords, minimalistes et non-contraignants mais présentés par les politiques comme une grandiose réussite pour l’environnement et le climat, seront les écolos et certaines ONG environnementales. L’Union européenne, elle, le sait déjà. Car ne nous leurrons pas. Malgré l’échec certain et déjà annoncé de cette 21ème grande messe climatique, elle sera « vendue » au grand public comme une victoire des politiques qui semblent ne pas avoir d’autres urgences que de se préoccuper du climat qu’il fera éventuellement en l’an 2100. En ce moment, les représentants des différents pays de l’UE ont perdu l’espoir d’adopter des accords contraignants sur les émissions de CO2 et doivent trouver un moyen honorable de sortir du pétrin dans lequel ils se sont fourrés. Car tout ce barnum n’est qu’une question de gros sous, de transferts de capitaux et de subsides, de pouvoir politique national et global. Plus précisément, il s’agit de transferts de sommes colossales vers des pays émergeants avec, au passage, un petit écrémage et un retour certain – sous la forme de dividendes – vers les pays financeurs. Rien de généreux, ni de désintéressé là-dedans, mais bien du business pur et dur. Illustrons ce propos avec l’exemple de Mme Merkel.L’Allemagne a promis d’offrir à l’Inde plus de 2 milliards d’euros afin de soutenir des projets dirigés vers l’utilisation de l’énergie solaire et la mise en place de réseaux électriques intelligents pour accélérer la transition de ce pays vers un développement durable. Cette annonce, faite durant la récente visite d’Angela Merkel à Delhi, a conduit le premier ministre Modi à promettre que l’Inde, l’une des puissances dissidentes dans la lutte contre le CO2, s’engagerait à renouveler ses efforts en la matière. Un semblant de victoire politique pour la chancelière allemande qui tente ainsi d’amadouer Modi et de l’amener à être du côté de Hollande lors de la COP21. Sauf que le premier ministre indien n’a nullement l’intention de ralentir la progression économique de son pays et que les chiffres qu’il a soumis à la COP21 invalident sa promesse faite à Mme Merkel. L’Inde fera ce qui est rationnel et va donc améliorer le rendement énergétique de ses centrales au charbon en utilisant de nouvelles technologies. Elle va donc diminuer la vitesse de croissance de ses émissions, mais celles-ci continueront cependant à croître. Les vrais vainqueurs de ce pathétique accord : les cabinets indiens qui feront les études de marché (en empochant les inévitables commissions) et les industriels allemands qui fourniront produits et matériaux pour le tout renouvelable photovoltaïque. Qui payera ces 2 milliards s’euros qui enrichiront en partie l’industrie allemande aussi complice que l’indienne? Les contribuables allemands. Sous forme de taxes, bien entendu.La duplicité des électriciens allemands est un modèle du genre. En effet, non-seulement bénéficient-ils de subsides étatiques promis par les politiques pour poursuivre la catastrophique transition énergétique allemande (EnergieWende), mais en plus, ils se permettent d’augmenter la facture d’énergie du citoyen qui se retrouve ainsi deux fois payeur. Les CEO allemands n’hésitent pas à mettre en péril leurs propres entreprises (elles perdent déjà beaucoup en bourse) parce qu’ils savent bien qu’ils bénéficieront de juteuses aides financières étatiques. C’est ce qui explique que l’entreprise EON ait été divisée en deux entités légalement indépendantes. Cette attitude irrite les entreprises énergétiques de petits Etats qui ne peuvent suivre cette politique de la course aux subventions sans risquer la faillite pure et simple. Ce qui explique les dissensions au sein du Conseil énergie de l’UE entre l’Allemagne et les « pays de l’Est » qui ne veulent pas de nouvelles contraintes sur les énergies renouvelables.Derrière tout ce cirque climatique se cachent de grandes banques, qui ont investi dans le renouvelable des sommes faramineuses et qui voudraient récolter les plantureux dividendes qui leur avaient été annoncés. Les crédits « carbone » ne sont qu’une de leurs nouvelles additions boursières. Ajoutons à cela de nombreuses industries multinationales qui officient dans des domaines aussi variés que la chimie, l’électricité et le pétrole (vous avez bien lu). Ces industriels ont aussi tablé sur le « tout renouvelable », la « chimie verte », les « énergies non polluantes », les biocarburants, la « décarbonisation », tout ce qui leur permettrait de bénéficier des largesses des Etats pour profiter des généreux subsides offerts de manière irréfléchie par nos dirigeants politiques. Les dindons de la farce ? Nous, les citoyens !Nombreux sont les industriels européens (surtout) qui plaident en faveur du renouvelable et ne cessent de demander des accords de plus en plus contraignants en la matière. Pour le bien de la planète ? Certainement pas. Ces décisions devraient leur garantir des retombées financières colossales, éviter que les investissements qu’ils ont faits en matière de renouvelable ne les entraînent dans une spirale financière négative et empêcher la concurrence des pays émergeants. Ils veulent éviter un « subprime » de l’énergie pourtant inéluctable. Prenons l’exemple de Total, qui a abandonné toutes ses activités solaires et fermé son usine belge http://www.journaldelenvironnement.net/article/total-et-gdf-suez-vont-fermer-leur-usine-solaire,29543) mais qui maintient son volet photovoltaïque en France (http://www.total.fr/ma-maison/solaire/panneaux-photovoltaiques.html). Pourquoi avoir gardé cette activité en France. Mr Hollande et ses promesses de déductions fiscales à l’entreprise belgo-française y seraient-ils pour quelque chose ?En son temps, BP (British Petroleum) s’est engouffré, comme certains agriculteurs, dans la course aux biocarburants aux subsides pour produire des biocarburants et avait même changé son nom pour Beyond Petroleum (comme c’est beau !). BP, qui avait massivement investi dans le « vert » a tout abandonné. Hélas, pas la Belgique, ni la France, ni l’Allemagne qui continuent à subventionner cette production utopique dont le rentabilité est facilement mesurée par le coût de la tonne de CO2 évitée: alors que sur le marché du carbone (ETS) la tonne se vend entre 6 et 8 €, celle des biocarburants revient à 300€. Et ces biocarburants ne sont en rien “écolo”. Le bioéthanol est produit comme la bière, par fermentation de céréales, et tout le monde sait que la fermentation produit beaucoup de CO2. Tout le monde ? Non, pas les politiques. Quant au biodiesel, il n’est qu’en partie “bio” car pour le produire il faut faire réagir de l’huile végétale avec du méthanol qui provient du méthane. Le biodiesel est donc généré à partir d’énergies fossiles. Tous les chimistes le savent. Pas les politiques.Quand aux ONG environnementales, qui fleurissent comme perce-neiges au printemps et qui ont un besoin vital de ressources financières, elles relayent les paroles sacrées de la messe climatique, effrayent le citoyen innocent et se remplissent les poches au passage. N’hésitant nullement à mentir ou à amender les faits, elles nous prédisent, avec l’aide de climatologues dédiés à LA cause, une future apocalypse des plus excitantes. Tout cela grâce à des subventions publiques aussi peu transparentes qu’abondantes. Les contribuables paient ces ONG, dont le crédo est taxer, interdire et subventionner, pour qu’elles nous dictent notre façon de vivre. Une aberration de plus dans notre société.Pour conclure, rappelons que la diabolisation du CO2 a débuté avec Mme Thatcher (qui voulait se débarrasser du National Coal Board, une entreprise étatique sensée gérer l’industrie charbonnière, qui était un véritable gouffre à subsides), que le plafond des 2°C au-delà duquel notre planète subirait des dommages irréversibles résulte de la pression exercée par Mme Merkel sur un groupe de climatologues allemands et qu’enfin le nouveau président du GIEC (groupe intergouvernemental pour l’étude du climat, une émanation de l’ONU), Mr Hoesung Lee, est aussi un membre du très discret GGGI (Global Green Growth Institute), une autre émanation de l’ONU sur laquelle il conviendrait de garder un œil particulièrement attentif.Le changement climatique ? Une magnifique opportunité pour gagner de l’argent public sur le dos d’une population fatiguée qui, cependant, commence petit à petit à sortir de sa torpeur et à se libérer de l’endoctrinement massif qu’elle a subi pendant des dizaines d’années. Lorsque le masque tombera finalement, gageons que le visage qu’il cachait sera particulièrement hideux. Il restera à payer la facture.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/10/31/cop21-hypocrite-industries/,Jim Simpson ,COP21 : hypocrite industries," István E. Markó*If you think that the climate conference, to be held in Paris in December 2015 (COP21), has anything to do with climate or nature protection, revise your copy. You have it all wrong. Those who will be the first one to realize it, after unsuccessfully searching in the recesses of these future minimalists and non-binding agreements, that will nevertheless be presented as a great success for the environment and the climate, will be the ecologists and some environmental NGOs. The European Union already knows that these talks will be a failure. And make no mistake. Despite the already announced fiasco of this 21st big Climate Mass, it will be exposed to the general public as a real victory of the politicians who appear to have no other more urgent matters to tackle than worry about the possible climate there will eventually be in 2100. At this moment, representatives of different EU countries have lost faith in adopting more binding agreements on CO2 emission levels and they are attempting to find a honourable way out of the mess in which they dug themselves. Indeed, this whole climate circus has all to do with money and only money, with investments and subsidies, with national and global political power. More precisely, it concerns huge amounts of money transfers to emerging countries with, en passant, a small skimming by some and interesting returns on investment – plus benefits, of course – to the participating countries. There is no generosity or willingness to help in this money transfer, only cold harsh business. Let’s illustrate the point with the example of Mrs Merkel.‪Germany promised India more than 2 billion euros to support projects directed to the use of solar energy and for the development of high-efficiency intelligent power networks to accelerate the transition of India towards sustainable development. This announcement, made during a recent visit of Angela Merkel in Delhi, led Prime Minister Modi to promise her that India, one of the dissident nations in the fight against CO2, would renew its efforts in this endeavour. Such an announcement appeared as a political victory for the German Chancellor who was trying to coax Modi and convince him to join the side of President Hollande during the COP21 climate meeting. However, and unfortunately for her, the Indian Prime Minister has no intention of slowing down the economic growth of his country and the figures he submitted to the COP21 invalidate his promise to Mrs. Merkel. India will hence act in a rational manner and thus improve the efficiency of his coal-powered power plants by implementing new technologies. Therefore, the CO2 emissions will continue to grow even though the rate of production of this greenhouse gas will gradually slow down. Who are the real winners of this pathetic German-Indian financial agreement: Indian firms that will perform market research (pocketing the usual backhander) and the German industry that will provide products and materials for all the photovoltaic equipment. Who will pay these two billion euros that will partly enrich the German industry almost as corrupted as the Indian one? German citizens. Via their taxes, of course.The duplicity of the German electricity industry is truly a model of its own. Indeed, not only do they benefit from state subsidies, promised by the politicians to pursue the catastrophic German Energy Transition (EnergieWende), but they also have no qualms in increasing the energy bill of the German citizen who are thus paying twice for the same service. The German executives do not hesitate to risk the future of their companies and to put them in danger of bankruptcy – they are already losing a lot of money through the stock options – because they know very well that they will receive juicy state subsidies. This is the reason underlying the division of EON into two legally independent entities. This attitude irritates the energy enterprises in small countries that cannot play this rotten political race towards subsidies without immediate bankruptcy, resulting in conflicts at the EU Energy Council between Germany and the “East Countries” who are against more stringent regulations favouring renewable energies.Hidden behind this climate circus, one can find large banks that have invested huge amounts of money in the renewable dream and who want to reap the juicy dividends that were promised to them. The carbon credits are only one of their new stock additions. Add to these players numerous multinational industries, involved in fields as diverse as chemistry, electricity and oil (yes, you read it right) and you start to get the picture. These companies have also relied heavily on the “all renewable”, the “green chemistry”, the “clean energy”, the “biofuels”, the total “decarbonisation”, anything that would allow them to benefit from the generosity of the states and take advantage of the scandalous subsidies offered recklessly by our political leaders. Who are the losers in this dirty game? We, the citizens!‪Many European companies argue in favour of renewables and keep requesting more and more binding agreements on the matter. To save the planet ? Of course, not. These agreements should guarantee them huge financial benefits. They should also protect them against the consequences of the bad investments they have made in the renewable area that were poised to lead them in a negative financial spiral. Finally, stringent regulations favouring renewables should undermine the competition with the emerging countries. They are trying to avoid an inevitable “energy subprime”. Let’s take the example of Total, who has dropped all its solar activities and even closed its Belgian plant (http://www.journaldelenvironnement.net/article/total-et-gdf-suez-vont-fermer-leur-usine-solaire,29543) but who, surprisingly, still maintains its photovoltaic company in France (http://www.total.fr/ma-maison/solaire/panneaux-photovoltaiques.html). Why did they keep this business in France? Would Mr Hollande and his promises of financial deductions have anything to do with it ? I wonder.‪BP (British Petroleum), like the farmers in the “corn states” who received huge subsidies based upon the US EPA biofuel policy, jumped into the race for biofuels subsidies to produce biofuels, even though this led to global chaos due to food price rise. They even went to the extent of changing their name for Beyond‪ Petroleum (so sweet!). Despite their heavy investment in the “green dream”, BP has now abandoned this area completely. Unfortunately, Belgium, France and Germany still continue to provide subsidies for the production of biofuels even though it is easy to realize that it is a nonsense just by looking at the cost of a ton of CO2 : in the carbon credit trade market, a ton of CO2 sells between 6 to 8€ whilst that of a biofuel sells at 300€. Moreover, these biofuels are everything except “ecologic”. Indeed, bioethanol is produced by fermentation of cereals and everybody knows that fermentation generates huge amounts of CO2. Well, not everybody. Politicians don’t know about it. As for biofuel, they are only partially “bio” as they need methanol, prepared from methane, to react with vegetable oil to produce the said biofuel. Biofuels are thus generated from fossil fuels. Every chemist knows that. Politicians, again, don’t have a clue.As for environmental NGOs, that bloom as snowdrops in spring and have a chronic need for financial resources, they relay the sacred words of the climate Mass, frightening innocent citizens and filling their pockets in the process. They do not hesitate to lie or amend the facts. With the help of climatologists dedicated to “THE cause”, they predict an apocalyptic future unless we abide by the rules of the new climate religion.‪Finally, let’s remember that the demonization of CO2 began with Mrs Thatche‪r ‪(who wanted to get rid of the National Coal Board, a state entreprise in charge of the coal mining industry and who was a real financial black-hole, sucking in huge amounts of state subsidies), that the +2°C ceiling, beyond which our planet would suffer irreversible damage, results from the pressure exerted by Angela Merkel on a group of German climatologists and that finally, the new chairman of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, a UN body), Mr Lee Hoesung, is also a member of the very discreet GGGI (Global Green Growth Institute, possessing diplomatic and legal immunity.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/10/31/targets-made-to-be-missed-the-greenhouse-gas-charade/,,TARGETS MADE TO BE MISSED – THE GREENHOUSE GAS CHARADE," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ 2015Since 1988, when concerns were first raised at international levels about the possibility that increasing human-related emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) might be having an adverse impact on global temperatures, various countries have adopted targets to reduce emissions. In 1992, there was an international agreement among developed countries on a voluntary target of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2005. It failed. Having not met a relatively modest target, countries agreed upon a more stringent one. In 1997 about 150 countries committed under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions by an average of 5% below 1990 levels by the 2008 to 2012 period. Most countries did not even come close to meeting it. At the Copenhagen conference of December 2009, the developed countries like Canada agreed to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. At the forthcoming conference in Paris in December 2015, Canada will be asked to commit to even tougher targets for 2030 and 2050.The new-elected Liberal Government has already declared that Canada will take an aggressive approach to greenhouse gas emissions reduction. It is time to have a look at how well we are doing in meeting the Copenhagen target.Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 were 737 megatonnes (Mt), so reducing them by 17% would mean eliminating 125 Mt to go down to 612 Mt. Every year Environment Canada publishes a report entitled Canada’s Emissions Inventory, which shows the trends in GHG emissions in each sector of the economy. The most recent Environment Canada report shows that emissions in 2013 totaled 726 Mt, down 11 Mt since 2005 after the most serious recession since the Great Depression. Even if we stayed in recession for the indefinite future, we still would not be on a track that would take us to the Copenhagen target.In fact, the prospects for attaining that dubious goal are even worse. In December 2014, Environment Canada published a report on the current trends in GHG emissions to 2020. The report showed that, instead of moving closer to the Copenhagen target, we are moving further away. The projected emissions by 2020 are now 746 Mt! Unless new and severe measures are taken, we will miss the target by 134 Mt. Other projections, by organizations like the National Energy Board, suggest that energy consumption, and the related emissions, will be considerably higher than those forecast by Environment Canada.What this means is that the Canadian economy is growing again and that factors like lower oil prices are likely to further increase economic activity, investment and employment, as well as emissions. However, the new Government, supported by the media and the environmental community, will engage in a great deal of hand-wringing and talk about what will have to be done to “turn the situation around.” In this context, it is interesting to consider what exactly has been happening and what a major new set of targets would mean.The following table shows Canadian GHG emissions by economic sector as defined by Environment Canada in selected years. The numbers show millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e).The table shows some interesting things. After declining during the recession, overall emissions are growing again, although not very fast. Emissions in the transportation sector, which receive so much media attention, are in fact quite stable, largely due to much more stringent regulations governing vehicle fuel economy. Emissions produced in the generation of electricity have fallen considerably and are expected to continue doing so, largely as a result of increased nuclear energy production, the phase out of coal-burning power plants and the loss of significant demand from industry, especially in Ontario. This has been largely offset by the increase in emissions from oil and gas production, which is expected to continue to 2020.While some might want to use this statistic to demonize the Canadian oil and gas sector, it is useful to bear in mind that the growth in China’s emissions in 2013 alone was over 500 Mt, more than two and a half times Canada’s total emissions from oil and gas projected for 2020.The most important message to take from this table is that, despite 25 years of program and tax measures to reduce GHG emissions, despite the spending of many billions of dollars in subsidies for alternative fuels and energy “conservation”, despite a serious and prolonged economic recession, emissions from Canada’s economy continue to diverge substantially from the paths set by government targets.The targets now being considered are far more stringent. The European Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, along with a host of environmental lobby groups and wealthy activists, are pushing for adoption of a target of an 80 per cent reduction from 2010 levels by 2050. That would take Canadian emissions down to 141 Mt in 35 years.Why, one might ask, do those who believe in the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming persist in pressing upon governments the adoption of emission reduction targets that are far beyond what is economically, politically and sometimes even technologically possible? The answer lies in the politics of climate change. High, consistently unattainable targets leave democratic governments in the position in which they are nominally honour-bound to take extraordinary action to do more. Targets give environmentalists symbolic two-by-fours with which they can beat governments about the head and shoulders when they fail to attain more reasonable goals. For politicians, the targets give them political justification (“cover”) to impose measures that would otherwise be seen as punitive, clearly harmful to the economy and/or disruptive of people’s rights and freedoms.A good example of what Canadians have in store for them if the new Trudeau government signs on to much tougher GHG emission reduction targets in Paris is the imposition of a carbon tax. British Columbia already has a carbon tax set at $30 per tonne, the equivalent of about seven cents per litre on gasoline. To attain the proposed 2050 target, the former National Roundtable on the Economy and the Environment argued that a carbon tax of $300 per tonne would be needed, and that a tax starting at $200 per tonne (i.e. 46 cents per litre equivalent) should be implemented immediately. It appears that the Trudeau government is planning to “take the lead” by getting the provincial governments to be the ones that impose the taxes, thus ensuring that the provinces get the enormous revenues (and suffer the inevitable political fallout).Even $300 per tonne would not be enough to force Canadians to completely stop using coal, oil and natural gas by 2050 as the environmentalists want, as this would shut down every important industry in the country and leave people without transport fuels. The targets, however, would justify an unprecedented growth in the role of governments and in their control over people’s lives. That, ultimately, is what emissions targets are all about.Robert Lyman is an energy economist of some 37 years experience, a former public servant and diplomat.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/09/29/power-generation-information-on-difficulties-of-instituting-the-proposed-wind-hydro-national-grid-network-in-acting-on-climate-change/,Ron Little ,Power Generation Information on Difficulties of Instituting the Proposed Wind-Hydro National Grid Network in “Acting on Climate Change”," TechnicalGeneration PerspectiveIn “Act on Climate Change” – a McGill Trottier report issued in spring of 2015, there was a proposal for a Canadian national wind-hydro grid and the authors claimed it could be implemented by 2035. Friends of Science Society asked the Alberta power generation experts for a discussion of whether or not that would be possible and at what cost. One of the papers cited in support of the proposal by Harvey et al. focused on Alberta as a significant wind resource. Here follows the technical discussion.Even if we take it as a given that there is enough wind potential, there are major technical issues with using a national wind/hydro hybrid system to supply all of Canada’s power. The biggest problem with wind is that it doesn’t respond to demand. In fact, in Alberta it is negatively correlated to peak demand. Our winter peak occurs when there is extreme cold and in these situations, there is ALWAYS an absence of wind. Ontario may be similar but no research on this area has been included in this commentary.The AESO publishes Long Term Adequacy Metrics to monitor the long term supply of electricity in Alberta. In the adequacy calculations, wind is excluded for the reason mentioned above. See ww.aeso.ca/downloads/Division_202_-_Section_202-6_Adequacy_of_Supply_(Oct_1_2014).pdf section4(2)(b)(v) and 4(2)(c)(v) on page 3 for the detail. The methodology “excludes wind” from the calculations.Currently in Alberta, we consume about 80,000 GWh of electricity per year and wind generation in the province has a capacity factor of around 30%. See pages 19 and 10 herehttp://www.aeso.ca/downloads/2014_Annual_Market_Stats_WEB.pdf. In theory, if Alberta were to be self-sufficient on an energy basis, we would need to install over 30 GW of wind turbines. Even with 30 GW of wind capacity, there would be times when wind contributes ZERO to the supply. In these cases we would need to import 100% of our power from other provinces. When the wind is blowing, we would be producing over 3 times as much power as we’re consuming. This would mean that we would need to export or spill up to 20 GW of power. “Spill” (lack of use) is a definite possibility as there is no guarantee there would be demand for that much power.In the Harvey paper, they talk about installing between 18.4 and 25.8 GW of wind in Alberta. This is 31% and 28% respectively of total wind capacity in their plan. This shows how heavily they on our province.Ontario is the other major contributor to their plan with between 45% and 48% of total wind capacity. They also use a capacity factor of 40% for Alberta when in reality it is only 30%. This paper does not review other regions in Canada but they quote higher capacity factors than Alberta, above 50% in some provinces. A few internet searches show that these values may be overly optimistic by at least 10%.The Harvey paper relies mainly on wind from Alberta and Ontario. Although, as they mentioned, it is true that there are benefits of diversification for wind sources, both provinces experience similar patterns. Higher wind in the winter months and lower in the summer. This can be seen in the AESO Market Statistics above and here for Ontario http://coldaircurrents.luftonline.net/2013/01/monthly-capacity-factor-of-wind.html. It is a certainty that there will be periods when both Alberta and Ontario simultaneously have low or no wind output. In these situations, the vast majority of the country would be entirely dependent on Hydro. Hydro has some flexibility but would not be adequate. A large portion of hydro is run of river and it can’t be turned on/off at will. Major blackouts would occur and the consequences would be severe at times of extreme hot or cold temperatures.In the paper, Section 4.1 Future Research Steps, they talk about looking into wind correlations and hourly demand. The fact that they didn’t do this before writing this paper is the fatal flaw. Perhaps if/when they finish their research, reality will set in.Transmission PerspectiveGiven the low capacity factor for wind, two to three times as much transmission is needed when compared to conventional generation. In the Harvey paper, they plan on transmitting wind energy across the country using HVDC lines to nodes in major demand centres. They consider only the “HVDC portion of the transmission and distribution system.” They ignore the integration of these HVDC lines into existing grids and they also don’t consider any transmission reliability issues. Even if we assume that their math for the HVDC lines is correct, they are severely understating the true cost of transmission and distribution.In Alberta, we spend around $1 million to integrate 1 MW of wind generation. See pages 61 and 62 of Review of the Cost Status of Major Transmission Projects in Albertahttp://www.ucahelps.alberta.ca/documents/ABE_TFCMC_Report_7_WEB_-_June_2014.pdf forbackground and costs of “SOUTHERN ALBERTA TRANSMISSION REINFORCEMENT (SATR); PROJECT 787 – To accommodate wind generation in southern Alberta.”In summary, Alberta would need to integrate the 18.4 to 25.8 GW of wind generation in the Harvey paper. HVDC lines would also need to be built across the country and the provinces receiving the power would also need to reinforce their grids. Alberta would also need to reinforce the grid to receive power and get it to load centres when the local wind isn’t blowing. The bottom line is Harvey considerably understated the transmission requirements.EconomicAbove it is mentioned how the whole plan is technically infeasible. But if we ignore that fact and pretend it could actually work, we can look at the economics.The Harvey paper estimates their hybrid wind/hydro plan would be able to supply the entire country at a price of between 4.5 and 6.39 cents per kWh including transmission costs. This is less than the majority of the country pays just for electricity right now and begs the question, if wind energy is so inexpensive, why hasn’t this plan already been implemented?First, Harvey states that power from wind costs between 3.75 and 4.97 cents per kWh. This requires “government-backed utility financing” at 3%. Then he states that private financing is closer to 12% and would essentially double the delivered cost of wind power. The reality is there is no “government-backed utility financing” in Alberta and even Ontario wind is being developed by private investors.Again, these are the two provinces where he expects most of the wind power to be developed. Also, as discussed above, the transmission costs are likely two to three times higher than he states. The bottom line here is that wind energy in his plan would cost at least double what he is claiming.If we assume his cost of $2k per kW of wind and that transmission costs are around 35% of wind costs (estimated from Table 1) this would require a capital investment of around $160 to $200 billion. Then, if we actually use realistic transmission assumptions it would likely be around $240 to $380 billion. This is in addition to the existing perfectly good infrastructure that we already have. Where would this money come from?PhilosophicalCanadian society is generally based on free markets, voluntary transactions between people. Harvey’s paper is anathema to free markets and describes a philosophy that would obligate society to pay $100’s of billions for an energy plan that won’t even keep the lights on. There would also be $100’s of billions of stranded generating assets and potentially bankrupt utilities. This would result in a huge loss of wealth to Canada and we would never realize all the positive benefits if the money was invested in productive assets rather than wasted on wind turbines.On wind versus conventional generation, the paper discusses how wind resources are vast and “a very small wind farm area in each sector would be sufficient to displace the entire current national fossil fuel-and nuclear-generated electricity.” This may be true but it would still be a much, much larger area than conventional generation. Also, large corridors across the entire country would need to be draped in transmission lines.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/09/15/coal-supplydemand-and-projections/,,Coal Supply/Demand and Projections," Contributed by Robert Lyman @ 2015As the phase-out coal debate continues in Alberta, it may be useful to get some perspective on world coal resources and use.Coal ResourcesCoal is the most widely available fossil fuel energy resource. Further, it is widely distributed geographically, with coal resources available in almost every country in the world and recoverable reserves present in around 70 countries. The largest coal reserves are in the USA, Russia, China and India.It is estimated that there are over 860 billion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. This means that there is enough coal already discovered and economic to produce at present prices to last the world at least 118 years at 2014 rates of consumption. In addition, potential coal resources dwarf proven reserves. Some deposits are estimated to have as much as 400 years of production remaining. New technologies, such as coal gasification, are likely to boost coal’s future role in energy supply even more.Coal reserves are broadly available in countries that currently have low levels of use and access to modern energy supplies. To Illustrate, here are illustrative lists of the coal reserves in a number of Asian and Sib-Saharan African countries:Table 1: Proved Recoverable Coal ReservesIn Asia Countries in 2008 (million tonnes)Country                                  Total ReservesChina                                      114,500India                                       60.600Kazakhstan                            33,600Indonesia                                  5,529Mongolia                                   2,520Turkey                                       2,343Pakistan                                     2,070Uzbekistan                                1,900Thailand                                    1,239Kyrgyzstan                                    812Source: World Coal AssociationTable 2: Proved Recoverable Coal ReservesIn sub-Saharan Africa in 2008 (million tonnes)Country                                  Total ReservesSouth Africa                           30,156Zimbabwe                                   502Mozambique                               212Tanzania                                     200Nigeria                                         190Swaziland                                    144Congo                                            88Source: World Coal AssociationCoal in Electricity GenerationCoal plays a vital, sometimes dominant, role in electricity generation worldwide. Coal-fired power plants currently fuel 41% of global electricity. In some countries, the percentage of electricity generated by coal-fired plants is even higher.Table 3: Coal in Electricity GenerationCountry                                  PercentageSouth Africa                              93Poland                                        92PR China                                    79Australia                                    77Kazakhstan                               70India                                          69Israel                                         63Czech Republic                         60Morocco                                    55Greece                                       52USA                                            49Germany                                     46Source: World Coal AssociationRecent Trends in Coal UseMeasured in terms of millions of tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), annual world coal consumption has risen from just under 1500 Mtoe in 1965 to about 3600 Mtoe in 2010, with 1200 Mtoe of that increase occurring in the period since 2001. The overall major increase masks the declines in use in the developed countries’ economies. In 1980, for example, the combined coal consumption of the U.S and European Union was 866 Mtoe. By 2010, the combined consumption of the two was 741 Mtoe. The gradual decline in the developing countries is continuing. U.S. coal consumption went down by more than 20% from 2007 to 2013 (to 455.7 Mtoe). In the EU, coal consumption fell by 12%. Canada, Australia and New Zealand have also reduced their coal consumption since 2008. Japan’s coal consumption was declining until the 2010 Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, but has been increasing since as Japan tries to make up for the loss of nuclear power. Germany, also reacting to the Fukushima incident, has been increasing its coal consumption since 2010.These trends in the OECD are overwhelmed by the truly impressive growth in coal consumption in the Asia Pacific countries. China is the world’s top consumer of coal, and was responsible for 74% of the growth in the Asia Pacific area from 1980 to 2010. From 1980 to 2013, China increased its coal consumption by more than six times to 1925 Mtoe, half of the world’s total consumption. Additions to coal-fired electricity generation capacity rose sharply after 2000, peaking at over 90 gigawatts (GW) in 2006, and were still 50 GW in 2012.In 2013, coal added more primary energy to the world’s energy system than any other fuel. It was the fastest growing fossil fuel, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2013, coal demand grew 2.4% on a tonnage basis. In 2013, coal demand in China (196 Mtoe) represented more than 100% of global growth, as the global total was offset by declines in the US and Europe.Future TrendsThe expansion of coal production capacity worldwide has, surprisingly, exceeded even the sharp increases in consumption. Consequently, the worldwide coal market is experiencing over-supply and low prices. Imported European steam coal prices, one of the main reference prices worldwide, were in the USD $70-80 per tonne range during 2014, compared to over USD $120 per tonne in March 2011.There are a number of different sources of information and analysis concerning future coal consumption. Two prominent sources that have recently issued medium and long-term (i.e. to 2035) projections are the International Energy Agency (IEA) and British Petroleum.In the IEA’s medium term outlook to 2019, it projected that global coal demand would continue rising and that China, despite efforts to develop more substitutes to coal in power generation, would still account for 60% of all demand growth during the forecast period. The growth in global coal demand is slowing slightly, but will still occur at an average rate of 2.1% annually to 2019.Reports from other sources confirm these trends. The World Resources Institute (WRI), in a recent report on projected emissions from coal, noted that in 2012 China had 363 new coal-fired plants, with a total capacity of 558 GW, in the construction “pipeline”. China has introduced new policies and standards as part of a so-called “Anything but Coal” Action Plan. The Plan would ban new coal plant construction near three major cities. Most regions, however, are not covered by the Action Plan, and more than 80% of the plants in the pipeline in 2012 were not affected by it. The planned additions will increase China’s coal-fired capacity by another 127%.Both the IEA and British Petroleum project that China’s growth in coal consumption will drop sharply from about 6% per year in 2005 to 2015 to 0.1% per year in the 2025-2035 period.Standing behind China and ready to take up the growth in coal demand, however, lies India and a large number of other Asian countries. India is where China was 15 years ago at the beginning of its power generation surge. The WRI report noted that in 2012 India had 455 coal-fired power plants in the planning or early implementation phases, which if built will add 519 GW to India’s power generation capacity. In 2010, India had an average electricity use of 700 Kwh per capita per year, compared to a global average of 2100 Kwh per capita per year. Three hundred million Indians remain without access to electricity or modern cooking fuels. The addition of coal-fired power generation thus represents for India an important component of its plans for social and industrial development. BP projects India’s coal demand growth to rise from 142 Mtoe (5.9% per annum) in 2005-2015 to 159 Mtoe (3.0% per annum) in 2015-2035 as the country industrializes.Significant expansion in coal-fired generating capacity will also occur in Russia, Turkey and Vietnam, according to WRI. In fact, WRI included in its inventory of plants in the “pipeline” 1199 worldwide, with 1401 GW in capacity.The IEA and BP project that globally coal’s share in primary energy will decline over time. BP considers that it will decline from 30% in 2012 to 27% in 2035, mainly due to growth in the use of natural gas and some renewables. By 2035, however, coal will still represent more than half of primary energy in China and India.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/09/15
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/09/15/what-is-the-ipccs-credibility-on-global-warming-a-2002-kyoto-debate-retrospective/,,What is the IPCC’s Credibility on Global Warming? A 2002 Kyoto Debate Retrospective," In 2002, Allan MacRae, P. Eng. was part of a published debate on the Kyoto Accord solicited by APEGA – the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta and it was published in their journal “The PEGG”.In the debate, two member of Pembina Institute argued for the Kyoto Accord, claiming that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was the authority on climate science and that Kyoto would lead to economic benefits, while Allan MacRae, P. Eng, along with Dr. Tim Patterson, Professor of Geology at Carleton University and Dr. Sallie Baliunas, Astrophysicist, argued against Kyoto on grounds that solar physics showed a better correlation to climate patterns than carbon dioxide concentrations, and that Kyoto was a flawed agreement that would be economically disastrous to Canada.Today, Allan MacRae has contributed his submissions to our blog so that the public can evaluate whether or not the IPCC has a credible track record or not.  He and his colleague in these written submissions, meteorologist Joe D’Aleo, present a concerning possibility of a slide into cooling temperatures.We post these opinions and scientific assessments by Mr. MacRae, which were independent submissions to the Alberta Climate Panel, as a public service.  Allan MacRae is not a member of our organization though his debating partners, Drs. Patterson and Baliunas were scientific advisers to Friends of Science Society and they appear in our climate science documentary “Climate Catastrophe Cancelled.”Mr. MacRae’s submission to the Alberta Climate Panel:PLEASE CONFIRM RECEIPTSubmission to Alberta’s Climate Change Advisory Panel (ACCAP)I request that you post this email AND the two attached papers, written for submission to ACCAP:1.    The UN’s IPCC Has No Credibility On Global Warming                     September 6, 2015 by Allan MacRae2.    Cold Weather Kills 20 Times as Many People as Hot Weather       September 4, 2015by Joseph D’Aleo and Allan MacRaeSUMMARY:The members of the Alberta Climate Change Advisory Panel may find these two papers controversial and want to dismiss them. The mandate of  the Alberta Climate Change Advisory Panel relies primarily on the scientific position of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, the IPCC’s position is being disproved by two decades of credible climate data. NONE of the IPCC’s dire climate change predictions have materialized.One’s predictive track record is an objective measure of one’s technical competence, and based on its negative predictive track record, the IPCC has NO credibility.In contrast, the predictive track records of Joseph D’Aleo, a veteran Meteorologist and Allan MacRae, a Professional Engineer, are highly credible. A debate with the Pembina Institute published in 2002 co-authored by Mr. MacRae provides evidence of his predictive competence. Mr. D’Aleo and his colleagues have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in their meteorological forecasts, as further described below*.Since its first report (FAR, 1990) the IPCC has predicted catastrophic global warming due to increased atmospheric CO2. However, global temperatures in the Lower Troposphere (LT) have NOT warmed in more than 18 years despite significant increases in CO2, according to the most accurate temperature data measured by satellites. The Surface Temperature (ST) data claims some warming, but it is increasingly obvious that the ST data is inaccurate, due to its increasingly large divergence from the satellite data.Despite claims of more extreme weather due to global warming, the incidence and severity of extreme weather has not increased. The climate has been remarkably stable despite substantial increases in atmospheric CO2. Over-hyped fears of global warming are utterly wrong. In fact, cold weather kills. Throughout history and in modern times, many more people succumb to cold exposure than to hot weather, as evidenced in a wide range of cold and warm climates. Evidence is provided from a study of 74 million deaths in thirteen cold and warm countries including Thailand and Brazil, and studies of the United Kingdom, Europe, the USA, Australia and Canada.Contrary to popular belief, Earth is colder-than-optimum for human survival. A warmer world, such as was experienced during the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period, is expected to lower winter deaths and a colder world like the Little Ice Age will increase winter mortality, absent adaptive measures. These conclusions have been known for many decades, based on national Excess Winter Mortality statistics.Excess Winter Mortality in the USA typically totals about 100,000 per year – that is, 100,000 Excess Winter Deaths every year during the cold months of December through March. In Canada, Excess Winter Deaths range from about 5000 to 10,000 every year.Despite our colder climate, Canada typically has slightly lower Excess Winter Mortality Rates than the USA and much lower than the UK. This is attributed to our better adaptation to cold weather, including better home insulation and home heating systems, and much lower energy costs than the UK, as a result of low-cost natural gas due to shale fracking and our lower implementation of inefficient and costly green energy schemes.The Alberta Climate Change initiative seeks to reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of green energy. In Europe, where green energy schemes have been widely implemented, the result is higher energy costs that are unaffordable for the elderly and the poor, and increased winter deaths. European politicians are retreating from highly-subsidized green energy schemes and returning to fossil fuels.The problem with green energy schemes is they are not green and they produce little useful energy, primarily because they are too intermittent and require almost 100% fossil-fueled (or other) backup.The lessons for Alberta are clear: When misinformed politicians fool with energy systems, the costs are enormous – globally, trillions of dollars of scarce resources have been squandered, economies have been severely damaged, and innocent people have needlessly suffered and died. Yours truly, Allan MacRae* Note:The Predictive Track Record of Joseph D’Aleo and colleagues has been remarkably accurate.For the past two winters, both Environment Canada and the USA National Weather Service have forecast mild winters. Joseph D’Aleo and colleagues forecast very cold winters in Central and Eastern North America and their forecasts proved remarkably accurate. Last Fall, we were concerned for public safety so we notified the Canadian and USA governments of our concerns.

The announcement, when it comes, will be an anti-climax, because it has been clear for most of the seven years that the Keystone XL Pipeline application has languished before U.S. regulatory bodies that the Obama Administration’s decision would not be based on the merits of the pipeline, as would be the case if it were built entirely in the United States. Indeed, over the past seven years, more than 20,000 miles of oil pipelines have been approved and built in the United States, almost none of them requiring more than 18 months of review. Instead, the decision in this case became hopelessly politicized because the United States environmental lobby decided to make it a symbol of their ideological opposition to greenhouse gas emissions. Obama will reject the permit as one element of his “environmental legacy”. The champagne corks will be popping in the boardrooms of the ultra liberal foundations and radical environmental groups across the United States and Canada. They think they have won the game. I have news for them. They have been watching the wrong ball. To understand why, one should revisit three of the key arguments accepted on faith by the anti-Keystone lobby: ·         Blocking Keystone will prevent Canadian crude oil from reaching the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries;·         This will significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and·         The world will use less oil and thus reduce its GHG emissions. Demand will be satisfied – Economics 101 for Eco-Radicals While all that lobbying effort and expense has been devoted to stopping Keystone XL, what has happened? Canadian crude oil exports to the United States have been growing steadily since 1990. In 1994, the exports were about 40 million barrels per year and they grew to 110 million barrels per year in 2015. In fact, just in the last year, from 2014 to 2015, Canadian crude exports grew from 2.7 million barrels per day (b/d) to 3.2 million b/d. Why? Well, it was primarily because U.S. refiners wanted it and were prepared to pay for it. Also, while the green lobby wasn’t looking: ·         In 2012, Enbridge reversed the Seaway pipeline, built to carry Texas crude to the U.S. Midwest, adding enough capacity to move 850,000 b/d south from Cushing, Oklahoma to Freeport, LA., the heart of the Gulf Coast. ·         Further north, Enbridge built the Flanagan pipeline system (585,000 b/d) and the Spearhead pipeline system (193,000 b/d) from Flanagan, Ill. to Cushing.·         TransCanada built its 700,000 b/d Gulf Coast Project crude oil pipeline (originally part of the Keystone XL project – oh, the irony!) between Cushing and Nederland, Texas, which began deliveries in January 2014.·         Later this year, the $300 million, 36-inch diameter pipeline from Trans Canada’s recently completed Marketlink pipeline will be filled with Canadian crude.·         Literally dozens of expansions were made to the pumping capacity of smaller cross-border pipeline systems, none of which required a Presidential permit.  There’s much more coming. There are 70 pipelines across the Canada-U.S. border. Just as water will find a way to seep through a crack in cement, Canada’s oil keeps streaming its way to Texas’ refinery row. Keystone XL would be better and cheaper, but its denial will only raise costs, it will not block movement. The fact is that the Gulf refineries were built to process exactly the kind of heavy crude oil that is available from Canada. Most of the growth in U.S. production is light crude oil. So, the Canadian crude is displacing heavy oil from Venezuela. It’s not Significant If You Can Barely Measure It  In 2013, President Obama announced his alleged “standard” for the acceptability of the Keystone XL pipeline. It had to be demonstrated that approving it would not “significantly” increase GHG emissions. The U.S. State Department Environmental Impact Statement devoted pages and pages to analyzing this subject and waffled in its observations. It stated that: “The total direct and indirect emissions associated with the proposed project would contribute to cumulative global GHG emissions. However, emissions associated with the proposed project are only one source of proposed emissions.” “The following climate changes are anticipated to occur regardless of any potential effects for the proposed Project.” The State Department report provided no support for the claim that refusing to approve the presidential permit would prevent Canada from developing the oil sands.  If one accepts the thesis that catastrophic climate change may be caused by human-made GHG emissions, how much difference to the world’s emissions would be made if the Keystone XL pipeline were not built? This can be demonstrated in percentage terms. Canada produces 1.8% of global GHGs. All current oil sands production accounts for 6.5% of Canadian emissions. The emissions associated with the oil that would be transported by Keystone XL represents about 20% of the production from the oil sands. If you multiply those figures (i.e. 1.8 x .065 x .2), you can calculate that the production of oil for the Keystone XL project would contribute 0.2% of global emissions. In other words, it is one five thousandth of annual global emissions. That is much less than the rounding errors used for statistical analysis. So, in the worst case, the emissions that would be avoided by rejecting the Keystone XL project can hardly be measured.  You Cannot Keep the People Down The proponents of the climate catastrophe theory would have the people of the world believe that they must stringently reduce their use of all fossil fuels – coal, oil and natural gas. They are delighted that the international price of crude oil has declined sharply over the past year, because that will offer less incentive for investment in new oil supplies, especially in higher cost sources like oil sands. They believe that their efforts will be successful in reducing oil and gas development and infrastructure construction.  They do not seem to realize that 85% of the emissions associated with the oil fuel cycle occur at the final consumption, or tailpipe, stage. Lower oil prices just mean increased demand for the fuel. Before the recent oil price decline, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected world oil consumption to increase by 36% above 2010 levels through 2040, with demand growth strongest in the less developed countries, and especially in China and India. With lower oil prices, the demand increases may be even faster. The OPEC Oil Market Report and the International Energy Agency Oil Market Report, the two most authoritative sources of expert analysis on oil market trends, both projected in July, 2015 that global oil demand will increase by 1.6 million b/d in 2015, the fastest pace in five years, and continue growing by around 1.4 million b/d in 2016.  Despite the decline in prices, infrastructure investment is booming.  In 2015, 1,115 miles of new crude oil pipelines will be constructed in the United States and 352 miles in Canada out of a global total of 1,886 miles. Crude oil pipelines under construction now that will be completed in future years total 3,885 miles in the United States and 2,968 miles in Canada out of a global total of 10,626 miles. Total onshore oil and natural gas pipeline construction worldwide in 2015 will total more than $40 billion. The people of North America and the world are demonstrating that they want access to modern energy services and do not believe the radical environmentalists’ rhetoric. Maybe they better forget the champagne.– 30 –Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/09/04
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/08/21/its-debatable-alberta-phase-out-coal-versus-burning-questions/,,It’s Debatable! Alberta Phase-out Coal versus Burning Questions," It’s time. Sunday, August 23, 2015 at 1:30pm at Tomkins Park,  Calgary – just off 17th Ave and 8th St SW (by Mount Royal Village). Time to talk about whether phasing out coal is really a good idea or not for Alberta.  On the one hand, you have people saying doing so would save lives and save $300 million…then you have our evidence-based report “Burning Questions” that shows power prices would skyrocket, it would cost $11 Billion plus compensation to the coal industry, shareholders and employees (to be paid by taxpayers)…and no substantial benefit to human health or the environment.  First of all, natural gas costs double the input cost of coal; secondly, Alberta’s health care system already eats up about 45% of the government budget.  Electrical power is considered to be the most important common element in modern medical care.  And then of course, there’s business and industry…and jobs. Just ask Ontario how phasing out coal is going for them….Some will say that the air quality in Ontario is much better – it probably is – because many US industrial operations were hit hard by the recession, and that’s where most of the smog used to come from according to the Ontario Ministry of Environment.In fact, the worst ‘smog’ of all is caused by ….forest fires. Most of them caused by humans.  Then we find out that Eco-activists have apparently decided to use child respiratory health and the ‘risk’ from coal-fired power plants as a lever to advance the agenda of carbon trading and renewables like wind and solar! Shocking.Anyway, come on down Sunday, Aug. 23, 2015 to Tomkins Park, beside Mount Royal Village just off 17 Ave and 8th St. SW in Calgary….debate starts at 1PM.  Bring your own chair.Friends of Science Society thanks the Zinner Law Office for sponsoring the Speakers’ Corner.  Debate is the basis of democracy!Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/08/21
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/06/26/climate-change-policy-in-alberta-the-return-of-the-great-depression/,Paul Bettez ,CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY IN ALBERTA – Where’s This All Going?," Contributed by Robert Lyman © 2015Robert Lyman is a retired economist and federal public servant who spent much of his career working on energy, transportation and environment issues. He now works part-time as a consultant in Ottawa.At the recent G7 meeting, the leaders of the world’s most influential free market economies committed that they would eliminate their emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 2100 and aim to reduce emissions by 2050 to between 40 and 70% below their 2010 levels. The European Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) continue to urge that leaders go further, and seek to reduce emissions by 80% below 2010 levels by 2050.In 2010, Canada’s emissions were 707 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) GHGs. Actual emissions in 2013 were 726 Mt. To attain the 70% target, therefore, Canada would have to reduce emissions to 212 Mt. That is 514 Mt below 2013 levels. Assuming the return of normal economic activity following the recent extended economic recession, emissions would normally rise considerably, thus making the proposed target even more daunting. We are supposed to achieve this in 35 years.To understand what this means, one has to examine what are the sources of emissions in Canada today. The following table shows the breakdown by economic sector, according to Environment Canada.GHG Emissions by Economic Sector (MtCO2e) in 2013How could we eliminate 514 Mt? Well, let’s start by considering what we absolutely can’t eliminate or would find virtually impossible to cut. We have to live in buildings; in fact, we will have to build considerably more simply to house the additional population expected by Statistics Canada to reach 46.9 million by 2050. Even with a considerable 20% increase in the energy efficiency of our buildings, which is possible but unlikely, a 25 % increase in population will override that. So we can’t cut there.Similarly, we have to feed ourselves. We might be able to cut back on agricultural production of the crops and animals that we export, things like wheat, beef and pork. Bovine flatulence is reportedly one of the causes of methane emissions that the IPCC strongly wants to reduce. So, we might be able to cut emissions there by half, say by 37 Mt. Of course, we don’t grow all the food we use; much of it is imported and has to be moved by truck. Of that 170 Mt of GHGs from transportation, trucking represents about 45%, but it is likely that no more than 15Mt specifically relate to transporting food.If you are keeping track, that means we cannot avoid 86 Mt on buildings, about 38 Mt on agricultural production, and 15 Mt on transportation because we have to house and feed ourselves. That’s 139 Mt. How will we be spend the remaining 73 Mt of our 212 Mt carbon dioxide budget?Right now, there are no practical alternatives to petroleum-based fuels in transportation, especially for aviation. Unfortunately we live in a large cold country and we have to get around a bit. We could cut out all pleasure travel and sacrifice tourism, eliminate all use of cars, spend several billion dollars to electrify the railways, and cut marine shipping to the bone, and we might be able to get emissions down by 73 Mt.There, what’s left? Well, we would have to eliminate all production of oil, natural gas and coal – not just new investments, but every single existing well and oil sands mine and in situ operation. We would have to stop all emissions intensive industries – those include mining and metal processing, industrial chemicals, cement, pulp and paper, oil refining and gas processing, and vehicle manufacturing, among others. We would have to shut down every electricity power plant based on coal, oil or natural gas. Tourism would be out. Finally, we would have to find some way to stop every other activity covered by the catchall category of “waste and others”.So, in Alberta, there would be no fossil fuel industry, no energy refining, processing or petrochemicals industry, no agricultural export industry, no mining or metal processing, few hotels and resorts and very little forestry. As these activities now represent more than 80% of the revenues for the Alberta government, unfortunately there would have to be major cutbacks in education, health care and other public service employment. In fact, the province could go back to the “good old days” in the 1930’s before major oil and gas fields were discovered and when prolonged drought hit agriculture. I think they called that “the Depression”.Image found on pinterest with these comments by Gisèle Dandurand • 29 weeks agoThis picture shows hundreds of men boarding a train to go to Ottawa to confront the prime minister, Robert Borden, about working conditions in relief camps. This moment, known as the “On To Ottawa Trek” clearly showed how bad the financial and industrial situation had become in Canada. The horrible conditions and low pay were compared to slavery, yet men continued to work, for they would not be able to find jobs elsewhere. Additional articles by Robert Lyman:http://www.troymedia.com/2015/06/22/what-signing-the-climate-change-targets-will-mean-for-you/Read Robert Lyman’s full report:http://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/climate_change_implications_Lyman.pdfRobert Lyman’s assessment of travel industy – “Snowbirds would be Nobirds”http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/06/prweb12809535.htmShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/06/26
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/05/26/qui-a-fait-de-la-publicite-trompeuse/,,Qui a fait de la publicité trompeuse???," In our opinion, the Association of Science Communicators of Quebec  (ASCQ) ran a billboard in Montreal, Quebec about November/December of 2014 that is in violation of Ad Standards Council Code, sections:1. Accuracy and Clarity (a)”Advertisements must not contain inaccurate, deceptive or otherwise misleading claims, statements, illustrations or representations, either direct or implied”(a)”Advertisements must not contain inaccurate, deceptive or otherwise misleading claims, statements, illustrations or representations, either direct or implied”(b) Advertisements must not omit relevant information in a manner that, in the result, is deceptive.and (e) claims must be supportable Both in principle and practice, all advertising claims and representations must be supportable. 8. Scientific claims Professional or Scientific ClaimsAdvertisements must not distort the true meaning of statements made by professionals or scientific authorities. Advertising claims must not imply that they have a scientific basis that they do not truly possess. Any scientific, professional or authoritative claims or statements must be applicable to the Canadian context, unless otherwise clearly stated.This ad, in French, says “What science REALLY says: The climate is changing. Because of us.” (or could also be read “Climate change. It’s because of us.”However, this misstates the scientific definition of climate change (see detail below) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which in both French and English says “Climate change in IPCC usage refers to… any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.”Thus, this billboard substantially overstates the claim about climate change by lumping all kinds of natural and human-caused climate change under one big layer of guilt – “It’s all our fault.”  (i.e. YOUR fault)That’s absurd…not scientific, and not even the IPCC/GIEC climate folks make such a statement.This plays upon the (Section 11) superstitions and fears of people.  That’s not right!Especially from a group claiming to be expert science communicators!Omitted from this billboard is the relevant information that climate changes all the time. See this? In the chart below, you can see that there have been many warm and cool periods over the thousands of years that had nothing to do with humans.  During the Roman Optimum, Hannibal crossed the Alps on elephants – we didn’t melt that snow!  We also did not cause the Dark Cold Age when much of human history and civilization simply….vanished.  Nor did we cause the Medieval Warm Period when all the cathedrals and castles were built in Europe – a time of warm, stable weather and very abundant crops.  We did not cause the Little Ice Age that followed – a time of terrible weather extreme, wet and cold seasons that led to crop failures, famines, and civil unrest.  And did we cause the present warming? (at the far right side of the graph)? Well, some scientists think so – but others do not and some think we only contributed to it nominally.And did we alone cause the present warming? (at the far right side of the graph)Well, some scientists think so – but others do not and some think we only contributed to it nominally.Some scientists note that there was very little volcanic activity from 1912 to 1963, as you can see in the black graph above – and that this might have been responsible for about 0.5 degree C of warming (meaning humans perhaps contributed only 0.3 degrees C of warming – not everyone agrees we contributed that much either).Likewise, let’s have a look at that industrial stack in the ASCQ ad with stuff pouring out of it.A common method of climate change activists, to make people feel like bad and dirty emissions are coming from plants, is to show an unidentified stack that is backlit.Today, certainly in Canada, most ‘soot’ emissions of black carbon (the stuff that makes wildfire smoke all black and that is really bad for your health) are highly regulated.  Most stacks emit steam  but when backlit – this looks black.  Since the stack is not identified, the viewer cannot know if this is a ‘dirty’ stack – or just steam. This seems very misrepresentative.You can see online at YourEnvironment.ca that in most cities in Canada, air quality has dramatically improved since the 1970’s.Furthermore – it’s not just greenhouse gas or carbon dioxide emissions that are defined as human factors contributing to climate change – the IPCC and most scientists agree that many human factors can affect climate and regional weather – such as deforestation, the Urban Heat Island effect, black carbon from transportation or wildfires (most of which are caused by humans), land disturbance (like farming/agriculture), and changing water bodies (like draining wetlands, building dams and reservoirs, diverting natural streams and tributaries….and more.To visually suggest that only emissions from human industrial activity are the cause of climate change is to greatly overstate the case and leaves out valuable information.As of course, the biggest natural factor (shouldn’t this be included too?…at least mentioned) is missing on this billboard …Here’s our point by point review.If you think it is wrong of a group of expert science communicators to mislead the public like this in their advertising, you know what to do. Complain to Ad Standards.http://www.adstandards.com/en/consumerComplaints/howToSubmitAComplaint.aspxNous ne faisions pas ce ‘climat change’ – ni ces changements climatiques!  Trompeuses!Simplement, ce n’est pas vrai.

In particular, we know that power generation seems to be a simple thing – all you and I do is flip a switch and there is light. In reality, power generation is an extremely complex industry. We’ve included some important technical commentary on this in our report.Thus, we have issued “Reality vs. Climate Change Uncertainties” so that as Canadian premiers gather in Quebec City on April 14, 2015, and thereafter, Canadians can all have a fully informed conversation on these proposed ‘solutions’ and their potential consequences.We would be pleased to hear your comments on our blog here or our facebook page.REALITY VS CLIMATE CHANGE UNCERTAINTIES FINAL april 06 2015Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/04/07

The seven scholars are looking for a new face who will be open to scientific debate.  However, their missive, published in a prominent Belgian newspaper was met with some push-back via the Ombudsman. Here is the original article.01/30/2015  http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20150129_01501548We see the Ombudsman’s response from De Standaard of Belgium.http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20150203_01509588And so we responded to him.ombudsman@standaard.beAnd here is what we responded to the Ombudsman.  To be fair, he has not yet had a chance to respond or publish yay…or nay.  None-the-less, we present our views in both languages for your consideration.De “Grote Mandrenke” van de Vrije Mening[1] – on Climate ChangeBy Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager,                                                   Friends of Science Society, Calgary, Alberta, CanadaDutch Translation by Albert Jacobs, Geol. Drs., Co-founder, Friends of Science SocietyDe Ombudsman van “De Standaard” in België rapporteerde een klacht over een recent artikel waarin zeven wetenschappers vraagtekens zetten bij de geschiktheid van Jean-Pascal van Ypersele als mogelijke volgende voorzitter van het IPCC. De ombudsman rapporteerde dat de (anonieme) schrijver van mening was dat iedereen die geen klimaatwetenschapper was geen stem zou mogen hebben. De klager stelde dat deze gerespecteerde Europese wetenschappers, geleerden, ingenieurs stil moeten blijven zitten – simpelweg omdat ze geen ‘klimaatwetenschappers’ zijn – als ze zien hoe wetenschappelijke principes door politieke spelletjes bij het IPCC ondermijnd worden, hoe nationale economieën tuimelen wanneer  roofzuchtig klimaatbeleid voorkeur geeft aan oneconomische alternatieve energie leveranciers en ‘koolstof’ handelaren, terwijl het Midden-Oosten overkookt, en het US EPA klimaat beleid de omzetting  van voedsel in brandstof ondersteunt.Je ziet de resultaten van het ‘wetenschappelijke’ klimatologie-beleid van het IPCC in je straat! Maar als je geen  ‘klimaat wetenschapper’ bent mag je je mond niet open doen.Wie beter dan een econoom om op ’heat or eat’ armoede -veroorzaakt door het klimaatbeleid – commentaar te geven? Wie beter dan een econoom en ingenieur om de gevolgen van stijgende energieprijzen en dalende aandelenkoersen te onderzoeken? Wie beter dan een filosoof om de drijvende krachten achter het IPCC te onderzoeken,  een organisatie die ver  afgedwaald is van haar  oorspronkelijke rapportage taak tot één van beslissen over het lot van miljoenen dollars, gebaseerd op twijfelachtige klimaatmodellen? En in dat domein kunnen we vertrouwen op een wetenschapper of ingenieur vertrouwd met algemene wetenschappelijke principes en computermodellen en die kan wijzen op de zwakke punten.Moeten wij – alle burgers – niet vrij zijn dergelijk beleid en dergelijke uitkomsten in vraag te stellen ?Ben je in Europa, een gebied met een lange geschiedenis, de wilde schommelingen van de natuur vergeten die ook deel zijn van die geschiedenis? De “Grote Mandrenke” in de stormvloeden van de 1219 en 1362? Ben je de Franse Revolutie vergeten tijdens de Kleine IJstijd? Vriestemperaturen, regen seizoenen,  falende gewassen, honger en wanhoop. Allemaal zonder SUV’s of ‘carbon’ voetafdrukken. Als je je dit herinnert hoef je niet naar een klimaat wetenschapper of deskundige te gaan om je af te vragen: hoe kan het IPCC beweren dat mensen en kooldioxide het weer of het klimaat bepalen op een catastrofale manier?Europa begon de traditie van het academisch onderzoek en beschermde dit  recent met het vieren van 900 jaar vrij en open onderzoek, de Magna Charta Universitatum. Dus waarom, in deze context van open onderzoek, wordt het plotseling ‘verboten‘ om de IPCC aan de tand te voelen? Waarom wordt het debat afgesloten? Waarom worden degenen die twijfelen aan de kaak gesteld als “deniers”, negationisten, of in dienst van ‘Big Oil’ … of deel van de tabak lobby?De zeven wetenschappers die Van Ypersele’s geschiktheid betwijfelden zijn allen experten  in aanverwante gebieden en vertrouwd met onveranderlijke wetenschappelijke principes en logica – of spreken alleen klimaatwetenschappers voor deze gebieden vandaag? Wij denken van niet.Kan niemand vragen of de wetenschappelijke pleidooiers van de klimaatopwarming die dit beleid duwen op één of andere manier betaald worden door Big Green ? Kan niemand hoop hebben op een meer neutrale voorzitter van het IPCC – een meer responsief leiderschap – die de overheden reeds vijf of  tien jaar op de hoogte zou gebracht hebben van het feit dat de opwarming van de aarde tot stilstand is gekomen, ondanks een stijging van de kooldioxide? Zou IPCC rapportage niet meer tijdig, open en eerlijk moeten zijn? Om dit te realiseren, moeten we ook een IPCC-leider hebben die open staat voor discussie.De ‘catastrofale antropogene opwarming van de aarde’ theorie (CAGW) wordt algemeen door het publiek aanvaard. Vreemd genoeg is dit ongeveer de enige reden voor de bouw van projecten voor “duurzame energie”, aangezien het bewezen is dat wind- en zonne-energie  duur en onbetrouwbaar is. Maar de schrik aanjagende emotionele retoriek van milieugroeperingen, van wie sommigen deelnemen aan de koolstof handel, brengen gewone kiezers ertoe het ‘klimaatverandering’s’ beleid en ‘hernieuwbare’ energie te eisen – zelfs als het meer kost – en bedelen hun regeringen om ‘de planeet te redden’.Ondertussen doden ze al het andere – de economie, de wetenschappelijke methode, gezond verstand en vrijheid van meningsuiting.De data en computer programma’s bewijzen de CAGW theorie niet. Temperaturen zijn nu onveranderd voor meer dan 16 jaar, ondanks een stijging van het  kooldioxide gehalte. Dit is iets waar we allemaal over moeten kunnen praten, vrijuit en zonder te worden gedenigreerd.Uit Canada, salueren we De Standaard voor het feit dat het de moed heeft om dat aan de orde te stellen.Maak dat, in de toekomst, onze stemmen niet lijden onder een “Grote Mandrenke”. De laatste ‘verdrinkings’ ( of vloed) problemen  in de Lage Landen losten jullie op met dijken en zeeweringen. – het huidige probleem kunnen we alleen oplossen door het openen van kanalen om de wetenschap ongehinderd te laten vloeien.Friends of Science Society of Canada steunt de moedige zeven die zich uitspraken over hun zorgen dat de volgende voorzitter van het IPCC open voor discussie en debat moet zijn.– 30 –ENGLISH VERSIONThe Great Drowning of Men’s Voices – on Climate ChangeBy Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager, Friends of Science Society, Calgary, Alberta, CanadaTranslation to Dutch by Albert Jacobs, Geol. Drs., Co-founder, Friends of Science SocietyDe Standaard Ombudsman of Belgium reported on a complaint about a recent article wherein seven scholars questioned the suitability of Jean-Pascal van Ypersele as the potential next chair of the IPCC. The Ombudsman reported that the (anonymous) writer expressed the view that anyone who is not a climate scientist should not be given a voice.  The complainant suggested that these esteemed European academics, scholars, scientists, engineers must sit by silent – simply because they are not ‘climate scientists’ – as they watch scientific principles subverted by politicking at the IPCC, national economies tumble as rapacious climate policies favour renewables purveyors and carbon traders, and while the Middle East boils over, thanks in part to US EPA climate policies of turning food into fuel.You see the results of the IPCC ‘science’ climatology-policy in your streets.  But if you are not a climate scientist, you shall not speak.Who better than an economist to address heat-or-eat poverty, caused by climate policy? Who better than an economist and engineer to examine rising power prices and falling share prices?  Who better than a philosopher to explore drivers behind the IPCC which has strayed far from its original reporting task, to that of deciding the fate of millions, based on faulty climate models – and in this we can rely on any scientist or engineer familiar with scientific principles and computer model to point out these weaknesses.Shouldn’t we – all citizens – be free to question such policies and such outcomes?In Europe, a region of deep history, have you forgotten the wild swings of nature that also shaped your history?  The Great Drowning of Men in the storm surges of the 1219 and 1362?  Have you forgotten the French Revolution during the Little Ice Age? Freezing temperatures, raining seasons, failing crops, famine and despair.  All with no SUVs or carbon footprints. Remembering these, you don’t have to be a climate scientist or expert to ask yourself – how can the IPCC claim that humans and carbon dioxide alone effect weather or climate in a catastrophic way?Europe began the tradition of academic inquiry and protected it more recently with the Magna Charta Universitatum, celebrating 800 years of free and open inquiry. So why, in this environment of open inquiry, is it suddenly verboten to question the IPCC?  Why is debate shut down? Why are those who question denounced as deniers, negationists, or in the pay of Big Oil…or as if vending tobacco?The seven scholars who questioned Van Ypersele are all experts in related fields and familiar with immutable scientific principles and logic – or do only climate scientists own these areas today?  We think not.Can no one ask if the global warming science advocates who push these policies are in the pay of Big Green?  Can no one hope for a more neutral chair at the IPCC – a more responsive leadership – so that governments might have been informed five and ten years ago that global warming had stagnated, despite a rise in carbon dioxide?  Shouldn’t IPCC reporting be more timely, open and honest? For this to happen, we also need an IPCC leader who is open to debate.The Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming theory has been widely accepted by the public. Curiously this is about the only reason for building renewable energy projects, as wind and solar have proven to be costly and unreliable. But the terrifying emotional rhetoric of environmental groups, some of whom play the carbon trading field, drive ordinary voters to demand ‘climate change’ policies and ‘renewable’ energy – even if it costs more – begging their governments to ‘save the planet.’In the process they are killing everything else – the economy, the scientific method, common sense and freedom of speech.The evidence does not support the Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming theory. Temperatures have flat lined despite a rise in carbon dioxide for over 16 years.  This is what we should all be talking about – and we should be free to talk about it without being denigrated.  From Canada, we salute De Standaard for having the courage to raise the issue.Let there not be a great drowning of men’s voices as we go forward.  The last ‘drowning’ problem you Europeans fixed with dikes and seawalls – this one we can only fix by opening channels to permit the free flow of valid science.Friends of Science Society of Canada supports the courageous seven who spoke out about their concerns that the next chairperson of the IPCC must be open to discussion and debate.30 –[1] De “Grote Mandrenke” (in het Oud Saksisch)  was één van de grootste overstomingen dat Europa meegemaakt heeft in 1362, waarbij 25000 mensen verdronken.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/02/10
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2015/01/22/note-to-future-chair-of-ipcc-science-is-founded-on-free-inquiry/,,Note to Future Chair of IPCC – Science is Founded on Free Inquiry," OPINION:Being chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is probably no picnic.  The organization has recently been under attack for its inability to explain why global temperatures have flat-lined, despite a rise in human-made carbon dioxide, once thought to be the main driver of climate change.  As the Netherlands submission to overhaul IPCC pointed out, the IPCC’s focus on ‘comprehensive’ reporting meant that for 15 years, global governments were unaware that global warming had stagnated – and continued to implement climate change policies to ‘stop global warming’…that had stopped naturally.A group of European scientists and scholars are raising the issue of free scientific inquiry in response to the previous Belgian Council of Minister’s support of an individual who is a candidate for the Chair of the IPCC.  However, these experts say the proposed candidate appears to bring an agenda to the table – and that’s not what the world needs now.They’ve issued a communiqué in Belgium that is getting some press.  See the English version here English Version of van Ypersele Communique Jan 21 2015 .  The English version of the communique expresses the opinions of the group and they wish to make fair comment on a matter of public interest. The English version includes some relevant background information for North American readers who may not be familiar with the issues or the signatories to the communiqué.Ironically, this candidate is part of a university that is signatory to the Magna Charta Universitatum:“The Magna Charta Universitatum is a document that was signed by 388 rectors and heads of universities from all over Europe and beyond on 18 September 1988, the 900th anniversary of the University of Bologna.It contains principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy as a guideline for good governance and self-understanding of universities in the future.Academic freedom is the foundation for the independent search for truth and a barrier against undue intervention for both government and interest groups.”Let us continue the 900+ year tradition of the University of Bologne – let us be free to question and criticize climate science in a civil and rational manner.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2015/01/22
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2014/12/06/liberte-de-parole-bien-sur-mais-pour-vous-seulement/,,Liberté de parole? Bien sûr! Mais pour vous seulement????," (Note: This was originally issued in the fall of 2014 – but these kinds of controversies continue today, so we reissued this blog piece as a video in April 2015. We had been especially surprised by the position of UQAM students on how the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms should be interpreted, in their blog piece of late Dec. 2014. The website of AWA mentioned below has been completely revamped and the words supporting democracy and respect for all views appear to have been edited out. We provide a screen shot from the AWA website at the time.)Les deux dernières semaines ont été un test très intéressant de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés.Le premier test est survenu lorsque la Presse Canadienne a pris contact avec les Amis de la Science (Friends of Science) pour faire une entrevue à propos de notre protestation sur le refus de l’Alberta Wilderness Association (AWA) de nous offrir un espace dans leur publication pour réfuter leur commentaire négatif à notre égard.Même si nous avions déjà émis un communiqué de presse à ce sujet deux mois auparavant, soudainement la Presse Canadienne était de nouveau intéressée parce que l’Alberta Wilderness Association (AWA) avait logé une plainte, basée sur l’éthique, à l’Association des Ingénieurs Professionnels et Géoscientifiques (AIG/APEGA). Le noyau central de notre groupe est composé de gens qui sont aussi membres de l’Association des Ingénieurs Professionnels et Géoscientifiques (AIG/APEGA). L’ Alberta Wilderness Association (AWA) prétendent que nous déformons la science parce que sur nos panneaux publicitaires nous affirmons que : ‘’ Le soleil est la principal facteur des changements climatiques. Non pas les humains! Non pas le gaz carbonique (CO2)!’’Dans l’article de la Presse Canadienne, le directeur général de l’ Alberta Wilderness Association (AWA) a déclaré ironiquement que nous essayions de les museler parce que nous avions fait remarquer aux Albertains que L’ Alberta Wilderness Association (AWA) était une organisation caritative financée par des fonds publics, qui déclarait être en faveur de la démocratie, de l’intégrité et de la loi et d’un dialogue respectueux et inclusif sur leur site internet, mais non pas en ce qui nous concerne. Ils ont, de plus, reçu des fonds d’un groupe d’outre-mer engagé dans une campagne internationale de salissage contre l’Alberta.(excerpt of text from AWA website at the time they published their story on Friends of Science)l’Association des Ingénieurs Professionnels et Géoscientifiques (AIG/APEGA) est d’accord avec un débat rationnel et démocratique. En 2002, ils ont suscité un débat démocratique sur le Protocole de Kyoto. Trois de nos scientifiques ont argumenté que le soleil était le facteur principal du changement climatique selon les données scientifiques. Deux représentants de      l’ Institut Pembina ont aussi argumenté pour le Protocole de Kyoto basé sur leur déclaration de principe et les revendications du Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC/IPCC).(Introductory text to the APEGA/PEGG Point and Counterpoint debate)Nous avions espéré que L’Alberta Wilderness Association (AWA) nous aurait permis la liberté de parole enchassée dans la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés. Vu que le noyau central de notre groupe compte plus de 300 années d’expérience partagée dans les sciences de la terre et de son atmosphère, le fait d’avoir droit à un débat éclairé sur le sujet compte beaucoup pour nous.Quelques jours plus tard la presse montréalaise était en furie parce la population réclamait que nos panneaux d’affichage (en langue française) soient enlevés sur les autoroutes.À Vancouver, Clean Energy Canada, l’organe de sensibilisation pour l’environnement de l’organisme caritatif Tides Canada, ont logé un plainte, via Twitter, réclamant que nos panneaux publicitaires étaient ‘’immoraux et peu éthique’’ et devraient être enlevés.Immoral? Peu Éthique? Le réchauffement global a cessé naturellement il y a plus de seize ans, malgré un hausse significative du gaz carbonique (CO2 ) – réfutant par conséquent la théorie fondamentale du réchauffement climatique anthropique. Depuis que cette information a été disséminée par le Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC/IPCC), plein de tentatives ont été faites pour esquiver ce fait tout en créant une escalade de l’hystérie apocalyptique.Ce qui est immoral et peu éthique est la suppression de cette information. Comme nous l’avons déjà argumenté en 2002, les cycles solaires agissent sur le climat de la terre; de plus, les tendances indiquent que l’on doit s’attendre à un refroidissement des températures.La baisse de l’irradiation solaire, telle que démontrée par des graphiques précis annonce des périodes de températures froides dans un avenir rapproché : au fil du temps, des cycles de températures froides ont été désastreux pour la race humaine.Il n’est pas nécessaire d’être un scientiste pour savoir cela. Dans la culture populaire, deux des comédies musicales les plus appréciées ont comme arrière-plan des changements climatiques extrêmes. La première est ‘’ Joseph et son Incroyable Manteau Multicolore. La pièce de théâtre est basée sur l’histoire biblique de Joseph et de ses frères, en Égypte, où les Dieux-Soleil Ra et Horus étaient adorés; le Pharaon avait eu un rêve prophétique et il a demandé à Joseph de l’interpréter : ‘’Sept vaches grasses sont dévorées par sept vaches maigres et laides’’. Le message était clair : ‘’Préparez-vous car la famine épuisera toutes les réserves accumulées durant les périodes de temps chaud’’. C’était un avertissement à ce moment-là pour toute l’humanité– peut-être la première preuve documentée d’un peuple se rendant compte que les cycles solaires affectent le climat sur terre.La deuxième comédie musicale est : ‘’Les Misérables’’. L’histoire se déroule à la fin du Petit Âge Glaciaire. Le Petit Âge Glaciaire, de 1350 à 1850 après J.C., était une époque de faible activité solaire et de conditions climatiques cruelles pour l’humanité. La Révolution française fut le point culminant de cette époque de pauvreté désespérante et de famine, après des décennies de froid inhabituel, d’un climat humide et misérable, où le cri de ralliement était : Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité.La Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen de 1789, une suite de la Révolution française, a garanti la liberté de parole en déclarant que : La libre communication des pensées et des opinions est un des droits les plus précieux de l’Homme (Article 11).Cette liberté fut acquise avec beaucoup de sang, de tristesse et de souffrances dans une période de désespoir, exacerbée par un rude climat. Depuis 1850, le climat global s’est réchauffé. Grâce au ciel! Les récoltes sont devenues plus abondantes et nous avons prospéré. Et maintenant le climat a commencé à refroidir de nouveau.Nous sommes intéressés par une discussion polie et raisonnable à propos des changements climatiques et des questions de politique mondiales s’y rattachant. La liberté de parole n’est pas seulement pour vous (AWA) mais pour nous tous qui sommes concernés.Ne devrions-nous pas apprendre de l’histoire et de la science, et non pas essayer de tout censurer?Voyez aussi ici a notre Blog des Amis de la Science (Friends of Science blog): Commentaire par Norm Kalmanovitch, P.

And, how long is the record? Oh, 36 years – 18 of them stagnated or cooling?"," By Norm Kalmanovitch, P. Geoph.Resident Science Adviser to Friends of Science SocietyRecently the press has been alive with stories of 2014 shaping up to be the ‘hottest on record’ http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/30/tech/innovation/record-temperatures – but Norm Kalmanovitch, P. Geoph. takes the media and NOAA to task for appearing to mislead ordinary citizens on climate change issues while omitting the larger historical warm periods and context.Warming? What warming?The world has been warming for over 300 years since the depths of the Little Ice Age so any record less than about 500 years long will make it seem as though today’s temperature is among the warmest “on record.” What is that record? 130 years (which would have begun at the end of the Little Ice Age when it was…cold! ) Or ~40 years of satellite data? For 18 of those years, temperatures have stagnated – sometimes showing a barely measurable rise of 0.05 degrees C.  As German climate expert Hans von Storch said in a July 2013 interview with Der Spiegel:  “In fact, the increase over the last 15 years was just 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.11 degrees Fahrenheit) — a value very close to zero.”This is not the kind of warming people should worry about. Why isn’t NOAA announcing the story this way: “Though a slight temperature rise appears to make this the warmest year in contemporary records, this ‘rise’ is close to zero and we are still much cooler than previous historical periods before humans used fossil fuels in industry?”This story appears to be a willful deception using a record that is too short to show the true state of the global temperature.An honest portrayal of the global temperature record, as was the case in figure 7.1 in the IPCC 1990 First Assessment Report, will show that the world has been cooling for 5000 years since the Holocene Maximum and on a shorter time frame cooling for 800 years since the Medieval Warm Period.If NOAA wanted to tell the truth about global temperature it would do the same as the NIPCC and use the record produced in 2010 by Ljungqvist showing that the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period were both warmer than any temperature on the NOAA NCDC global temperature dataset.ReferenceLjungqvist, F.C. 2010. A new reconstruction of temperature variability in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere during the last two millennia.Geografiska Annaler Series A 92: 339-351.http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2010/dec/15dec2010a4.htmlFigure 1. Reconstructed extra-tropical (30-90°N) mean decadal temperature variations relative to the 1961-1990 mean of the variance-adjusted 30-90°N CRUTEM3+HadSST2 instrumental temperature data of Brohan et al.(2006) and Rayner et al. (2006). Adapted from Ljungqvist (2010).Since NOAA does not seem able to differentiate cooling from warming over periods longer than their 130 year dataset, I annotated the graph with trend lines showing the current temperatures lower than the Medieval Warm Period.Regardless of whether or not 2014 is the warmest year on the 130–year record it is certainly not warmer than temperatures of the Roman Warm Period or the Medieval Warm Period.  The public needs to question the motivation of NOAA and the media in making this misleading statement.NOAA should also show its dataset on the same graph as CO2 concentration and explain why its data shows slight net global cooling since 2002, even while atmospheric CO2 increases at the same rate as during the warming that occurred before 2002. (See graph from www.climate4you.com )People should be asking NOAA to explain why all five global temperature datasets show the same slight net global cooling since 2002 – which is the same time period over which the World Radiation Center data shows that total solar irradiance (TSI) is decreasing.Why is NOAA telling the American public that it is the ‘hottest year on record’ without telling people how long that record is, or that in context, this year’s temperatures are below the hotter times prior to fossil fuel use in the Minoan, Roman and Medieval time periods?We think it is wrong to create public angst over the fear of global warming – especially when we are experiencing global cooling, however slight it may be. Children are particularly susceptible to this kind of fear mongering.There are numerous factors that affect climate – in our view the sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change.  However there are many cyclical atmospheric oscillations that have global impact, even though they are centered in one region.  Find out more about the various aspects of climate science – see our website at www.friendsofscience.orgNorm Kalmanovitch, P.

Geoph.Resident Science Adviser & Friends of Science member On February 22, 2013 IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri acknowledged a 17 year “pause” in global warming essentially confessing to the Australian press that global warming had already ended by 1996 (which was before the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change was even initiated!) http://canadianawareness.org/2013/02/ipcc-head-rajendra-pachauri-acknowledges-17-year-stall-in-global-warming/ Solar Cycles are a Critical Predictor of Climate ChangeThe sun has a number of cyclical patterns that give rise to fairly predictable patterns of warming and cooling on earth. We saw the ‘pause’ coming.Solar Cycleshttp://www.universetoday.com/103803/solar-cycle-24-on-track-to-be-the-weakest-in-100-years/The PauseAnother year has passed since Pachauri’s pronouncement of the 17 year “Pause.” The global cooling that began in 2002, is related to a drop in Total Solar Irradiance. Each year of global cooling erased a portion of previous global warming to where the point of zero net global warming now stands somewhere between 1995 and 1997 depending on the global temperature dataset used.Drop in solar irradiance is visibly evident since 2002.Graph from the World Radiation Center in Davos, Switzerland. (yellow bar added to illustrate decline.) The global cooling was in turn caused by the 0.8W/m2 decrease in total solar irradiance between the peak of solar cycle 23 in 2001 and the peak of solar cycle 24 in 2014. The peak of solar cycle 25 is predicted to be even lower than the current solar cycle 24, so all indications are that the current global cooling will not only last until at least 2032; it will intensify. Climate Model Mania more Important at IPCC than Evidence? Climate models are very complex computer simulations – but they suffer from many subjective attributions by designers, and numerous climate interactions are impossible to model.  Climate models continue to predict extreme warming – reality tells us the opposite. Temperatures have flat lined…and are cooling.If it’s already cooling, why must we stop global warming?With the world now cooling for a dozen years as CO2 emissions reach new record high levels year after year, it is ridiculous to me, for the head of the IPCC to contradict his own statement that global warming ended before the 1997 Kyoto Accord was initiated. Kyoto was initiated to “stop global warming.”  Global warming has stopped naturally.  Why does Pachauri continue to claim that we have to honour the ludicrous “save the world from global warming by reducing GHG emissions” premise of the same Kyoto Accord?!In my opinion, even more ridiculous than claiming that we have to stop global warming in a cooling world, is the way that the IPCC, World Bank and others want to do it. Since 1997 the world has spent over a trillion dollars on IPCC approved initiatives aimed at reducing CO2 emissions only to have global CO2 emissions increase from 24.3 billion tonnes in 1997 to over 35 billion tonnes today. If initiatives did not work in the past and humankind only wasted a trillion dollars for nothing; how is more of the same going to do anything to stop global warming…. considering that global warming already stopped before this trillion dollars was spent.Mission Impossible – Renewables not so Doable or “Affordable”Along with the demand we ‘stop global warming’ is the alleged solution – ‘renewable power’ in the form of wind and solar.That truly is a mission impossible, and an expensive one at that.As of 2013 renewables make up only 2.2% of the world’s primary energy consumption while fossil fuels make up 87% so it will take some doing to follow the IPCC directive and replace fossil fuels with renewables.The sheer idiocy of the preposterous statement that we must reduce GHG emissions (i.e. CO2 emissions) to zero by the end of this century is demonstrated by primary energy consumption increasing by 247.2MBOE (million barrels of oil equivalent) with renewables only supplying 38.5MBOE of the increase.If we are increasing our energy consumption of fossil fuels by over five times more than we are increasing our supply of energy from renewables; exactly how are we going to achieve a GHG emissions reduction to zero by the end of the century when we are already losing ground at this rate!The 2012 primary energy consumption 12483.2MBOE, 2013 primary energy consumption 12730.4MBOE 2013 Fossil fuel consumption 11032.2MBOE 2013 renewables 279.3MBOE)http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/Energy-economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2014-full-report.pdfWe told you so!On April 14, 2008, I and four of my climate science associates sent a letter to Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, Chairman Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.We sent a graph showing the decline.In 2008 meteorologist Joe D’Aleo not only pointed out the global cooling trend starting in 2002, but made a graph of both global temperature and atmospheric CO2concentration captioned with “World Temperatures Falling Whilst CO2 Keeps Rising”. He and I were some of the first to notice and openly talk about the start of the current global cooling trend on the global temperature data.We asked Pachauri to honour the empirical evidence.After three months and receiving no response from Pachauri, on July 14, 2008 we sent a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon demanding that “The UN Climate Change Panel must be called to account and cease its deceptive practices- Policies based on false science must be ended.”Included in this letter was the original letter to Rajendra Pachauri which provided the scientific evidence refuting the IPCC’s anthropogenic global warming (AGW) conjecture. Both Pachauri and UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon were made aware of empirical data refuting the IPCC’s AGW dogma.Yet on November 2, 2014, with the release of the IPCC Synthesis report, they boldly proclaimed their ignorance and preached the same dogma that empirical evidence refuted back in 2008 and still refutes today.People wondered why we are running billboards.Now you get it. It’s a public service.No one else is going to tell you.Norm Kalmanovtch, P. Geoph.Our tiny earth is shielded by a magnetic field that resists the solar wind, a proton blast travelling at a million kmph.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2014/09/16/uncharitable-rejection-lost-in-the-alberta-wilderness/,harebell ,Uncharitable Rejection: Lost in the Alberta Wilderness," In the July 2014 edition of Wild Lands Advocate, on page 14 of the magazine of the Alberta Wilderness Association, the editor published a picture of our famous billboard under the title of – “With friends like these…”along with a short negative commentary about Friends of Science. The article misrepresented the facts about our organisation, our purpose and mandate and smeared our reputation. (Note: Due to a web-site update by AWA, some links in this article to their site don’t work anymore. We have included relevant scans and screenshots below to support our statements. New link to magazine: http://albertawilderness.ca/archive/publications/2014-07-16-vol-22-no-3-wild-lands-advocate )Scan of Alberta Wilderness Assoc articleNo one from Alberta Wilderness Association had contacted us to verify anything about our billboard, our organization, or our mandate prior to the publication of this piece.We wrote a detailed letter to the editor and demanded that they publish our rebuttal response on their web site and in the next edition.  They refused. We submitted a further request. They refused.Rejection of Rebuttal Not in Keeping with Typical Publishing PoliciesFirst of all, we find this not in keeping with the general policy of most publishers.For instance, the Montreal Gazette published two articles recently related to the climate science findings of Shaun Lovejoy of McGill University in which Friends of Science was referred to in a negative light.We objected to how we were characterized in the articles and also disputed Shaun Lovejoy’s science claims. The Montreal Gazette was very receptive to publishing a rebuttal. They did ask us to rewrite one paragraph for clarity and later to shorten our article in terms of available space. We were happy to comply. Here is our recent published rebuttal.In general, this has been our experience with other major publications – rebuttal comments are accepted in the interests of fairness and open, democratic debate.Not in Keeping with AWA’s Stated ValuesBut not so at the Alberta Wilderness Association which claims the following as some of its ‘values’:INTEGRITYWe conduct our advocacy with truth, honesty, respect for others and within the full limits of the law.RESPECTFULNESSWe develop rapport with individuals and communities through active listening, openness and free access to information in a democratic way.PARTICIPATIONWe promote effective environmental decision making through an empowered and knowledgeable public that is inclusive of all segments of society.”We were more annoyed to find out that Alberta Wilderness Association is funded by taxpayers through Alberta Spirit lotto funds and tax deductible charity donations. We are taxpayers too!Charities have Special Requirements Under the LawYes, Alberta Wilderness Association is a charity.Regarding charities, the Canada Revenue Agency stated:“…promoting a particular point of view or political orientation is not charitable. Presenting selected items of information and opinion to the general public without the necessary element of instruction is not regarded as charitable.”Friends of Science Society has actively promoted public debate on climate science and even hosted speakers who completely oppose our position that the sun is the main driver of climate change. We are scientists and have science-minded members. Science is about exploring all the facts, not just the convenient ones. We welcome and encourage open, rational, civil debate on topics of climate science.An example is this 2002 debate about the Kyoto Protocol, published in the PEGG – the magazine of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta. The debate was conducted between two representatives of the Pembina Institute (for “The Point”) and three of our scientific advisors (for “The Counterpoint”). The Kyoto rhetoric of “The Point” side has been proven false over the years while the scientific argument by our advisers has strengthened.Vivian Krause has Raised Questions About the Motives of Some Charity SponsorsA further review of the Alberta Wilderness Association revealed that this charity has a number of high-profile funders – some of which are charities themselves. Researcher Vivian Krause has raised questions about the activities and motives of some of these large charities and their funding.The sponsors of AWA, according to their website, include: Alberta Conservation Association, Alberta Ecotrust, Alberta Historical Resources Foundation, Alberta Lottery Fund – Community Initiatives Program, Alberta Real Estate Foundation, Alberta Sport, Recreation Parks & Wildlife Foundation, Community Lottery Board Grant Program  Calgary, The Calgary Foundation for Calgary… Forever, FRIENDS of the ENVIRONMENT Foundation, Canadian Council for Human Resources in the Environment Industry, Canadian Technology Human Resources Board, Alberta Gaming Community Facility Enhancement Program, Edmonton Community Foundation, Geospatial Information & Technology Association, glasswaters Foundation, Henry P.

(new web link: http://albertawilderness.ca/sponsors)For instance Vivian Krause’s opinion article in the Financial Post indicates that some funders were associated with an anti-Alberta tourism campaign, and various website grant funding details were withdrawn after she began investigating.According to other related research, Wilburforce has provided grants of $1.7 million to Canadian organizations in 2009, including $21,200 to the Alberta Wilderness Association. (Note: Krause indicates that currently Wilburforce does not appear to be a funder.)In light of Krause’s extensive review, in our option one has to wonder – if these organizations are party to destroying Alberta’s tourism reputation, what were/are they doing funding Alberta Wilderness Association?Screenshot of List of Sponsors from AWA website (1/2) as it appeared in July 2014Screenshot 2 of AWA Sponsors as it appeared of July 2014 on their websiteAccording to the Ecofascism web-site: http://ecofascism.com/article21.html“The ubiquitous, opaque Tides Foundation and Tides Canada Foundation are clearing houses for foundations wishing arm’s-length relationships with the unwashed mass of ENGOs. Tides Canada owns assets worth $31 million. In Alberta they fund: Alberta Wilderness Association, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, Canadian Wilderness Federation, Ducks Unlimited Canada, Pembina Institute, Sierra Club Canada, Southern Alberta Land Trust, and Western Wilderness Committee.

With freedom comes responsibility – with charitable tax status, even more so, as recently noted by Andrew Coyne in the National Post.  Coyne is not opposed to groups engaging in advocacy – he just doesn’t think anyone should have charitable tax status to do so.In light of this experience, we agree with him.We, as taxpayers and scientists, are appalled at Alberta Wilderness Association’s refusal to engage in factual, democratic debate.With Freedom of Speech Comes Responsibility; With Charitable Status comes a Requirement to be Factual and ApoliticalIf you share our concerns, this is the CRA website where you can get more information or send a letter of complaint.http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/cntct/cmplnts-eng.htmlIf you are writing the Charities Compliance Division, you will need the following information: “AWA is a federally registered charity and functions through member and donor support.

https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2014/07/21/when-the-sun-isnt-the-only-thing-giving-us-heat-challenging-greenpeace/,,When the Sun Isn’t the Only Thing Giving Us Heat: Challenging Greenpeace," When the Sun Isn’t the Only Thing Giving Us Heat:Challenging Greenpeace Dear Greenpeace – Admit intimidation tactics!Here at Friends of Science, we’re a small organization based out of Calgary that advocates for one main cause: evidence-based climate science. Good science makes good policy.Our position, after a dozen years of expert review of climate science, is that the sun is the main driver of climate change – not you, and not CO2 – carbon dioxide.Of course, we have reasons and evidence to support this position, well-summarized in our DOHA report of 2012.More recent evidence, noted in the September 2013 IPCC report, shows global warming naturally stopped 16 years ago. In fact, from 2002 to May 2014, the earth surface temperatures appear to be cooling slightly. This is true for both HadCRUT4 surface and satellite temperatures. Despite rising CO2 emissions, there is no warming and no environmental damage from the 0.8 degree Celsius warming of the last 100 years.Many people have forgotten their grade school science. CO2 is actually plant food; our CO2 emissions have increased crop yields, and help forests grow and flourish – creating additional new, natural carbon sinks.Following our recent luncheon featuring Ross McKitrick’s presentation, we decided to run a digital billboard, shown above. Three weeks later, Greenpeace picked up on it and claimed ‘foul play.’ They said the outdoor sign company had been censoring an earlier Greenpeace billboard that supported renewable energy.Censoring?Suffice it to say, if anyone could censor Greenpeace’s unconventional tactics, we’d be surprised. Remember when Greenpeace literally rappelled off of the Calgary Tower to claim the government should “separate the oil from the state?” We certainly do. In case you’ve forgotten, you can see the court document here .Now, Greenpeace is making headlines again – but mainly for their intimidation tactics that target the corporate officers, directors and CEOs of some 80 insurance and energy companies from around the globe. In “Dear CEO, admit climate crimes,” writer Terence Corcoran asks, what right does Greenpeace have to bully corporations to support their cause? Isn’t that kind of, like… mafia tactics? @terencecorcoran, we agree with you – that, yes, Greenpeace is fueled by their skewed and overly passionate emotions.While we’re definitely passionate about our own cause, we think it’s important to let our message be directed by evidence first, and not passion alone.Greenpeace relies on one paper, written by a non-climate scientist, to make the claim of ‘climate crimes.’ To give an even further background, Greenpeace is demanding that corporations disclose their alleged anti-climate change funding activities and lobbying efforts. Greenpeace, an unaccountable, unelected organization labels anything outside the ‘consensus’ view on climate as criminal, punishable activity. In “Dear CEO, admit climate crimes,” Greenpeace faults CEOs and major companies for the devastating effects of natural disasters:The Greenpeace letter claims climate catastrophes are personal, “It’s personal to the victims of super Typhoon Haiyan …” but 101 years ago a similar typhoon hit Tacloban, killing half the population of two cities.  Natural events like this have nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions. Corporations are not responsible for natural weather events. A peak at James Marusek’s extensive list of 14,000 catastrophic weather events throughout time, long before fossil fuel use, will clarify this point.Likewise, there is no correlation between hurricanes and global temperatures or emissions as underscored by the fact that global hurricane energy has declined 40% since 1998, see graph here. Meanwhile, the frequency of strong (F3+) tornadoes in the USA have declined significantly since the 1970s, see graph here. The severity of droughts globally and in North America have also been on the decline, see graph here.”This evidence directly contradicts the claim against corporate officers, made by Carroll Muffett, Centre for International Environmental Law and Leanne Minshull, Greenpeace International’s Climate and Energy Campaigner who wrote “The responsibility – not just the devastating effects – should be personal.”Let’s look at the flip side. Perhaps there should be personal responsibility and consequences to Greenpeace campaigners for threatening corporate officers and engaging in a game of public shaming?After the Greenpeace accusations were made in the letter, Greenpeace then asks these accused corporate officers to fill out and return a questionnaire to them – essentially confessing to their alleged climate crimes.  Greenpeace state they will then post the answers – or lack of them – on their web-site! A public hanging with no judge, jury or trial – submit!  Or Greenpeace will shame you. According to the dictionary, that’s a form of extortion.Why? With all of this going on, and in light of Greenpeace’s ongoing bullying, we have to ask you, Greenpeace: is bullying the proper way to gain supporters? Is intimidation the right way to inform the public about your cause?Answer this: Would you think kindly of our political leaders if that is how – through bullying and intimidation — they garnered your support? We think not.Friends of Science will continue on with our efforts, while we face baseless accusations from Greenpeace – such is life. At the end of the day, we refuse to rappel down towers, and we refuse to send letters to companies to frighten them. Greenpeace got early credibility for challenging environmental problems – now they are losing it for acting like caffeinated road-ragers.So far in the West, Greenpeace has been left to explore its street theatre and often dangerous, life-threatening stunts.  But India has a much more serious take – they’ve declared Greenpeace a threat to national security.And recent revelations show that senior Greenpeace officers are guilty of their own climate crimes – like flying 250 miles to work. In their defense, Greenpeace say ‘that’s a tough one.’ Really?Doesn’t this make Greenpeace eco-HIPPO-crites?Instead of threats and intimidation Greenpeace – live up to your name. Be environmental leaders, don’t make up lame excuses, and keep the peace. Dump the extortion tactics and face the facts.  You’re wrong about climate crimes. Global warming stopped 16+ years ago, despite a rise in CO2.  Our last billboard was so effective – we decided to do another.“Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.”  For more information about Friends of Science and our scientific perspective, please visit www.friendsofscience.org.    Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ",['Uncategorized'],2014/07/21
