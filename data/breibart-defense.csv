(Ret.) Lloyd Austin as his defense secretary, amid rising opposition from Senate Democrats at the prospect of another retired general at the helm of the Defense Department.



In order to get Austin confirmed, Congress would have to grant Austin a waiver from a law that requires a defense secretary be out of uniform for at least seven years, aimed at upholding the principle of civilian leadership of the armed forces.



The waiver has only been granted twice in history.



Once for Army Gen. (Ret.) George Marshall, and more recently for Marine Gen. (Ret.) James Mattis. However, 17 Senate Democrats opposed a waiver for Mattis, arguing it undermined the principle of civilian leadership of the Pentagon, and many Democrats and Never Trumpers criticized Trump for appointing Mattis and other retired generals to senior civilian positions in his administration.



During a live-stream event introducing Austin, Biden seemed to go back and forth between touting Austin’s military service and recognizing the importance of civilian leadership of the Pentagon.

Biden said there was a “good reason” for the law that he “fully” understood and respected, but added he would not be asking for the waiver if he did not believe the “moment” in history called for it.



He then criticized President Donald Trump for putting the “civilian military dynamic” under “great stress in the past four years” and argued Austin would work “tirelessly” to get it back on track — but then went back to praising Austin’s service on the battlefield.



I have personally worked with this man. I’ve seen him lead American fighting forces on the field of battle. I’ve also watched him faithfully carry out the orders of the civilian leadership of this nation. There’s no doubt in my mind not any doubt whatsoever whether this nominee will honor and respect and on a day to day basis breathe life into the preeminent principle of civilian leadership over military matters in our nation.



Biden also called Austin “General” no fewer than 12 times — something Democrats had criticized Trump for doing with Mattis and others.



In addition, Biden used military cliches when describing Austin, including as “cool under fire” and a “soldier’s leader.” He thanked Austin’s family for “once again” sharing him with the country.



Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who also spoke at the live-stream event, also called Austin “General” three times and praised him as “a seasoned, highly decorated, and trailblazing commander.” She said with this nomination, Austin would “continue his service.”



Biden, Austin, and Harris did not take questions, even as some journalists shouted out questions about the waiver.



Biden’s decision to choose a retired general was despite the 2020 Democratic Party platform vowing to end the Trump’s “distortion of civilian and military roles in decision-making.”



“We will reinstate national security policymaking processes that advance competent civilian control,” the platform said.



It is the hypocrisy of Biden’s pick that has an increasing number of Democrats wary.



Already, four Senate Democrats have indicated they will vote against a waiver, according to Axios.



Sens. Tammy Duckworth (IL), Elizabeth Warren (MA), Richard Blumenthal (CT), and Jon Tester (MT) have said they oppose a waiver for Austin.



Several other senators stopped short of opposing the waiver, but indicated they are uncomfortable with supporting one.

Sen. Jack Reed (RI), the top Democrat on the influential Senate Armed Services Committee, said, “the preference would be for someone who is not recently retired.”



Sen. Tim Kaine (VA), another Democrat member of the committee said he had “great respect for General Austin’s leadership of CENTCOM and his deep experience with military operations,” but plans to “to closely evaluate the implications for waiving the National Security Act requirement twice in just four years.”



With four Democrat senators already opposing a waiver for Austin, even if Democrats win both Senate seats in Georgia for a 50-50 Democrat-Republican split in the Senate, Biden would need help from at least four Republican senators to pass a waiver to allow Austin to serve.



The picture is even worse if Democrats lose in Georgia. Biden would need at least six Republican senators to support a waiver for Austin.



Biden’s team has already begun outreach to Republican senators, but with the results of the election not yet official and Republicans eager to flex their muscles against Biden picks, Republican support could be difficult to come by, particularly given the partisanship from Democrats during the Trump administration.



Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), an Army veteran and a close Trump administration ally, tweeted out Tuesday his concern with Austin’s lack of experience in the Asia Pacific.



He tweeted out Biden’s op-ed in the _Atlantic_ explaining why he had chosen Austin and highlighted that mention of China — the nation’s top national security threat — was nowhere to be found.

For his part, Austin — who would be the first black defense secretary if confirmed — vowed to come to the role as a “civilian leader.”



“I come to this role this new role as a civilian leader, with military experience to be sure, but also with a deep appreciation and reverence for the prevailing wisdom of civilian control of our military,” he said.



“I recognize that being a member of the president’s cabinet requires a different perspective and unique responsibilities from a career in uniform. And I intend to keep this at the forefront of my mind. And I look forward to surrounding myself with experience capable civilian appointees and career civil servants to enable healthy civil military relations grounded in meaningful civilian oversight,” he said.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened a veto of the defense bill if it did not include legislation to end Section 230 protections for tech companies.



“Our Country can never be safe and secure if we allow it to stand,” Trump wrote on Twitter about Section 230, describing the provision as a “serious threat to our national security and election integrity.”



Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act grants broad legal protections to social media companies regarding content posted by users.



Trump wrote that “if the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk.”



Section 230 allows social media companies as platforms that are not held legally responsible for content posted on their websites rather than publishers. But in recent years, platforms like Facebook and Twitter only exponentially increased decisions of censorship and removal of users from their service, calling their neutrality into question.



“Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to ‘Big Tech’ (the only companies in America that have it – corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity,” Trump wrote. “Our Country can never be safe and secure if we allow it to stand.”



Lawmakers of both parties support reigning in Big Tech with changes to Section 230, but many have stopped short of calling for an outright ban of the provision.

(UPI) — Legislation was introduced in the U.S. House which essentially guarantees Israel’s qualitative military edge over Middle East countries.



The bill, led by Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., calls for a commitment to Israel’s qualitative military edge, a legislated U.S. pledge to Israel under the Arms Export Control Act.



“This bill strengthens that commitment and reminds the administration of its obligations under the law,” Schneider said in a statement.



Introduced Friday, the legislation comes after Israeli concerns that President Donald Trump‘s administration plans to sell F-35 fighter planes to the United Arab Emirates.



Israel is currently the only Middle East country with the advanced fighter planes, and the UAE purchase could destabilize a balance of power, members of Congress have warned.



“With all due respect, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if Israel’s the only country in the Middle East that has F-35s, that selling it to someone else no longer produces that qualitative military edge in the air,” Sen. Bob Menendez, R-N.J., said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Sept. 24.



Schneider was joined in submitting the House bill on Friday by two Republicans and 13 Democrats, which seeks to reaffirm the role of congressional consultation regarding Israel’s qualitative military edge, a practice employed since the 1960s, in U.S. sale of arms, they said.



The bill would require the White House to report to Congress on how any arms sale would impact Israel within 60 days.



While not providing Israel with blanket veto power over U.S. sales, “Israel is our single most important ally in the Middle East, and Congress will not let any President undermine her security with unapproved weapons sales,” Schneider said.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, on Wednesday touted President Donald Trump’s foreign policy accomplishments, including the rebuilding of the U.S. military after nearly a decade of decline under the Obama administration.



Kellogg said in an address during the Republican National Convention that Trump, in his three-and-a-half years, has “reversed the decline of our military and restructured our national security strategy.”



“With historic investment and vision, our military is now better equipped, better resourced, and better manned than any military in the world,” he added.



The U.S. military’s readiness declined dramatically during the Obama administration as deep defense cuts of $1 trillion kicked in. Congress worked to prevent the cuts from being fully implemented, but the Pentagon still took a deep hit and military readiness suffered dramatically.



Kellogg said he has witnessed leadership under Trump, drawing upon his own service:



In 1967, at the age of 22, I volunteered to serve my country in Vietnam. From the jungles of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, I have gone where my nation asked. I have borne witness to soldiers’ last moments on earth, their lives spent in the hope and promise of a better future for all Americans.



He also recalled serving in the Pentagon when it was attacked on September 11, 2001:



I lost friends there that day. In the years that followed, I watched my daughter, son, and son-in-law deploy to Afghanistan. I have looked into the eyes of my grandchildren as they said goodbye to their fathers and hugged them one last time.



“I lived service. I understand sacrifice. I know leadership,” he said.



He said he has witnessed every major foreign policy and national security decision by Trump.



“I have been in the room where it happened. I saw only one agenda and one guiding question when tough calls had to be made … ‘is this decision right for America?'” he said.



He said before Trump took office, decades of “failed foreign policy had crippled us.”



He cited “wars without end in sight, creation of failed states like Libya and Syria, a past that allowed a terrorist caliphate to grow, and leadership in Washington that allowed our military to atrophy while we spent trillions of dollars abroad instead of investing at home.”



He said Trump “demolished the terrorist ISIS Caliphate in the Middle East and eliminated its leader, al-Baghdadi, one of the world’s most brutal murderers.”



Kellogg also said Trump took decisive action by ordering a U.S. strike against Iranian terrorist mastermind Qasim Soleimani — a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American servicemen in Iraq.



He said that Trump has succeeded in getting NATO allies to invest more in Europe’s defense.



“When our NATO allies failed to meet their commitments as we upheld ours, President Trump demanded parity. NATO members have now increased their contributions over $100 billion this year, and NATO’s Secretary-General credits President Donald J. Trump,” he said.



“President Trump challenged, and continues to challenge, an increasingly provocative and militant China,” he said.



But, he added, Trump “is no hawk.”



“He wisely wields the sword when required, but believes in seeking peace instead of perpetual conflict,” he said.



Kellogg pointed out the peace agreement Trump brokered between the United Arab Emirates and Israel — “the first in the Middle East in over 25 years.”



This week, he said, Afghan negotiators — with help from American officials — will start peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government to end America’s longest war.



He urged Americans to look at Trump’s record:



Ask yourself, has this President kept his promises to keep us out of needless conflicts and to pursue ending wars without end? Has he defended your interests in renegotiating trade deals that previously hurt Americans and our national security? Has he fulfilled his Commander in Chief role by decisively going after our Nation’s enemies?



You and I know, the answer is yes. The choice is clear. This is the most important election of our lifetimes. The next four years will decide the course of our country for decades to come. I am asking you to stand up and be counted, so we never have to look back and recall what it was once like in America when men and women were free, our families were secure — and we had a president who served the people.

China expects to increase its defense budget for 2020 citing increased “defense threats from Western countries led by the U.S.” according to a report by the state-run _Global Times_ on Tuesday.



The 2020 draft defense budget is expected to be released this Friday when the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature, convenes in Beijing. According to the article, which cites Chinese military “experts,” the budget could increase by up to six percent to 1.25 trillion yuan (about $1.77 billion).



The report claimed that the “COVID-19 [Wuhan coronavirus] pandemic has raised additional national defense demands” due to increased military threats from Western countries, especially the U.S. “Since the start of 2020, the U.S. has been frequently sending warships and warplanes into the South China Sea,” the article says.



The article fails to explain that the U.S. has been forced to increase its military presence in the South China Sea as a direct response to Chinese-initiated provocations in the region. The U.S. military, along with other Western countries like Australia, has deployed warships and fighter jets to operate near southeast Asian countries bordering the sea in a show of support after they were bullied by the Chinese military in recent weeks.



In April, the U.S. and Australia supported Malaysia by deploying warships to its waters after a Chinese fleet followed a Malaysian drillship for an entire month trying to thwart its oil exploration activities, which it eventually did. Beijing illegally claims to have sovereign rights over the waters and natural resources explored by Malaysia within its own exclusive economic zone.



China “needs to continue expanding its naval arsenal and conduct frequent patrols and exercises in related waters to safeguard territorial integrity and national sovereignty,” said one Chinese military expert interviewed for the report. Beijing’s claims to “sovereignty” over “related waters” such as the South China Sea have no legal standing and were dismissed by an international court ruling in 2016. China claims practically the entire sea, forging ahead despite the ruling to establish a significant military presence in the waters. This presence has increased sharply in recent years and especially in recent months with the world distracted by the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.



The _Global Times_ article cites an April report on world military expenditures in 2019 released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in an effort to demonstrate that the U.S. spends significantly more on its defense budget than China: “According to [the SIPRI] report, the U.S. drives global military expenditure growth, spending a whopping $732 billion in 2019. By comparison, China only spent $261 billion. The number for China in the report is higher than China’s official figure.”



Although the article’s authors fail to explain why they would cite a military expenditures report they allege to be inaccurate in terms of their own country’s defense budget, the admission that China’s actual military budget differs from that officially reported seems most significant.



According to a March report by national security news site Defense One, the discrepancies between the military budget released by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its true figures have long been established, a byproduct of a military run by the Communist party, in which aspects of the military pervade political and economic life.



Further complicating accurate comparisons are the unique characteristics of China’s party-run military, such as military-civil fusion, usage of state-owned enterprise, theft of intellectual property, and the embedding of party organizations in private companies. Some of these elements, even if known, are simply unquantifiable.”



According to the article’s author – a military defense budgeting analyst – the best way to discern an accurate defense budget from the CCP’s intentionally obscure figures is to “remove all military R&D [research and development] from the calculations,” as China fails to account for R&D in all military expenditures released to the public.



“[T]he [Communist] party-government omits and withholds data to project a non-threatening image of its People’s Liberation Army [PLA],” the article explained.



China alludes to this hidden military development in its Tuesday report, claiming that “[a]n expanding defense budget would also give more funding to China’s military research and development [R&D], which is actually boosting domestic demand at a time when exports are being hit by the [Wuhan coronavirus] pandemic.”



According to the April 2020 SIPRI report, China remains “the world’s second-largest military spender” and “is estimated to have allocated $261 billion to the military in 2019—equivalent to 14 percent of global military expenditure. Its military spending in 2019 was 5.1 percent higher than in 2018 and 85 percent higher than in 2010.”



Defense One’s March report calculated that China’s military budget is “about 87 percent of America’s” after accounting for the CCP’s manipulation of publicly-released data.

President Donald Trump signed into law a defense bill on Friday that ushered in significant reforms for military families.



The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which authorized $738 billion in defense spending for the current fiscal year, contains the largest pay raise for members of the military in a decade, at 3.1 percent.



“As we head into Christmas, I am proud to report that we are giving every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine a well-earned pay raise. In January, each of you will see the largest increase that you have had in such a long time,” Trump said Friday before signing the bill.



The bill also doubled the reimbursement amount for state licensure expenses incurred by military spouses as they move from duty station to duty station in the U.S.



It also eliminated the so-called “widow’s tax,” which blocked certain benefits for families of the fallen.



The “widow’s tax” allowed widows to qualify for survivor benefits from only one program even if they qualified for several different programs under the Department of the Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. For every dollar received under that one program, a dollar would be taken away from money received under the other programs.



“The tax is gone,” Trump said. “That was very important to us. The ‘widow’s tax’ is gone.”



The bill also tackles the military housing crisis, which has seen thousands of military families sickened and displaced from their military base homes due to mold, lead, pests, or other dangerous conditions.



The bill creates a tenant’s bill of rights for service members and their families **,** bans private housing contractors from imposing nondisclosure agreements, and standardizes assessments to monitor health hazards, among other requirements.



The bill also allows members of the military for the first time to file claims against the Pentagon for medical malpractice, inspired by the case of Green Beret Richard Stayskal, who currently has Stage 4 lung cancer after a military doctor misdiagnosed him years ago.



Although the bill does not repeal the Feres doctrine preventing service members from suing the military, it authorizes the Secretary of Defense to allow, settle, and pay an administrative claim against the United States for personal injury or death of a service member as the result of medical malpractice caused by a Department of Defense health care provider.



The bill also authorizes 12 weeks of paid parental leave for federal civilian employees after the birth or adoption of a child, a top priority of first daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump, who was present at the bill’s signing on Friday.



“After years of unrealized promises by other politicians, I honor my commitment today as I sign paid parental leave for the federal civilian workforce. That’s paid, into law,” Trump said.



“That’s a very big thing: paid parental leave. Another thing that they’ve been trying to get for many years.”

Joe Biden attempted to paint himself as an expert on foreign policy at the fourth Democrat presidential primary debate on Tuesday, despite his decades-long history of “judging the [international] situation incorrectly.”



“We have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection,” Biden said, proceeding to attack President Donald Trump for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria.



Biden said:



It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy. The fact of the matter is [that] I have never seen [such] a time and I’ve spent thousands of hour in the situation, I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places in Syria.



Despite Biden’s tough rhetoric and his positioning as an expert on international matters, the former vice president has long been castigated by members of the military and national security officials over his foreign policy credentials. In particular, Biden has faced consternation for supporting the Iran Nuclear Agreement, proposing a controversial agenda for partitioning Iraq, and downplaying the threat posed by China.



Some of the former vice president’s biggest critics have been Defense Secretaries Robert Gates and James Mattis, two men beloved by the international affairs experts.



Gates, who led the Pentagon under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, asserted during a May interview with CBS’s _Face the Nation_ he stood by statements made in his 2014 memoir that Biden had “been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” The show’s host, Margaret Brennan, looped Gates’ prior comments into a broader question about whether Biden had the ability to “be an effective commander-in-chief.”



“I don’t know, I don’t know,” Gates said. “I stand by that statement. He and I agreed on some key issues in the Obama administration, we disagreed significantly on Afghanistan and some other issues.”



“I think that the vice president has some issues with the military, so how he would get along with the senior military and what that relationship would be,” Gates continued. “I just think it would depend on the personalities at the time.”



Mattis, a former general who served as Trump’s first defense secretary, echoed a similar sentiment in his newly released book.



Biden “exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly,” Mattis wrote when discussing the former vice president’s strategy for the Iraq War.

The Senate Finance Committee is probing the Obama administration’s 2015 decision to approve the sale of a U.S. company with insight into “military applications” to the Chinese government and an investment firm run by former Vice President Joe Biden’s youngest son, Hunter Biden.



Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the committee’s chairman, sent a letter to the Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Thursday requesting documents relating to the sale of Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company, to Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). The latter was formed in 2013 by a merger between a subsidiary of the Bank of China and Rosemont Seneca, a firm started by Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry.



Since AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges, the producer of “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with military application, the deal required approval from the Obama administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The panel — made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies, including the departments of State, Treasury, and Defense — is required to review any transaction that could lead to a foreign person gaining control of an American business.



In question is whether CIFUS was influenced by Obama administration officials, most notedly Joe Biden and John Kerry, who had an interest in seeing the deal move forward.



“The direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,” Grassley wrote.



The senator noted in his letter that AVIC’s bid for Henniges should have immediately set off alarm bells in the Obama White House. In 2007, AVIC “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.”



Even more troubling, however, is that bid was facilitated at the same time China was staking out a more adversarial role in global affairs. At the time, Beijing was suspected of undermining U.S. cybersecurity by underwriting hackers stealing governmental data. There was also simmering tension over disputes in the South China Sea.



Despite the threat to national security, the $600 million deal was approved by CIFUS, with AVIC purchasing 51 percent of the company and BHR taking ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”



In his letter to Mnuchin, Grassley compared the deal to the Uranium One scandal, which arose when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton approved the sale of a Canadian mining company to Rosatom, the state-owned Russian nuclear energy conglomerate. It later emerged that both investors in the company and Russian energy officials had donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation.



“As with the Uranium One transaction, there is cause for concern that potential conflicts of interest could have influenced CFIUS’ approval of the Henniges transaction,” Grassley wrote. “Accordingly, Congress and the public must fully understand the decision-making process that led to the Henniges approval and the extent to which CFIUS fully considered the transaction’s national security risks.”



This is not the first time that Hunter Biden’s ties to China have caused grief for his father’s political career. As Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book _Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends_, Hunter Biden signed the $1.5 billion deal creating BHR in 2013 only ten days after visiting China aboard Air Force Two with his father.

 **TEL AVIV – After the U.S. announced last month that it wouldnot sell Turkey F-35s due to Ankara’s procurement of the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system, Turkish authorities are now considering buying Russian Su-35 fighter jets, a Turkish daily reported Sunday.**



According to _Yeni Safak_ , the country’s Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB), Turkish Air Force Command and other relevant authorities have been asked to investigate the possibility of purchasing the Russian jets.



Turkish officials have yet to comment on the report.



According to Russian news site Sputnik, Russia’s state-controlled arms agency Rosoboronexport offered to sell Su-35 fighters to Ankara.



The U.S. stopped Turkey’s F-35 program due to the belief that the country’s purchase of the Russian missile defense system risks the security of NATO members and constitutes a clear violation of a 2017 law threatening sanctions for any purchase of sophisticated Russian technology — the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017.



The White House at the time said, “The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities.”



Russia’s S-400 is considered one of the most advanced air-defense systems in the world.



At the time of the purchase, President Donald Trump blamed the Obama administration for never reaching a deal to sell a comparable American missile defense system to Turkey.



“Because they have a system of missiles that’s made in Russia, they’re now prohibited from buying over 100 planes,” Trump said of Turkey during a Cabinet meeting. “I would say that (F-35 manufacturer) Lockheed isn’t exactly happy. That’s a lot of jobs. And frankly I’ve always had a very good relationship” with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.



Trump said the decision to ban F-35 sales was one he was making reluctantly, as the F-35 is the world’s largest defense program and has already generated $12.9 billion worth of orders.



“We are now telling Turkey that because you have really been forced to buy another missile system, we’re not going to sell you the F-35 fighter jets,” the president said. “It’s a very tough situation that they’re in and it’s a very tough situation that we’ve been placed in, the United States. With all of that being said, we’re working through it, we’ll see what happens. But it’s not really fair.”



“Because of the fact he bought a Russian missile, we’re not allowed to sell him billions of dollars worth of aircraft. It’s not a fair situation,” Trump added.



Speaking to Turkish ambassadors in Ankara last week, Erdogan slammed the U.S.’s accusation that the purchase of the S-400s put Turkey’s commitment to NATO into question.



“There is no concrete evidence showing the S-400s will harm the F-35s or NATO, nobody should deceive each other. Many NATO member states have purchased from Russia. We don’t see this being turned into a crisis,” Erdogan said, according to Reuters.

NEW YORK — James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for Barack Obama, has been making the rounds in the news media downplaying the prospect of President Donald Trump achieving a breakthrough in nuclear talks with North Korea.



Clapper left out how in his own recently published book, he admitted the Obama administration’s military campaign that brought about the downfall of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi likely served as a lesson for Iran and North Korea not to give up their own nuclear programs. Gaddafi in 2003 voluntarily agreed to give up his decades-old nuclear weapons program and opened the country to nuclear inspectors.



“I personally don’t believe the North Koreans have long term any intent to denuclearize,” Clapper said on CNN when asked about Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong-un. “Why should they? It’s their ticket to survival, and they’re just not going to do that.”



Clapper made similar remarks to NPR, lecturing: “Demanding that the North Koreans give up what they consider is fundamental to their national survival has not proven real profitable, if you will, for this administration or previous administrations. So perhaps another approach might be in order.”



In his book, _Facts and Fears: Hard Truths from a Life in Intelligence_ , Clapper explains the Obama administration’s actions to depose Gaddafi as part of the so-called Arab Spring and despite the Libyan strongman’s disarmament may have hardened the positions of Iran and North Korea, making those countries less likely to agree to nuclear disarmament.



Clapper wrote (emphasis added):



As someone whose fingerprints were on the faulty National Intelligence Estimate that led the United States to invade Iraq, I certainly knew we were fallible, and as someone who’d helped fight the forces of chaos unleashed after we’d removed Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi from power, I was well aware that the actions we took from initial good intentions could have horrific unintended consequences.



…



Nine days after the hearing, with a UN resolution in hand, the US military began taking out Libyan air defenses, first with cruise missiles, and then with escorted bombing runs. With help from the British, French, and Canadian air forces, and drawing on targets identified by multinational intelligence efforts, the US military established a safe no-fly zone in four days and turned the mission over to NATO control. Gaddafi pleaded for the United States and then NATO to stop the attacks, citing his cooperation with weapons inspectors, his voluntary disarmament of his nuclear program, and his restraint from using chemical weapons in his current civil struggle. It was far too late, and no one in the West paid attention. **However, I believe North Korea and Iran took careful note of what happens when you give up your nuclear program, and Bashar al-Assad in Syria saw what happens to dictators who show restraint.**

 **TEL AVIV – At least 16 people were killed, including six civilians — one of whom was an infant — and 21 others wounded during an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iranian targets in Syria, Syrian sources reported on Monday.**



It was not immediately clear if they were killed by the strikes themselves or by Syrian anti-aircraft fire, war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. It added that several Hezbollah fighters and other Iranian-backed foreign forces were also killed in the strikes, which occurred near Homs and Damascus.



Among the targets were a headquarters for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces, a research center near Homs, an airbase, a Hezbollah arms depot near the border with Lebanon, and a scientific research center in Jamraya that doubled as a weapons warehouse.



It was the third time Israeli airstrikes reportedly hit the facility, with strikes reported in 2013 and most recently in February 2018.



“A military source said that the army air defenses confronted hostile missiles launched by Israeli warplanes at midnight from Lebanese airspace towards some of our military sites in Homs and the surroundings of Damascus,” the state-run SANA news agency reported.



The report said Syria’s air defense had intercepted several missiles.



In keeping with its policy of silence surrounding strikes in Syria, Israel did not comment on the attacks, which were said to be the most widespread yet.



The al-Mezzeh airbase, which houses the air force intelligence service and its prison, was also targeted in the strikes, local media reported.



A Syrian anti-aircraft missile also crashed north of Nicosia in northern Cyprus, causing a large fire.



The strikes came hours after an Israeli satellite company released images it said showed that Syria’s S-300 air defense system was fully operational.

The strikes have raised doubts as to the effectiveness of the Russian-made S-300.



Israel has in the past warned that it would destroy the S-300 system if it is used against its warplanes.

(Reuters) – Israeli warplanes fired missiles targeting Syrian military positions in Homs and the Damascus outskirts in an attack that killed at least four civilians and wounded another 21, Syrian state media said.



The Syrian military said Syrian air defences had confronted the attack, which was launched from Lebanese airspace.



An Israeli military spokeswoman, asked about the report, said: “We don’t comment on such reports.”



…



State news agency SANA said an additional 21 people had been wounded. SANA also reported that Syrian air defences had brought down a number of the missiles.

 **TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday inaugurated a new town in the Golan Heights named after President Donald Trump in recognition of his formal recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the strategic plateau.**



The town, which has yet to be built, was named Ramat Trump, Hebrew for Trump Heights.



“This is a historic day,” Netanyahu said. “We are about to approve construction of a new town in the Golan, something that hasn’t happened in quite a long time … and we’ll be honoring a great friend of Israel, President Donald Trump, who recently recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, the first foreign leader to do so.”



Earlier on Sunday, the cabinet held its weekly meeting in the Golan town of Kela Alon to formally approve the new community named for Trump.



Joining Netanyahu at the cabinet meeting and the subsequent naming ceremony, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman thanked Netanyahu for the “extraordinary gesture.”



“It is well-deserved, but much appreciated. We look forward to working with you and with the Government of Israel to continue to strengthen the unbreakable alliance between the United States and Israel.”



Later, Friedman lauded Trump as an Israeli hero.



“We all checked the history book … it almost never happens anywhere in the world that an entire community is dedicated in the name of a sitting president,” he said.



“President Trump will be honored to be in that small cadre of Israeli heroes,” he added.



“My only regret is that neither the president nor I are in the real estate business any more, because if we were, I’m sure this would be high on our list for places that we would think about developing.”



Trump’s March decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights came in the wake of what he said were “aggressive acts by Iran and terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, in southern Syria [that made] the Golan Heights a potential launching ground for attacks on Israel.”



In April, Netanyahu vowed to name a community in his honor.



“All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” Netanyahu said at the time.



“I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.”



However, Sunday’s inauguration was slammed by critics as little more than a publicity stunt.



“What does a successful PR campaign look like? Exactly like this,” Blue and White MK Zvi Hauser said.



“Anyone who reads the fine print in this ‘historic decision’ will understand that it is nothing more than a non-binding fake policy. There is no budgeting, no planning, no location for settlement, and there is not really a binding decision to implement the project. But the main thing was that they insisted on deciding on a name for the dummy community,” he added.

NEW YORK — Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe lent some credibility to a previous White House claim that some FBI personnel were upset over the agency’s decision, under the leadership of disgraced ex-FBI Director James Comey, not to charge Hillary Clinton in the criminal probe of her private email server use.



The claim that some FBI rank-and-file workers lost confidence in Comey following his infamous press conference announcing that no charges would be brought has been in dispute.



Yet in largely unreported testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on December 21, 2017, McCabe confirmed that some FBI personnel were “surprised” and “frustrated” with the result of the Clinton email case as announced by Comey. A transcript of McCabe’s testimony was released three weeks ago by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga.



On July 5, 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign, Comey held a notorious press conference during which he bypassed Justice Department tradition by unilaterally declaring that “no charges are appropriate” in the case of Clinton’s private email server. It is not the role of the FBI to make such pronouncements.



In his testimony, McCabe clarified that he was “not aware” of sentiments expressing disappointment or surprise from within the small unit that specifically investigated Clinton’s email case. But he stated several times that there was negative sentiment about Comey’s decision within the larger FBI.



“I am not aware of those sentiments within the team,” MCcCabe said. “But I am aware that the outcome of the case was surprising, and maybe frustrating to many people, including some of the people who work for the FBI.”



Asked what those FBI employees were surprised about, McCabe replied, “I think, like many people around the country, they were surprised by the result in the case and the fact that we were not recommending pursuing charges.”



“When I say surprise,” he added, “I’m talking about people who heard the Director’s statement on July 5 and were frustrated with that result, not people who were engaged in the investigation or the prosecutors across the street at the Department of Justice.”



McCabe was asked to respond to a November 2016 statement from Trump confidante Rudy Giuliani that he had heard from other former FBI agents “there’s a revolution going on” inside the agency over the decision not to charge Clinton.



“I am not aware of a revolution,” McCabe replied before going on to once again concede that some FBI agents were indeed surprised and possibly frustrated.



“As I said, there was certainly FBI personnel who were surprised and maybe frustrated by that result,” McCabe continued. “Director Comey spent a lot of time, in the months following his announcement, you know, in visits to field offices and interactions with retired agents’ groups, and things like that, answering a lot of questions about why we had done what we had done.”



The White House official who took the most flack for saying that FBI agents were upset over the case was undoubtedly White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who made a statement to that effect to reporters on May 10, 2017.



“Most importantly, the rank-and-file of the FBI had lost confidence in Comey,” she said, discussing Comey’s loss of credibility. “We’ve heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.”



According to the final report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, Sanders walked back some of those statements.



Reads the report: “Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from ‘countless members of the FBI’ was a ‘slip of the tongue.’”



“She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made ‘in the heat of the moment’ that was not founded on anything,” the report continued.



After the release of Mueller’s report, Sanders went on Fox News where she maintained that the claim about disgruntled FBI agents over the Clinton email case was “not untrue.”



“I acknowledge that I had a slip of the tongue when I used the word ‘countless,’ but it’s not untrue,” she said, explaining that she meant to convey that “a number of both current and former FBI agents agreed with the president. James Comey was a disgraced leaker who tried to politicize and undermine the very agency he was supposed to run.”



In the wake of the Mueller report’s release, CNN political analyst April Ryan went so far as to call for Sanders to be fired over her statements about FBI agents.



“Not only does she not have any credibility left, she lied,” Ryan claimed. “She outright lied and the people, the American people, can’t trust her. They can’t trust what’s said from the president’s mouthpiece, spokesperson, from the people’s house.”



“Therefore, she should be let go; she should be fired; end of story,” Ryan stated. “When there is a lack of credibility there, you have to start … lopping the heads off. It’s ‘Fire me Thursday’ or ‘Fire me, Good Friday.’ She needs to go.”



In October 2016, the Daily Caller reported that some FBI agents were frustrated with Comey’s leadership following the Clinton email probe conclusion.



“This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,” one FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases was quoted as saying in a transcript obtained by the Daily Caller. “We talk about it in the office and don’t know how Comey can keep going.”

President Donald Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda are holding a joint press conference in the White House Rose Garden Wednesday.



The two leaders held a midday bilateral meeting before an expanded working lunch and a joint signing ceremony. The two are then schedule for a joint press conference at 2:15pm.



A senior administration official previewed the visit on Tuesday with word that discussions will involve a high-level delegation and center primarily around matters of security. The goal is to deepen security partnership between the two nations in line with NATO goals and planning. The official emphasized that this falls in line with a pattern of meetings at a high-level with Central European leaders.



Poland was identified in Tuesday’s briefing as key as the nation has demonstrated a commitment to bearing the burden of their own security in the region, particularly meeting their two percent NATO defense spending goal.



The senior official described the meeting as historic, 80 years after the beginning of WWII, 30 years after communist rule in Poland, and 20 years since the nation joined NATO.



Another senior administration official added that the meetings will also highlight expanded trade relationships, energy partnerships, people-to-people contacts, and cultural relations.



Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan hosted his counterpart from Poland Tuesday at the Pentagon, according to one of the officials.

“Aerial defenses detected hostile targets coming from the direction of Quneitra and dealt with them,” the official SANA news agency quoted a military source saying, referring to a Syrian town in the Golan Heights bordering Israel.

The Obama-era FISA warrant obtained to monitor the communications of Carter Page was most likely utilized as a gateway to spy on the rest of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, contended William Binney, a former highly placed NSA official turned whistleblower.



The same warrant against Page technically could also have been used to legally justify collecting data on the Republican National Committee (RNC) or the leadership of the Republican Party, Binney said.



Binney was an architect of the NSA’s surveillance program. He became a famed whistleblower when he resigned on October 31, 2001 after spending more than 30 years with the agency.



He was speaking during an interview that aired Sunday on this reporter’s weekend talk radio show, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.



Binney referred to measures put into place by President Obama in January 2014 that restrict the NSA to collecting data on individuals that are only two steps removed from a target being monitored. He explained that if Page had called anyone from the Trump campaign or the RNC, the NSA could legally have spied not only on that second individual but on others called by the second person.



Stated Binney: “If you get a warrant on say Carter Page and for example he has a call or an email to the Republican National Committee or anybody in the Trump campaign, that warrant then allows them to go out two degrees from the RNC to everybody associated with the RNC and from anyone from the Trump campaign to anyone they are associated with.”



“So effectively what that means is that they had the ability to basically spy on anybody,” he said. “They could spy on everybody on the Republican National Committee or everybody in the Trump campaign.”



“Not only could they collect all the data on that second person but all of the data content as well as metadata on anybody that he talks to,” Binney added.



Contrary to Binney’s characterization that “data content” could be collected, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders do not allow the NSA to collect the contents of communications. Instead, the NSA receives so-called call record details, or CDRs, which contain information such as the date, time, and duration of calls but do not include the content of any calls.



Additionally, such warrants do not allow the collection of data on “anybody” called by the target. Numerous restrictions are placed on the NSA in accordance with applicable guidelines.



In late October 2016, then-FBI director James Comey signed the first of three successful FISA applications to obtain warrants to spy on Page, the American financial consultant who was tangentially associated with the campaign as an adviser. The second and third were renewal applications since a FISA warrant must be renewed every 90 days.



All three applications reportedly cited as key evidence against Page the largely-discredited dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm.



According to Republican House characterizations, the FISA applications signed by Comey withheld key information raising questions about the dossier, including that it was financed by Clinton and the DNC and had known credibility issues.



Binney argued that the warrant on Page was likely used to “legitimize” and “justify” spying on the entire Trump campaign. “That’s why they want to hide the FISA request and all of the justification and affidavits that they filed to obtain it.”

After special counsel Robert S. Mueller’s final report found no collusion between Donald Trump or his 2016 campaign and Russia, the editorial board of the _Washington Post_ spun a new conspiracy – Trump’s “deference” to Russian President Vladimir Putin could be “repayment for the Kremlin’s help during the presidential race.”



The _Post_ did not specify to which “deference” it was referring. Trump has taken a hardline approach toward Russia, rejecting its annexation of Crimea, sanctioning Russian entities and checking Russian influence in Syria among many other actions.



The newspaper’s editorial board also stated as fact that Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to assist Trump in the presidential race when there was no consensus conclusion reached on that assessment by the U.S. intelligence community and serious questions have been raised about the unsubstantiated claim.



Shortly after the release of Attorney General William P. Barr’s summary of Mueller’s main conclusions on Sunday, the _Washington Post_ published an editorial board piece titled, “Trump did not collude with Russia. But he’s wrong to say Mueller exonerated him.”



In the editorial, the _Post_ allowed that Mueller’s conclusion of no collusion, as per Barr’s summary, “should be a relief to Americans worried that the nation’s senior leaders acted as agents of a foreign power during the 2016 election.”



The bizarre editorial, however, went on to advocate the conspiracy that Trump was allegedly deferring to Putin, and doing so to perhaps repay the Russian strongman for alleged help in the 2016 presidential race:



On the other hand, Mr. Trump’s bizarre refusal to acknowledge the Russian interference, and his unceasing assaults on Mr. Mueller’s investigation, are all the more confounding. It is still not out of the question that Mr. Trump’s disturbing deference to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin is repayment for the Kremlin’s help during the presidential race. But it seems more likely that Mr. Trump is simply a Russian apologist. That is not comforting.



The January 6, 2017, U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) report by three intelligence agencies assessed the conclusion that Putin favored Trump and worked to get him elected only with a classification of “moderate confidence,” while the FBI and CIA gave it a “high confidence” rating.



The narrative of Russia seeking to get Trump elected was also partially challenged by the book of James Clapper, who served as director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration. It was Clapper’s agency that released the Intelligence Community report.



And an extensive Republican House Intelligence Committee report charged that the IC’s findings on the matter were colored by politics. The Republican House Intelligence Committee’s 250-page report on alleged Russian collusion found that the IC assessment of Putin’s strategic intentions for allegedly interfering in the U.S. election to aid Trump “did not employ proper analytic tradecraft” and contained “significant intelligence tradecraft failings that undermine confidence” in the judgments, including the failure to “be independent of political considerations.”



As Breitbart News reported, Clapper’s own book describes numerous shifts in Russia’s alleged attitude toward Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.



At first, Clapper writes that Russia simply opposed Hillary Clinton and didn’t favor one Republican presidential candidate. After Trump seemed initially poised to possibly win, Clapper relates an alleged Russian propaganda effort to aid Trump’s victory in order to defeat Clinton. Toward the final stretch of the presidential campaign, with Trump’s poll numbers falling, Clapper wrote that Russia shifted its position away from purportedly aiding Trump and focused mainly on opposing Clinton, even allegedly providing Green Party candidate Jill Stein with more favorable coverage.

TEL AVIV — On Thursday, President Donald Trump proclaimed that the time has come for America to “fully recognize” Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The announcement marked a monumental shift in U.S. policy that could help ensure Israel’s security into the future.



According to reports, Trump is expected to enshrine this position in an official declaration recognizing Israeli control over the Golan as soon this coming week during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s scheduled visit to Washington.



Below, in no particular order, are five major reasons Trump’s decision on the Golan Heights is the correct one.



 **1 – Maintaining the Golan Heights is essential for protecting Israeli security. Relinquishing the territory – used three times to mount ground invasions into Israel — would precipitate an existential threat to the Jewish state.**



The Golan Heights is strategic, mountainous territory that looks down on Israel’s main population centers. It was thrice used by Syria to mount ground invasions into the Jewish state – in 1948; during the 1967 Six-Day War; and again during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.



Israel captured the Israeli sections of the Golan Heights from Syria as a result of the unprovoked Six-Dar War and essentially annexed the territory in 1981 by applying Israeli law there. Syria temporarily overran sections of the Golan Heights in the 1973 war but they were ultimately repulsed in what amounted to a failed attempt to destroy Israel.



As Yoram Ettinger, a former Israeli attaché to Washington, correctly notes at Israel’s Ariel Center for Policy Research:



The importance of the Golan Heights to Israel’s national security hinges on the eastern mountain ridge, stretching between Mount Hermon in the north and the steep canyon of the Rokad River in the south, which constitutes a most effective natural tank barrier. The control of this mountain ridge enabled 177 Israeli tanks to fend off the surprise offensive of 1,400 Syrian tanks during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A withdrawal from that natural tank barrier would deny Israel the key strategic benefit of the Golan Heights, exposing the Jewish state to lethal threats. A withdrawal from that mountain ridge, which is located 35 miles from Damascus, would deprive Israel of a most effective posture of deterrence, which would induce further hostilities in the region.



The Coalition for the Israeli Golan documents:



The State of Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria after years of incessant attacks on Israeli communities surrounding the Sea of Galilee and close to the border. The Golan Heights, being a strategic control point, was, for years, a region frequently used by the Syrians to threaten the State of Israel and its strategically important sites, such as the Haifa Port.



…Furthermore, during the 20 years of Syria’s control over the Golan, and as a country that supports terror, Syria allowed terrorist organizations to use the topographical advantage of the Golan Heights as a base for exporting and launching terrorist attacks against Israel. Israel’s seizure of the Golan Heights was done in self-defense, to ensure the security of the State of Israel and of its residents and to remove an existential threat.



 **2 – Syria is a failed state that constitutes a direct threat to Israel.**



Syria has been destabilized by the years-long civil war there and Iran managed to gain a significant foothold in the country. The unstable, dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria cannot be trusted with the Golan Heights. Assad is not even in a position to effectively govern his own failed state. Any Israeli forfeiture could be utilized by Assad’s Iranian sponsors to directly attack the Jewish state.



Trump’s declaration about the Golan Heights last week came the same day Jews worldwide celebrated the holiday of Purim, which commemorates the saving of the Jewish people from destruction at the hands of biblical Haman under the ancient Persian Empire.



 **3 – Israeli control of the Golan Heights advances U.S. security in the region.**



As a key U.S. ally, Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights serves as a pro-Western anchor to ensure against Iranian, Syrian and Russian designs in the area. Besides Iran, Russia is the other main powerbroker in Syria, where Moscow maintains major military installations including its massive naval facility in Tartus and the Khmeimim, Tiyas and Shayrat airbases. **  
**



**4 – Outside control of the Golan Heights could threaten Israel’s water supply.**



The Golan Heights rests atop the Sea of Galilee and Lake Tiberius, with the Galilee serving as the source of one-third Israel’s water supply. While it controlled the Golan Heights from 1948 to 1967, Syria took action to prevent Israel from water development projects and attempted to divert critical water sources from the Golan with the goal of denying Israel its much needed water supply.



5 **– Jews have long been connected to the Golan Heights — territory that is steeped in Jewish history.**



Israel has maintained the territory longer than the brief 19 years that it was under Syrian control from 1948 to 1967. Before that, the Golan was variously controlled by the French and British mandates and by Turkey.



After the modern state of Israel was founded in 1948, tens of thousands of acres of land in the Golan Heights was seized from Jewish associations which had purchased the land in the late 19th century.



The Golan Heights is steeped in Jewish history.



This reporter previously gave an account of the Jewish historic and biblical connections to the Golan Heights:



The book of Joshua relates how the Golan was assigned to the tribe of Manasseh. Later, during the time of the First Temple, King Solomon appointed three ministers in the region, and the area became contested between the northern Jewish kingdom of Israel and the Aramean kingdom based in Damascus. The book of Kings relates how King Ahab of Israel defeated Ben-Hadad I of Damascus near the present-day site of Kibbutz Afik in the southern Golan, and the prophet Elisha foretold that King Jehoash of Israel would defeat Ben-Hadad III of Damascus, also near Kibbutz Afik.



The online Jewish Virtual Library has an account of how in the late 6th and 5th centuries B.C., the Golan was settled by Jewish exiles returning from Babylonia, or modern day Iraq. In the mid-2nd century B.C., Judah Maccabee’s grandnephew, the Hasmonean King Alexander Jannai, added the Golan Heights to his kingdom.



The Golan hosted some of the most important houses of Torah study in the years following the Second Temple’s destruction and subsequent Jewish exile; some of Judaism’s most revered ancient rabbis are buried in the territory. The remains of some 25 synagogues from the period between the Jewish revolt and the Islamic conquest in 636 have been excavated. The Golan is also dotted with ancient Jewish villages.

BAGHOUZ, Syria (AP) — US-backed forces in Syria announced Saturday they have liberated the last pocket of territory held by the Islamic State in Syria, declaring victory over the extremist group and bringing an end to the caliphate it declared in 2014.



The capture of the village of Baghouz in eastern Syria by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces brings to a close a grueling battle that stretched across several weeks and saw thousands of people flee the territory and hundreds killed.



“Baghouz is free and the military victory against Daesh has been achieved,” tweeted Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the SDF, referring to the group by its Arabic acronym.



The elimination of the last IS stronghold in Baghouz marks the end of the militants’ proto-state, which at its height blanketed large parts of Syria and Iraq, but the group maintains a scattered presence and sleeper cells across Syria and Iraq. IS affiliates in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Afghanistan and other countries continue to pose a threat, and the group’s ideology has inspired so-called lone-wolf attacks that had little if any connection to its leadership.



The campaign to take back the territory by the US and its partners has spanned five years and two US presidencies, unleashed more than 100,000 bombs and killed untold numbers of fighters and civilians.



But the weekend announcement, in a tweet, was anti-climactic, and on the ground sporadic gunfire continued. A day earlier, US President Donald Trump declared that Islamic State militants no longer control any territory in Syria.



Associated Press journalists in Baghouz on Saturday reported hearing mortars and gunfire directed toward a cliff overlooking Baghouz, where US-led coalition airstrikes were carried out a day earlier. SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel told the AP Friday that there were IS fighters hiding in caves near Baghouz and that clearing operations were still underway.



On Saturday, journalists were taken to an encampment in Baghouz where the group had made its last stand — a wasteland of wrecked vehicles, torn tents and scorched trees.



Personal belongings and other items including generators, oil barrels, water tanks and satellite dishes were scattered in the dirt. Cars and motorcycles were turned to rusted, twisted heaps of metal. Amid the empty fox holes and trenches stood a building with a huge yellow SDF flag on top.



Ciya Kobani, an SDF commander, announced the end of the operation from the rooftop: “We have been victorious against Daesh,” he declared.



At its height, the Islamic State group ruled a third of both Syria and Iraq, holding millions of people hostage to its harsh and violent interpretation of Islamic law. The group carried out large-scale massacres and documented them with slickly produced videos circulated online. During a rampage through Iraq’s Sinjar region in 2014, it captured thousands of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority and forced them into sexual slavery. Many remain missing to this day.



The group also used its caliphate as a launchpad for attacks around the globe, including the assaults in Paris in 2015 that killed more than 130 people.



While it imposed an unforgiving version of Islamic law through public beheadings and crucifixions, the group also carried out the mundane duties of governance in its territories, including regulating prices at markets and building infrastructure.

TEL AVIV — Marking a monumental shift in U.S. policy that would help ensure Israel’s security into the future, President Donald Trump on Thursday declared that the time has come for America to “fully recognize” Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.



“After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!,” Trump tweeted.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump to thank him by phone. “You made history,” Netanyahu’s office quoted him as saying.



“At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Thank you President Trump,” Netanyahu subsequently said in a tweet.

U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt hailed Trump’s “historic” call for recognition of Israeli sovereignty:



Another bold, courageous, and historic decision by @POTUS who understands Israel and its security needs. Thank you President Trump for your tremendous leadership! https://t.co/9I76mbHFBD



— Jason D. Greenblatt (@jdgreenblatt45) March 21, 2019



As _Haaretz_ reported, Trump’s tweet does not formally change U.S. policy. There are two main avenues to formalize the declaration:



There are two main avenues for changing the official U.S. position on the status of the Golan Heights. One way is through legislation in Congress, which indeed already exists and could be sped up now as a result of Trump’s tweet. The second way could be through a presidential decision, such as the one Trump made when he decided to relocate the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.



While his tweet isn’t an official declaration, it increases the likelihood that such a decision will be issued.



Already, the State Department took the surprise move last week to remove the phrase “occupied” when referring to Israeli sections of the Golan Heights in its 2018 human rights report. Instead, the Israeli Golan was referred to as “Israeli-controlled territory.”



The Golan Heights is strategic, mountainous territory that looks down on Israel’s main population centers. It was twice used by Syria to mount ground invasions into the Jewish state – in 1948 and again during the 1967 Six-Day War.



Israel captured the Israeli sections of the Golan Heights from Syria as a result of the Six-Dar War and Israel annexed the territory in 1981.



Israel has maintained the territory longer than the brief 19 years that it was under Syrian control from 1948 to 1967. Before that, the Golan was controlled by the French and British mandates and by Turkey.



After the modern state of Israel was founded in 1948, tens of thousands of acres of land in the Golan Heights was seized from Jewish associations which had purchased the land in the late 19th century.



The Golan Heights is steeped in Jewish history.



This reporter previously gave an account of the Jewish historic and biblical connections to the Golan Heights:



The book of Joshua relates how the Golan was assigned to the tribe of Manasseh. Later, during the time of the First Temple, King Solomon appointed three ministers in the region, and the area became contested between the northern Jewish kingdom of Israel and the Aramean kingdom based in Damascus. The book of Kings relates how King Ahab of Israel defeated Ben-Hadad I of Damascus near the present-day site of Kibbutz Afik in the southern Golan, and the prophet Elisha foretold that King Jehoash of Israel would defeat Ben-Hadad III of Damascus, also near Kibbutz Afik.



The online Jewish Virtual Library has an account of how in the late 6th and 5th centuries B.C., the Golan was settled by Jewish exiles returning from Babylonia, or modern day Iraq. In the mid-2nd century B.C., Judah Maccabee’s grandnephew, the Hasmonean King Alexander Jannai, added the Golan Heights to his kingdom.



The Golan hosted some of the most important houses of Torah study in the years following the Second Temple’s destruction and subsequent Jewish exile; some of Judaism’s most revered ancient rabbis are buried in the territory. The remains of some 25 synagogues from the period between the Jewish revolt and the Islamic conquest in 636 have been excavated. The Golan is also dotted with ancient Jewish villages.



In recent years, Syria has been destabilized by the years-long civil war there and Iran managed to gain a significant foothold in the country.



Trump’s declaration comes as Jews worldwide celebrate the holiday of Purim, which commemorates the saving of the Jewish people from destruction at the hands of biblical Haman under the ancient Persian Empire.

https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/03/17/exclusive-israeli-politician-moshe-feiglin-vows-to-drain-the-swamp/,EXCLUSIVE: Israeli Politician Moshe Feiglin Vows to ‘Drain the Swamp’,Aaron Klein,2019-03-17,defense,"

TEL AVIV — Moshe Feiglin, chairman of the Zehut party, vowed that if he enters the Knesset following next month’s election here, he will work to “drain the swamp” by fighting corruption and big government policies that, Feiglin argues, are negatively impacting Israelis’ day-to-day lives.



Feiglin’s surprise surge in the polls in recent days sent shockwaves across the Israeli political arena amid widespread speculation that his party could be the ultimate kingmaker in the formation of the next government, determining which Israeli leader will be able to cobble together enough seats to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset.



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself facing a tight race from challenger Benny Gantz, a former chief of the Israel Defense Forces. The next occupant of the prime minister’s office could be decided by the size of the smaller parties on the right or left endorsing either a Netanyahu or Gantz coalition. Feiglin’s decidedly anti-establishment Zehut party is currently projected to cross the electoral threshold and garner at least four Knesset seats.



Speaking in an interview set to air on this reporter’s Sunday night radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” Feiglin explained that President Donald Trump’s catchphrase “drain the swamp” applies to Israel.



“[Trump] spoke about draining the swamp. This is exactly what we are talking about here,” Feiglin stated. “Drain the swamp. And believe it or not, in Israel the swamps are much deeper.”



Feiglin continued:



America is at least based on the free market. The concept of the free market and freedom all together is what created America. Israel started as one big swamp of socialism to begin with from the time of Mapai (the Workers Party of the Land of Israel) and Ben-Gurion and so on. It was socialists who established the State of Israel and the Histadrut (General Organization of Workers in Israel) and the unions is what ran the show over here from the very beginning.



So the swamp here is much deeper. It is not going to be easy to deal with but because we are coming not from within the establishment but from outside of it and we are coming with the will to fight it and to win that fight. And add to that the fact that there is a new and young generation in Israel that understands what we are talking about and is giving us the backing that will stand with us. … I think there is a very good chance that we will succeed.



Feiglin charged that the current system of government in Israel fosters corruption. “There are wide circles of people who are connected to the system who are making a very good parnasa (Hebrew word for a living) from all of that,” he said.



“This is something that the Zehut Party will end,” Feiglin pledged. “Because we are totally new. We don’t connect to the system. We will come with a broom and sweep very well the whole system.”



Feiglin formerly was a Knesset member in Netanyahu’s Likud Party. Feiglin’s libertarian policies have been attracting voters from the right, center and the left. Zehut’s extensive platform seeks to massively lower Israeli regulation, especially as it relates to the cost of living, housing and taxes.



On all major issues, Zehut’s philosophy consistently calls on government to minimize its role in the personal lives of Israeli citizens.



When it comes to security and the so-called Palestinian issue, the religious Zionist Feiglin takes a strong line promoting the territorial contiguity of the land of Israel. In a previous interview with this reporter, Feiglin, drawing from the Zehut platform, contended that is time for Israel to formally abandon the so-called two-state solution as well as the concept of a Palestinian state and instead push for the complete Israeli annexation of the West Bank and retaking of the Gaza Strip.



The one Zehut policy issue that has perhaps garnered the most attention and significant electoral support so far is the party’s call for the legalization of cannabis, with Feiglin naturally aligning his anti-establishment ideology with the sizable marijuana legalization crowd.



Israel’s foremost legalization activist, stand-up comedian and actor Gadi Wilcherski, is a candidate on Zehut’s list and has been a fixture at most Zehut campaign events. In what many here take as a clear bid to court Feiglin ahead of next month’s election, Netanyahu last week said that he is looking into legalizing cannabis.

NATO members increased their defense spending over the course of 2018 following pressure from the United States, yet just six countries are meeting targets set last year by President Donald Trump.



NATO’s 2018 annual report on Thursday showed that member countries had increased their average defense spending to a five-year high of 1.51 percent, but still nearly 0.5 percent sought of the U.S. target of two percent of each state’s national economic output.



Seven countries, including the United Kingdom, Poland, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, and Lithuania, all met their two percent target last year, while spending in Bulgaria, the Baltic states, and the Netherlands increased some 20 percent in 2018 compared with 2017.



Meanwhile, defense spending in Canada under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fell by almost 11 percent, while Germany’s remained the same at 1.23 percent. Both Belgium and Spain’s spending also remains below one percent of GDP.



NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference on Thursday that he had received assurances would increase its military spending by 80 percent between 2014 and 2024.



“Germany has after years of cutting defense spending started to increase, and actually added a significant amount of money to the defense budgets,” he said. “But I expect more. I expect further increases and Germany has made it clear they plan to further increase defense spending.”



However, many officials remain unimpressed with Germany’s refusal to meet its NATO commitments. Speaking to Breitbart London last month, Washington’s ambassador to Berlin described the government’s failure as “woeful.”



“It is woeful; Germany is the largest economy in Europe,” he said. “They made a commitment to NATO, and they should be serious about that commitment; it is a multilateral institution that guarantees the allies, guaranteeing freedom.”



The report estimates that NATO countries spent almost one trillion dollars on defense on the military in the year 2018, although 70 percent of that spending came from the United States.



“We face a paradox,” he continued. “At a time when some are questioning the strength of the transatlantic bond, we are actually doing more together … than ever before.”

 **TEL AVIV – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit Israel next week as part of a brief tour of the region ahead of the Trump administration’s unveiling of its long-awaited peace plan in April.**



Pompeo said he plans to visit Lebanon, Israel and Kuwait, and while he declined to give exact dates, the State Department confirmed that the trip would take place before Israel’s general election on April 9.



Israel’s attorney general last week announced his intention to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, pending a hearing.



State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Pompeo’s trip was not intended to send a message of support or otherwise. “Israel is an ally,” Palladino said. “We’re not going to get involved in the domestic politics of another country.”



The indictment announcement prompted President Donald Trump to praise Netanyahu as “tough, smart, and strong.”



“I can say this, he’s done a great job as prime minister,” Trump said last week.



“He’s tough, smart, and strong. He’s very defensive, his military has been built up a lot, they buy a lot of equipment from the United States, and they pay for it,” he added.



Pompeo visited several countries in the region earlier this year but had to cut the trip short due to family concerns. On that trip, he did not get a chance to visit Gulf states as intended.



“This is very much the continuation of that previous trip,” Palladino said.

TEL AVIV — In light of serious U.S. national security concerns, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should strongly consider nixing Israel’s shortsighted agreement with a Chinese government-controlled company to operate a new seaport in the Israeli coastal city of Haifa.



Haifa is home to Israel’s largest international seaport and has long been a safe docking hub for American warships from the Sixth Fleet. The Haifa port has routinely hosted joint U.S.-Israeli naval drills.



In 2015, the Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG), which is 44%-owned by the Chinese government, won a tender to operate the Haifa seaport for 25 years starting in two years. The deal faces renewed scrutiny from the Trump administration, which has been confronting China on trade and has expressed deep concern about the possibility of Beijing using its infrastructure and high-tech projects for espionage or expansionism.



U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton reportedly recently told Israeli leaders that China could utilize its newfound foothold in Haifa to potentially spy on U.S. interests or strengthen its strategic position in the Middle East.



The close proximity of Chinese port workers to U.S. naval ships carries an obvious potential risk of espionage. According to multiple reports, the U.S. is so worried about the Chinese oversight deal that the U.S. Navy is considering making changes to its traditional operations at the Haifa port.



Additionally, the Haifa port deal and larger Chinese investment in Israeli infrastructure and high-tech have raised questions about whether U.S. intelligence shared with Israel could become vulnerable to Chinese spying.



One Trump administration official, referring to growing Chinese involvement in Israel, told Reuters that the U.S. does not want any impediments to sharing intel with Israel. “We specifically put it on the agenda,” said the official.



Gary Roughead, a former chief of U.S. Naval Operations, outlined the potential security risks of the Haifa port deal thusly: “The Chinese port operators will be able to monitor closely U.S. ship movements, be aware of maintenance activity and could have access to equipment moving to and from repair sites and interact freely with our crews over protracted periods.”



“Significantly, the information systems and new infrastructure integral to the ports and the likelihood of information and electronic surveillance systems jeopardize US information and cybersecurity,” Rougheed added, speaking at a conference last November at the University of Haifa.



Former Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy voiced concern over the port deal: “If Haifa becomes a port—the civilian part of it—which is directly controlled by the Chinese in a civilian mode, not a military one, nevertheless it is more than just a symbolic foot on the ground for the Chinese in a very strategic area of Israel,” Halevy said.



“That, of course, raises a lot of questions because of the policies of China with emphasis on its growing and spreading relations with Iran,” added Halevy.



In a stinging rebuke of the port deal, Israel’s Shin Bet security service chief Nadav Argaman warned in January that Chinese investments in Israel such as the Haifa project carry with them potential national security risks for the Jewish state.



Besides the Haifa port deal, a second Chinese firm won a 2014 tender to construct the South Port in Ashdod. A subsidiary of the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) is helping Israel build the Tel Aviv Light Rail line, while another Chinese company will construct a hydroelectric power station in the Jordan Valley.



The exponential pace at which China has been expanding its involvement in Israeli infrastructure comes as Beijing is seeking to promote its Belt and Road Initiative, a development strategy with specific focus on securing Chinese infrastructure projects across Europe, Asia and Africa. China critics see the Belt and Road Initiative as a Trojan horse scheme to expand Chinese dominance globally, in part using a strategy of low bids to ensure successful tenders.



Beyond infrastructure, the growing Chinese investment in Israeli hi-tech firms is also setting off alarm bells in Washington.



A report four months ago by the Israel-based IVC Research Center Ltd. documented about $1.5 billion in Chinese funds invested in nearly 300 Israeli companies. Ilan Berman, a senior vice president at the American Foreign Policy Council, warned in an op-ed in _Wall Street Journal_ about Chinese “influence over as much as 25% of Israel’s tech industry.”



The Trump administration has taken action to curb the global penetration of two of China’s largest network firms, Huawei Technologies Cos Ltd and ZTE Corp, both of which deny that their equipment is being utilized for spying purposes. Reuters reported on deals and potential deals between those Chinese firms and Israeli tech companies:



In December 2016 Huawei acquired Israel’s HexaTier, whose technology secures databases in the cloud, for $42 million. This followed a visit to Israel by the Chinese technology giant’s CEO. That same month it also acquired IT research firm Toga Networks for an undisclosed amount.



According to Israeli media, ZTE has shown interest in Israel’s tech sector since sending a senior delegation to the country in 2013.



“We are all concerned about theft of intellectual property and Chinese telecoms companies that are being used by China for intelligence-gathering purposes,” a senior Trump administration official told Reuters.



If it is not going to nix the Haifa port deal, meanwhile, Israel should at a minimum strongly consider founding a governmental agency similar to CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a coalition of agencies that together review national security implications of foreign investments in U.S. companies and operations. According to local reports today, Netanyahu is already leaning in that direction.



U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette recently told reporters in Tel Aviv that “we evaluate foreign investment in the United States very, very closely. We would hope that Israel would adopt a similar approach.”



Yaakov Amidror, chief of Israel’s National Security Council from 2011 to 2013, also advocated an Israeli governmental vetting process for foreign investments with national security implications.



“The problem isn’t China or Haifa Bay port, the problem is the mechanism,” Amidror stated.



“There’s no body that examines foreign investment in Israel that isn’t security related. If Saudi Arabia decided it wanted to buy a Tel Aviv skyscraper, there’s no supervising body.”

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/03/04/media-echo-michael-cohen-conspiracy-trump-will-start-civil-war-if-voted-out/,Media Echo Michael Cohen Conspiracy: Trump Will Start Civil War if Voted Out,Aaron Klein,2019-03-04,defense,"

Since last week, the news media has been busy churning out content echoing a talking point propagated during Congressional testimony by President Trump’s disgraced and disbarred attorney Michael Cohen claiming that Trump will not allow a peaceful transition if he loses the 2020 election.



Journalists and pundits utilized Cohen’s remarks to warn about such outlandish post-election scenarios as Trump using the U.S. military to cling to power, raising a private army of mercenaries or deliberately igniting a civil war.



Cohen is a convict who pled guilty to, among other things, lying to Congress in two separate prosecutions. The prison-bound Cohen also pled guilty to violating campaign finance laws and financial crimes, including tax evasion and bank fraud.



In his closing remarks before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Cohen stated:



Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power.



After the credibility-challenged Cohen’s internationally televised testimony, John Dean, President Richard Nixon’s former White House counsel, wrote an op-ed for the _New York Times_ in which he drew parallels with his own defining testimony against Nixon.



Dean used the column to say that he shares Cohen’s fears. Dean opined that Cohen’s warning about a violent transition “was the most troubling — actually, chilling — thing he said in his five hours before the committee.”



He further wrote:



Since Mr. Cohen’s warning came in his closing words, there was no opportunity for committee members to ask follow-up questions. So I double-checked with his lawyer, Lanny Davis, if I had understood Mr. Cohen’s testimony correctly. Mr. Davis responded, “He was referring to Trump’s authoritarian mind-set, and lack of respect for democracy and democratic institutions.”



Indeed, what is most similar about my and Mr. Cohen’s testimony is that we both challenged authoritarian presidents of the United States by revealing their lies and abuses of power. Mr. Trump is the first authoritarian president since Mr. Nixon, and neither he nor his supporters will play fair. Mr. Cohen will be dealing with these people the rest of his life.



In fact, all Americans are affected by the growing authoritarianism that made Mr. Trump president. These people who facilitated his rise will remain long after Mr. Trump is gone. We need to pay more attention.



In a piece published in the _Miami Herald_ and other publications, syndicated columnist Leonard Pitts Jr. warned, “Should Trump lose in 2020, a smooth transition is not guaranteed.”



Pitts cited Cohen’s remarks and inquired: “Let that marinate a moment. And ask yourself: What happens if this guy whose self-definition, whose entire psychological structure, is founded upon a self-image as a man who always wins, loses? Can you see him quietly accepting it with dignity and grace? One can more readily imagine Mitch McConnell twerking in Times Square.”



Pitts claimed that Trump’s supporters could turn violent if he loses the 2020 election:



And if Trump does refuse to accept the verdict of the electorate, what do the people who have followed him slavishly, renouncing common sense, simple decency and the evidence of their own eyes, do then? Will they reject the legitimacy of the new president? Will violence follow?



You may think the entire scenario far-fetched. But in the Trump age, that term hardly has meaning anymore. Indeed, it is a measure of how extraordinary this era is that this fear, expressed by a man who knows Trump better than almost anyone, was not the top takeaway from the hearing.



Following the standard anti-Trump playbook of comparing the president to Nixon and Watergate, Pitts cited Dean to smear Trump’s entire presidency as a “cancer.”



“John Dean, you will recall, famously warned Richard Nixon of a ‘cancer’ on the presidency,” Pitts recalled. “But in 2019, the cancer is the presidency. So there is a need for us to be clear-eyed and sober about what we face. I don’t know that we’re there yet.”



In a stroke of originality, Moveon.org activist Robert Reich, Bill Clinton’s former Secretary of Labor, wrote a piece for the _Guardian_ titled, “If Trump loses, we know what to expect: anger, fear and disruption.”



Reich utilized Cohen’s warning to exclaim, “The United States is now headed by someone pathologically incapable of admitting defeat. This doesn’t bode well for the 2020 presidential election.”



The alarmist Reich implies that a Trump loss in 2020 could prompt a civil war:



For Trump, losing is the deepest form of humiliation, and humiliation is intolerable.



…



Imagine it’s November 2020 and Trump has lost the election. He charges voter fraud, claiming that the “deep state” organized tens of millions of illegal immigrants to vote against him, and says he has an obligation not to step down.



Only this time he’s already president, with all the powers a president commands.



In years past, Americans have trusted our system of government enough that we abide by its outcomes even though we may disagree with them. Only once in our history — in 1861 — did enough of us distrust the system so much we succumbed to civil war.



Showing no concern for Cohen’s track record of deceit, Reich declared: “We should take seriously Michael Cohen’s admonition that if Trump is defeated in 2020, he will not leave office peacefully.”



Over at MSNBC, “Morning Joe” regular Donny Deutsch cited Cohen’s comments to suggest, like the others, that Trump could ignite a civil war. “If impeachment starts to happen, even if he loses an election, whatever inner move you think this guy is capable of doing to create a civil war, he will [do]. … I’m not speaking hyperbole.”



At Truthout.com following Cohen’s warning, a column by William Rivers Pitt was titled, “Trump May Want to Be President Forever. Take the Threat Seriously.”



Pitt wildly suggests a “private army” could be called upon to wreak havoc if Trump loses:



It may also be worth noting that Erik Prince, brother of the sitting Education Secretary and a Trump devotee, used to have his own large, battle-tested private army. I’m sure he still has their phone numbers.



There is a legitimate concern that even discussing the idea of Trump seeking to be president past his term actually empowers him and his followers. Raising the specter, goes the argument, gives them a club to wield, a weapon of intimidation to add to their already formidable arsenal. This dilemma is real, but outweighed in the end by the dangers implicit in not sounding the alarm. Awareness of what he is capable of is the first requirement for any effective resistance. Trump is fully capable of doing this, and the people must be warned.



…



Donald Trump might be the most dangerous man ever to hold the office of the presidency, and only a fool would believe he will go quietly into that good night.



Echoing the others, Pitt warns of a civil war scenario. “Some will tell you the Civil War never ended, and a lot of those folks voted for Donald Trump,” he writes. “If he calls, they will come.”



The talking point that Trump would not bow out peacefully following any election defeat was circulating even before Cohen’s testimony. Two weeks ago, CNN.com ran a piece by law professor Joshua A. Geltzer headlined, “What if Trump refuses to accept defeat in 2020?”



“In light of these overreaching assertions of his own authority, it’s at least plausible that Trump might attempt to cling to power in ways previously unimaginable by an American president,” Geltzer surmised.



Geltzer theorized Trump could potentially use the U.S. military to hold onto power after a defeat at the ballot box. “He’s the commander in chief of the most powerful military on Earth. If he even hints at contesting the election result in 2020, as he suggested he might in 2016, he’d be doing so not as an outsider but as a leader with the vast resources of the US government potentially at his disposal.”



Geltzer takes his outlandish theory so seriously he recommends that Congress ask military leaders to declare on record they will not allow Trump to use the military to stay in office following any election defeat:



Our civilian and uniformed Defense Department leaders have a role to play. The health of our democracy rests, in part, on not involving the military in transfers of power. And that should continue. But imagine the most extreme scenario, with Congress certifying Trump’s defeat but Trump refusing to leave office. In those circumstances, the military would no longer owe its loyalty to Donald Trump as of noon on January 20, 2021. And it’s worth asking the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as they testify before Congress in coming months, to affirm that they understand that and would act consistently with it.

Joe Arpaio, the former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, lauded President Trump for persisting with the drive to build a border barrier while slamming the Democratic Party and some Republican opponents of the proposed wall as “trying to hurt our country because they may not like our president.”



“He’s got guts to continue this,” Arpaio told Breitbart News. “And he is not going to surrender. Other presidents or politicians would surrender, play the Mickey Mouse games. You do this or you do that. No. He is sticking with the border issue. He is sticking with the wall. And he will come up with the money one way or another.”



Arpaio said that politicians opposed to Trump’s proposed barrier are risking U.S. national security because they “hate” Trump and are seeking to embarrass the president.



“I am talking about the Democrats and the few Republicans trying to hurt our country because they may not like our president,” Arpaio clarified.



“What’s the big deal to spend $5 billion when Congress in the past already said it was okay to build a wall? Now we have got this going on because they hate Trump? It’s all got to do with Trump. Nothing else. Trump. They hate him. They want to embarrass him. And that is what it is all about. And they don’t care about the security of this country. The murders that occur.



“I said four years ago that heroin is coming back. No one would listen. Now we are being flooded with heroin. And the president is trying to do something about it. You can’t just do it with boots on the ground. You’ve got to do something unusual. And that is building a wall.”



Arpaio spoke as the White House confirmed on Thursday that Trump will sign a bipartisan bill to avert a potential government shutdown that contains a fraction of the $5 million the president has been seeking to build a barrier along the porous U.S.-Mexico border.



Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that Trump would also take “other executive action — including a national emergency” as he tries to fulfill the border wall pledge.

The Jerusalem Post reports: Arab countries and Israel are talking about war with Iran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Warsaw, as he filmed a shot near a skating rink for his Facebook page.



“From here I am going to a meeting with 60 foreign ministers and envoys of countries from around the world against Iran,” Netanyahu said.



“What is important about this meeting – and this meeting is not in secret, because there are many of those – is that this is an open meeting with representatives of leading Arab countries, that are sitting down together with Israel in order to advance the common interest of war with Iran.” Netanyahu said.

NEW YORK — Amid the flurry of news media coverage surrounding President Donald Trump’s criticism of the U.S. intelligence community, it may be instructive to recall the Obama administration was repeatedly accused of politicizing the country’s intelligence agencies to advance its own foreign policy agenda.



This while Trump has said that while he may disagree with some of the Intel community’s assessments, he respects the independence of those same agencies.



The uproar began last week, when Trump pushed back after U.S. agencies issued an annual report on global threats claiming Iran is not taking measures to produce a nuclear weapon and that North Korea was unlikely to give up its arsenal.



Trump initially responded on Twitter, calling the Intel community “extremely passive and naïve when it comes to the dangers of Iran.”



The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, they are MUCH different, but….

….a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!

Trump then announced that he held a meeting with the leaders of the U.S. intelligence community and said their views had been “mischaracterized” by the news media.



Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media – and we are very much in agreement on Iran, ISIS, North Korea, etc. Their testimony was distorted press…. pic.twitter.com/Zl5aqBmpjF

In public remarks on the matter, Trump affirmed that he wants U.S. intelligence agencies to have their own opinions and explained that he takes their analysis into account when taking foreign policy decisions.



“I am going to trust the intelligence that I’m putting there,” Trump told CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”



“But I will say this: My intelligence people, if they said, in fact, that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I disagree with them 100 percent,” he continued. “I have intel people, but that doesn’t mean I have to agree,” Trump added, upholding the independence of the U.S. intelligence community.



The Obama administration, by contrast, was repeatedly accused of politicizing the U.S. intelligence community.



One damning investigation by House Republicans released in August 2016 found that under the Obama administration, the intelligence arm of the U.S. Military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) routinely produced intelligence that “distorted, suppressed, or substantially altered” the results of the campaign against the Islamic State.



The probe found that top CENTCOM leaders modified intelligence assessments to present an “unduly positive” assessment of combating the Islamic State and training the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).



Far from respecting the independence of the military’s intelligence arm, analysts whose views conflicted with senior intelligence leaders were kept out of CENTCOM’s intelligence fusion center and restrictions were implemented for analysts whose views dissented, according to the investigation.



One common them that House Republicans found was that some Obama-era CENTCOM analysts declined to be interviewed, possibly out of fear of reprisals from CENTCOM leadership, while the interviews that did take place were under the watchful eyes of Obama’s DOD officials.



One year prior to the House probe, The Daily Beast broke the story that over 50 CENTCOM intelligence analysts formally complained that senior officials inappropriately altered their reports on IS and al-Qaeda’s Syria branch.



Writing at _National Review_ in September 2015, former national security employee Fred Fleitz documented other instances of the Obama administration allegedly politicizing intelligence:



Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, for instance, was accused of politicizing intelligence analysis in February 2011 when he said, during a congressional hearing: “The term ‘Muslim Brotherhood’ is an umbrella term for a variety of movements — in the case of Egypt, a very heterogeneous group, largely secular, which has eschewed violence and has decried al-Qaeda as a perversion of Islam.”



Many members of Congress were outraged by this statement, which Clapper later had to walk back. But Clapper was speaking from prepared remarks that conveyed the consensus views of the U.S. intelligence community. Why did no intelligence analysts come forward to allege that the intelligence community was playing down the threat from the Muslim Brotherhood.



…



I can cite many other examples of politicized intelligence analysis during the Obama administration, including the intelligence community’s altering of terrorism terminology to conform with the Obama administration’s agenda. **Analysts must now use the term “home-grown violent extremists,” for example, instead of “home-grown terrorists.” Intelligence agencies never use the terms “radical Islam” or “Islamist.” **When referring to ISIS terrorists in Syria, the intelligence community’s 2015 worldwide threat report repeatedly refers to them as “Sunni violent extremists.”

Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller opens his office’s indictment of Roger Stone, a former associate of President Donald Trump, by citing information that relies on an outside company’s independent assessment that Russia hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).



The indictment immediately implies that WikiLeaks released emails stolen by Russians who allegedly hacked the DNC servers, going on to document alleged communication between Stone and WikiLeaks in part using intermediaries.



The indictment does not charge Stone with any attempts to collude with WikiLeaks or Russia, instead charging him with witness tampering, obstructing an official proceeding and making false statements to investigators and to the House intelligence committee.



The DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its server to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which a third party company, CrowdStrike, conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI.



As this reporter previously documented, CrowdStrike was financed to the tune of $100 million from a funding drive by Google Capital.



Google Capital, which now goes by the name of CapitalG, is an arm of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton and is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party.



It was previously reported that Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the DNC and Clinton’s campaign, helped draft CrowdStrike to aid with the DNC’s allegedly hacked server.



On behalf of the DNC and Clinton’s campaign, Perkins Coie also paid the controversial Fusion GPS firm to produce the infamous, largely-discredited anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.



Mueller’s indictment of Stone begins with an “introduction” section that sets the tone of the 23-page document. That section starts with the alleged hack of the DNC and references conclusions about Russia made by CrowdStrike.



The indictment states:



“Company 1” clearly refers to CrowdStrike.



The charge document continues:



2\. On or about June 14, 2016, the DNC—through Company 1—publicly announced that it had been hacked by Russian government actors.



3\. From in or around July 2016 through in or around November 2016, an organization (“Organization 1”), which had previously posted documents stolen by others from U.S. persons, entities, and the U.S. government, released tens of thousands of documents stolen from the DNC and the personal email account of the chairman of the U.S. presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton (“Clinton Campaign”).



“Organization 1” refers to WikiLeaks.



In June 2016, _The Washington Post_ reported on the Perkins Coie law firm’s involvement in bringing in CrowdStrike to investigate the DNC’s allegedly hacked server.



 _The Washington Post_documented how Michael Sussmann, a partner with Perkins Coie who also represented the DNC, contacted CrowdStrike after the DNC suspected its server had been hacked. CrowdStrike then identified hacker groups allegedly tied to Russia.



 _The Post_ reported that Sussman called in Shawn Henry, president of CrowdStrike.



 _The Post_ reported:



DNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April. Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed some unusual network activity. “It’s never a call any executive wants to get, but the IT team knew something was awry,” Dacey said. And they knew it was serious enough that they wanted experts to investigate.



That evening, she spoke with Michael Sussmann, a DNC lawyer who is a partner with Perkins Coie in Washington. Soon after, Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor who handled computer crime cases, called Henry, whom he has known for many years.



Within 24 hours, CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNC’s computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access, when and how.



According to the _Post_ , citing DNC officials, the “hackers” had “gained access to the entire database of opposition research on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.”



In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered “multiple requests at different levels,” to review the DNC’s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a “highly respected private company”—a reference to CrowdStrike—would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified.



A senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC.



“The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,” the official was quoted by the news media as saying.



“This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,” the official continued.



CrowdStrike is a California-based cybersecurity technology company co-founded by experts George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch.



Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. The Council takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression.



The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., the U.S. State Department, and NATO ACT.



Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations.



The indictment of Stone, meanwhile, paints a picture of Trump associates allegedly communicating with Stone on the issue of WikiLeaks.



The Associated Press summarized the portions of the document detailing the background thusly:



The document says that by June and July 2016, Stone had told senior Trump campaign officials that he had information indicating that WikiLeaks had obtained documents that could be damaging to Clinton’s campaign.



After the July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks release of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, the indictment says a senior Trump campaign official “was directed” to contact Stone about additional releases and “what other damaging information” WikiLeaks had “regarding the Clinton campaign.” The indictment does not name the official or say who directed the outreach to Stone.



Another Trump campaign official cited in the indictment is Steve Bannon, who later became Trump’s chief strategist in the White House. Bannon, referred to as a “high-ranking Trump Campaign official,” exchanged emails with Stone in October 2016 about WikiLeaks’ plans for releasing hacked material. The indictment quotes from those emails, which had previously been made public by news outlets.



The actual indictment charges Stone with seven criminal counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements and witness tampering.



Stone’ attorney, Grant Smith, stated that his client would “vigorously” fight the charges.



“There was no collusion,” Smith told Reuters. “He forgot to tell something to Congress and what it was was immaterial.”
