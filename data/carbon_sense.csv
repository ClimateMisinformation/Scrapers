I attended the IPA’s book launch of Climate Change The Facts 2020 at Sunshine Beach last week.
Jennifer Marohasy, the editor, came up with the following quotation which was new to me:
Better a question that cannot be answered than an answer that cannot be questioned.
Attributed to Richard Feynman, American theoretical physicist (1918-88), but may not be an entirely original thought by him.
It does rather sum up the state of contemporary climate science, does it not?

https://carbon-sense.com/2020/09/21/new-cold-records/,,A New Cold Record set at International Falls: Should we be Surprised?,"By David Archibald
News has come from the Duluth office of the National Weather Service that both International Falls & Hibbing broke their records for low temperatures on the morning of September 17. The Falls got to 23°, breaking the old record of 24° set in 1959, and Hibbing to 24°. We shouldn’t be surprised because the Canadian prairies have been cooling for decades now. Also, President Trump, while in California on September 14, had predicted cooling, saying “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.” Three days later a new cold record is set at the iconic International Falls weather station. Either President Trump actually has some control of the weather or he is getting very good advice.
The paper on the Canadian prairies by Garnett, Khandekar and Kauer notes that “During the grain growing months of May-July, the mean temperature on the Canadian prairies has cooled down by 2ºC in the last 30 years. The cooling appears to be most certainly linked to diminishing solar activity” and “This cooling has led to a reduction in Growing Degree Days (GDDs) and has also impacted the precipitation pattern.” The paper includes this figure showing the multi-decadal decline in GDDs:
Figure 1: May GDDs 1985 – 2019
The Canadian prairies grow about 75 million tonnes per year of grains and pulses so the temperature downtrend evident is concerning with respect to the ability of the world to feed itself. The fact that the reduction of solar activity over that period is likely to have been the cause of the cooling is supported by the following figure, produced from data in Table 4 of the paper:
Figure 2: June – August Sunspot activity correlation with GDDs 1985 – 2019
Over the period 1985 to 2019, the figure above shows the correlation between sunspot activity and GDDs on the Canadian prairies. The blue line is the line of best fit.
While the Canadian prairies have been cooling for decades, the Modern Warm Period only ended 14 years ago as shown by the following graph of the cumulative aa Index against the long term average:
Figure 3: Cumulative aa Index against long term average 1868 – 2020
While sunspots are visual manifestations of solar activity, it has been suggested that the Sun’s magnetic activity is the biggest factor in controlling climate on Earth. The figure above suggests that trends in solar activity are about 70 years long. If so, the Earth has just started into a long term cooling trend.

https://carbon-sense.com/2020/09/14/greenhouse-effect-on-venus/,,RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE EFFECT ON VENUS? THE EVIDENCE SAYS NO!,"By Dr. John Happs
Venus is named after the ancient Roman Goddess of love and beauty, also called Aphrodite by the Ancient Greeks. Presumably, the “love and beauty” term came from the fact that Venus is the brightest of all the planets in the night sky.
The Italian Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was the first astronomer to observe Venus through a telescope and he observed that the planet had phases like our Moon. This observation supported the revolutionary (and politically dangerous) idea that Venus and other planets orbited the Sun.
Bing.com: Galileo Galilei
Venus is similar in structure and size (slightly smaller) when compared to the Earth. It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in our solar system with little difference between day and night temperatures.

We often hear climate alarmist’s claim that, should we continue emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (where carbon dioxide makes up a mere 0.04%), we could end up with an atmosphere like Venus (comprising 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen and traces of other gases such as sulfur dioxide). They argue that this would lead to runaway greenhouse heating on Earth.
The Earth is around 150 million km from the sun whilst Venus is much closer to the sun at about 108 million km but (against intuition) its proximity to the sun doesn’t explain the high temperature on Venus.
Venus is the brightest planet in the night sky because it reflects most of the solar radiation it receives from the sun. Albedo is a measure of the reflectivity of an object such that 100% reflectivity would give an object an albedo of 1 whilst an object that absorbs 100% of the radiation it receives has an albedo of 0.
Measurements from CERES spacecraft (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) give an average of the Earth’s albedo around 0.30. If our planet were covered in forest, it would have an albedo of around 0.14 compared to an albedo of 0.84 if it was covered in ice.
 https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/84499/measuring-earths-albedo
The upper atmosphere of Venus receives nearly twice as much solar radiation as the Earth but Venus has an albedo of 0.75 in that 75% of the radiation it receives from the sun is reflected back into space. Venus has high-level dense clouds containing sulphuric acid droplets. These clouds are up to 40km thick with bases around 30km altitude and relatively little solar radiation penetrates this cloud mass.
https://www.universetoday.com/36871/clouds-on-venus/
The question must be asked – if so little solar radiation penetrates the Venusian atmosphere, why is the average temperature on Venus around 460°C? (The melting point of lead is 327.5°C.)
One important clue that explains the high surface temperature and low upper atmosphere temperature of Venus is the dramatic change in atmospheric pressure. The ground atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than that on Earth. This was determined in 1970 when the Russian spacecraft Venera 7 landed on the surface of Venus. It collected data for 23 minutes and was then melted and crushed by the tremendous heat and pressure.
https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/venera-7/in-depth/
In 1972, after 117 days, Venera 8 landed on the Venusian surface and transmitted data for 63 minutes before it too was melted and crushed.
NASA: The 495 kg refrigerated Venera 8 probe
The transmitted data were vital since they showed that the high temperature at the surface of Venus has little, if anything, to do with the so-called “greenhouse effect.”
The temperature-altitude profile for Venus is clear:

A comparison of the temperature and pressure profiles of Venus and Earth shows that at 50 km altitude the Venusian atmospheric pressure corresponds to the normal pressure on Earth with both temperatures approximately 37°C. This equates with temperatures that are not uncommon in our tropics.
In fact the high surface temperature on Venus is essentially a result of its atmospheric pressure (92 atmospheres) and not its composition. If the carbon dioxide (molecular weight 44) in the Venusian atmosphere were replaced by nitrogen (molecular weight 14) its surface temperature would be only slightly lower.
As Dr. Harry Dale Huffman has said:
“Listen to the physicists that tell you there is no greenhouse effect; they know without having to go to the Venus data — and I am one of them. The continuing incompetence on this vital point among so many scientists, for more than a century, is amazing, and tragic.”

There are many peer-reviewed, published papers that reject the so-called Greenhouse hypothesis. These can be located at:

ADIABATIC HEATING
The atmospheric lapse rate refers to the change in temperature with a change in altitude and the concept of lapse rate can be related to the atmospheres on other planets.
 http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/civil_engineering/Atmospheric_lapse_rate.pdf
As mentioned previously, Maxwell pointed out that the atmospheric temperature gradient and warming are due to pressure and not radiative forcing. He related temperature at a given height to the pressure at that altitude in his 1872 book Theory of Heat.
 https://www.amazon.com/Theory-heat-James-Maxwell-ebook-dp-B00PKD044Y/dp/B00PKD044Y/=
Since Maxwell’s earlier work, other scientists have confirmed that the so-called “greenhouse effect” is actually a result of atmospheric mass/pressure/gravity, rather than radiative forcing from carbon dioxide.
Dr. Hans Jelbring writes:
“It is remarkable that the hypothesis claiming a quantitatively important anthropomorphic global warming (AGW) has survived for more than 100 years.”
 https://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2012/01/01/hans-jelbring-the-greenhouse-effect-as-a-function-of-atmospheric-mass/
Dr. Ned Nikolov and Dr. Karl Zeller in their 2017 paper: “New Insights on the Physical Nature of the Atmospheric Greenhouse Effect Deduced from an Empirical Planetary Temperature Model” write:
“The atmospheric ‘greenhouse effect’ currently viewed as a radiative phenomenon is in fact an adiabatic (pressure-induced) thermal enhancement analogous to compression heating and independent of atmospheric composition.

Compression heating would have been experienced by most people who have hand-pumped a bicycle tyre.
Bing.com: This person would experience adiabatic heating
In their 2007 paper: “Falsification Of The Atmospheric CO2 Greenhouse Effects Within The Frame Of Physics”  Gerhard Gerlich and Ralf D. Tscheuschner state:
“The atmospheric greenhouse effect, an idea that many authors trace back to the traditional works of Fourier (1824), Tyndall (1861), and Arrhenius (1896), and which is still supported in global climatology, essentially describes a fictitious mechanism, in which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat pump driven by an environment that is radiatively interacting with but radiatively equilibrated to the atmospheric system. “
And: “There are no common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass houses and the fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects,”
https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1161
Other papers that reject the greenhouse hypothesis include: Davis et al. (2018) who say:
“Recent research has shown, however, that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been decoupled from global temperature for the last 425 million years.”
https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/6/1/3/htm
Hertzberg et al. (2017) examined the concept of “greenhouse gases” and various definitions of the phenomenon known as the Atmospheric Radiative Greenhouse Effect, concluding:
“The six most quoted descriptions are as follows: (a) radiation trapped between the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere; (b) the insulating blanket of the atmosphere that keeps the Earth warm; (c) back radiation from the atmosphere to the Earth’s surface; (d) Infra Red absorbing gases that hinder radiative cooling and keep the surface warmer than it would otherwise be – known as ‘otherwise radiation’; (e) differences between actual surface temperatures of the Earth (as also observed on Venus) and those based on calculations; (f) any gas that absorbs infrared radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface towards free space. It is shown that none of the above descriptions can withstand the rigours of scientific scrutiny when the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics are applied to them.”

VOLCANISM ON VENUS – AN ADDITIONAL HEAT SOURCE
Investigations by scientists at the University of Maryland and the Institute of Geophysics in Zurich, Switzerland have used radar scanning to identify over 30 active volcanoes on Venus. Dr. Laurent Montési reported: “This study significantly changesthe view of Venus from a mostly inactive planet to one whose interior is still churning and can feed many active volcanoes.”
https://phys.org/news/2020-07-scientists-volcanoes-venus.html

Venus, with more than 1,000 volcanic structures, has more volcanoes than any other planet in our solar system with more than 150 of these measuring over 100 km across. A number of these structures are “flattened pancake” dome volcanoes, covering hundreds of kilometres, formed by lava erupting under the very high pressure of the Venusian atmosphere.
https://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/stereo_atlas/HTDOCS/VPAN.HTM
Although global surface temperature is essentially determined by the Earth’s atmospheric pressure and water vapour, there is ample evidence to show that the sun and clouds are important drivers of our climate and weather. There are numerous other factors that have an impact on our climate and weather with atmospheric carbon dioxide being one of the least significant.
There is no empirical evidence to show that atmospheric carbon dioxide has ever driven global temperature and many climate alarmists with vested interests know this. Some continue to promote catastrophic carbon dioxide-driven global warming because it is financially and/or politically beneficial for them to do so.
Whenever scientists and other vested interest groups say that our future depends on addressing (imaginary) catastrophic global warming by stopping carbon dioxide emissions, they most likely mean that their income and/or ideology depends on it.

Solar energy is very dilute, so solar collectors usually cover huge areas of flat arable land, stealing farmland, starving wild herbs and grasses of sunlight and creating “Solar Deserts”.

Wind turbines steal energy from winds which often bring moisture from the ocean. These walls of turbines then create rain shadows, producing more rain near the turbines and more droughts down-wind. Turbines work best along ridge lines where eagles also seek thermals, so birds and bats get chopped up by these whirling scythes. They also annoy neighbours with noise and increase bushfire risk.
They even spread their wall of wind towers offshore, so that less wind and rain even reaches the shore. Not green at all.

Then we have the biofuels scandals. This is UN-promoted stupidity where forests are logged in America and shipped across the Atlantic to burn in a British power station; where native forests are cleared in Indonesia and Brazil to grow palm oil for bio-diesel; and where food grains are distilled to make ethanol fuel for motor vehicles. Nothing green about any of this.
Now green dreamers want to use our precious water to manufacture hydrogen in a round-robin electrolytic process that consumes far more energy than it can ever produce.
Electrolysis consumes nine tonnes of water plus heaps of electricity to make one tonne of hydrogen. This processed water is not recovered until the hydrogen is burned (unlike water in steam turbines where most water is reused and some escapes to the atmosphere via cooling towers.)
“In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded.”
Terry Pratchett
Hydrogen is a low-energy explosive gas. Collecting, storing and exporting it will be a hazardous business and producing it will consume scads of Australian water and electricity to generate trendy “green” fuel for Asia. Burning this fuel will release pure Australian water into polluted Asian skies. But the Australian Government is funding hydrogen speculation with $70 million.
Green Energy isn’t green. It has a huge cost in rare metals; it creates toxic waste problems; solar panels create solar deserts; turbines chop birds and steal wind and rain from inland areas; and now they want to steal fresh water and energy to export low-energy explosive hydrogen.
In contrast, coal is fossil sunshine. Burning it releases new energy for industry and its combustion products bring great benefits for the green world – water vapour, carbon dioxide plant food, and valuable plant micro-nutrients.
Why export our sunshine, wind and fresh water via hydrogen while leaving our abundant fossil sunshine locked underground as “politically stranded assets”?
All that is not green – it’s green stupidity.

Before sunrise yesterday, the grass temperature in Washpool, “Sunny Queensland” was minus 1.7 deg.
There was no wind or sunshine. Wind turbines were becalmed and not even moonbeams energised our solar panels.
In that still, frosty darkness, green energy failed again. Not a watt came from becalmed wind “farms” or from subsidized solar panels cluttering many roofs (including ours). But we didn’t need our diesel in the shed – we were saved by trusty Old King Coal, with maybe a dash of gas or hydro.

Rio Tinto’s [Paywall] announced closure of its aluminium smelter in New Zealand due to uncompetitive power prices is a reminder of the vulnerability of Australia’s four remaining smelters, all of which face sharply higher prices courtesy of government energy policies. With energy costs comprising about a third of their total costs, smelters are industry’s bellwethers of future energy competitiveness and all four of Australia’s are on national suicide watch.
As a result of subsidies to wind and solar, these expensive and unreliable energy sources have caused high customer costs, both directly and indirectly, while also diverting the nation’s investment resources into avenues that actually damage the economy.
Commonwealth and state subsidies to wind and solar energy are running at just under $7 billion a year. $4 billion of these are as a result of requirements imposed on consumers by the Commonwealth’s Renewable Energy Target, its similar provisions for roof-top installations and measures taken by state governments. Some $2 billion of assistance to renewables comes from direct subsidies.
The effect of these subsidies is compounded by their forcing out of production lower cost coal generators. As a result, prices are now double what they were three years ago, bringing the national damage to over $15 billion per year. The outcome is that from having the world’s lowest cost electricity we now suffer from being among the highest and our reliance on intermittent renewables has left supply increasingly precarious.
But it does not stop there. In order to accommodate the subsidised renewables, consumers are being required to spend vast sums to augment transmission links.
These expenditures are for two reasons. First, they are to allow the surplus from wind and solar during daytime peaks to be exported – a further subsidy to renewables. Secondly, they are to provide greater security for those regions, especially South Australia, which have become over-reliant on intermittent power, having jettisoned the in-state coal generators that provided stability and reliability. In addition, we are in the process of converting the magnificent Snowy and Tasmanian hydro systems into quasi-batteries that will, at a cost of 30 per cent of their output, simply offset the inherent unreliability and intermittent nature of wind and solar. The Tasmanian link is likely to cost over $2 billion and Snowy2 will be far pricier than this.
At some future date we will ask how this was allowed to happen. How did we as a nation not only acquiesce in but actually finance the demise of our energy industry?
Obviously, the great sales pitch from the wind/solar subsidy seekers is part of the answer. That pitch promised low cost reliable electricity if only the government offered a few incentives as a bridge to this future. So also is the hysteria, on which the subsidy-seekers’ pitch partly rested, about global warming and the misinformation that this can be remedied by Australia abandoning the fossil fuels that still supply three quarters of our electricity.
But a great deal of the blame must be sheeted home to the bureaucracy, especially Treasury, formerly the gatekeeper of wasteful spending and the leader in combating other damaging proposals and policy stances. Forty years ago, under the legendary John Stone, the Commonwealth Treasury not only focussed on paring back ministerial spending ambitions but was also the leader in reducing regulatory imposts – which were at that time mainly in the form of import tariffs.
Gradually Treasury has metamorphized. Treasurers themselves, with the notable exception of Peter Costello, have been incapable of resisting the green interventionist advice that they have been offered.
Today the Treasury is headed by people who are wedded to accelerating an “inevitable” replacement of fossil fuelled electricity generation to one dominated by wind, solar or some yet to be discovered alternative. Secretary Steven Kennedy was the author of the notorious 2008 Garnaut report with its panoply of taxes and new spending levers designed to transform the economy. The two senior Deputy Secretaries, Jenny Wilkinson and Meghan Quinn have also spent over a decade pressing for carbon taxes and other interventions designed to push the economy in the directions they favour.
The coronavirus crisis offers an opportunity to turn back the tide before it engulfs the entire economy. Benefits include savings of over $2 billion in Commonwealth and state outlays presently wasted in direct support of renewables, a further $5 billion in regulatory forced transfers imposed on electricity customers and almost $10 billion in consequent increases in wholesale energy costs. In addition, there are the further outlays down the pike on new transmission lines and in converting the hydro schemes into renewable support facilities.
But the leading bureaucrats will not help in illuminating these opportunities and the Energy Minister is either incapable of persuading his colleagues to reverse course or he too is captive to the same environmentalist fervour.

“Searching for truth at the United Nations is like looking for kernels of wheat in a mountain of horse dung.”
Attributed to: “A playground for the vile and dangerous.” By Piers Akerman, Daily Telegraph, September 30, 2009)
https://www.icjs-online.org/indarch.php?article=2073

Perhaps Piers Akerman was a little harsh over his criticism of the United Nations (UN) although there is no doubt that current climate hysteria had its origins within that organisation.
To its credit, the UN initially focused on nuclear arms control, disarmament, the protection of human rights, securing the independence of colonized countries and the economic development of poor countries.
https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CTC/uncharter.pdf
Starting its journey for world peace and human rights, the UN has now morphed into a massive unelected socialist bureaucracy that attempts to interfere in the business of nations worldwide on just about every aspect of their lives. The UN now sees itself as a quasi-world government with global socialism as its raison d’être.
Rational people want to lift everyone out of poverty, yet many selfish advocates would deny those in developing countries access to the things we take for granted. The UN wants to see constraints on industry and human progress, arguing that the world can only be “saved” by stifling economic growth.
 https://www.climatedepot.com/2018/03/05/claim-halting-economic-growth-the-key-to-solving-climate-change/
So-called “climate summits” have little to do with global climate. They are smokescreens for the UN’s intent of changing the world and how it is governed. The UN wants to see the suppression of capitalism, but who would be made to pay for the universal welfare system they crave?
Developing countries would receive on-going payments from those countries that are developed and successful whilst those successful countries would be expected to lower their standard of living to meet the UN’s demands.
As Roger Franklin observed:
“Given that the UN is a spigot of innovative ideas for emptying the pockets of, well, everyone, not just the rich, and the paucity of proof that it has ever achieved anything worthwhile… .”
 https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2012/09/gillard-the-un-and-me/
Australia would be expected to pay “climate compensation” for damage to developing countries, allegedly caused by extreme weather.
 https://saltbushclub.com/2018/12/28/climate-summit-hidden-agenda/#more-146
The UN has a Commission on Global Governance and this is seen as central to global control:
“Regionalism must precede globalism. We foresee a seamless system of governance from local communities, individual states, regional unions and up through to the United Nations itself.”
http://www.green-agenda.com/globalgovernance.html
Investigative journalist Donna Laframboise warns:
“Communication goes in one direction only. From them-on their high thrones in Geneva-to us. This is an anti-democratic institution and since we didn’t vote them into office, we have no ability to turf them out. We have no means of objecting, no way of insisting that UN priorities are not our priorities.”
 https://nofrakkingconsensus.com/2018/12/17/the-anti-democratic-united-nations/
THE UN WANTS YOUR MONEY
In short, the UN strives to achieve global governance whilst controlling the re-distribution of wealth from developed countries that have earned it to poor countries that simply want it. More likely, we would see the transfer of money from the poor in rich countries to the rich in poor countries.
One goal would be to persuade western nations to provide climate compensation of $100 billion a year by 2020 to the UN with a commitment to pay 1.5% of their GDP annually.
Paragraph 33 of annex 1 reads: “By 2020 the scale of financial flows to support adaptation in developing countries must be [at least USD 67 billion] [in the range of USD 70-140 billion] per year.”
 https://giovanniworld.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/climate-change-world-govt/
UN officials realise that to get nations to cut back on their economic growth and transfer their wealth to developing countries, they must somehow persuade politicians from developed countries that the planet is heating up dangerously because of their industrial carbon dioxide emissions. The UN would build on this feeling of guilt to penalise them financially.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC) 2008 meeting in Poland discussed the management ofa UN Adaptation Fund that would transfer money into “climate protection.” Unfortunately, many politicians believed the IPCC’s global warming alarmism and the need for global reductions of carbon dioxide emissions. They also thought that paying the UN was justified, with Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announcing in 2014 that the Federal Government would contribute 200 million taxpayer dollars to the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF).

To his credit, Australia’s current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, made clear that no further funding would be forthcoming, saying:
“Nor are we bound to go and tip money into that big climate fund; we’re not going to do that either.”
He added:
“So I’m not going to spend money on global climate conferences and all that sort of nonsense.”

Other politicians were not fooled by the UN’s goals. Canada’s former Prime Minister Stephen Harper said: “Kyoto is essentially a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth-producing nations.”

WHO IS BEHIND THE UN’s DECEPTION?
The IPCC’s Dr. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber wants to link “sustainability” with global governance, saying:
“Either the Earth System would undergo major phase transitions as a result of unchecked human pressure on nature’s capacities and resources or a “Great Transformation” towards global sustainability would be initiated in due course. Neither transitions nor transformations will be manageable without novel forms of global governance and markets… “

Dr. Ottmar Edenhofer was co-chair of the IPCC’s Working Group III, and lead author of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report released in 2007. Edenhofer hasn’t even tried to hide the UN’s ideological goals goals, saying:
“The climate summit in Cancun —- is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War.”

He reiterated what the UN intentions are: “We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”
This then became“The Cause.”
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung (Nov. 14, 2010) Edenhofer confessed: “One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.”

When Figueres, was head of the UNFCCC, she freely admitted that the goal of the UN was never about preventing ecological calamity. Rather, it was about changing the global economic model:
“This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.”
And: “Our aim is not to save the world from ecological calamity but to destroy capitalism.”

FOOLING THE MASSES
But firstly, the UN had to convincingly demonise atmospheric carbon dioxide and persuade a largely scientifically-challenged population, the drama-seeking media and pliant politicians that the trivial amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (400 ppm) was the root cause of “imaginary” climate chaos. It mattered not that atmospheric carbon dioxide has never driven global temperature at any stage over the last 500 million years. See for instance:
 http://notrickszone.com/2017/07/31/new-paper-co2-has-negligible-influence-on-earths-temperature/
There are now more than 1,300 peer-reviewed, published papers promoting skeptical arguments against climate alarmism.
 http://www.populartechnology.net/2009/10/peer-reviewed-papers-supporting.html
Such evidence would be completely ignored by UN officials since they knew that few members of the public would check and understand the science. They also knew that the media would promote the imaginary greenhouse problem whilst politicians would simply accept it – especially if they thought that the majority in their electorates believed it.
So how was this deception kick-started?
In 1979 the first World Climate Conference warned nations about (imaginary) carbon dioxide-driven global warming and associated dangers such as ice sheet and glacier melt, extreme weather, sea level rise, spread of disease, ocean acidification and any number of imaginary dangers that simply haven’t happened.
 https://mustelid.blogspot.com/2019/11/declaration-of-first-world-climate.html
In 1985 the Villach conference concocted the following statement:
“As a result of the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, it is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature which is greater than any in man’s history could occur.”
This would completely ignore the many previous, well-documented beneficial warming periods “in man’s history” that took place well before industrialization. Carbon dioxide had to be made into public enemy number one for “The Cause.”
The Villach conference targeted government policies:
“While some warming of the climate now appears inevitable due to past actions, the rate and degree of future warming could be profoundly affected by government policies on energy conservation, use of fossil fuels, and the emission of greenhouse gases.”
 http://climatechange.lk/DNA/data/Statement%20by%20the%20UNEP%20on%20Villach_1985.pdf
The UN was moving the science into the political arena and had to convince the public and politicians that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) was a real threat to the planet. Senator Timothy Wirth, former US undersecretary for global affairs, made clear his political stance. Apparently Wirth cares not one jot about the evidence. He said: “We have to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong.”
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/06/26/quote-of-the-week-still-wirthless-after-all-these-years-edition/
The catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) deception had its origins with Maurice Strong (1929-2015) whose central aim was to achieve world governance by the UN. He promoted the global warming hysteria and the UN’s Agenda 21 with its deceptive aim of sustainable living, saying:
“Current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class – involving high meat intake, use of fossil fuels, appliances, air-conditioning, and suburban housing – are not sustainable. A shift is necessary which will require a vast strengthening of the multilateral system, including the United Nations.”
 https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/22127-the-legacy-of-maurice-strong-the-head-of-the-first-earth-summit
Strong went on to say:
Bing.com: Maurice Strong
And: “In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that the threat of global warming would fit the bill… . the real enemy, then, is humanity itself… .we believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is a real one or one invented for the purpose.”
http://green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html
It was here that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming was “invented for the purpose.” Strong was a founding member of the Club of Rome, established in the 1960’s and inspired by the 1798 essay by Thomas Malthus: Essay on the Principle of Population. Malthus incorrectly linked the geometric progression of growing populations with the arithmetic progression of food production leading, as Malthus thought, to population outstripping food supplies, starvation and deaths.
https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/malthusian-theory/
As Elaine Dewar explained in her book Cloak of Green after spending five days with Strong at the UN: “Strong was using the UN as a platform to sell a global environment crisis and his Global Governance Agenda.”
https://canadiantruths.wordpress.com/2008/01/20/cloak-of-green/
So the unfounded scare of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming would be the vehicle for socialist reform and a number of scientists who continue to support The Cause for their own selfish reasons, knew they would have to be economical with the truth. Dr. Stephen Schneider thought it acceptable to bend the truth for environmentalism:
“We need to get some broad based supportto capture the public’s imagination… So we have to offer up scary scenarios,make simplified, dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts… Each of us has to decide what the right balanceis between being effective and being honest.”

Dr. Paul Ehrlich took up the Malthus argument in his 1968 book The Population Bomb, with his ridiculous prediction that: “The battle to feed humanity is over.

“A global climate treaty must be implemented even if there is no scientific evidence to back the greenhouse effect.”

In 1989, Noel Brown, when a senior environmental official at the UN and Director of the New York office of the UN Environment Program, also started to ramp up climate alarmism. Brown said:
“Entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000.”
And: “Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of “eco-refugees” threatening political chaos and governments have a 10 year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect.”

THE UN’s TROJAN HORSE
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) felt there was a need for a scientific assessment of the claims that increasing emissions of carbon dioxide would impact the Earth’s climate and life on Earth.The WMO proposed the setting up of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This would be advertised as an independent authoritative scientific vehicle with an expert team of climate scientists carefully looking at all available climate literature to provide reliable advice on climate change.
 https://council.science/current/blog/the-origins-of-the-ipcc-how-the-world-woke-up-to-climate-change/
To convince the media and politicians that the Earth is warming dangerously and that a looming climate catastrophe is fast approaching, the UN established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. This would be the Trojan Horse, invented to persuade the gullible that we face a climate emergency.
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trojan-horse
UN officials knew that few would read the IPCC technical reports, produced in good faith by contributing scientists. They also knew that, if easy to read report summaries were made available to the media and politicians, those summaries could be “massaged” by UN officials and made sufficiently alarming to convince the media, the public and politicians that we face a climate crisis.
 More importantly, the UN knew that many gullible politicians would eagerly pull that particular Trojan Horse into their parliament and climate legislation would follow. UN goals would be achieved and taxpayers would pay the price.

https://carbon-sense.com/2020/05/26/more-useless-energy-policies/,,Thought Bubbles from Canberra – more useless energy policies,"
By Viv Forbes
The Australian Minister for Promoting Useless Energy thinks that hydrogen fuel, carbon capture and storage, soil carbon and biofuels are priorities for energy policy and greenhouse gas reduction.
If that’s the best our leaders can come up with, Australia should have voted Green last election to speed the inevitable recession and blackouts that will eventually kill this tsunami of energy nonsense.
Pixabay : https://pixabay.com/photos/soap-bubbles-bubbles-fun-colors-83758/
“Hydrogen” does not supply net energy – burning it can return some of the energy used to produce it from hydrocarbons or electrolysis of water. It is an expensive explosive gas that makes less sense than Snowy 2 – more energy in than out!
Moreover, we have no infrastructure that can safely store, distribute or use hydrogen in our transport fleet, energy network or smelters. Governments should not force energy consumers or tax payers to promote Canberra’s thought bubbles – let the “green hydrogen” entrepreneurs risk their own or shareholders’ money.
“Carbon capture and storage” is another dumb idea. To capture CO2 emissions from coal, gas or biomass power stations consumes a lot of energy to separate, store, pipe and pump it underground (hoping it will stay there). It would be far better leave non-polluting CO2 in the lower atmosphere and surround every power station with crops and forests hungry for the CO2 plant food so essential to their growth.
Trying to extract CO2 from the atmosphere is even dumber because the mighty oceans will quickly release CO2 from their huge stores to restore equilibrium between atmosphere and oceans. Even if it could be done, it is a bad idea – why steal plant food from grass, crops and forests?
“Soil carbon” is green-speak for what every sensible pastoralist tries to do – increase the humus and biological activity in soil. The quickest way to do this is via keyline/contour ripping to retain water in the soil (as shown in Australia by P A Yeoman), and by managed periodic heavy impact of grazing animals to promote pasture growth (as shown in Africa by Alan Savory). But it is total nonsense to turn “carbon farming” into a costly rural rort run by a bureaucracy of soil samplers and modellers who think it will cool the climate.
“Biofuels” are another way to waste energy, food crops and trees to do jobs better done by coal, gas and oil – a crime against humanity and the environment.
If our Minister for Promoting Useless Energy is determined to sequester and store carbon, there is only one sensible way – restore the forestry industry. Harvest mature forest trees for poles, posts, sleepers, paper, cardboard or dance floors. Then replant with new trees. Young trees grow rapidly and extract much CO2. But old trees reach a stage of carbon equilibrium when the CO2 they extract in summer is equal to what they lose as leaves, branches and trunks fall to frosts, droughts, bushfires and termites.

The Nationals oppose the idea of planting more trees to reduce our Carbon emissions. Their objection is that subsidised tree planting will consume arable farms and threaten food security for Australia. It’s a fair point.
So, if we think carbon dioxide is bad and we want to reduce it, we can either reduce our output or lock more carbon away in carbon sinks, where it cannot get back into the atmosphere.
If I can describe to you a plan that will lock vast amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere for hundreds of years and will consume no arable land or threaten food production and will create new jobs and exports for Australia, do you think that would be a good idea?
Forests are very efficient at converting CO2 into wood in the first fast growing 20-40 years, after which carbon capture tails off. “Old Growth” mature forests are almost useless for this purpose.
Rather than continuously expanding plantations of new growth to keep forests locking carbon in place the same result in carbon capture can be achieved without putting any new land into forest, by better managing what we already have in bush. We also have a problem of increasingly dangerous forest fires caused by excessive fuel loadings in unmanaged forests. The answer is not to put more land into forest; it is to mill the “old growth” forests that are no longer pulling their weight in carbon capture. Whether the wood is used for house framing or exported as lumber, pulp or fibreboard, it is out of the carbon cycle, potentially for hundreds of years. Even if it is made into disposable products like paper, that remains in landfills for hundreds of years. Landfills should be recognised as carbon sinks.
Then the new planting will be on the newly felled land, replacing the lazy “old growth” trees with fast growing carbon-binding new trees. We could replant with specific species of Eucalypts that koalas like to eat, thus expanding their habitat at the same time. The tree felling, if done in strips across the prevailing summer wind direction, can also be used as fire breaks. It is all win-win! This will actually create jobs and make money for the country and is much cheaper to introduce than the untried technology of coal fired carbon capture at power stations.
Sold properly, we’ll have Tasmanian greenies protesting for more pulp mills to convert their forests into carbon sinks! And we would bring back a golden age of forestry, strip felling vast swathes of bush with a clear conscience. I imagine the fanatical warmists would soon be demanding that we clear-fell 5% of our national parks each year to attain our carbon reduction targets, by sequestering massive amounts of carbon into lumber.
Carbon sequestration is most easily achieved by converting trees into lumber and building houses out of it, then growing more trees on the same ground.
Just think of the slogans:
The tree-fellers will be our new eco-warriors!
Save the world thanks to sawmills!
The chainsaw shall become a symbol of hope to the carbon-phobic!

https://carbon-sense.com/2020/04/09/greenland-ice-sheet/,,The Greenland Ice Sheet Might Disappear – Probably When Hell Freezes Over,"By Dr. John Happs

The Greenland ice sheet is the second largest body of ice on Earth after the Antarctic ice sheet and to say that Greenland’s ice sheet is big would be an understatement. It is about 2,400 km long, 1,100 km wide and covers an area of around 1,710,000 square km. It has a volume of about 2,850,000 cu. km and ice cores have been taken from a depth of around 4 km.
The public read and hear only about Greenland’s short summer melting events with exaggerated media reports routinely providing alarmist messages.
In July 2019,The Guardian newspaper reported that:
“More than 250 news outlets worldwide have signed on to Covering Climate Now, a project to improve coverage of the emergency.”  (My emphasis)
We all know they are not remotely interested in improving coverage. They promote groupthink – the antithesis of investigative journalism and we also know what the media’s version of “improved coverage” is.
 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/25/the-guardian-joins-a-major-media-initiative-to-combat-the-climate-crisis
In 2015 The New York Times featured Coral Davenport, Josh Haner and Derek Watkins reporting on how: “Greenland is Melting Away” and “ as the temperature rises, large lakes form on the surface of the ice, which in turn create a network of rivers.”
The drama continued: “The rivers then flow down into giant holes in the ice, called  moulins , which drain through tunnels in the ice sheet and out into the ocean.”
NASA: Greenland Moulin
All very dramatic but with no reference to research such as Smith et al. (2015) reporting that not all that meltwater actually reaches the ocean:
“Models alone cannot fully describe supraglacial drainage and its connection to subglacial systems, and that predicting outflow from climate models alone, without recognition of subglacial processes, may overestimate true meltwater release from the ice sheet.”
https://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1001
New snow is added to the Greenland ice sheet each year and the overall mass of the Greenland ice sheet is determined by the difference between ice loss (usually during June, July and August) and ice gain, during the winter months.
Summer melt is a normal process, but not for Forbes reporter Scott Snowden who breathlessly told us: “Last week, the world received yet another stark reminder of what’s yet to come as temperatures at the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet rose above freezing and melted the snow there for the first time since July 2012 and perhaps only the third time in the last 700 years. The glacier-covered island lost 12.5 billion tons of ice in one day.”
 https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottsnowden/2019/08/16/greenlands-massive-ice-melt-wasnt-supposed-to-happen-until-2070/#6a651f0e4894
Except that melting stopped a few days later and recovery was rapid. Not surprisingly, this went unreported:

https://www.drroyspencer.com/2019/08/
Davenport, Haner and Watkins would have us believe this brief period of rapid melt and the dramatic picture of moulins prove that Greenland is melting away. What these alarmists never admit (perhaps they don’t know) is that summertime always leads to some surface melting and runoff.
On December 5th, 2017 Henry Fountain and Derek Watkins continued the melting Greenland ice sheet drama, with similar articles in The Guardian reporting with the usual IF, MAY and COULD:
“There’s still much that remains unknown about the ice-sheet which, at roughly 650,000 square miles, is more than twice the size of Texas. The sheet, up to two miles thick, contains enough ice that, IF  it all melted, would raise oceans around the world by 24 feet. “
Not to be outdone,The Guardian’s Global Environmental Editor Jonathan Watts reported (6th December, 2018) how:
“Sea levels MAY  rise more rapidly due to Greenland ice melt.”
And: “The Greenland ice sheet is like a sleeping giant who is slowly but surely awakening to ongoing global warming.”
And: “ Rising sea levels COULD  become overwhelming sooner than previously believed … “
And: “ IF  all the ice in Greenland melted, it would raise sea levels by seven metres. At the current pace that would take thousands of years, but the ongoing acceleration COULD  bring this forward rapidly.” (My emphasis on the above quotes)
Watts tried to scare us with another of those dreaded tipping points:
“The ice has no political agenda – it either grows or melts. Today it is melting as humans have warmed the planet. The ice sheets have tipping points, and how quickly they impact our livelihoods through sea level rise depends on what we do now and in the very near future.”
The “sleeping giant” might not have a political agenda but Watts certainly has.
Watts should know that even the alarmist Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has acknowledged there has been no significant global warming for more than 20 years and state (AR5):
“Exceptionally unlikely that either Greenland or West Antarctic Ice Sheets will suffer near-complete disintegration (high confidence).
https://www.aei.org/economics/us-economy/ipcc-apocalypse-not/
Other media alarmists have dramatised Greenland’s melting moments, including Ted Scambos from CBS News and the Washington Post. He reported how Greenland was experiencing: “One of its greatest melting events ever recorded.”
Perhaps that is because nobody recorded the melting that took place during the Minoan Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period or the Medieval Warm Period when Vikings colonized Greenland, ran cattle and grew crops there.
Bing.com
It seems those media alarmists haven’t yet worked out how the Viking dead were buried where today’s permafrost prevents any excavation at those locations.
Ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet provide a good record of temperatures in Greenland over the last 5,000 years and this places current temperatures in perspective:

 https://www.scienceunderattack.com/blog/2019/11/4/no-convincing-evidence-that-greenland-ice-sheet-is-melting-rapidly-38
Not only do we see a cooling at the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, we also see how this coincides with rising carbon dioxide levels.

Why can’t reporters from The Guardian, CBS News, The Washington Post, theBBC, the ABC and other media alarmists understand that the Greenland ice sheet is not melting away and rising levels of carbon dioxide have had no impact on temperature?
Most likely for the same reason they have decided to ignore research such as the following:
Greenland was 4-5oC warmer than current temperatures during the early part of the Holocene, around 12,000 years ago. Syring et al. (2020)
 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379119304238
The Greenland ice sheet cooled and gained mass over a 40 year period, despite slowly rising levels of carbon dioxide. Mikkleson et al. (2018)
 https://www.the-cryosphere.net/12/39/2018/tc-12-39-2018-supplement.pdf
From 8,300 BCE to 800 BCE the average temperature was higher than the average temperature between 1960 and 1980. Vinther et al. (2009)
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08355
Media climate alarmists don’t appear to know (or choose to ignore) that this nonsense about the complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been going on for almost a century.
On the 18th November, 1930 Tasmania’s North-Eastern Advertiser warned:
“It is now definitely established that Greenland’s ice cap is disappearing.”
And:
“The entire disappearance of this ice cap would probably open up all the polar regions to settlement.”
On the 17th December, 1939 the Harrisburg Sunday Courier announced that: “Glaciers are Melting Over Greenland” with Dr. Hand Ahlmann stating:
“It may without exaggeration be said that glaciers – like those in Norway face the possibility of a catastrophic collapse.”
 https://americanfreepress.net/500-scientists-no-climate-catastrophe/
We now have climate alarmists claiming that basal melting will cause Greenland’s ice sheet to be lubricated by melt-water causing it to slide into the ocean. Of course it’s never explained how this is going to happen when the geological profile of Greenland is that of a large basin. Ollier and Pain explain:
“Global warming alarmists have suggested that the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica may collapse, causing disastrous sea level rise. This idea is based on the concept of an ice sheet sliding down an inclined plane on a base lubricated by meltwater, which is itself increasing because of global warming.
In reality the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets occupy deep basins, and cannot slide down a plane. Furthermore glacial flow depends on stress (including the important yield stress) as well as temperature, and much of the ice sheets are well below melting point.”

So what is really happening to Greenland’s ice cap?
Ice loss due to natural seasonal summer surface warming in some areas is more than offset by ice accumulation elsewhere.
Media claims of record Greenland temperatures have been grossly exaggerated with no indication of any warming trend found in official records:

According to the Polar Portal Season Report (2018) large regions of the oceans surrounding Greenland have been cooling by as much as 1-2oC in the last few years:
“Observations from the 18 weather stations in the melting region of the ice sheet indicate that the average degree of melting was the lowest recorded during the 10 years in which observations have been made (2008-2018).”

Climate alarmists rarely mention that Greenland’s Jakobshavn Glacier is advancing with research from NASA scientists showing that it is now thickening and advancing towards the ocean.
file://localhost/Climate%20Change%20File/Greenland/G’lsn%20glaciers%20grows.html
In fact the Jakobshavn Glacier has been advancing and thickening since 2016. NASA’s Dr. Josh Willis observed:
“The third straight year of thickening of Greenland’s biggest glacier supports our conclusion that the ocean is the culprit.”
Joughin et al. (2020) reported a thickening of the Jakobshavn glacier and also attributed this to regional ocean cooling of 1.5oC in recent years.
https://www.the-cryosphere.net/14/211/2020/tc-14-211-2020.pdf
Whilst climate alarmists tell us that glaciers worldwide are disappearing, they appear not to know (or choose to ignore) that Dr. Finnur Palsson from the University of Iceland who is studying several glaciers in Iceland including the Hofsjökull, Langjökull, Mýrdalsjökull, and Vatnajökull notes that they, like Greenland’s Jakobshavn Glacier, are also advancing.

Westergaard-Nielsen et al. (2018) have examined temperature trends across the ice-free part of Greenland and have concluded:
“The most recent and detailed trends based on MODIS (2001-2015) shows contrasting trends across Greenland, and if there is any general trend it is mostly a cooling.”
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19992-w
Ice has been steadily building up on Greenland’s ice sheet as testified by a team hunting World War 11 aircraft that were abandoned there in 1942.
Two B-17 bombers and six P-38 Lightnings ran out of fuel and crash-landed on the Greenland ice cap.
In 1988 one of the P-38 Lightnings was located using steam boring down to a depth of 82 metres.
82 metres of ice had accumulated in 46 years.
In 2002 the restored P-38 flew again.

 https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/a22575917/wwii-p-38-discovered-under-300-feet-of-ice-in-greenland/
Again, this episode certainly doesn’t support media alarmism about a rapidly melting Greenland icecap. In fact Greenland cooling has been documented by a number of other researchers. For instance Kobashi et al. (2015) reported that Greenland cooled from the 1970’s to the 1990’s.
 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL064764
Research by Axford et al. (2019) points out that 9,000 years ago north-west Greenland’s outlet glaciers were smaller than they are today:
 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379119302021
Schweinsberg et al. (2019) also pointed to the most pronounced glacier expansion in West Greenland having occurred during the last 2,000 years:
 http://www.glyfac.buffalo.edu/Faculty/briner/buf/pubs/Schweinsberg_et_al_2019.pdf
It’s such a pity that the media never consult the temperature records maintained at Greenland’s Summit Station situated about 3,000 m above sea level. The station recorded Greenland’s lowest temperature on 2nd January, 2020 at -66°C and this is very close to the Northern Hemisphere’s record low, measured in 1933 at Oymyakon in Russia. That record low temperature was -67.7°C.
 https://electroverse.net/greenland-just-set-a-new-all-time-record-low-temperature/
Dr. Valentina Zharkova from the UK’s Northumbria University and other solar physicists have been warning for some time that the sun is in a low-activity mode and this will move the Earth into a prolonged period of cooling. Zharkova has repeatedly pointed out that:
“By 2020 we are likely to be in for a new “Super Grand Solar Minimum” which will bring about a multi-decadal cold global temperature period similar to the “little ice age” between about 1300 and 1850.”
Dr. Zharkova rejects the notion of atmospheric carbon dioxide as a climate driver and she correctly predicted that solar cycle 24 would be weaker than solar cycle 23. More than 100 peer-reviewed, published papers, ignored by climate alarmists, also show a close correlation between solar activity and global temperature:
http://notrickszone.com/100-papers-sun-drives-climate/
As we enter the next solar minimum phase there are indications that it will be as deep and long as any observed during the last 100 or more years and that will lead to more ice build-up in Greenland.
NASA has reported that solar cycle 25 will be the weakest of the past 200 years and this promises global cooling:
 https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/solar-activity-forecast-for-next-decade-favorable-for-exploration
There will always be occasions when some surface melting takes place in Greenland. It’s called summertime! It’s also the time when global warming alarmists pretend that the usual summer melt is unprecedented.
Inevitably, we can expect information about Greenland’s natural melting and overall cooling to be ignored or downplayed by climate alarmists such as David Rising and Seth Borenstein who excitedly reported for AP News (August, 2019) that:
“The Greenland ice sheet has lost 240 billion metric tons this year.”
https://www.apnews.com/65694195c91d4b62b275bd14a6955b4c
240 billion metric tonssounds scary – except it isn’t!
Dr. Shfaqat Abbas Khan from the Technical University of Denmark has calculated the loss of ice from Greenland at 9,000 billion tons over the last 100 years.
 https://sciencenordic.com/climate-denmark-sea/greenland-has-lost-9000-billion-tons-of-ice-in-a-century/1427537
Sound even more scary since it equates to a cube of ice with dimensions: 20 km X 20 km X 20 Km. This represents a very large ice cube but, as David Middleton points out, a Greenland ice cube measuring 20 km X 20 km X 20 Km. is still a trivial amount compared to Greenland’s overall ice mass:

 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/12/30/greenland-retained-99-7-of-its-ice-mass-in-20th-century/
Even if the impossible happened and the Greenland ice sheet lost 240 billion metric tons every year from now on and even if the impossible happened and there was no further snow/ice accumulation, it would still take many thousands of years for all the ice to disappear.
It’s reassuring to know that we will be given at least one more “last chance” to stop the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet and avoid yet another tipping point. Presumably, a few thousand years from now, we can expect another dire warning (this time we are really, really serious) about a Greenland ice sheet tipping point.
It’s enough to make Extinction Rebels glue themselves to the nearest lamp post.

In this PowerPoint presentation, I have tried to answer a question about climate policy that is too rarely asked in Canada. How much does it cost? Only those with a profound ignorance of economics, or a contempt for it, would say that the answer to this question is unimportant. The central economic fact of life is that there are always more things that we want and need than we can afford; when we fail to understand what our choices cost, we indirectly deprive ourselves of things that may be far more important to our overall wellbeing.

Dr. Michael Mann will be in Australia for 6 months during 2020 as Visiting Professor at the Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC) at the University of New South Wales.
Bing.com: Dr. Michael Mann
This is the same university that awarded an honorary doctorate to the late Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, former chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Investigative journalist Donna Laframboise, in her book: Into the Dustbin: Rajendra Pachauri, the Climate Report and the Nobel Peace Prize, described Rajendra Pachauri, the former chairman of the IPCC, as an environmental activist, habitual liar on climate matters and a “non-stop train wreck.”
 https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/into-the-dustbin-rajendra-pachauri-the-climate-report-the-nobel-peace-prize-9781492292401
Tony Thomas has certainly done his homework on Pachauri and his summary makes the above comments by Laframboise appear more than charitable:
 https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2020/02/shed-no-tears-for-rajendra-pachauri/
Bing.com: Dr. Rajendra Pachauri
No doubt Dr. Michael Mann will take every opportunity to engage the Australian media to persuade them that dangerous global warming is here and we are all doomed. He will tell us how we are now facing more heatwaves, droughts, dramatic sea level rise, species loss, the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef and more of those “unprecedented” wildfires.
Of course Mann can always count on the ABC, SBS and The Project on Channel 10 to promote this kind of alarmist nonsense. Wasting no time, Mann has already told reporter Swati Pandey:
“It is conceivable that much of Australia simply becomes too hot and dry for human habitation.”
And:
“Unfortunately we could well see Australians join the ranks of the world’s climate refugees.“
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2020/01/16/michael-mann-beclowns-himself-with-aussie-climate-refugee-prediction/
If any Australians flee the country, it will most likely be because they can’t afford the ever-increasing cost of electricity brought about by the introduction of inefficient, unreliable wind and solar sources of energy.
Naturally, some naïve politicians and drama-seeking reporters will now link every storm, wildfire, flood, drought, very hot days, very cold days, cyclones or any natural disaster to Michael Mann’s dire warnings about catastrophic anthropogenic global warming. The fact that there is a total lack of empirical evidence to support his alarmism will be ignored.
We need to go back to historic records and well-established geo-chronology techniques to be confident about past climate change and how those changes compare with today’s climate.
We are currently living in a mild period of an ice age called an interglacial. Despite all the alarmist drama about an overheating planet, we are now experiencing an unusually cold period, compared to most of the past 500 million years. For more than 80% of geologic time the Earth has been up to10oC warmer than current global temperature and was free of ice sheets and glaciers.

20,000 years before present (bp) the current ice age we are now living through reached its lowest temperature (glacial maximum). Deserts occupied much of the land mass and sea levels were around 100 metres below current levels.
14,000 years bp saw a rapid warming of the Earth with temperatures similar to those we experience today. Ice sheets and glaciers retreated, sea levels rose and forested areas expanded.
12,500 years bp, in a period known as the Younger Dryas, the planet moved back into a brief cooling phase and experienced 1,000 years of increasing glacial conditions.
11,500 years bp ushered in the mild interglacial period we are now living through. This is known as the Holocene, a time when the Earth warmed, ice sheets and glaciers retreated once more, sea levels rose again, forests extended their range and deserts retreated.
However, temperatures fluctuated markedly during the Holocene and this more recent Earth climate history is well documented in both historic and geo-chronological records. These show:
200 BC to 600 AD: A time known as the Roman Warming Period.
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V15/N24/C2.php
600 to 900: A time known as the Dark Ages Cold Period.
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0959683617693898
900 to 1300: A time known as the Medieval Warm Period. The whole world experienced medieval warming which exceeded (by at least 3oC) 20th Century temperatures. Greenland was colonised; agriculture flourished in Europe and people prospered.
http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/vineland.htm
1300 to 1850: A time known as the Little Ice Age or Maunder Minimum, was a period of low solar activity. The LIA had global temperatures 2-3oC lower than we experience today. Crops failed; famine and disease spread and millions died of malnutrition.
As physicist James Marusek points out:
“Hunger became the heart of this crisis. Plagues, smallpox, typhus, measles and fever belong to a cluster of deadly diseases that correlate closely with harvest yields. Little Ice Age conditions produced famines, which increased the frequency and intensity of these diseases. Flooding created swamplands that became mosquito breeding grounds and introduced tropical diseases such as malaria throughout Europe.”
http://www.breadandbutterscience.com/Little_Ice_Age_Theory.pdf
More recent temperature shifts include:
1850 to 1940: A period of global warming.
1940 to 1975: A period of global cooling.
1976 to 1978: A period of global warming.
1979 to present: Independent, uncontaminated temperature readings from satellites and radio-sondes (balloons) do not show any unusual warming and certainly no catastrophic global warming.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed in 1988. So how did the IPCC depict Earth temperature history over the last 1,000 years or more? In fact they initially showed it exactly as it is recorded in historic and geo-chronological records.
The IPCC’s First Assessment Report (FAR) released in 1990 stated clearly:
“The Little Ice Age came to an end only in the nineteenth Century. Thus some of the global warming since 1850 could be a recovery from the Little Ice Age rather than a direct result of human activity.”
(IPCC, WG1, Chapter 7.2.1, 1990 Report)
The IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR) released in 1995 clearly showed the historic temperature shifts, including the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age and the gentle 20th century warming.

In fact the IPCC’s 2nd Assessment Report released in 1995 stated explicitly that:
1. “None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed (climate) changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases.”
2. “No study to datehas positively attributed all or part(of observed climate change) to anthropogenic (i.e. man-made) causes.”
3. “Any claims of positive detection of significant climate change are likely to remain controversialuntil uncertainties in the natural variability of the climate system are reduced.”
IPCC contributing scientists could find no evidence for human-driven climate change and had accurately portrayed the two major climate shifts (warming and cooling) over the last 1,000 years. This was problematic for those United Nations officials who needed to show that human-produced (anthropogenic) carbon dioxide emissions were driving dangerous global warming. After all, this was their primary political/ideological goal.
How do we know this was the IPCC’s primary political/ideological goal?
The IPCC was established in 1988 by both the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).
The IPCC was given the following brief:
“To assess the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant for the understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change.“
(My bold)
There was no empirical evidence to show any human-induced climate change – none at all. But, for political/ideological reasons, UN officials needed to show that human-induced climate change was real and the result of industrial emissions. In fact only data supporting that contention would be seriously considered.
UN officials started by ignoring the lack of evidence for human-driven climate change and used the “Summaries For Policymakers” document to say:
“The balance of evidence suggests a discernable human influence on global climate.”
Dr. Frederick Seitz, Past President of the NAS and American Physical Society, was appalled by this blatant abuse of the scientific process. He commented:
“This Report is not what it appears to be– it is not the version that was approved by the contributing scientists listed on the title page. In my more than 60 years as a member of the American Scientific community, including service as president of both the NAS and the American Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer- review process than the events that led to this IPCC report.”
The corruption gathered momentum when IPCC contributing scientist Dr. David Deming, a geologist at the University of Oklahoma, reflected:
“They thought I was one of them, someone who would pervert science in the service of social and political causes. So one of them let his guard down. A major person working in the area of climate change and global warming sent me an astonishing email that said: “We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.” (My bold)
And:
“The existence of the MWP had been recognized in the scientific literature for decades. But now it was a major embarrassment to those maintaining that the 20thCentury warming was anomalous. It had to be gotten rid of.“
https://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2012/10/17/1943
Enter Dr. Michael Mann, with his recently awarded Ph.D. He readily embraced “The UN’s Cause” and stepped forward with a way to get rid of both the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.
He achieved this by producing a temperature graph from tree-ring analysis that showed temperature almost flat-lining for 900 years, ending with a sharp uptick in temperature after the Industrial Revolution.
The shape of the graph resembled a “hockey stick” with its flat handle and upturned blade. Mann’s infamous “hockey stick” became the IPCC’s prize exhibit:

Mann made the claim, with no empirical evidence known to the climate science community, that the sudden temperature rise was a result of the trivial anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide.
The IPCC seized on Mann’s “hockey stick” graph since it served its purpose exactly and it became the poster for the UN/IPCC’s aim of persuading countries to take carbon dioxide emissions seriously with commitments to reduce them. The UN was also asking developed nations to pay climate compensation into the UN’s Green Climate Fund.
Many scientists, including some who were still working with the IPCC, immediately became suspicious. They knew that Mann’s graph ignored the many peer-reviewed published journal articles showing clear evidence of a Medieval Warm Period that was significant and global.
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/02/12/more-evidence-that-the-medieval-warming-period-was-global-not-regional/
So how had Mann actually generated data in order to show 900+ years of little temperature change followed by dramatic 20th century warming?
In the first instance, Dr. Michael Mann, Dr. Raymond Bradley and Dr. Malcolm Hughes published a paper in the journal Nature entitled:
“Global-Scale Temperature Patterns and Climate Forcing Over the Past Six Centuries.”
 http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/shared/articles/mbh98.pdf
The data for Mann’s “Hockey-Stick” graph came from dendrochronology or tree-ring analysis. This technique dates tree growth-rings back to the year they were formed and gives some insight into the climate at different periods during the tree’s growth.
Bing.com: Tree rings
Curiously, other dendrochronologists didn’t find the same results as those found by Mann et al.
Alarm bells started to ring!
The late Dr. Keith Briffa and his colleagues published a paper, also based on tree-ring data, but they did not find the same dramatic temperature uptick that Mann claimed to have found. In fact Briffa et al. showed cooling after 1983:

Another paper by Jones, Briffa, Barnett and Tett actually cast doubt on tree-ring reliability. This was:
“High-resolution paleoclimatic records for the last millennium: interpretation, integration and comparison with General Circulation Model control-run temperatures.”
They concluded that tree-ring data can be very unreliable although their paper showed that the Medieval Warm Period and theLittle Ice Age bothexperienced significant temperature shifts.
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/095968398667194956
Now these results alone should have cast doubt on the claim that Mann’s graph could be trusted. But it seems the IPCC couldn’t allow that to happen and they certainly didn’t want Briffa’s reconstruction to “dilute” the alarmist message. Briffa’s temperature “decline” had now become a problem.
Mann, was a Lead Author for the key chapter in the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report (TAR). He was asked to write a temperature summary for that report and, although Jones and Briffa were allowed to be contributors to the IPCC report, only Mann could deliver the final message and the IPCC knew exactly what they wanted that message to be.
In short, Jones and Briffa appear to have been sidelined and this could well be perceived as being a case of political and scientific interference.
IPCC Coordinating Lead Author Dr. Chris Folland observed the discrepancy between the Mann and Jones et al. data:
“A proxy diagram of temperature change is a clear favourite for the Policy Makers summary. But the current diagram with the tree ring only data (Briffa’s) somewhat contradicts the (Mann) multiproxy curve and dilutes the message rather significantly.”
 https://alethonews.com/2020/01/11/hide-the-decline-a-climategate-backgrounder/
It is likely that Folland didn’t want the alarmist “carbon dioxide drives global warming” messageto be “diluted” and he probably didn’t want any contradictions. Placing Mann’s “hockey-stick” centre-stage in the final IPCC report would present a nice tidy story about recent unprecedented anthropogenic global warming. The “hockey-stick” was to be paraded in the IPCC’s Summaries For Policymakers.
It must be stressed that the Summary For Policymakers is the one negotiated and approved by UN officials before it is sent out to politicians and the media. It is a political document, used by the IPCC to essentially ignore or marginalise any conflicting scientific evidence in order to promote its catastrophic anthropogenic global warming message.
Dr. Phil Jones from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia admitted the politics in the following email to Dr. Chris Folland:
14:50:24 2009
from: Phil Jones <REDACTED>
subject: RE: FW: Temperatures in 2009
to: “Folland, Chris” <REDACTED>
Chris,
I sent it. He says he’ll read the IPCC Chapters! He hadn’t
as he said he thought they were politically biased. I assured
him they were not. The SPM may be, but not the chapters.
From other things in his email though, he won’t be convinced.
Cheers
Phil
Dr. Peter Thorne, from the UK Meteorological (MET) Office, had also noted the politics in the IPCC’s 2007 4th Report, saying:
“I also think the science is being manipulated to put a political spin on it which for all our sakes might not be too clever in the long run.”
 https://www.thegwpf.com/climate-science-proves-scams-dont-die-of-exposure/
Jones and Briffa were perturbed by Mann’s “hockey-stick” taking precedence over their more moderate findings. Leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia showed that Briffa really had his doubts about Mann’s data:
“I know Mike thinks his series is the “best” and he might be right – but he may also be too dismissive of other data and possibly over confident in his. After all, the early (Pre-instrumental) data are much less reliable as indicators of global temperature than is apparent in modern calibrations.”
Briffa was aware of the IPCC’s political/ideological agenda and other leaked emails showed that Briffa was worried. He persisted:
“I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards “apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data” but in reality the situation is not quite so simple. We don’t have a lot of proxies that come right up to date and those that do (at least a significant number of tree proxies) contain some unexpected changes in response that do not match the recent warming. I do not think it is wise that this issue be ignored in the chapter.”
Bing.com: Dr. Keith Briffa
Briffa persisted in another leaked email:
“I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1,000 years ago. I do not believe that global mean annual temperatures have simply cooled progressively over thousands of years as Mike appears to and I contend that there is strong evidence for major changes in climate over the Holocene … .” (My bold)
This statement alone appears to contradict the argument put forward by Mann et al. that recent global warming was unprecedented. Climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry observed:
“Temperatures have been warming for more than 200 years, and, that in the 20th Century, 40 percent of the warming occurred before 1950 when carbon dioxide was not a factor in the warming.”
 https://dailycaller.com/2015/12/09/climate-scientist-turns-the-tables-on-dem-senator-trying-to-discredit-her-video/
Michael Mann was likely concerned that the IPCC’s alarmist message might be dismissed by those many scientists who did not have a political agenda (The Cause) so, in a leaked email, he responded:
“So if we show Keith’s series in the plot, we have to comment that “something else” is responsible for the discrepancies in this case… We would need to put in a few words in this regard. Otherwise, the skeptics would have a field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and, thus, can undermine faith in the paleoestimates.”
Presumably, Mann wanted all the plots to agree so he got around the problem of data contradictions by producing the following plots that incorporated data from Mann et al. (1999); Jones et al. (1998); Briffa (2000). He then added modern instrumental data:
IPCC Third Assessment Report Figure 2.21: Comparison of warm-season (Jones et al., 1998) and annual mean (Mann et al., 1998, 1999) multi-proxy-based and warm season tree-ring-based (Briffa, 2000) millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions.
Incredibly, all the separate data sets now appeared to merge and agree that recent 20th century warming was unprecedented and dramatic.
Briffa’s reconstructions diverged from the instrumental series towards the end of the 20th century so Mann used the instrumental post-1960 record for padding so that the “divergence problem” was resolved and the smoothed series now pointed upwards. Briffa’s data had to be hidden since they showed 33 years of temperature decline. The instrumental data were added with the Briffa data hidden under the other plots and smoothed to “hide the temperature decline.”
Magnified portion of the plots from the IPCC Third Assessment Report Fig 2-21.
The graph with the Mann, Jones and Briffa data appeared in the IPCC’s main report whilst Mann’s “hockey-stick” graph appeared several times in both the IPCC report and the political/ideological Summary For Policymakers that went out to politicians and the media.
That was enough to cause the climate alarm UN officials wanted and the IPCC made sure that their alarmist message got through to the right people. The “hockey-stick” graph was presented several times at conferences by the then IPCC Chairman Sir John Houghton and later by the then chairman Dr. Rajendra Pachauri.
The broader scientific community didn’t accept Mann’s infamous “Hockey Stick” graph. Its problems had been exposed by several scientists and statisticians for the flawed “climate science” that Mann hoped everyone would believe. It was seen as little more than a fabrication and is now widely parodied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMqc7PCJ-nc
Among those scientists who questioned the “hockey-stick” graph was Dr. Stephen McIntyre, an expert IPCC reviewer. He requested that the IPCC show the decline:
“Show the Briffa et al. reconstruction through to its end; don’t stop in 1960. Then comment and deal with the “divergence problem” if you need to. Don’t cover up the divergence by truncating this graphic. This was done in IPCC TAR; this was misleading.”
McIntyre’s comments were ignored.
A thorough analysis of Mann’s “Hockey-Stick” graph was made by Dr. Stephen McIntyre and Dr. Ross McKitrick in their paper:
“Corrections to the Mann et al. (1998) Proxy Data Base and Northern Hemispheric Average Temperature Series.”
McIntyre and McKitrick commented:
“The dataset used to make this construction contained collation errors, unjustified truncation or extrapolation of source data, obsolete data, incorrect principal component calculations, geographical mislocations and other serious defects.”
And:
“The extent of errors and defects in the MBH98 data means that the indexes computed from it are unreliable and cannot be used for comparisons between the current climate and that of past centuries, including claims like “temperatures in the latter half of the 20th century were unprecedented.”
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1260/095830503322793632
McIntyre had really exposed the flaws in the “hockey stick” but this wasn’t appreciated by Mann who acidly wrote in August, 2007:
“I have been talking [with] folks in the States about finding an investigative journalist to investigate and expose [him].”
 https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2011/11/23/climategate-2-0-new-e-mails-rock-the-global-warming-debate/#ce6a70527ba6
As Dr. Jim Lacey, Professor of Strategic Studies at the Marine Corps War College pointed out:
“Rather than contest McIntyre’s findings with evidence and data, Mann decided that his best alternative was to smear his challenger’s reputation. Skeptics always had to be on the watch for Mann’s spiteful attacks. But what is interesting is that many of his fellow warmists had a low opinion of his work. Despite this, they were slow to criticize Mann – partly because they did not want to give the skeptics any more ammunition, but also because they were afraid of him. As one warmist wrote to Jones, Mann was a “serious enemy” and “vindictive.”

A number of other scientists and statisticians criticized Mann’s “hockey-stick” graph, including expert statisticians Dr. Edward Wegman from George Mason University, Dr. David Scott from Rice University, and Dr. Yasmin Said from the Johns Hopkins University.
The Wegman Report concluded:
“Overall, our committee believes that Mann’s assessments that the decade of the 1990s was the hottest decade of the millennium and that 1998 was the hottest year of the millennium cannot be supported by his analysis.”
 http://www.lavoisier.com.au/articles/greenhouse-science/temperature-data/Wegmanfactsheet.pdf
The question must be asked – how did Mann’s “hockey-stick” get past peer-review? The answer is – it didn’t have to and Wegman explained why:
“There is a tightly knit group of individuals who passionately believe in their thesis. However, our perception is that this group has a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism and, moreover, the work has been sufficiently politicized that they can hardly reassess their public positions without losing credibility.”
 https://jennifermarohasy.com/2006/07/global-warming-icon-hit-for-six/
And:
“As statisticians, we were struck by the isolation of communities such as the paleoclimate community that rely heavily on statistical methods, yet do not seem to be interacting with the mainstream statistical community. The public policy implications of this debate are financially staggering and yet apparently no independent statistical expertise was sought or used.”
 http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2010/08/paper-many-climate-science-papers.html
There was mounting criticism so the IPCC quietly dropped Mann’s infamous “hockey-stick” graph from subsequent reports and, if the aim was to get strong media coverage and to influence politicians, then the IPCC had achieved this.
The demolition of the “hockey-stick” didn’t stop Al Gore from using it in his discredited movie “An Inconvenient Truth” that was shown to promote the climate alarmist message that had little basis in fact. A later High Court judgement in London was highly critical of Gore’s “imaginative” and “politically-motivated” movie.
http://www.wildsingapore.com/news/20070910/071009-4.htm
Mann’s contrived graph has also been used to promote the “Kyoto Protocol” and the UN’s “Agenda 21″ with the likely intentions of controlling the lives of those who actually accepted the IPCC’s climate alarmism.
An increasing number of prominent climate scientists, such as Dr. Judith Curry doubted the validity of Mann’s “hockey-stick” graph and Canadian statistical experts Dr. Steve McIntyre and Dr. Ross McKitrick had already exposed numerous errors in Mann’s work.
Energy consultant Dr. Philip Bratby, in his submission to the UK Parliament, wrote:
“It is concluded that over at least a period of 20 years, climate science has been seriously compromised by the actions of a small group of scientists who have attempted to control the debate about climate change. The effects of this are potentially profound. For example a generation of work may have been corrupted and may be unreliable. A generation of students may have been corrupted and their work may be unreliable.”
 https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/memo/climatedata/uc1702.htm
Although many in the scientific community saw through this “data- massaging” episode, many media commentators and some politicians, wanted to maintain the climate alarm. Incredibly Mann’s infamous “hockey-stick” graph had become a central icon for climate alarmists and is still trotted out by a number of vested interest groups.
Former Professor of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg, Dr. Tim Ball was one of many scientists who were not fooled by Mann’s “hockey stick” graph. He knew that emails leaked from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia showed that other scientists also knew exactly what was going on. Ball was quite explicit in his criticism:
“The argument that global warming is due to humans, known as the anthropogenic global warming theory (AGW) is a deliberate fraud. I can now make that statement without fear of contradiction because of a remarkable hacking of files that provided not just a smoking gun, but an entire battery of machine guns.” 
And:
“Carbon dioxide was never a problem and all the machinations and deceptions exposed by these files prove that it is the greatest deception in history, but nobody is laughing. It is a very sad day for science.”  
https://www.iceagenow.com/Climategate.htm
Ball, referring to Mann’s position at Pennsylvania State University, famously quipped that Mann: “belongs in the state pen, not Penn State.”

Mann wasn’t happy with this and, rather than argue the science, he took legal action, filing a libel suit against Ball in the British Columbia Supreme Court in Canada.
John O’Sullivan observed:
“Facing each other is Plaintiff, Dr. Michael Mann (he of ‘hockey stick’ graph infamy) representing so-called UN ‘consensus’ climate science. Mann claims his work proves humans are dangerously warming the planet. Defendant, retired Canadian climatologist, Dr. Timothy Ball believes Mann was a key player in the Climategate scandal and has hidden his dodgy tree-ring data for over 13 years to cover up fakery in the numbers.”
 http://climaterealists.com/index.php?id=8796andlinkbox=trueandposition=8
In September, 2011, the Canadian court asked for Mann’s data with which the “hockey-stick” graph was produced. Mann refused, stating that “private ownership” blocks any Freedom of Information claim.
Dr. Tim Ball further observed:
“We believe that he [Mann] withheld on the basis of a US court ruling that it was all his intellectual property. This ruling was made despite the fact the US taxpayer paid for the research and the research results were used as the basis of literally earth-shattering policies on energy and environment. The problem for him is that the Canadian court holds that you cannot withhold documents that are central to your charge of defamation regardless of the US ruling.”
 https://www.cfact.org/2017/07/26/michael-manns-hockey-stick-hypocrisy/
The saga dragged on for more than 5 years until, in February 2017, the British Columbia Court finally instructed Mann to hand over all data relevant to the “hockey-stick” graph. He didn’t comply and so the court decided that Mann’s non-compliance was compelling evidence that he had no intention of proving that Ball had defamed him. This was a cynical attempt by Mann to silence Ball and prevent any further criticism of his data manipulation.
Mann failed to demonstrate that he had not “massaged” his tree ring proxy data for the past 1,000 years and, after 9 years had passed, Mann’s case against Ball was dismissed by the Hon. Mr. Justice Giaschi on 22nd Aug 2019 in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
All Michael Mann was asked to do was go before the Court and produce empirical evidence proving the veracity of his “hockey-stick” graph. He failed to do this and his case was thrown out with Ball being awarded court costs.

Mann has also turned his legal sights on author Mark Steyn. In 2015, Steyn wrote:
“My name is Mark Steyn. I am not a scientist. I am an author. My main interest in climate science is that Michael E Mann, the inventor of one of its most notorious artifacts, is suing me for “defamation of a Nobel Prize winner” – a crime that I was not aware existed, especially in his case, as according to the Nobel Institute he is not a Nobel Prize winner. So I recently edited a book about it called “A Disgrace to the Profession”: The World’s Scientists – in Their Own Words – On Michael E Mann, His Hockey Stick, and Their Damage to Science, Volume One -which I’m proud to say was Number One on the Climatology Hit Parade.”

Many scientists might say that Mann and the IPCC’s work serve as a shining example of how science can be abused for political/ideological reasons. They might also say that the meme of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is already proving to be the biggest fraud in the history of science. In fact many scientists are now being forthright in their public criticism of the IPCC.
The late Dr. Vincent Gray, climate consultant, long-standing member of the New Zealand Royal Society and founder of the New Zealand Climate Coalition was an expert reviewer for all four IPCC Assessment Reports. He described the IPCC’s climate change statements as:
“An orchestrated litany of lies.” 
 http://www.climatescienceinternational.org/index.php?option=com_contentandtask=viewandid=92andItemid=1
Gray went on to say:
“It is now evident that the promoters of the greenhouse theory are not just deluded – in order to promote their delusion that the planet is being destroyed by humans, they resorted to many forms of deception, dishonesty, distortion and downright fraud to impose policies for which there is no scientific evidence.”
Gray, V. (2015). “The Global warming Scam and Climate Change Superscam.” Stairway Press.
Dr. Christopher Kobus, Professor of engineering at Oakland University said:
“In essence, the jig is up. The whole thing is a fraud. And even the fraudsters that fudged data are admitting to temperature history that they used to say didn’t happen… Perhaps what has doomed the Climategate fraudsters the most was their brazenness in fudging the data.” 
 https://www.briansussman.com/commentary/climate-change-the-jig-is-up/
Geophysicist Dr. Norm Kalmanovitch agrees:
When the cooling started in 2002 climate change and advocacy for following the dictates of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change went from an issue of science to an issue of fraud, so it is no longer up to the scientists to disprove the AGW hypothesis as much as it is up to the lawyers to lead a class action against this fraud which has crippled the economy and caused global starvation as basic food staples are being used as feedstock for biofuels so the perpetrators of this fraud can increase their wealth trading carbon credits.
https://ilovemycarbondioxide.com/index3.html
As does Dr. Don Easterbrook from Western Washington University:
“The corruption within the IPCC revealed by the Climategate scandal, the doctoring of data and the refusal to admit mistakes have so severely tainted the IPCC that it is no longer a credible agency.”
 https://principia-scientific.org/media-whitewashes-climategate-scandal-one-decade-on/
As does Dr. Harold Lewis, Emeritus Professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara:
“Climategate was a fraud on a scale I have never seen.”
And:
“… the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, and has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist.” 
 https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2010/10/scientist-says-no/
A final word from Mark Steyn who added:
“I despise Michael Mann for many reasons, not least for the damage his peculiar insecurities have done to honest inquiry and scientific integrity.”
 https://www.steynonline.com/7661/the-craziness-of-the-climate-science-echo-chamber
And:
“Phil Jones and Michael Mann are two of the most influential figures in the whole “climate change” racket. What these documents reveal is the greatest scientific scandal of our times – and a tragedy. It’s not just their graphs but their battle lines that are drawn all wrong. Science is never settled and certainly not on the basis of predictive models. And any scientist who says it is is no longer a scientist. And the dismissal of “skeptics” throughout the Jones/Mann correspondence is most revealing: a real scientist is always a skeptic.”
https://www.steynonline.com/9864/how-the-science-got-settled
Once more, we have Dr. Michael Mann suing someone for pointing out his questionable science.
 Scientists with integrity would defend their position on a scientific subject with evidence and logical argument. They wouldn’t resort to legal action to silence their critics.
Once more, it would appear that Mann has little prospect of winning.

https://carbon-sense.com/2020/02/26/electric-vehicles-and-green-energy/,,The Looming Collision between Electric Vehicles and Green Energy,"by Viv Forbes
Two green-dream fantasies are heading for a massive and costly collision.
Firstly they dream of generating all grid power from wind/solar propped up by battery storage (such as lots of giant Tesla batteries and pumped hydro).
Secondly they dream of replacing all petrol/diesel/gas cars, trucks and buses with electric vehicles, powered by more batteries.
But wind farms do well if they can average about 35% of their rated capacity with low predictability, while solar panels average just 25% of their capacity, produced intermittently. To generate zero emissions energy for Australia, we would need hills covered with turbines, flats covered with solar panels, the countryside spider-webbed with access roads and transmission lines, and much more hydro.
To stabilise a green energy system without using hydrocarbons will require an eye-watering quantity of batteries, costing as much as 200 times the cost of any wind/solar facility needing backup. Every home will need a battery in the basement (and sensible ones will also have a diesel in the shed).
Add to this battery bonanza millions of batteries will be needed to electrify and replace our fleet of petrol/diesel vehicles.
No wonder cynical mining companies like BHP are going green – they smell a jackpot from the coming green boom in demand for steel, aluminium, lithium, copper, nickel, graphite, cobalt, rare earths and nuclear fuels. And no wonder Tesla supports green energy – the total annual output of the world’s biggest battery factory in Nevada would store less than five minutes of annual US electricity demand. And they also see booming demand for electric vehicle batteries. No wonder Tesla shares have gone ballistic (the boom before the crash?).
The carbon dioxide emitted by all the extra mining, transport, manufacture and disposal of green energy generators and batteries would far exceed the CO2 allegedly saved by the threatened green upheaval.
All Australians rely on trucks to deliver their daily food to towns and cities – in road trains, semi-trailers, refrigerated trucks and electric trains, almost all powered by diesel, coal or gas. If they were all-electric and powered by batteries, where will the electricity come from to recharge all of these batteries? In tomorrow’s Australia it must come from an unreliable wind/solar grid, hydro power or diesel generators.
Take a look at the video below at a road train taking cattle to market in the Kimberley region in outback Australia. One truck on its own would bog in the soft sand or in creek crossings, but with a 4WD tractor, four diesel semis and eight trailers linked in a road train, at least one set of driving wheels is likely to be on solid ground. In the electric vehicle fantasy-world, what weight of batteries would drive this road train and where would they recharge their batteries?

Even if they just focus on forcing electrification of private cars where does the real power come from every night when most of them plug in to re-charge? If it is a still night, ZERO electricity will be coming from wind and solar. That leaves coal, gas, batteries, pumped-hydro, rationing, load-shedding or blackouts to close the gap.
Forget energy-wasting nonsense like capture and burial of CO2, and the energy-consuming roundabout of generating and then burning hydrogen. The zero-emissions delusion is impossible without nuclear power, but this can only happen if people can be reassured on nuclear safety and waste disposal. Are the Greens going to lead that education process?
And if we get global cooling instead of global warming, what will keep us warm on long still winter nights? Any state or country reaching for these impossible green dreams is destined for blackouts and energy riots on the streets.
It’s time for Australian politicians to stop frolicking with green fairies around the zero emissions maypole. Green energy will never power a conversion to electric vehicles. They must remove all barriers and climate taxes on safe, reliable, trusted energy sources – coal, gas and oil.

We need more reliable cheap power for jobs and industry and more CO2 in the atmosphere to make green plants grow faster with less water.

https://carbon-sense.com/2020/02/16/do-green-buses-pass-the-performance-test/,,Do ‘Green’ Buses Pass the Performance Test?,"By Duggan Flanakin
Should Americans follow China in a massive commitment to supposedly eco-friendly battery-electric buses (BEBs)? California has mandated a “carbon-free” bus system by 2040 and will buy only battery or  fuel cell-powered buses after 2029. Other states and cities are following suit.
Vehicle decisions are typically based on cost and performance. Cost includes selling price plus maintenance, while performance now includes perceived environmental impacts – which for some is the only issue that matters. But that perception ignores some huge ecological (and human rights) issues.
China today has 420,000 BEBs on the road, with plans to reach 600,000 by 2025. The rest of the world has maybe 5,000 of these expensive, short-range buses. However, the Chinese still get 70% of their energy from coal, so are their BEBs really that green? Are they safe? And are they really ethical?
Battery costs are the main reason BEBs today are much more expensive than buses that run on diesel or compressed natural gas. But bus makers say electric buses require less maintenance, and climate activists say the lower net “carbon footprint” (carbon dioxide emissions) justifies paying a little more.
China gets around the up-front cost problem by establishing national mandates, heavily subsidizing bus (and battery) manufacturers, and rewarding cities that replace entire bus fleets at one time. This ensures that their factories benefit from economies of scale – and that the transition will be swift and complete.
Beijing simply dodges the environmental costs by ignoring the fossil fuels, horrific pollution and human illnesses involved in mining, ore processing and manufacturing processes associated with building the buses. California and other “renewable” energy advocates do likewise. In fact, those costs will skyrocket as China, California and the world emphasize electric vehicle, wind, solar and battery technologies.
Meanwhile, the USA and EU nations focus on subsidizing passenger cars. Thus, there are far more zero-emission passenger cars on the road today in the U.S. and Europe than public transit vehicles. No wonder Westerners still view electric vehicles as subsidized luxuries for the “woke wealthy,” who boast about lowering their carbon footprint, despite also often needing fossil fuel electricity to charge batteries.
The huge costs for fast-charging stations across Europe, let alone the vast United States, pose more huge challenges for future expansion of the electric vehicle market. But transit vehicles, even school buses, run regular routes, and if the routes are short enough, the bus can be recharged overnight in the garages.
Tax credits, free HOV lane access, free charging stations and other subsidies for the rich are seen by most as terrible policies. Yet another, says University of California-Davis researcher Hanjiro Ambrose, is the Federal Transit Administration funding formulas that favor short-term cost-efficiency over long-term innovation. “Those funding mechanisms haven’t been aligned with trying to stimulate policy change,” Ambrose says. “The cheapest technology available isn’t usually the newest technology available.”
To work around high upfront battery costs, innovative capitalists are creating  new financial products that allow fleet owners to finance battery purchases. Treating battery costs the same way as fuel costs – as ongoing expenses – meets federal guidelines. Matt Horton, chief commercial officer for U.S. BEB maker Proterra, says, “The importance of the private capital coming into this market cannot be understated.”
Green advocates admit  the primary reason people choose EVs is their belief that electric cars and buses, even with electricity generated from fossil fuels, are good for the environment. The Union of Concerned Scientists claims BEBs are 2.5 times cleaner in terms of lifespan emissions than diesel buses. That is highly questionable. Moreover, BEBs with today’s strongest batteries can take a full load no more than 150 miles in good weather. That’s fine for airport shuttles, maybe even for short public transit routes.
However, electric battery life is shorter than the 12-year vehicle life that many transit and school bus systems rely upon in their budgets. Battery replacement for BEBs is very expensive and unpredictable.
And then there are the  horror stories. Los Angeles Metro purchased BEBs from Chinese-owned BYD Ltd. but yanked the first five off the road within a few months. Agency staff called the buses “unsuitable,” poorly made, and unreliable for more than 100 miles. Albuquerque returned seven out of its 16 BYD buses, citing cracks, leaking fluid, axle problems and inability to hold charges.
French journalist  Alon Levy reported that BEB sales teams in Vancouver admitted their buses could not run for an entire day without recharging during layovers. Worse, in Minneapolis, bus performance suffers tremendously in cold weather: at 20o F buses cannot last all day; on Super Bowl Sunday, at 5o F, a battery bus lasted only 40 minutes and traveled barely 16 miles. Imagine being in a BEB in a blizzard.
In largely rural Maine, lawmakers proposed converting all school buses to BEBs. But Maine Heritage Policy Center policy analyst  Adam Crepeau found that BEBs can travel no more than 135 miles per charge (in good weather), while diesel buses go up to 400 miles and can be refilled quickly almost anywhere. “This,” he said, “will severely impact the ability of schools to use them for longer trips, for sporting events, field trips and other experiences for students.” Or in bitterly cold Maine winters.
The economic and practical bottom line is simple. Activists and sales teams are pressing American cities, school boards and other public entities to follow China and convert their fleets to BEBs, calling them “the wave of the future.” Even in California, where lengthy power outages have become routine, this climate and anti-fossil ideology dominates. Given the growing vulnerability of our electric grid, among other concerns, cost and performance may not be the only considerations in making such an irreversible choice.
The environmental and ethical bottom line is equally simple – but routinely gets shunted aside.
Electric vehicles require about three times more copper than internal combustion equivalents – plus lithium, cobalt and other metals for their batteries. Wind turbines need some  200 times more steel, copper, plastics, rare earths, concrete and other materials per megawatt than combined-cycle gas turbines. Photovoltaic solar panels have similar materials requirements. 100% “renewable, sustainable” Green New Deal electricity systems on US or Chinese scales would require  millions of turbines, billions of solar panels and billions of half-ton Tesla-style battery packs for cars, buses and backup electricity storage.
Those technologies, on those scales, would require mining at levels unprecedented in world history! And the environmental and human rights record we’ve seen for those high-tech metals is terrifying.
Lithium comes mostly from Tibet and the Argentina-Bolivia-Chile “lithium triangle,” where contaminated lands and waters are poisoning fish, livestock, wildlife and people. Most  cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 40,000 children and their parents slave in open pits and dark, narrow tunnels – and get exposed constantly to filthy, toxic, radioactive mud, dust, water and air. Broken bones, suffocation, blood and respiratory diseases, birth defects, cancer and paralysis are commonplace.
Nearly all the world’s  rare earth elements come from Inner Mongolia. Mining the ores involves pumping acid into the ground and processing them with more acids and chemicals. Black sludge from the operations is piped to a huge foul-smelling “lake” that is surrounded by formerly productive farmlands that are now so toxic that nothing can grow on them, and people and wildlife have just moved away. Here too, severe skin and respiratory diseases, cancers and other terrible illnesses have become commonplace.
In many of these cases, the mining and processing operations are run by Chinese companies, under minimal to nonexistent pollution control, workplace safety, fair wage, child labor or other basic standards that American, Canadian, Australian and European companies are expected to follow.
And this is just for today’s “renewable, sustainable, ethical, Earth-friendly, green” technologies. Just imagine what we are likely to see if China, California, New York, Europe and countless other places start mandating a fossil-fuel-free future – and then shut down nuclear power, to boot. Where will we get all the raw materials? Where will we put all the wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and transmission lines?
The prospect is horrifying. And it’s all justified by exaggerated fears of a climate apocalypse. Crazy!

23 December 2019
Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist who first claimed that the burning of hydro-carbons like coal, oil, gas, peat and wood may cause global warming.
In 1895 he calculated (incorrectly) that a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration would lead to a 4-5 oC rise in global temperature.
However, Arrhenius suggested that this increase could be beneficial, making the various climates on Earth “more equable” and stimulating plant growth and food production.
Then a showman/politician, Al Gore, gave life to the theory that extra carbon dioxide due to human activities will cause dangerous global warming.
But temperatures refused to obey the alarmist computer model forecasts. So they switched to the universal bogey-man – climate-change, where every bit of bad weather was blamed on western industry. But this did not scare enough people so it morphed into climate emergency, which allows coal, oil, gas, cars and cattle to be blamed for everything bad – floods and droughts, snowstorms and heatwaves, bushfires, coral bleaching, species extinction and pollution anywhere.
But the carbon dioxide scare is proving false – it’s time for some climate sense.
Human activity can never control atmospheric CO2 or global temperature. Much bigger forces are at work – solar system cycles, earth orbital changes, volcanic activity (especially on the sea floor), El Nino episodes, declining magnetic field and magnetic pole reversals, variable cosmic rays and cloud cover, and absorption/expulsion of CO2 by the mighty oceans.
Geological records show that today’s CO2 levels are very low – so low that plants grow slower and need more water.
Moreover, the ice core records from Antarctica and Greenland show clearly that atmospheric temperature always rises before CO2 levels rise. So rising CO2 is the effect of rising temperature not the cause. Warming oceans are like warming beer – they both expel bubbles of CO2 into the atmosphere. When oceans cool, they take it back.
The dense plant and animal populations in equatorial regions shows that humans need not fear global warming – in fact the Russian President has welcomed the possibility of warming for his cold land.
We live in a natural warm interlude but we are past the warming peak. There will still be fluctuations and extreme weather events but the next big move will be global cooling – the 11th freeze-up in about a million years. All it needs are oceans heated by submarine volcanoes, and skies made cold by volcanic ash that blocks incoming solar energy. This will trigger evaporation of water from the oceans and heavy snowfalls on land. Once the summer sun fails to melt all the winter snow, glaciers and ice sheets will advance again. The increased albedo from the snow and ice will cause further cooling.
Ice ages have been a periodic threat to much of life on Earth. As the ice sheets spread from the North Pole there will be massive depopulation and survivors will need to relearn hunter-gatherer skills or have access to reliable energy. Wind turbines and solar panels will not work in snowy conditions and many hydro-energy supplies will also freeze up. Even the Great Niagara Falls froze in 1848 during the Little Ice Age.
But the UN climate bureaucracy will probably still collect climate taxes and organise well-fed conferences in places with a warm climate and reliable power.
Alarmism over climate is the great gravy train for academics, bureaucrats, speculators, globalists and politicians seeking excuses for more power and more taxes.
“Climate emergency” is an exercise in global politics, not science. The plan is to scare us into transferring money and power from western nations to the UN – a fake answer to an invented problem.

A silly statement about the obvious. He then added:
“In the Northern Hemisphere the last 30 years have been the warmest since Anglo-Saxon times; indeed, eight of the ten warmest years on record in the UK have occurred since 2002.”
Except that, looking a little further back, the Medieval Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period and the Minoan Warm Period were all significantly warmer than anything experienced in recent times.
Perhaps Carney can tell us what caused those 3 global warming episodes. But then, I’m wondering if Carney has even heard of those historic periods.

Perhaps Carney can draw on his knowledge of climate science and tell us WHY the Earth warmed during the Medieval Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period and the Minoan Warm Period and WHY the Earth has been cooling since the end of the Cretaceous period, around 65 million years ago:

But again, I’m left wondering if Carney even knows about this long-term cooling trend.
I’m also wondering if Carney knows that the alarmist Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has now acknowledge the temperature stasis over the last 20 years.
Mark Carney went on to say:
“Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are at levels not seen in 800,000 years.”
Except that current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, at 400 ppm are amongst the lowest in 500 million years.
Carney added to the drama:
“The rate of sea level rise is quicker now than at any time over the last 2 millennia.”
Except that Dr. Nils-Axel Morner, a world authority on sea levels, points out that:
“Many key sites and test sites show little or no rise at all.”
And:
“Nowhere do we find records of true “acceleration.”
And:
“Satellite altimetry show a mean rise of 0.5 ±0.1 mm/yr.”
And:
“Past sea level oscillations have been faster and steeper that in the last century.”
 https://www.climatedepot.com/2016/02/23/sea-level-expert-rips-study-claiming-fastest-rise-in-2800-years-study-full-of-very-bad-violations-of-observational-facts/

I’m also wondering if Carney, or any other bankers, realise that the Earth is currently experiencing a carbon dioxide famine:

No surprise then that the UN’s socialist Secretary General and serial climate alarmist Antonio Guterres announced at the “failed-again” 2019 COP 25 meeting:
“I’m pleased to announce that Mr. Mark Carney, who is presently the Governor of the Bank of England and a remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to act on climate, has accepted to be my Special Envoy on Climate Action and Climate.”
Bing.com Antonio Guterres
Well we can hardly expect the UN’s “Special Envoy on Climate Action and Climate” to be measured in his comments about climate change. Nor can we expect him to be measured about the use of hydrocarbon fuels since he has already espoused the view that “fossil fuels are becoming stranded”.
Except that oil, gas and coal are seeing increasing production “due to increasing demand with no viable alternative in sight.”
 https://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/follow-the-money-part-2-goldman-sachs-getting-their-sitting-carbon-ducks-in-a-row/
Carney’s wife, Diana Fox Carney, is a well-known green activist who: “co-authored a report for a progressive policy think tank warning about potential climate change-related losses to Britain’s economy. The report argues that financial markets are failing to address the problem adequately and recommended steps to reduce climate-related risks.”
 https://www.ippr.org/files/publications/pdf/known-unknowns_2nd-ed_March2016.pdf
I suspect that the Carneys frequently discuss green ideology and what’s best for the world. Nigel Lawson certainly has his doubts.
In response to a number of dire climate-related predictions by Mark Carney, Lord Nigel Lawson of Blaby replied:
“Although the economy is now doing very much better, there are a whole lot of remaining problems in the financial sector – some of which you alluded to in your opening statements others of which we’ve discussed this afternoon.”
He added:
“Wouldn’t it be better if you focused your attention on those instead of engaging in green claptrap?”
 https://www.thegwpf.com/nigel-lawson-grills-boe-governor-mark-carney-on-energy-risks/
Unfortunately for the developing world, other bank personnel have echoed the same climate pseudoscience as espoused by Mark Carney.
In 2015, the IMF/World bank Group, with President Jim Yong Kim, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, indicated a need to put a price on carbon (dioxide) whilst phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.
 https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/04/18/raising-trillions-for-climate-finance.
Jim Yong Kim said that the World Bank will stop all lending for oil and gas projects after 2019.
Rupert Darwall has shown how the World Bank’s policies are stifling development in poor countries whilst condemning their people to poverty and starvation. He describes the bank’s funding of inefficient, unreliable wind and solar power as:
“An inhumane and senseless attempt to try and save the planet on the backs of the world’s poor.”
Darwall argues that:
“The World Bank should lift its 2013 ban on financing coal-fired power stations and help the world’s poorest by supporting the next generation of low-emission power stations.”
https://www.thegwpf.org/world-bank-abandons-the-poor/
The European Investment Bank (EIB) officials had already phased out lending to coal projects in 2013 and they agreed to phase out lending to oil and gas projects by the end of 2021. EIB president Werner Hoyer said the bank’s decision was:
“A quantum leap in its ambition. We will stop financing fossil fuels and we will launch the most ambitious climate investment strategy of any public financial institution anywhere.”
 https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/11/15/european-investment-bank-ends-lending-fossil-fuel-projects/
In 2018, the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina sensibly said:
“The key challenge for Africa is the generation of power. The continent has the lowest electrification rate in the world. Power consumption per capita in Africa is estimated at 613 kWh per annum, compared to 6,500 kWh in Europe and 13,000 kWh in the United States. Power is the overriding African priority.”
 https://www.cfact.org/2018/07/16/rejecting-carbon-colonialism/?mc_cid=28f5235db7andmc_eid=3a8ed2762d
But someone must have whispered in Adesina’s ear at the Climate Action Summit in New York (September 23, 2019). The President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina appeared to make a U-turn and made clear that the AfDB would stop financing coal, oil and gas. He said:
“Coal is not the future and it is powerful that the AfDB has acknowledged this reality on a global stage. This is a critical step to clean renewable energy for frontline coal communities and a climate just future for all.”
And:
“Continued finance for coal, oil, and gas are not in line with the Paris Agreement. We would also welcome an immediate end to AfDB finance for all fossil fuels, not just coal.”
 http://priceofoil.org/2019/09/25/response-to-african-development-banks-commitment-to-stop-financing-coal/
In Australia, the Reserve Bank’s Deputy Governor, Guy Debelle said in a Public Forum, hosted by the Centre for Policy Development (12th march, 2019):
“The insurance industry has recognised that the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones (and hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere) has changed.”
Bing.com Guy Debelle
Indeed the frequency and severity have changed and a little due diligence from Debelle would have shown him that the change is for the better. Even the alarmist IPCC has acknowledged that extreme weather events have not increased in number or intensity.
 https://fabiusmaximus.com/2017/04/05/reviewing-trends-in-extreme-weather/
Debelle continued:
“The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report documents that 1 degree of warming has already occurred from pre-industrial levels as a result of human activities.”
I doubt that Debelle or any banking officials have read (and understood) the IPCC technical reports. Rather they might have looked at the Summaries For PolicyMakers (SPM’s) that are produced specifically for gullible politicians, the media (and banking officials) and bear little resemblance to the information provided in the technical reports.
In 2019, the National Australia Bank’s chairman Philip Chronican told a parliamentary inquiry that the NAB would:
“Take no new thermal coal mining customers and wind down lending to existing customers to zero by 2035.”
And:
“The bank’s exposure to thermal coal mining stands at $762 million and it would be phased down to about half by 2028 and effectively zero by 2035. The bank would not fund new coal-fired power generation or expansions to existing plants unless there was technology in place to materially reduce emissions.”
 https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6494321/nab-to-stop-lending-to-thermal-coal-mining/
Bing.com Philip Chronican
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has also accepted the junk science that is catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW), announcing plans to work towards exiting thermal coal by 2030, reaffirming its support for a “responsible transition to a net zero emissions economy by 2050.”
 https://www.commbank.com.au/guidance/newsroom/our-climate-commitment-201708.html
Westpac said it would remain in fossil fuel power generation but would transition away over time. It would support new coal mining in existing basins and where the quality of the coal was in the top 15 per cent.
We now have a “Network for Greening the Financial System” (NGFS), launched at the Paris One Planet Summit on the 12th December 2017. This is a group of 18 Central Banks that believe the carbon dioxide – driven global warming nonsense and agree to contribute to the analysis and management of climate and environment-related risks in the financial sector. The NGFS aim to mobilize finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy.
 https://www.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/media/2018/10/11/818366-ngfs-first-progress-report-20181011.pdf
There are a number of other groups such as “Market Forces” that have brought pressure to bear on banks and organizations by actively encouraging people to lobby those banks that provide finance to companies producing hydrocarbon energy. The Market Forces website lists those banks that provide such finance and those who do not. Their website says:
“Market Forces is about “using your money as a force for good”. With our banks comparison table we aim to show people which banks are investing in the fossil fuel industry and enable individuals to take action, whether by calling for better action from a bank or finding an alternative bank that isn’t financing the coal, oil and gas industries. We’ve included over 120 banks, mutuals and credit unions in our table and tried to make it easy for you to find information and take action to change your bank’s behaviour, or just change your bank!”
 https://www.marketforces.org.au/info/compare-bank-table/about-the-banks-comparision-table/
The questions must be asked:
Do those banking officials that have decided to stop funding the mining of coal and the exploration for oil and gas really believe that their decision will make one iota of difference to global carbon dioxide emissions?
The sum total of human emissions is around 3% and, should the human race stop emitting carbon dioxide altogether, it would make absolutely no difference to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels since 97% of atmospheric carbon dioxide comes from natural sources that even bank officials cannot control.
Do those banking officials that have decided to stop funding the mining of coal and the exploration for oil and gas really believe that China, Indonesia, India and a host of other countries would be foolish enough to stop using inexpensive, high energy-density hydrocarbon fuels?

Countries such as China, Indonesia and India rightly want the lifestyle we enjoy and they will continue to lift their people out of poverty using hydrocarbon fuels. Virtue-signalling bankers need to understand the following facts:
1. There are over one trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves globally – enough to last for more than 150 years at current demand.
2. Those countries that have the largest coal reserves, such as China, India, Russia and the US will continue to use and export coal to those countries that need it. They don’t care one jot about any of the foolish, feel-good policies that Australian politicians and bankers might dream up.
3. Virtue-signalling policies from naïve bankers would hamstring our industries and energy market and do nothing to assist the poor in developing countries. The economies of India (with plans to build around 370 new coal-fired power plants), Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea will grow their economies since they have plans to increase their combined coal-fired generating capacity by more than 60% by 2019.
 https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2015/04/18/india-to-push-ahead-with-coal/amp/
4. China will start work on six to eight nuclear power plants annually for the next five years and operate 110 plants by 2030 to meet its energy needs.
 https://www.firstpost.com/world/china-to-invest-78-bn-to-build-110-nuclear-power-plants-by-2030-will-overtake-us-2471414.html
China produces 5 times as much coal as the US and almost as much as the rest of the world combined. Additionally, the Chinese spent 15 billion USD building coal plants outside China between 2013 and 2016.
As President Xi Jinping said at the 19thNational Congress of the Communist Party of China:
“No one should expect China to swallow anything that undermines its interests.”
 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/xi-jinping-speech-new-era-chinese-power-party-congress
Apparently, Australian and other bankers will swallow anything that is even slightly green.
Globally, there are over 500 coal-fired power plants under construction with a further 2,000 planned in South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Madagascar, Mauritius, Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, The Gambia, Morocco, Egypt, Indonesia, Phillippines, Vietnam, Burma, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Armenia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, Iran, Israel, Turkey, Greece, Hungary, Herzegovina, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, USA
 https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2017/07/electricity-hope-lost/
It’s such a pity that banking officials don’t reflect and reject the ridiculous claims from environmental activists such as Dr. Tim Flannery who (amongst many other silly things) foolishly told Australian politicians that:
“The social licence of coal to operate is rapidly being withdrawn globally.”
 https://www.abc.net.au/lateline/tony-jones-speaks-with-australian-of-the-year-dr/2189970

Why would anyone believe this kind of activist nonsense?
As the Indian Minister for State Power, Piyush Goyai said:
“Just as in all other countries, including the developed world, coal will continue to remain the mainstay of our energy related needs for the foreseeable future. In all fairness, it would not be correct to say or to expect India to move away from coal when we are at the cusp of our developmental journey.”
 https://www.uschamber.com/above-the-fold/there-are-gigawatts-good-reasons-still-mine-coal
Why don’t Australian bank personnel place our economy above pointless attempts to “save the planet” that are ham-stringing our industries when other countries have no intention of disadvantaging theirs?
Tragically, there are still more than 1 billion people around the world that have no access to affordable, reliable energy. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, only a mere 24% of the population has access to reliable electric power and hydrocarbon fuels will be essential to meet their needs.
South Africa is the most advanced and electrified nation in the sub-Saharan yet even that country does not have sufficient reliable power to prevent the blackouts that stop factory and mining production, school closures and the restriction of hospital operations.
Unlike unreliable, inefficient solar and wind sources, inexpensive, high-energy-density hydrocarbon fuels are essential for those countries wanting to lift their people out of poverty and to give them the quality lifestyle that we take for granted.
They need reliable, inexpensive electricity for cooling or heating their homes and for cooking, rather than having to burn wood or animal dung.
They need hydrocarbon fuels for their transport and for the production of raw materials for roads, buildings and all aspects of their life.
All bankers need to understand that energy poverty means real poverty, disease and malnutrition.
As African columnist Steven Lyazi says:
“But it is also because callous, imperialistic people in rich countries use exaggerated, imaginary or phony environmental concerns and fake disasters to justify laws, regulations and excuses not to let poor countries use fossil fuels or nuclear power or develop their economies.”
And:
“They tell us we should only use renewable energy. They say nuclear power is dangerous, and oil, gas and coal are dirty and cause dangerous climate change. They don’t seem to think or care about the poverty, diseases and starvation that we suffer because we do not have fossil fuels.”
 https://townhall.com/columnists/stevenlyazi/2016/12/01/the-world-needs-more-energy-n2253070
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that, in Africa:
“The primary causes of death in children under-5 include pneumonia, preterm birth complications, diarrhoea, birth asphyxia and malaria. Approximately one third of all childhood deaths are linked to malnutrition in the African Region.”
And:
“Malnutrition makes newborns and children vulnerable to both infectious and non-infectious diseases through a weakened immune system.”
https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/child-health
These people need inexpensive, reliable energy for their housing, hospitals, education, transportation and guaranteed food supplies yet thoughtless protesters opposing the Adani and other coal mines would deprive millions of people in developing countries of that inexpensive, reliable electricity supply.
Those selfish protesters call it “climate justice” and Greta Thunberg is one of them.
Greta is angry and wants coal, oil and gas left in the ground:

Professor David Bellamy OBE died recently at the age of 86 and it’s fair to say he goes down in history as one of the first victims sacrificed on the altar of the new religion of climate change.
David Bellamy was a prolific broadcaster, respected authority on botany of the natural world. He wrote and appeared in, or presented, hundreds of television programs on botany, ecology, environmentalism and other issues. But was ultimately disowned by the BBC, never to appear again within their hallowed halls once his declared stance against the new religion of CAGW became known.

I never met him but we corresponded and both appeared on an Australian TV interview. He was very interested in our green sheep, see:

https://carbon-sense.com/2019/12/18/lancet-and-climate-science/,,"Hopefully, Lancet Personnel Know More about Medicine than They Know about Climate Science","By Dr. John Happs
A “Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change” report was published in 2015, with 46 signatories contributing to a document that claimed:
“To map out the impacts of climate change, and the necessary policy responses, in order to ensure the highest attainable standards of health for populations worldwide.” 
The executive summary reported:
“The effects of climate change are being felt today, and future projections represent an unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health.”
And:
“The direct effects of climate change include increased heat stress, floods, drought, and increased frequency of intense storms, with the indirect threatening population health through adverse changes in air pollution, the spread of disease vectors, food insecurity and under-nutrition, displacement, and mental ill health.” 
That report was emotive, exaggerated and lacked supportive empirical evidence. It was thoroughly critiqued by Dr. Weston Allen and his analysis can be found here:
 https://theclimatescepticsparty.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-lancet-commissions-health-and.html
A follow-up, but equally inaccurate article has been published more recently. This article is called:
“The 2019 Report of The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change: Ensuring that the Health of a Child Born Today is not Defined by a Changing Climate.”
Dr. Mikko Pauno, adjunct Professor in epidemiology at the University of Helsinki examined this report and concluded:
“The Lancet Countdown Report is dangerous nonsense.”
 https://www.thegwpf.com/the-lancet-countdown-report-is-dangerous-nonsense/
Undeterred by this and other criticism, a number of Lancet affiliates, including Dr. Tony Bartone (elected Federal President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) in 2018) have produced articles and given media interviews that have attempted to promote the climate alarmist pseudoscience contained in both the 2015 and 2019 reports.
 

In an article written by Katherine Murphy, Political Editor for The Guardian (3rd September, 2019), Bartone continued to promote the same unsubstantiated climate alarmism along the lines:
“There is no doubt that climate change is a health emergency.”
He went on to state that global warming is responsible for:
“Increasing the environment and situations in which infectious diseases can be transmitted.”
Against all the evidence, Bartone said we are experiencing:
“More extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves.”
And
“Climate change will cause higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress.” 
Dr. Bartone said the AMA would continue to assess the evidence about climate change as it emerged and update its stance to reflect the science.
I suspect that neither Bartone nor reporters at The Guardian are remotely interested in what the science says about climate change. They have an agenda and for good measure, Katherine Murphy promoted the carbon dioxide threat – without giving us any figures of course:
“Emissions in Australia have increased every year since the Abbott government repealed a national carbon price after taking office in 2013.”
 https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/03/australian-medical-association-declares-climate-change-a-health-emergency
The spectre of more heatwaves, the spread of insect-borne disease and heat-related deaths continue to be paraded by Bartone (on behalf of the AMA) whilst even a casual survey of the peer-reviewed, published literature shows those claims to be nothing more than unsubstantiated nonsense.
Dr. Bartone was quoted as saying:
“The climate science suggests warming will affect human health and wellbeing by increasing the environment and situations in which infectious diseases can be transmitted, and through more extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves.”
Alarmist claims of more heatwaves are easily checked since we have very good temperature records going back to the19th century. For instance, we can examine the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index from 1895-2015:

 
 https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-high-and-low-temperatures
We can see from the above that heat-waves in the US have been few and far between since the 1930’s.
It is easy to see how an alarmist media can exaggerate the occurrence of US heat-waves with selectivity and the gentle massaging of data:
 

Now it’s starting to look more scary and alarmists can stretch the Y axis to make it look even more scary.
As Dr. John Christy reported in his written Senate Committee testimony:
“Much of the alarm related to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations shifted in the past decade from global temperature changes to changes in extreme events, i.e. those events which typically have a negative impact on the economy. In terms of heat waves, below is the number of 100 °F days observed in the U.S. from a controlled set of weather stations. It is not only clear that hot days have not increased, but it is interesting that in the most recent years there has been a relative dearth of them.”
(My emphasis)
 https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ef_rrt_ac-heat-waves.pdf
Climate alarmists might want to look up the following website that lists 108 graphs from 89 peer-reviewed, published papers, all refuting claims of unprecedented global-scale modern warming:
 https://notrickszone.com/2018/08/02/108-graphs-from-89-new-papers-invalidate-claims-of-unprecedented-global-scale-modern-warmth/
What about heatwaves in Australia? Again, evidence shows that record heatwaves are a thing of the past and a little more due diligence by Dr. Bartone would have found such evidence, although I suspect he might want that to remain out of sight.
Bartone should consider the following:
The major drought periods of 1895-1905 (Federation Drought); 1958-68 and 1982-83 were more severe than any recent events.
N. Queensland experienced a 70 year drought between 1801-70.
On January 12th, 1896, 47 people died in a heatwave in Bourke, NSW. Temperatures averaged 47oC for 13 days.
From 1923 – 24 Marble Bar set the world heatwave record: 160 consecutive days with temperatures over 38oC
We all know what climate alarmists at the AMA would say if those temperatures were experienced today.
Even the alarmist IPCC conceded:
“In summary, the current assessment concludes that there is not enough evidence at present to suggest more than low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century.”
 https://www.thegwpf.org/gwpf-criticises-ofcom-for-getting-it-wrong-on-the-ipcc-and-extreme-weather/
Ignoring other facts, Dr. Bartone continued with the drama:
“Climate change will cause increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases.”
Presumably, by climate change, Bartone means global warming of which several reliable, accurate and uncontaminated satellite data sets show there has been no warming for at least 20 years and even the alarmist IPCC has now admitted as much.
Of course that is why the weasel-terms “climate change” or “climate extremes” are now used by alarmists such as Bartone.
Before anyone promotes the idea of a warming planet causing an increasing spread of insect-borne diseases, they really should consult publications by the world’s foremost expert on insect-borne disease. Professor Paul Reiter works at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and is chief of its Insects and Infectious Disease Unit. Reiter is a specialist in the natural history and biology of mosquitoes, the epidemiology of the diseases they transmit and strategies for their control.
Reiter was chairman of the American Committee of Medical Entomology of the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and several committees of other professional societies. He has worked for the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization and other agencies in investigations of outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. He was also a contributory author for the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report.
In 2001, the U.S. State Department nominated Reiter to be a lead author of the IPCC’s next health chapter. The IPCC was incorrectly arguing that (imaginary) global warming was increasing the habitats for mosquitoes, putting millions of people in the tropics at risk of contracting malaria and dengue with the prospect that such diseases would spread around the world.
Reiter said:
“I know of no major scientist with any long record in this field who agrees with the pronouncements of the alarmists at the IPCC.”
And:
“On the contrary, all of us who work in the field are repeatedly stunned by the IPCC pronouncements. We protest, but are rarely quoted, and if so, usually as a codicil to the scary stuff.”
 http://jr2020.blogspot.com/2007/03/ipccs-famous-2500-top-scientists.html
Reiter reported that, in its Second Assessment Report (SAR) chapter on human population health, the IPCC displayed “glaring ignorance” about mosquitoes, their survival temperatures and the altitudes where mosquitoes can be found.
The same can now be said of The Lancet report.
The IPCC claimed that malarial mosquitoes are unable to survive temperatures below 16oC, not realizing that many species do and that many temperate species survive temperatures of -25oC. Neither did the IPCC alarmists know at what altitudes mosquitoes are to be found.
In testimony to the UK House of Lords, Reiter said:
“The paucity of information was hardly surprising: Not one of the lead authors had ever written a research paper on the subject. Moreover, two of the authors, both physicians, had spent their entire career as environmental activists.”
 https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/paul-reiters- damning-assessment-of-the-ipcc/
Reiter resigned from the IPCC, saying:
“The IPCC has done a disservice to society by relying on “experts” who have little or no knowledge of the subject and allowing them to make authoritative pronouncements that are not based on sound science. In truth, the principal determinants of transmission of malaria and many other mosquito-borne diseases are politics, economics and human activities.”
http://www.habitat21.co.uk/energy151.html
Malaria continues to kill about 1.5 million people per annum, including around 800,000 children under 5 years of age. Malaria is treatable and preventable with current technology. The majority of cases are found in the sub-Sahara where poverty is the biggest obstacle in dealing with this epidemic.
All personnel at The Lancet should read Gething et al. (May 2010) in the journal Nature. They write:
“It has long been known that the range of malaria has contracted through a century of economic development and disease control.”
And:
“Widespread claims that rising mean temperatures have already led to increases in worldwide malaria morbidity and mortality are largely at odds with observed decreasing global trends in both its endemicity and geographic extent.”
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485434
Malaria has actually receded, contrary to what some climate alarmists would have us believe.
Dr. Bartone was reported as saying:
“Climate change will cause higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress.”
In fact cold weather kills 20 times as many people as does hot weather, according to an international study analyzing over 74 million deaths in 384 locations across 13 countries. Dr. Antonio Gasparrini from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK reported in The Lancet:
“It’s often assumed that extreme weather causes the majority of deaths, with most previous research focusing on the effects of extreme heat waves.”
 https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/tl-tli051915.php
Gasparrini provided evidence to the contrary although Bartone et al. either missed this or decided to ignore it:
 

Dr. Indur Goklany wrote in 2009:
Data from the US National Center for Health Statistics for 2001-2008, shows that on average 7,200 Americans died each day during the months of December, January, February and March, compared to the average 6,400 who died daily during the rest of the year. In 2008, there were 108,500 ‘excess’ deaths during the 122 days in the cold months (December to March).”

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, says:
“The UK has an appalling record on cold-related deaths, with one older person dying every seven minutes from the winter cold. Colder countries like Sweden are better at protecting older people from the cold.”

Maria Wardrobe, director of National Energy Action, adds:
“Cold homes are a bigger killer across the UK than road accidents, drug abuse or alcohol abuse.”

UK MP Dan Jarvis, has raised the issue in Parliament. He told the Prime Minister:
“People should not be dying in the UK in the 21st century because they can’t afford to keep themselves warm in winter.”

Energy poverty in the UK means that many people have to decide whether to “heat or eat.”
An international study covering 384 locations in 13 countries, found that cold weather is responsible for 17 times as many deaths as hot weather.
Evidence was provided from a study of 74 million deaths in 13 cold and warm countries including Thailand, Brazil, the UK, Europe, the US, Australia and Canada:
 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)62114-0/abstract
In 2004 W.R. Keatinge and G.C. Donaldson of Queen Mary’s School of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of London reported in the Southern Medical Journal that:
“Cold-related deaths are far more numerous than heat-related deaths in nearly all countries outside the tropics, and almost all of them are due to common illnesses that are increased by cold, including heart attacks, strokes, flu and pneumonia.”
 https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/well/beware-winter-is-coming.html
Citizens in many countries are now paying the price for believing the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming nonsense. A number of governments have spent billions of dollars on unreliable and inefficient wind and solar power when they should have been building nuclear power stations or efficient, reliable coal and gas-fired power stations to heat or cool homes and businesses.
The impacts of dangerous cold weather are exacerbated by the spiraling cost of energy, a direct result of government’s misguided energy policies to “tackle climate change.” This inevitably leads to many more Australians being unable to heat or cool their homes.
An in-depth study of more than 100 countries over 40 years by economist Dr. Nikolaos Antonakakis, Visiting Fellow at the University of Portsmouth Business School, has concluded:
“Poverty, unemployment and zero economic growth are the likely outcome for countries which choose renewable energy sources over fossil fuels… “
And:
“Energy from fossil fuels appears to ignite economies into greater and more sustained growth, whereas energy from wind and solar power not only fails to enhance or promote economic growth, it actually causes economies to flat- line.”
 https://phys.org/news/2017-02-choice-green-energy-economic-growth.html
The AMA’s Dr. Bartone was reported as saying:
“The latest official data released last week confirms that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise in Australia. National emissions increased by 3.1m tonnes in the year to March to reach 538.9m tonnes, a 0.6% jump on the previous year.”
I suspect that most of the contributors to the alarmist article in The Lancet have no idea how trivial those carbon dioxide emissions are.
They also appear not to know that the impact of carbon dioxide on global temperature is neither exponential nor linear. The warming effect of carbon dioxide absorption falls off logarithmically with concentration. They fail to appreciate that carbon dioxide is a minor greenhouse gas that is physically incapable of having no more than a trivial impact on global temperature.
But I suspect that Bartone doesn’t care much about the facts I recently provided for him. This is evidenced by the response I received from one of his staff members, Virginia DeCourcy.
Her dismissive and evidence-deficient reply came perilously close to actually addressing my concerns. She said:
“The AMA’s most recent position statement can be found at  Climate Change and Human Health – 2015. This position is grounded in scientific evidence and was approved by the AMA Federal Council, the AMA’s representative policy-making body.”
This suggests that the AMA hasn’t actually surveyed all their members on this issue.
We are told that:
“The Lancet is the world’s leading independent general medical journal. The journal’s coverage is international in focus and extends to all aspects of human health. The Lancet publishes the original primary research and review articles of the highest standard. The Lancet is stringently edited and peer-reviewed to ensure the scientific merit and clinical relevance of its diverse content.”
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/the-lancet/
When we look at People at the Lancet it appears there is a “cast of thousands” with Editor, Deputy Editor, Senior Executive Editors. Executive Editors, Managing Editors, Senior Editors and a plethora of staff from around the world.
https://www.thelancet.com/lancet-people
The questions must be asked:
1. Have all those editors from around the world actually been asked for their opinions about theLancet’s official climate alarmist position?
And:
2. Have all those editors from around the world merelyfallen into line with Dr. Bartone’s official alarmist nonsense?
Virginia DeCourcy provided a further clue:
“Dr Bartone is confident that the AMA policy captures the overarching view of the AMA membership.”
I don’t think I’m as confident as Dr. Bartone is on that score. In fact I suspect that, as with so many other institutions, the AMA’s position statements on climate change do not represent the views of all, or even a majority of its members or its global editorial team.

Leaders of the Clintel Group of world scientists and professionals will attend the UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) which starts in Madrid today (2 December) and runs for twelve long days. (The Climate Summit was shifted suddenly to Spain after Chile cancelled because of violent riots in Santiago.)
Clintel will present their “No Climate Emergency” petition at the Climate Reality Forum. This petition has already been presented to the UN Secretary General, the European Commission and the European Parliament.
Voting on a motion promoting a climate emergency declaration (in opposition to the Clintel statement), over one third of the members of the EU Parliament voted for “No Climate Emergency”. This shows there is a significant opposition to alarmism, even in the EU.
The Climate Summit is expected to attract up to 25,000 high-flying delegates and hangers-on from 197 member countries. Most will not arrive using bicycles, sailing boats or gliders – they will burn hydrocarbons. Desperate to spread their “Climate Emergency” alarmism, delegates will try to force high energy costs and rationing on us while they waste it conspicuously themselves.
Clintel says that computerised global temperature simulation models are unfit for the purpose of setting climate policies – they have consistently run hot for 20 years.
The real global climate has warm and cold cycles. Current global temperatures are about as warm as the Medieval Warm era (which was followed by the Little Ice Age).
There is no uniform global temperature at any place or any time, and no one knows what ideal temperature we should aim for – the Frigid Zone would probably like it warmer, the Torrid Zone would probably like it cooler.
We need to take heed of climate history and energy realities, both neglected in alarmist/UN propaganda. Too many UN “scientific” reports are tinkered with by officials before release, and are designed to alarm rather than inform.
For too long we have been forced to listen to biased academics (chasing research funds), energy speculators (chasing government subsidies and tax breaks), alarmist journalists (chasing sensations), noisy children (chasing days off school) and greenish politicians (chasing votes).
It’s time to stop the chasing.

https://carbon-sense.com/2019/11/25/perth-highest-temperature/,,Highest Temperature on Record in Perth? Don’t Believe a Word of It,"
By Dr. John Happs
Channel 7 and Channel 9 news were quick to announce that Perth experienced its highest temperature on record on Saturday, 16th November 2019.
We were told that the temperature reached 40.8oC and a record temperature was claimed. Of course we were not told exactly where that particular temperature was taken and why that “record temperature” was not recorded in neighbouring suburbs.
Interestingly, that“record temperature” of 40.8oC was measured at Perth Airport at 2.00 pm. Also at 2.00 pm, the temperature in Perth City was 38.6oC. Still hot, but 2.2oC lower than Perth Airport.
So what about the temperature in suburbs further west of the airport? Hillarys for instance recorded 24.30oC at 2.00pm on the same day – a whopping 16.5oC lower than the airport “record temperature.”

Differences in temperatures between suburbs is common across Perth or any other city. For instance on the 9th November, 2019, the temperature at Perth Airport at 3.00 pm was 39.3oC whilst the temperature at Hillarys was 26.6oC at the same time. A difference of 12.7oC.
On the 14th November 2019, the temperature at Perth Airport at 1.00 pm was 38.5oC whilst the temperature at Hillarys was 24.8oC at the same time. A difference of 13.7oC.
So why the discrepancy and why should we be skeptical of media claims of a record temperature for Perth on the 16th November 2019 or any other date?
To ensure standard measurements from meteorological instruments, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has specified the construction and placement of the Stevenson Screen, invented by the British engineer and meteorologist Sir Thomas Stevenson (1818-1887), father of author Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) of Treasure Island fame.
The Stevenson Screen offers instruments protection from leaves, animals, rain, snow and wind and is painted white to reflect direct solar radiation. It is a double-louvered box that allows the free passage of air and it holds instruments such as maximum/minimum thermometers, hygrometers for measuring relative humidity and a barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure.
Stevenson Screens should be kept 1.25 metres off the ground and be on a level piece of ground that is covered with short grass. It should be erected well away from any trees or buildings.

Temperature measurements from many land-based thermometers provide readings that are highly questionable. When temperatures are taken in urbanised area, they are likely to produce a significantly inflated reading due to artificial heating from surrounding buildings, paving and roadways.
https://weather-lessons.blogspot.com/2014/03/weather-instruments.html
At airports, where information about temperature, wind strength and direction are needed for operational aircraft, WMO locations and conditions for measurements might be difficult or impossible to meet. Consequently, temperatures measured at airports are almost certainly going to be higher than surrounding suburbs due to the Urban Heat Island Effect.
Record surface temperatures, often paraded by climate alarmists, are likely to be exaggerated by urbanization. Heat from the sun is retained by buildings and roadways and re-radiated. This is why cities and airports are referred to as Urban Heat Islands and this effect can be shown in profile:
http://icecap.us/docs/change/URBANHEATISLAND.pdf
Cities and airports have large areas of concrete and asphalt in roads and runways. Additionally, buildings can funnel and concentrate heated air such that any weather station placed in this environment will inevitably return an exaggerated high temperature reading.
Urban Heat Islands are better monitored from space as seen on the following NASA map plotted across Paris in June 2019:
Credit: NASA/JPL -Caltech
Note the temperature at the Charles de Gaulle airport compared with the surrounding area.
In the same month (June, 2019) a NASA satellite temperature survey across Rome showed similar heat island results:
Credit: NASA/JPL -Caltech
Note the temperature at Rome’s Leonardo da Vinci airport compared with the surrounding area and a similar problem is seen at Wichita airport in Kansas where a “record” high temperature was claimed on the 4th May, 2014.
The red circle shows the position of the weather station and we shouldn’t be at all surprised that an inflated temperature measurement was attained here when the station is close to jet aircraft burning fuel and releasing hot exhaust gases.

Other examples where daily maximum temperatures at airports have been exaggerated can be located at:
https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7445
Minimum temperatures are also clearly influenced by the positioning of weather stations and there could be significant differences (by several degrees) across any suburb. Senior meteorologist Blair Trewin from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has acknowledged:
“The minimum temperature could have quite big variations within a suburb – by up to several degrees.”
https://www.domain.com.au/news/melbournes-coldest-suburbs-are-not-close-to-the-beach-854343/
Perth geoscientist Warwick Hughes looked closely at the temperature data assembled by scientists from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia in the UK, later to be at the centre of the Climategate scandal. The CRU was responsible for collating temperature data from around the world and those data were used by the now discredited Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Hughes examined the Southern Hemisphere temperature trends that the CRU’s Dr. Phil Jones had published. Hughes showed that virtually all the warming claimed by Jones resulted from the Urban Heat Island Effect.
When Hughes expanded his analysis of the CRU data collected from South Africa and Siberia he concluded that:
“Cities are the source of the apparent warming, which is not apparent at nearby small towns or rural stations.”
http://www.warwickhughes.com/climate/
When Hughes requested more data and information from Jones in 2005, Jones told Hughes that he would not send more data, saying:
“We have 25 or so years invested in the work. Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?”
http://www.warwickhughes.com/blog/?p=4203
Many people innocently believe that scientists will always deliberately seek constructive criticism from their peers so that science can advance from such criticism. Apparently climate alarmists don’t subscribe to this view.
There are numerous peer-reviewed, published papers that show how terrestrial temperatures are affected by weather station shifts, changes in instrumentation, observation patterns and recording bias. Perhaps of more importance, there are problems with bad positioning and changes in the land surrounding the weather station.
Examples of land changes close to weather stations have been provided by Fall et al. (2010)
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235221588_Analysis_of_the_impacts_of_station_exposure_on_the_US_Historical_Climatology_Network_temperatures_and_temperature_trends
This station is at Tucson University, Arizona and is one of many investigated by Fall et al.

They concluded:
“The comparison of time series of annual temperature records from good and poor exposure sites shows that differences do exist between temperatures and trends calculated from USHCNv2 stations with different exposure characteristics.”
Anthony Watts and his team of 650 examined more than 800 weather stations across the US and concluded:
“We found stations located next to the exhaust fans of air conditioning units, surrounded by asphalt parking lots and roads, on blistering-hot rooftops, and near sidewalks and buildings that absorb and radiate heat. We found 68 stations located at wastewater treatment plants, where the process of waste digestion causes temperatures to be higher than in surrounding areas. In fact, we found that 89 percent of the stations – nearly 9 of every 10 – fail to meet the National Weather Service’s own siting requirements that stations must be 30 meters (about 100 feet) or more away from an artificial heating or radiating/ reflecting heat source. In other words, 9 of every 10 stations are likely reporting higher or rising temperatures because they are badly sited.”
https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/surfacestationsreport_spring09.pdf
So much for meeting the rigorous standards set out by the WMO or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
Watts and Pielke examined temperature monitoring stations in the USA and showed that only 11% actually met WMO or NOAA standards.
Dr. John Christy points out that the surface temperature readings upon which global warming hysteria is built have been distorted by urbanization and that many cities, where “official temperatures” are recorded, are 7 or 8 degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside.
Dr. John Christy and Dr. Roy Spencer analyzed temperature readings from NOAA and NASA satellites, finding significantly lower temperatures being returned from satellites compared to those recorded at surface stations.
There is now widespread agreement that temperature data from cities and airports are “contaminated” and exaggerated by Urban Heat Island bias and this must be removed if we are to have more reliable and believable surface temperature records.
https://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/Pielke-etal_BAMS_Jun07.pdf
Many peer-reviewed, published studies have shown how the Urban Heat Island bias inflates temperatures in many parts of the world leading Block et al. (2004) to conclude:
“The local amount of warming is considerably affected by the surrounding orography.Therefore regional climate models should take anthropogenic heat into account to improve their performance.” 
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GL019852
From China, Zhou et al. (2004) report:
“Rapid urbanization in south-eastern China in the past 25 years is responsible for an estimated warming rate much larger than previous estimates for other periods and locations.”
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/06/040623084435.htm
Hinkel et al. (2003) found similar problems:
“Here, we demonstrate the existence of a strong urban heat island (UHI) during winter. Data loggers (54) were installed in the ∼150 km2 study area to monitor hourly air and soil temperature, and daily spatial averages were calculated using the six or seven warmest and coldest sites. During winter (December 2001-March 2002), the urban area averaged 2.2 °C warmer than the hinterland. The strength of the UHI increased as the wind velocity decreased, reaching an average value of 3.2 °C under calm conditions.”
http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003andcontext=geography_pubs
A 2010 study by NASA concluded:
“Summer land surface temperature of cities in the Northeast were an average of 7°C to 9°C (13°F to 16 °F) warmer than surrounding rural areas over a three year period, the new research shows. The complex phenomenon that drives up temperatures is called the urban heat island effect.”
Satellite telemetry is providing better understanding of the Urban Heat Island effect and has been used to compare various urban settings. Ping Zhang, lead author of the NASA research said:
“This, at least to our knowledge, is the first time that anybody has systematically compared the heat islands of a large number of cities at continental and global scales,”
https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/heat-island-sprawl.html
Another clear example (from many) of Urban Heat Island temperature distortion was seen when the UK media and Met Office were quick to claim that a temperature record had been set on the 1st July, 2015 at Heathrow Airport where the thermometer registered 36.8oC.
Of course the temperature measured in other parts of the UK were conveniently ignored and the public was led to believe this was evidence of (imaginary) global warming and that large areas of runways, buildings and jet engine exhaust had nothing to do with that high temperature of 36.8oC. Data from other locations, on the same date and time, proved otherwise:

When temperature data from Heathrow were compared with data from other sites around the UK on the same day, the Urban Heat Island impact soon became apparent but the public remained blissfully unaware of this.
Returning to the claim that Perth experienced its highest temperature on record on Saturday, 16th November 2019, we need to consider the location of Perth airport. In fact it is located well inland:
Google Earth maps, 2018
Like most airports, it has large areas covered by concrete and there are many buildings and car parks in the vicinity.

It is interesting to note that climate alarmists usually refer to terrestrial (ground-based) temperatures when claiming that the planet is warming. They rarely (if ever) mention the lower troposphere temperatures as measured by a series of satellites. Satellites provide data accessible to all and those data are not subjected to “adjustment.”
IPCC contributing scientist Dr Robert Davis agreed, saying:
“Global temperatures have not been changing as state of the art climate models predicted they would. Not a single mention of satellite temperature observations appears in the (IPCC) Summary for Policymakers.”

Statements by IPCC experts vs the IPCC

Only satellite data provide reliable records of lower troposphere temperatures since their microwave radiometers, with calibrated platinum resistance devices, have a proven long-term stability. Coverage of the whole planet is possible and temperature measurement is extremely accurate. NASA has made clear:
“Satellite analysis of the upper atmosphere is more accurate, and should be adopted as the standard way to monitor global temperature change.”
https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/122096963
Try telling that to those climate alarmists who refer only to terrestrial temperature data!
UAH lower troposphere satellite data provide the most comprehensive and accurate global temperature measurements and there is no indication of a warming trend. Even the alarmist Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) now acknowledges there has been no global warming for at least 15 years, despite rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
The IPCC reported that the gentle end of 20th century warming has stopped. The IPCC’s Chapter 9 of the WG1 Report discusses the hiatus under Box 9.2: Climate Models and the Hiatus in Global-Mean Surface Warming of the Past 15 Years.
Under Box 9.2 we read:
“Nevertheless, the occurrence of the hiatus in GMST trend during the past 15 years raises the two related questions of what has caused it and whether climate models are able to reproduce it.”
https://judithcurry.com/2013/09/30/ipccs-pause-logic/
Dr. Howard Hayden observes:
“If the science were as certain as climate activists pretend, then there would be precisely one climate model, and it would be in agreement with measured data. As it happens, climate modelers have constructed literally dozens of climate models. What they all have in common is a failure to represent reality, and a failure to agree with the other models.”
http://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=4922
Dr. Phil Jones, former director of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at Britain’s University of East Anglia conceded that there has been no “statistically significant” rise in global temperature since 1995.

Phil Jones: “No global warming since 1995”

Dr. Khabibullo Abdusamatov, head of the space research facility at the Pulkovo observatory in St. Petersburg warns of low solar activity and global cooling which could continue for 2 or more decades. He states:
“By the mid-21st century the planet will face another Little Ice Age, similar to the Maunder Minimum, because the amount of solar radiation hitting the Earth has been constantly decreasing since the 1990s and will reach its minimum approximately in 2041.”
https://www.iceagenow.com/Russian_scientist_says_Earth_could_soon_face_new_Ice_Age.htm
The UK’s Royal Society has admitted in a statement on the science of climate change that the previous spell of warming ended in 2000.
The Journal Science has said the pause in global temperature is real, as do many refereed scientific papers in numerous journals.
Climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry said it is now clear that the IPCC’s computer modeling, which predicted continual warming, is deeply flawed. She suggests that all climate scientists should:
“Use this as an opportunity to communicate honestly with the public about what we know and what we don’t know about climate change. Take a lesson from other scientists who acknowledge the “pause”.

Temperature data from Greenland, Antarctica, the Himalayas, New Zealand, Portugal, China, Canada and a host of other countries show there has not been any warming for many years.

Greenland, Antarctica And Dozens Of Areas Worldwide Have Not Seen Any Warming In 60 Years And More!

We can expect more record temperatures to be declared for Perth in the future. After all, it is a growing city and the airport will inevitably see more runways and buildings and exaggerated temperature readings will continue to be paraded by the media.
There will be no mention of temperature trends at locations such as Cape Leeuwin in the south of Western Australia, away from any heat islands and with 120 years of temperature data. Winemaker Erl Happ has been a long time weather-watcher in this area and notes:
“The warmest decade in January occurred in 1979-1988.  The failure to warm indicates that the much celebrated hypothetical link between carbon dioxide and atmospheric temperatureis absent.”
 https://reality348.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/climate-change-in-margaret-river/
 Climate alarmists, including a number of scientists, will routinely cite terrestrial thermometer readings whilst ignoring data from satellites and radio-sonde balloons. They will do this because uncontaminated satellite and balloon data show no significant warming and this does nothing to promote the human-caused climate disasters they so desperately need to promote. After all, nothing attracts research funding like a looming disaster that scientists say is real and only they can provide a solution.
Dr. Christian Schuchter, emeritus professor at the University of Bern in Switzerland explains:
“As a number of other prominent climate scientists I know will attest, there’s one broadly recognized universal tip for those seeking government funding. All proposals with any real prospects for success should somehow link climate change with human activities rather than to natural causes. Even better, those human influences should intone dangerous consequences.”
https://www.newsmax.com/LarryBell/warming-global-climate/2014/06/17/id/577481/
Nobel Laureate Dr. Ivar Giaver has referred to the notion of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming as an ideology and he could well have been referring to the selection of exaggerated terrestrial temperature data as an example when he described:
“A pseudoscience that begins with an emotionally-appealing hypothesis and then looks for items which appear to support it while ignoring ample contrary evidence.”

Late on Tuesday, Nov. 12, high tides from the surrounding lagoon surged onto the more than 100 islands that make up Venice, flooding 85% of the city and damaging artwork and many historic sites. The mayor blamed climate change for the flood. Jim Steele wrote an excellent article about the event and climate change. The Great Flood of 1966 was the worst on record. Since then, Venice has been working on the long-delayed MOSE project which was supposed to prevent flooding. High inflows to the Venice Lagoon from the Adriatic Sea are driven by the strength of the Sirocco and Bora winds that cause local sea level to surge. There has been no trend in the winds. Steele wrote “Dwarfing the 1.4 millimeters per year of estimated sea level rise, from 1930 to 1970 Venice sank at the rate of 2.3 millimeters per year, largely due to ground water extraction. After addressing that problem, the rate of sinking slowed, but Venice continues to sink at a rate of 1 millimeter per year.” The 1996 flood happened during a low tide and the 2019 flood during a high tide.

Bushfires are normal events in this season in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes of the southern hemisphere – in Australia, Africa and South America. Even Captain Cook noted many fires in Eastern Australia in 1770, long before the era of “global warming” hysteria.
What is unusual is the number and ferocity of recent Australian fires.
Destructive bushfires need three things – a big load of dry fuel, hot dry winds and a point of ignition.
A big load of dry fuel, close to towns and buildings, in this season, is a sign of gross mis-management (seen most commonly in public lands). That fuel should have been raked, dozed or burnt in safer weather conditions.
Hot dry winds are not unusual in this season in these latitudes – no use whinging.
But how do 100+ bushfires start suddenly? Machinery occasionally starts fires but not 120 fires in a short time. There have been no lightning storms so who are the arsonists or idiots starting these fires?

They have fought many bushfires and have seen several fires lit – some deliberately, some naturally, some carelessly. One careless fire burnt out their exploration camp in Arnhem Land, another accidental “fire with nine lives” threatened their grazing property in SE Qld, and a deliberate fire on another property cleared a lot of lantana and leaf litter from their property and also made the adjacent National Park a much safer neighbour. 
Below is a true unpublished story about one fire we fought on our grazing property during the Millennium Drought. We hope you find it interesting:

By Sanjeev Sabhlok  Senior leader and overseas coordinator of India’s Swarna Bharat Party
The Modi government has been shovelling scarce taxpayer resources into solar energy, with a further $6.5 billion promised till 2022. This is over and above indirect subsidies that people pay through higher electricity bills because of renewable energy certificates. And while Donald Trump did the right thing by walking out of the Paris Agreement, Mr Modi unthinkingly remains committed to it and Niti Ayog has been touting subsidised electric vehicles.
Our party disagrees with this approach. First, because we oppose subsidies for any industry. But second, because we believe there is a strong case to impose Pigovian taxes on solar energy given the economic and environmental harm it causes.
Solar energy can do a few useful things. It can power a radio in an off-grid location. But it can’t support our day-to-day life.

Dr. John Happs
Despite alarmist claims of “catastrophic global warming”, there is no empirical evidence to confirm that or any acceleration in global sea level rise. Notwithstanding this lack of evidence many people, often those with vested interests, still cling to the alarmist beliefs that catastrophic sea level rise is imminent.
If you live on an overpopulated island with high unemployment, limited resources and were already dependent on aid from the outside world, there is one sure-fire strategy for bringing in extra money. This involves ignoring the lack of empirical evidence for any acceleration in global sea level rise or increase in extreme weather whilst taking the following steps:

Blame successful, developed nations such as Australia for producing (trivial) emissions of carbon dioxide. This can then be attributed to imaginary dangerous global warming, sea level rise and more extreme weather.Demand compensation for damage sustained as a result of (imaginary) sea level rise or demand financial aid for climate mitigation schemes.Rely on gullible politicians from developed nations to believe the dangerous anthropogenic global warming and sea level rise alarmism for which there is no empirical evidence.Sit back and wait for taxpayer money to arrive from developed nations.
But then, leaders from a number of Pacific and Indian Ocean islands don’t need me to outline this strategy since the process is already underway with representatives from various island groups having met recently to sign the following Boa Agreement in Nauru.
This states:
“We reaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the people of the Pacific and our commitment to progress the implementation of the Paris Agreement.”
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-05/australia-and-pacific-nations-sign-climate-security-declaration/10204422
Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne and New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern attended the meeting where the Boa Agreement was signed, although Australian personnel (wisely) would not support a statement from small island states, calling for countries to “urgently accelerate” reductions in carbon (dioxide) emissions.
According to contributing economics editor Judith Sloan, neither would Australian representatives go along with the request from Tuvalu’s Prime Minister to cease any expansion of coalmining in Australia. (The Weekend Australian, August 24-25, 2019, P22)
Tuvalu’s Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga, when pressed by journalists to name the country that would not commit to reduce its carbon (dioxide) emissions, said that a country “starting with a capital A” had objected. Mr Sopoaga said:
“The issues are so critical for leaders of smaller island states because of their vulnerability to climate change.”
And:
“We appealed to Forum leaders to endorse [the statement] so we can walk the talk.”
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-05/australia-and-pacific-nations-sign-climate-security-declaration/10204422
Most of the Pacific Island Forum members called for the United States to re-join the Paris Climate Agreement but the Australian delegation (sensibly) did not support this either.
That aside, Foreign Minister Marise Payne appears to be serious about “tackling climate change” in the Pacific saying:
“We are very focused on our engagement on climate in the region.”
How focused? Well the Australian government is helping to pay for projects in the Pacific through a multi-billion dollar fund that Marise Payne says:
“Will stream climate adaptation and resilience through its investment in energy, in transport, in communications and in water, reflects the priority we place on these issues.”
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/defence-chief-sounds-warning-on-surge-of-climate-change-refugees
The core issue of the climate change/alarmist debate is that human induced emissions of atmospheric carbon dioxide are the “key and controllable” driver of our global climate. This claim ignores all other natural forces and cycles that have guided our climate over billions of years as evidenced in our geological history. It has also precipitated a general demand that all countries reduce their carbon dioxide emissions whilst simultaneously paying compensation to those countries claiming to be threatened by the (non-existent) climatic effects of “anthropogenic global warming”.
Forum members haven’t been slow in demanding action, starting with Vanuatu. This island country is located in the South Pacific Ocean, comprising around 80 volcanic islands stretching over 1,200 kilometres. It is home to more than 250,000 people and many of the islands are less than 1 metre above sea level.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu#/media/File:Vanuatu_on_the_globe_(Polynesia_centered).svg
The Vanuatu government said it would look into the possibility of taking legal action against fossil fuel industries and their country of origin because they are the cause of climate change and sea level rise.
Well good luck with that since a court of law will demand empirical evidence rather than opinion to support that particular claim.
Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said he was:
“Putting the fossil fuel industry and the states that sponsor it on notice that the climate loss and damages ravaging Vanuatu will not go unchallenged”.
He added: “My government is now exploring all avenues to utilise the judicial system in various jurisdictions – including under international law – to shift the costs of climate protection back onto the fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country.”
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/vanuatu-says-it-may-sue-fossil-fuel-companies-and-other-countries-over-climate-change
Vanuatu’s politicians are not alone in blaming economically successful nations for (imaginary) climate problems.
Tuvalu (once known as the Ellice Islands) is made up of 9 small atolls and reef islands in the South Pacific, with its highest point about 5 metres above sea level. It lies mid-way between Australia and Hawaii and has a population of around 11,000.
http://www.bing.com/maps?q=Tuvaluandpc=cospandptag=G6C999N1234D011214A28D7143A82andform=CONMHPandconlogo=CT3210127
As far back as 2003 Tuvalu’s Prime Minister told the United Nations that the westerners were causing the seas to drown his home, saying:
“The threat is real and serious, and is of no difference to a slow and insidious form of terrorism against us.”
Tuvalu’s Deputy Prime Minister, Tavau Teii made a speech on climate change at a meeting of the United Nations in New York in which he claimed:
“Tuvalu is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change so we are seeking new funding arrangements to protect us from the impacts of climate change … Rather than relying on aid money we believe that the major greenhouse polluters should pay for the impacts they are causing.”
Presumably that would include Australia.
Sixteen years later Tuvalu still hasn’t been submerged but Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga (predictably) implied that it was just a matter of time:
“Tuvalu’s future at current warming is already bleak. Any further temperature increase will spell the total demise of Tuvalu.”
Current warming? Total demise of Tuvalu?
Apparently nobody had toldEnele Sopoaga there has been no global temperature rise for at least the last 20 years, no increase in extreme weather and no evidence that Tuvalu is about to go under the waves.
But you have to admire both persistence and guile. In 2015, an obviously tearful Tuvalu delegate at the Copenhagen climate jamboree, Ian Fry, lamented over the threat of rising sea levels saying: “I woke up this morning crying, and that’s not easy for a grown man to admit … The fate of my country rests in your hands.”
As one might expect, the Copenhagen delegates loudly applauded Fry although it wasn’t revealed that Tuvalu wasn’t his country at all. In fact he was a lawyer, specialising in island-nation advocacy and an ex-Greenpeace liason officer from Queanbeyan.
https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2018/02/drowning-truth-sea-piffle/
Tuvalu is a nation poorly equipped for modern living. Water is a scarce resource and its accumulating waste is also becoming a major problem.
http://www.pireport.org/articles/2010/07/12/trashy-tuvalu-has-nowhere-put-waste
For the 3 years to 2018, Australian aid to Tuvalu, courtesy of taxpayers, was $24 million. Not bad for an island group with a population of around 11,000.
But here is the good news (or maybe not) for Tuvalu politicians.
Research conducted in 2010 by Arthur Webb and Paul Kench used aerial photographs and satellite imagery to show that 23 out of 27 Pacific Islands were either unchanged or had actually grown. Webb and Kench reported:
“That rather gloomy prognosis for these nations is incorrect … It has been thought that as the sea level goes up, islands will sit there and drown. But they won’t. The sea level will go up and the island will start responding.”
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818110001013
They specifically pointed out that the islands of Tuvalu are among those that have grown, assisted by accumulated coral debris and sediment. They noted:
“We have now got the evidence to suggest that the physical foundation of these countries will still be there in 100 years, so they perhaps do not need to flee their country.”
The evidence from Webb and Kench is supported by evidence from other experts on sea level such as Dr. Cliff Ollier who says:
“Graphs of sea level for twelve locations in the southwest Pacific show stable sea level for about ten years over the region. The data are compared with results from elsewhere, all of which suggest that any rise of global sea level is negligible.”
http://climaterealists.com/index.php?id=3839
Professor Nils-Axel Mörner is arguably the world’s foremost expert on sea-level measurement with around 650 publications on the topic. He headed the Paleogeophysics and Geodynamics Department at Stockholm University and has studied sea level throughout his long career.
In an interview with science reporter Alex Reihmuth, Mörner said:
“Climate and sea level science has been completely politicized and hijacked by an activist agenda and has become a “quasi religion”.
He added: “Over the past 200 years the sea level has not changed very much. Over the past 50 to 70 years it has been absolutely stable”.

The above plot shows best estimates of post-glacial sea level rise, deduced from various localities around the world.
https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/understanding-mans-role-in-sea-level-rise/
After observing how the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has systematically abused climate science for its political/ideological ends, Mörner called into question the IPCC’s prognosis on future sea-level rise and how this contradicts what recognised experts in the area, with no vested interest, have documented.
Mörner reported to the UK House of Lords how genuine experts on sea level refuted IPCC claims of rapidly rising levels and that island nations could be inundated. Mörner said:
“There is a total absence of any recent ‘acceleration in sea level rise’ as often claimed by IPCC and related groups … So all this talk that sea level is rising, this stems from the computer modeling, not from observations. The observations don’t find it.”
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V7/N5/C3.php
There are 34 peer-reviewed, published papers that point to little or no sea level rise detection and no indication of an anthropogenic/carbon dioxide signal. These can be located at:
https://notrickszone.com/skeptic-papers-2016-2/
Research by Webb and Kench also found that Tuvalu gained 73 hectares of land and, of the 101 islands, more than 70 had actually grown.
Despite media hype about rising sea level and vanishing land, observations by Dr. Gennadii Donchyts from the Deltares Research Institute in the Netherlands show that:
“Between 1985 and 2015 around 173,000 square kilometers (67,000 square miles) of water were transformed into land and 115,000 square kilometers (44,000 square miles) of water shifted to dry land. That’s a net gain of land area the size of Lake Michigan.”
https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/water-land-sea-levels-shift-map.html
Tony Thomas succinctly lays out the real problems faced by Tuvalu residents:
“Concerning atoll erosion, over-fishing of beaked reef fish and mining of sand, gravel and coral for Western-style house construction are primary causes.  Other ‘bads’ are denuding of beach vegetation for fuel, asphalting of roads, and urban drift to the main island Funafuti.
And:
(Funafuti is only two-thirds the size of London’s Hyde Park, but includes a 1500m air-strip). Waste and waste-water disposal are other serious issues. Above all, having lots of children in a seriously limited habitat is bound to create an environmental mess. The fertility rate in Tuvalu is 3.11 children per woman, compared with Australia, 1.78.”
https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2012/01/going-going-not/
Now one might be forgiven for thinking that islands, about to be submerged by rising seas could be purchased at fire-sale prices. Apparently this isn’t the case.
Consider the cost of an island in the Vanuatu group, South Pacific, also about to be submerged by rising seas, according to Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu. He too has referred to the threat of sea level rise and the “climate loss and damages ravaging Vanuatu.”
Lataro Island covers 700 acres and comes with an airstrip. This could be yours for 10 million USD with a lease until 2082.

In fact never has land about to be submerged, according to Vanuatu politicians and other alarmists, been so expensive.
Perhaps there are islands to be found at give-away prices in the Indian Ocean, such as the Maldives group. After all, there are more than 1,200 islands in this group and not one of them has an elevation of more than 2 metres above sea level.
Maldives – Wikipedia Commons
Curiously, this “soon to be submerged” group of islands, is in the process of  constructing 11 new regional airports  and they will spend $500 million on a complex that includes an 18-hole floating golf course.

Little wonder that Professor Nils-Axel Mörner sent the following letter to Maldives President Nasheed:
October 20, 2009
To: President Mohammed Nasheed of the Maldives
From: Nils-Axel Mörner, Stockholm, Sweden 
Mr. President,
You have recently held an undersea Cabinet meeting to raise awareness of the idea that global sea level is rising and hence threatens to drown the Maldives. This proposition is not founded in observational facts and true scientific judgements.
Therefore, I am most surprised at your action and must protest its intended message.
In 2001, our research group found overwhelming evidence that sea level was by no means in a rising mode in the Maldives, but had remained quite stable for the last 30 years ..”
And:
“I have written to you twice without reply. Your people ought not to have to suffer a constant claim that there is no future for them on their own islands. This terrible message is deeply inappropriate, since it is founded not upon reality but upon an imported concept, which lacks scientific justification and is thus untenable. There is simply no rational basis for it.”
https://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2010/03/dr-nils-axel-morners-reply-to-maldives.html
Other researchers have confirmed previous studies of island resilience and growth. See: Kench, McLean, Owen, Tuck and Ford: Storm-deposited coral blocks. A mechanism of island genesis, Tutaga Island, Funafuti atoll, Tuvalu.
https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/46/10/915/548204/storm-deposited-coral-blocks-a-mechanism-of-island?redirectedFrom=fulltext
As Dr. Murray Ford, from the University of Auckland, notes:
“While the effect on particular islands of climate-induced changes will vary, there is plenty of evidence to suggest these islands are more resilient than commonly thought.”
https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/sea-level-rise-may-not-spell-the-end-for-low-lying-pacific-atolls
Politicians around the world have already wasted trillions of dollars on useless mitigation schemes in the naive belief they can control both sea level and the climate of a planet.
Unfortunately, some Australian politicians might also believe that a few million more taxpayer dollars wasted on preventing non-sinking islands from sinking is only a drop in the ocean.

The 1997 climate treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol allows wealthy countries to count carbon storage in forests towards their targets for limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement
We often hear about various environmental groups that are intent on planting as many trees as possible, supposedly to offset anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The Australian Government has described carbon offsetting as:
“An activity, process, organisation, event, building or precinct is carbon neutral when its net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions) are equal to zero. To become carbon neutral, entities must calculate their emissions, reduce these emissions as much as possible, and then purchase and cancel carbon offsets or carbon credits equivalent to the remaining emissions. This process results in emissions being offset and leads to net zero emissions or being carbon neutral.”
https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/government/carbon-neutral/ncos-eligible-offsets

The Australian Government initially promised to work with the community to plant 20 million trees by 2020, to re-establish green corridors and urban forests.
https://www.environment.gov.au/land/20-million-trees
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has now increased this commitment with the aim of planting 1 billion trees across Australia by 2030. Those trees will cover 400 thousand hectares of land.
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/australia-to-plant-1-billion-trees-in-the-next-11-years-bringing-the-country-closer-to-paris-agreements-goals/
There are many organisations available to assist in tree-planting ventures. Outland Resources Pty. Ltd. has tree-planting crews that meet various contracts with 250 million trees already planted Australia wide.
https://www.outlandresources.com.au/
A range of tree-planting (paid work) positions are advertised in most states across Australia. These can be located at:
https://au.jora.com/Tree-Planting-jobs-in-Australia
We are told that the Australian tree-planting scheme is designed to remove 18 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over the next 10 years, enabling Australia to meet its Paris Agreement.
So the Australian tree-planting initiative will remove 1.8 million tons per annum. This might seem like a lot of carbon dioxide except that human respiration globally emits 2.25 billion tons of carbon dioxide per annum and termites produce far more carbon dioxide than the sum total of human activities.
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/218/4572/563
There are many tree planting initiatives in Australia. In Western Australia, for instance, there is the self-funding, not for profit organisation Men of the Trees group with their website “Trillion Trees.”
https://trilliontrees.org.au/
A number of these initiatives make claims that appear both plausible and laudable. For instance, the Carbon Neutral Charitable Fund states:
“We plant trees for the planet” and presumably this well-intentioned group firmly believes that planting trees will reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and save the planet. Exactly what the planet is being saved from isn’t made clear.
https://cncf.com.au/our-approach-native-trees/

There is no doubt that many claims about the environmental benefits of trees are valid including their role in providing shade, habitat, shelter and food for a range of animals.
Trees are not only aesthetically pleasing, they can restore barren landscapes to provide more biodiversity, improve soil structure, increase surface water infiltration and combat soil erosion and salinity. Trees provide renewable resources such as timber, a range of foods, gums and resins. Rubber is a well-known resource.
Rubber tree – free-images.com
Expanding forestry inevitably leads to more employment opportunities.
What’s not to like about tree-planting?
However, a number of claims made about the benefits of tree-planting are not supported by empirical evidence, including:
“Trees are the world’s single largest source of breathable oxygen.”
https://www.gulf-times.com/story/456623/Plant-more-trees-and-make-a-difference-for-the-env
In fact terrestrial photosynthesis plays only a minor role in the production of atmospheric oxygen.
Oceans cover more than 70% of the planet and it is estimated that marine plants, including seaweed and the more than 7,000 species of algae, including cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce up to 80% of the oxygen that enters the atmosphere.
Seaweeds – free-images.com
Of the remaining 20% of oxygen, a significant portion comes from the large areas of grasslands such as the Pampas in South America, the Steppes in Central Eurasia and the African Savannas, with only a relatively small portion coming from forested areas.
African Savanna – free-images.com
As Kasting and Siefert point out:
“Terrestrial photosynthesis has little effect on atmospheric O2 because it is nearly balanced by the reverse processes of respiration and decay.”
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1066.long
Another questionable claim made by some tree-planting groups is that:
“Maintaining our forests and restoring our natural landscape will make a real difference in reducing climate change.”
Whatever “reducing climate change” actually means.
Although many saplings will take up and use more carbon dioxide than the oxygen they liberate, most mature trees absorb no nett carbon dioxide over their lifetime. What they take up via their photosynthetic cells, they lose via their larger biomass of respiratory cells and, more importantly, by the decay of falling leaves, branches and eventually the tree trunk.
Dr. Harald Franzen explains:
“Trees only absorb large quantities of carbon during their growth, so once they are fully grown–in other words, when the reforestation is complete–they will not be able to serve as CO2 sinks.”
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/planting-trees-wont-save/
We are often told that the Amazon and other Rainforests, covering around 6% of the Earth’s surface, are the lungs of the planet. In fact tropical rainforests are large natural sources of carbon dioxide.
Tropical rainforest – Pixabay
Monitoring of carbon dioxide from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Dioxide Observatory-2 satellite shows how forested areas on Earth liberate copious quantities of carbon dioxide at night via respiration, organic matter decay and land clearing:

Note the relatively higher concentrations of carbon dioxide from the Amazon, African and Indonesian rainforests.
http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov
Putz et al. add:
“Tropical forest deforestation has been identified as a major source of CO2 emissions, though biomass loss due to fragmentation-the creation of additional forest edges-has been largely overlooked as an additional CO2 source.”
https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6037
A number of tree-planting websites have claimed that carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that traps heat and is leading to (imaginary) global warming. They ignore the fact that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have never driven global temperature at any time over the last 500 million years.
A number of tree-planting websites have also claimed that carbon dioxide from industrial activity is raising the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, leading to more extreme weather. They ignore the fact that even the political/ideological Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported there is no evidence of increased extreme weather. (See Chapter 2 of the AR5 Report).
Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace observes:
“At 400 parts per million, all our food crops, forests, and natural ecosystems are still on a starvation diet for carbon dioxide. The optimum level of carbon dioxide for plant growth, given enough water and nutrients, is about 1,500 parts per million, nearly four times higher than today.”
https://www.facebook.com/CraigKellyMP/photos/greenpeace-co-founder-why-i-am-a-skeptic-following-article-by-patrick-moore-phd-/368616809999626/
Carbon dioxide is a colourless, odourless, non-toxic source of plant food and anyone who is serious about re-vegetating the Earth would see the need for much more atmospheric carbon dioxide. In other words, the planet needs more carbon dioxide – not less.
Possibly not aware of these facts, tree-planters might think they are “coming to the rescue of planet Earth.” They rightly point out that trees will take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen into the atmosphere. They also rightly explain that trees convert carbon dioxide and other chemicals into tree tissues such as cellulose (40% – 50%), hemicellulose (15% – 25%) and lignin (15% – 30%).
Well-intentioned tree-planters firmly believe that the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere has been taken care of but they ignore the fact that leaves and branches are constantly falling off trees. When this happens they decompose and carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. Similarly, when trees die, the stored wood decays with micro-organisms, fungi and termites breaking down the wood, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.
Fungi on tree branch – Wikimedia Commons
Dr. Emma Sayer from the UK’s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology points out that any increase in litter-fall from trees stimulates soil micro-organisms leading to a release of stored soil carbon. Her research shows that:
“Extra litter-fall triggers an effect called ‘priming’ where fresh carbon from plant litter provides much-needed energy to micro-organisms, which then stimulates the decomposition of carbon stored in the soil.”
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110814141445.htm
Another problem for climate alarmists and those protectors of wetlands is the fact that tropical forested wetlands are a significant source of atmospheric methane. Pangala et al. point out that methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, is emitted from tree stems as well as peat surfaces yet these sources are ignored in any so-called carbon accounting.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233956906_Trees_are_major_conduits_for_methane_egress_from_tropical_forested_wetlands
Additionally, autotrophic respiration for growth and the maintenance of stems, roots and leaves will result in further release of carbon dioxide. Trees increase their respiration rate when producing flowers or leaves, fighting a pathogen or creating chemical defences. These responses by trees lead to more carbon dioxide being released.
Metrosideros excels – Wikimedia Commons
Dr. Markus Eichhorn from the University of Nottingham adds:
“Many deciduous trees in Europe rot in the middle of their trunk – you may see some old British oaks like this. It’s usually not harmful to the tree, but it does mean that they give off carbon dioxide. When the tree is dying the same will happen.”
http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/answers/viewtopic.php?id=93
When a forest reaches maturity it attains a steady state and is carbon (dioxide) neutral, thus old growth, mature forests do nothing more for carbon dioxide sequestration and those who oppose the removal of old growth forest are doing nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Dr. John Caspersen from Princeton University summed up the situation:
“Trees only absorb large quantities of carbon during their growth, so once they are fully grown–in other words, when the reforestation is complete–they will not be able to serve as CO2 sinks. It’s important to realize that when the forests have recovered, we have only gotten back to ground zero in terms of the carbon balance in the atmosphere.”
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/planting-trees-wont-save/
It’s worth noting that mature trees in both tropical rainforests and coniferous forests across Alaska, Canada and the northern US states give off more carbon dioxide than they take in.
A further problem that tree planters are probably unaware of arises during the planting of trees and this has been described by Dr. Riccardo Valentini from the University of Tuscia in Italy. He points out that planting trees to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere actually releases a surge of carbon dioxide when the soil cover is broken. Valentini reports that:
“The problem is soils. Forest soils and the organic matter buried in them typically contain three to four times as much carbon as the vegetation above.”
And:
“When ground is cleared for forest planting, rotting organic matter in the soil releases a surge of CO2 into the air.”
He also notes that the Kyoto Protocol takes none of this into account and says:
“Besides ignoring soils, it has no measures to stop deforestation. Instead, it seems to give countries a perverse incentive to chop down existing natural forests and replace them with plantations.”
And:
“They will be able to claim carbon credits for the new planting, while in reality releasing huge amounts of CO2 into the air. There is nothing in the protocol to stop this.”

Proposals to plant more trees in our cities are always well received since most people appreciate the attractiveness of trees and see the benefits of having more shade and habitats for a variety of wildlife.

What is not generally understood is the fact that, on hot days, trees release volatile organic compounds (VOCS) including isoprene and mono-terpenes. When released in cities, these compounds can lead to the production of significant amounts of ozone.
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b06514.
Eucalypts release VOCS that are flammable and bushfires can travel rapidly as a result of the release of these compounds. Many homes have been destroyed in Australia because of their proximity to stands of burning eucalypts.
Another instance where so-called “carbon sequestration by trees” is countered was given by Colorado State Forester Mike Lester who testified before a state legislative committee, saying:
“When so many trees die and large wildfires follow, our forests quickly turn from a carbon sink into a carbon source.”
Greg Walcher is president of the Natural Resources Group and author of “Smoking Them Out: The Theft of the Environment and How to Take it Back.” He is a former secretary of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and says:
“The more concerned people are about climate change, the more they should be interested in active management to restore forest health. Yet many of the groups pushing urgent climate policies are the same groups that continue to fight logging, tree thinning and other management necessary for healthy forests. The result is more of the same disasters we have seen unfolding for over 20 years: dead and dying forests, catastrophic wildfires, habitat devastation, loss of human property and lives, and destruction of wildlife.”

Foresters in Australia, such as Roger Underwood, would say “Amen” to that.

Everyone should applaud and support schemes to re-vegetate the planet, especially when they are established by “not for profit” groups. However, it should be pointed out that spending money on tree planting will be beneficial in so many ways but it will not reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels or save the planet from (imaginary) global warming.
Professor of atmospheric chemistry at Yale University Dr. Nadine Unger is author of: “To Save the Planet, Don’t Plant Trees.” For all the reasons already stated, she concludes:
“More funding for forestry might seem like a tempting easy win for the world leaders at the United Nations, but it’s a bad bet.”

A number of organisations that generate carbon dioxide emissions during their commercial operations offer their clients an option to purchase “carbon offsets” that commonly involves planting trees.
At least 11 airlines offer carbon (dioxide) offset programs since climate alarmists have convinced them that air travel generates large quantities of carbon dioxide that contributes to (imaginary) global warming.
https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/airlines-that-offer-carbon-offset-programs.php
Some airline chiefs have actually done their homework and have not bowed to pressure from climate alarmists and environmental activists. In 2008 Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary made clear his disbelief in the link between carbon dioxide and global temperature.

Passengers travelling on those airlines offering offset programs are given the option to pay an additional amount for carbon (dioxide) offsetting with the money going into a range of environmental schemes although Emirates doesn’t ask passengers to pay. Rather the airline generously pays for offsets.
Emirates – Free-Images.com
Air New Zealand has a carbon (dioxide) offset scheme, providing passengers with a calculator so they can work out the cost of offsetting their flight. The airline supports a number of projects with the offset money collected, including a project at Mangara Station in Hawkes Bay where they have already planted 85,000 trees.
Air New Zealand – Free-Images.com
Overall, airlines are doing the planet a great service by pumping large amounts of invisible, non-toxic life-giving carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during every flight.
It is estimated that a mere 10% of travellers want to purchase offsets whilst flying. These are the people wanting to fly and are willing to pay for the planting of more trees, to help “Save the planet.”
Perhaps this should be called Gullible Travels.
Flying off-setters should be congratulated for their two-fold contribution to atmospheric life-giving carbon dioxide levels. After all, if we are serious about further greening the planet, reducing desert areas and increasing food crop yields, we need all the carbon dioxide we can get from aircraft and of course all those beautiful trees that will eventually return their stored carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere where it is badly needed.

By Tom Harris & Dr. Jay Lehr
pjmedia.com
03 Aug 2019
The new president of The Heartland Institute, Frank Lasee, was not exaggerating when he described the 13th International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC13) as “the most important climate change and energy event of the year.”
Speaking about the July 25 conference held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., Lasee explained, “ICCC13 demonstrated that the Climate Delusion is not based on sound science or economics. It is wasting trillions of dollars and threatening our way of life, while propping up the drive for world socialism.”
This was a common theme throughout ICCC13. The Climate Delusion, relying on bad science and misguided economics, is damaging America and threatening the world.

The conferencesold out with over 300 attendees, launched with a translated video address by Dominik Kolorz, a Polish trade union activist and the chairman of the Śląsko-Dąbrowski Solidarity, the largest regional union structure in Poland. Kolorz could not be at the conference because he had to support union workers in a protest against the closing of furnaces in one of the largest employers in Śląsko, a major steel plant, due to misguided European Union climate policy. “You can see that the effects of climate policy, already noticeable, can be very dramatic in a social context,” said Kolorz. “We do not deny that we are in a period of global warming. But … there is no scientific consensus, in our opinion, about human responsibility for climate change…”
Kolorz expressed strong concern about the long-term consequences of UN climate policy, stating, “what the European Union proposes to us in the frame of climate policy is…a liquidation of industry operating in Poland. It’s not just about banning the coal. It’s not only the elimination of conventional energy, but it is really about the decarbonizing of the industry in Poland but also in Europe, we would deal with the liquidation of the metallurgical, steel and cement industries…What can happen in Poland if we stick to the dogma of the climate policy—we will lose about half a million jobs in the next 20 years.
“I can declare that we in Poland are ready, under the auspicious of Solidarity, to actually lead to an economic, social, scientific conference on which different types of views will collide—those who say that man is responsible for climate change and the skeptical ones,” said Kolorz.
He told the audience, “Now, Solidarity with you can expose the lie that conducted climate policy is good for humans. Let us lead a policy that is really good for the citizens of the world but let us not lead the policy that is stuffed with lies and which would really lead to the fact that the rich will be even richer and the poor will be even poorer.”
This was followed by the presentation of the “Dauntless Purveyor of Climate Truth Award”to the junior author of this article, Dr. Jay Lehr, for his many years of fearless communication of climate science realities to the public. In his acceptance speech, Lehr focused on the real drivers of the climate scare—attempts by the left to impose world socialism and put society under ever more government control. Lehr demonstrated the Climate Delusion by listing twelve variables that, while crucially important to any calculation of projected Earth temperatures, are not well understood.
ICCC13 Panel One concerned “Scientific Observations,” in particular, the science presented in Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels, the latest volume of peer-reviewed research by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). The panel also focused on climate modeling vs. observed temperature data, and the Sun’s dominant influence on climate change. Dr. Nir J. Shaviv of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem explained that “There are no arguments proving that warming is mostly human.” Shaviv maintained that future warming will be benign, supporting his position with convincing data.
After tracing the history of the IPCC and the NIPCC, Dr. David Legates of the University of Delaware proposed that NIPCC reports be encapsulated in an online format that would be quick and easy for students and others to access.
Dr. Roy W. Spencer of the University of Alabama in Huntsville described how poorly computer models correlate with real climate change and concluded that there is no climate crisis or climate emergency. “Even if observed warming is due to increasing CO2 (carbon dioxide), it’s too weak to notice in your lifetime,” he said. Spencer also explained that “damaging tornadoes are down 50% since we started monitoring them in the 1950s. You wouldn’t know that from listening to the media every time a tornado hits a town.”
Panel 2 on Energy and Climate Economics was outstanding in making the real costs of the Climate Delusion clear and irrefutable. Kevin Dayaratna of the Heritage Foundation offered a simple explanation of the various mathematical models used to determine the costs to society of eliminating fossil fuels. No matter how he sliced it, the results are draconian. Dr. Ben Zycher, resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute, and Dr. Roger Bezdek described the absurdity of attempting to shift away from fossil fuels to unstable so-called renewable energy. Considering what goes into developing a wind turbine or a solar farm, it is clear that they are not really green and never economical without the government paying most of the bill. Zycher emphasized that “‘Clean’ power is not clean.” It requires huge land use and creates “heavy-metal pollution, noise, flicker effects, solar panel waste, wildlife destruction,” among other negative impacts of alternative energy sources. He also focused on the “anti-human core” and the “authoritarian implications” of the Green New Deal proposed by the Democrats.
In his luncheon keynote speech, Representative Tom McClintock (R-Calif., ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee) asserted that future generations “will remember with gratitude and admiration that there were organizations like Heartland…to lead us out of the darkness of fear and hysteria and into the light of the bright future that our advancing technology and freedom can and surely will deliver, if we let them.”
Christopher Monckton, the Viscount Monckton of Brenchley (UK), followed up with a highly technical talk in which he demonstrated that “Global warming will be small, slow, harmless and net beneficial. There is no case, rational, scientific, political, economic, social, moral or other for any mitigation of global warming. It’s over!”
At the lunch event, James Taylor, Heartland senior fellow, Environment and Energy Policy, introduced an open letter to President Donald Trump that he wrote and co-signed with nine other climate realists. The letter, which was included in the material given to all conference attendees, thanked the president for “speaking out against the fake climate crisis,” and asked for his help:
By appointing the Commission on Climate Security proposed by National Security Council scientist Dr. Will Happer. “It is a winning political argument to point out that you are supporting more scientific investigation and inquiry, rather than less,” the letter explained.“We ask that you tweet frequently about the Climate Delusion to break through the media blackout that has kept much of the public from learning about the Climate Realist position.”
The letter explained Trump’s important role in ending the Climate Delusion: “Without your help, it is likely the current media blackout imposed on the truth about the very minor role of CO2 in temperature forcing and the net benefits of a warmer climate will continue unabated.”
Attached to the open letter were 10 pages of supporting documentation demonstrating many of the mistakes in the Climate Delusion.
Dr. Craig Idso, Dr. Patrick Michaels, and Anthony Watts pulled the curtain away from the doctored data promoted by NASA and NOAA in Panel 3. They all showed that when the initial data did not support the Climate Delusion, alarmists found ways to convince people that the data needed to be adjusted. Idso focused on the data that does indeed prove that CO2 is the lifeblood of all vegetation, with plant growth always increasing with increasing levels of the gas.
This panel flipped the politically-correct argument on its head by proving with data and diagrams that increasing CO2 is not damaging the planet and its inhabitants, but instead is yielding huge benefits for life on Earth. They collectively emphasized that at the time of World War II, CO2 levels [about 300 parts per million (ppm)] were too close to plant starvation, which occurs with less than 150 ppm of CO2. Satellite photographs showed major greening of nearly every continent in the past 40 years. Particular increases are now seen in the rain forests along the equator.
The real-world benefits of increasing CO2 fly in the face of the propaganda produced by the United Nations and associated organizations that benefit by trying to increase the size of government in response to fraudulent fears.
The first speaker inPanel 4, “Winning Public Policy Options,” was Douglas Pollock from the University of Chile. His efforts to warn institutions about the unnecessary harm that fighting climate change is causing resulted in his views being banned in Chile and throughout Latin America. Pollock explained what has been happening in Chile as a cautionary tale about what can happen in North America if we follow their disastrous devotion to green energy. Pollock said that the impact on global temperature of Chile’s plans would be 0.0000115 deg C per decade. The wind and solar sources Chile has brought online recently “have meant an average cost at least nine times higher than those of traditional sources,” concluded Pollock.
James Taylor next explained the futility of conservatives trying to appeal to the left and influence the center by supporting the climate scare. He said, “Scientifically, economically, politically, if you are a Republican and you are pushing for these types of programs [lesser versions of the Green New Deal], you are a loser.” As the senior author of this article (Tom Harris) and moderator of Panel 4 commented after Taylor’s talk, “I wish you’d been an advisor to our previous prime minister Stephen Harper because he was elected as a climate skeptic and, in an attempt to appease the left and attract the middle vote, he moved over to become a climate alarmist. And the media still massacred him and he lost the last election.”
Finally, Myron Ebell, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Center for Energy and Environment, explained the debate that has gone on inside the Trump administration concerning the delayed Happer climate change commission. He also described two petitions launched by CEI. The first was for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to re-open the CO2 Endangerment Finding. Because of a new OMB (Office of Management and Budget) memorandum, the EPA has 120 days to answer the petition. The second petition was asking NASA to withdraw the misguided statements on their web site about 97% of scientists agreeing with the so-called global warming consensus.
“Let’s push back against the deep state that still has its tentacles around the White House,” concluded Ebell. No wonder the Business Insider commented, “Myron Ebell may be enemy #1 to the current climate change community.”

Panel 5, Advancing from Theory to Practice, discussed how fossil fuels are still very much a key part of the future of the world, and how America is leading the way. This panel made it clear that converting the world from coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear power can never happen in practice. But the effort to even attempt it will greatly damage the entire world population with the poorest suffering the most as energy costs skyrocket and brownouts and blackouts become the order of the day.
During panel 5, Dr. Benny Peiser, Director of the London, England-based Global Warming Policy Forum, gave an eye-opening talk about the negative impacts that installation of wind and solar energy projects were causing all over Europe. Germany’s poor judgment in this area, Peiser said, was destroying its leadership in all areas of high-tech manufacturing as a result of the tripling of their energy costs. For every kilowatt they produce with wind or sun, they must have a fossil fuel plant at the ready to take over when the wind and solar power are not adequate.
Lord Monckton gave a stirring speech in Panel 5 in which he demonstrated the “unit abatement cost of abating 1 degree C of anthropogenic global warming by policies equivalent to Britain’s zero-emissions plan was $273 trillion per degree C abated.” That is over one-quarter of a quadrillion dollars. “It is ten times more expensive, on these optimistic assumptions, to try to mitigate global warming than to let it happen and adapt to it,” Monckton concluded.
Also speaking in Panel 5 was Jennifer Fielder, CEO of the American Lands Council and a Montana state senator. She explained why nationally-controlled lands managed by distant, unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, combined with the influence of far-left extremists in the environmental movement, have resulted in dirty air, polluted water, decimated wildlife, blocked access and economically devastated, depressed and unsafe communities. The solution, said Fielder, was to entrust the land to people who live close to the land in the states.
During the evening meeting at the closing session, awards were given to three of the world’s most expert climate scientists:
Dr. Tim Ball received the “Lifetime Achievement in Climate Science Award.” In his acceptance speech, Dr. Ball explained how wealthy Canadian businessman, the late Maurice Strong, engineered much of the climate scare through the United Nations.Dr. Patrick Michaels received the “Courage in Defense of Science Award.” In his acceptance address, he summarized the high points of his efforts to stop the fraudulent alarmist movement’s promotion of the Climate Delusion.Dr. Richard Lindzen received the “Frederick Seitz Memorial Award.” In his acceptance speech, he cited many of the great scientists who came before him who seriously questioned the climate scare.
The conference came to a close with prominent meteorologist Joe Bastardi regaling the audience with his childhood love of weather, storms, and hurricanes. Now in his 60s, Joe showed amazing childhood enthusiasm for his work. He took the audience on a tour of the greatest hurricanes to hit the East coast of the United States over the last 100 years. While everyone was transfixed by his narrative, Joe’s phone rang. He paused and answered it, putting the caller on speakerphone. Out of the phone came the voice of “President Trump” complimenting Heartland for great work on climate change. “Trump” said, “One thing on climate: it’s just like the fake news story on Russia, which was a complete hoax, by the way, a complete hoax; there is no collusion between CO2 and temperature, no collusion whatsoever.” We may never know for sure whether or not it was indeed President Trump. We certainly would like to think so.
ICCC13 was one of the best of all of Heartland’s climate realist events yet. It will go a long way to helping end the Climate Delusion.

By Daniel Fitzhenry
The seas and oceans to the east of Australia forms the largest body of water on Earth. This broadly connected vast body of water presents a genuine sea level. The Sydney Fort Denison Recording Station provides stable, accurate and genuine mean sea level data. The following table shows mean sea levels at 10 year intervals and these levels are related to Chart Datum which is at the lowest spring tide level.

100 YEARS OF MEAN SEA LEVELS AT FORT DENISON, SYDNEY:
1914 – 1.11 metres
1924 – 0.98 metres
1934 – 0.98 metres
1944 – 0.97 metres
1954 – 1.00 metres
1964 – 1.09 metres
1974 – 1.09 metres
1984 – 1.02 metres
1994 – 1.04 metres
2004 – 1.08 metres
2014 – 1.12 metres
2019 – 1.05 metres
Accordingly, the mean sea level at Sydney in 2019 is 6 centimetres lower than the mean sea level at Sydney in 1914 when the Bureau Of Meteorology commenced recording Mean Sea Level.
High Sea Levels during Storm, Cyclone & Low Pressure Events.
Ill-informed commentators have asserted that sea levels may permanently rise by 1 to 2 metres in the next 100 years. 100 years of records on the largest water body on Earth indicates that this is incorrect.
There have always been short period storm and low pressure rises in sea levels. The highest recorded sea level at Sydney occurred during the 1974 low pressure storm. The sea level rose to 30 cm above high spring tide level for one day. During recorded history there has been no indication whatsoever of a 100 to 200 cm permanent rise in sea level.
There will always be short period storm, cyclone and low pressure rises in sea levels in close proximity to cyclone and storm centres. These storm centre rises in sea levels are not permanent.
Ocean swells and storm waves can exceed 16 metres during major storm surge events. It is these massive waves that have caused significant damage to coastal and island communities in the past. It is certain that huge storm event waves will occur in the future and will cause significant damage to the island and low lying communities. Coastline and flood zone protection is the sane answer to storm event damage.
It is polite and essential that the world population should avoid incorrect climate nonsense. We need to divert the alarmist energy to caring for the planet. Cease polluting the oceans. Prevent development of flood prone land and threatened coastal zones that have been, and will always be, subject to flooding.

Battery Storage-An Infinitesimal Part of Electrical Power
By Steve Goreham
Originally published in Energy Central.
Large-scale storage of electricity is the latest proposed solution to boost the deployment of renewables. Renewable energy advocates, businesses, and state governments plan to use batteries to store electricity to solve the problem of intermittent wind and solar output. But large-scale storage is only an insignificant part of the electrical power industry and doomed to remain so for decades to come.

Last month, Senator Susan Collins of Maine introduced a bi-partisan bill named “The Better Energy Storage Technology Act,” proposing to spend $300 million to promote the development of battery solutions for electrical power. Collins  stated, “Next-generation energy storage devices will help enhance the efficiency and reliability of our electric grid, reduce energy costs, and promote the adoption of renewable resources.”
Arizona, California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon adopted statutes or goals to develop storage systems for grid power, with New York committing to most ambitious target in the nation. In January, as part of his mandate for “100 percent clean power by 2040,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo  announced a target to deploy 3,000 megawatts (MW) of storage by 2030.
Today, 29 states have renewable portfolio standards laws, requiring utilities to purchase increasing amounts of renewable energy. But the electricity output from wind and solar systems is intermittent. On average, wind output is between 25% and 35% of rated output. Solar output is even less, delivering an average of about 15% to 20% percent of rated output.
Mandating the addition of wind and solar to power systems is like forcing a one-car family to buy a second car that runs only 30% of the time. The family can’t replace the original car with the new intermittent car, but must then maintain two cars.
Renewable advocates now propose electricity storage to solve the intermittency problem and to help renewable energy replace traditional coal, natural gas, and nuclear generators. When wind and solar output is high, excess electricity would be stored in batteries and then delivered when renewable output is low, to try to replace traditional power plants that generate electricity around the clock.
Headlines  laud the growth of battery installations for grid storage, growing 80% last year and  up 400% from 2014. But the amount of US electricity stored by batteries today is less than miniscule.
Pumped storage, not batteries,  provides about 97% of grid power storage in the United States today. Pumped storage uses electricity to pump water into an elevated reservoir to be used to drive a turbine when electricity is needed. But less than one in every 100,000 watts of US electricity comes from pumped storage.
In 2018, US power plants generated 4.2 million GW-hours of electrical power. Pumped storage capacity  totaled about 23 GW-hrs. Battery storage  provided only about 1 GW-hr of capacity. Less than one-millionth of our electricity is stored in grid-scale batteries.

Electricity storage is expensive. Pumped storage is the least  costly form of grid storage at about $2,000 per kilowatt, but requires areas where an elevated reservoir can be used. Battery storage  costs about $2,500 per kilowatt for discharge duration of two hours or more. Batteries are more expensive than onshore wind energy, which has an installed market  price of under $1,000 per kilowatt. But a key factor in the effectiveness of storage is the length of time that the system can deliver stored electricity.
In the case of New York State, plans  call for the installation of 9,000 MW of offshore wind capacity by 2035 and 3,000 MW of battery storage by 2030. The wind system will likely cost in excess of $9 billion, and the battery system will likely cost about $7.5 billion. But this planned battery deployment is wholly inadequate to remove the wind intermittency.
If the wind system has an average output of 33% of its rated output, then the planned 3,000 MW of battery storage would only be able to deliver the average wind output for about two hours. To replace output for a full day when the wind isn’t blowing, 36,000 MW of storage would be needed at a cost of $90 billion, or about ten times as much as the wind system itself. Since several days without wind in most locations is common, even a day of battery backup is inadequate.
In addition, the 10-15 year lifetime of grid-scale batteries is no bargain. Wind and solar systems are rated for 20-25 years of service life. Traditional coal, natural gas, and nuclear systems last for 35 years or more.
Storage of electricity should be regarded as foolish by anyone in the manufacturing industry. For decades, major companies pursued just-in-time manufacturing, “lot size one,” Kanban, lean manufacturing, and other programs designed to eliminate finished goods inventory to reduce costs. Electricity is delivered immediately upon generation, the ultimate zero-finished-goods-inventory product. But many organizations now clamor for electricity storage to try to fix the intermittency weakness of renewables.
Today, battery grid storage capacity is less than one millionth of national electricity output. Practical battery storage adds a cost factor of at least ten to the cost of the partner renewable system. It will be decades before battery storage plays a significant role in large-scale power systems, if ever.

If you wonder where today’s temperature fits in with the grand scheme of time on Earth since the dinosaurs were wiped out, here’s the history. We start with the whole 65 million years, then zoom in, and zoom in again to the last 12,000 from both ends of the world. What’s obvious is that in terms of homo sapiens history, things are warm now (because we’re not in an ice age). But, in terms of homo sapiens civilization, things are cooler than usual, and appear to be cooling.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS A MYTH

INTRODUCTION
Climate alarmists believe the world is warming, and that this is caused exclusively by man-made carbon dioxide. ‘Global Warming” is now stretched to Climate Change”, but it must be stressed that carbon dioxide can only produce warming: the deceptive change of name does not change the alleged process.
To demonise carbon dioxide further it is supposed to cause ‘acidification’ of the oceans. They claim that anthropogenic carbon dioxide causes the ocean to become more ‘acid’, which dissolves carbonate. This despite the fact that the oceans are alkaline, and have never been acid throughout their existence on Earth. We are implored to reduce the production of anthropogenic carbon dioxide to ‘protect’ the ocean. In this article I show that such claims are baseless, and indeed that carbon dioxide is beneficial to the ocean.

CHEMISTRY OF CARBONATES
pH AND THE MEANING OF ‘ACID’
‘Acid’ is an emotive word to the general public, which is why it is seized upon by the alarmists in their search for yet another scare. In reality increasing CO2 makes the ocean become ‘less alkaline’, but never ‘acid’.
Acidity and alkalinity are measured on a pH scale which goes from 0 to 14. pH is a measurement of the amount of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, the log of the hydrogen ion concentration with the sign changed. The pH needs to be less than 7 to be ‘acid’ and above 7 is alkaline. Because it is a log scale it is very hard to move a pH of 8.2 to 7.0, which is neutral. Claims of ‘increasing acidity’ in the oceans are misleading wordplay, because the ocean would not even start to be acid until the pH was below 7. It is like saying a block of ice is becoming more liquid if the temperature changes from -30oC to -20oC when it cannot become liquid until it reaches 0oC. The ocean has never been acid throughout Earth history.
The pH of sea water can be very variable. Ocean pH varies regionally by 0.3, and seasonally in a particular location by 0,3. Rhodes Fairbridge told me that he found the day-night variation in a coral pool was 9.4 to 7.5. David Barnes reports that on the Great Barrier Reef water is pushed onto the front of reefs at around pH 8.1-8.2. It then flows across the shallow reef flat and into the lagoon or back-reef area. The pH of water leaving the reef flat in the daytime is around 8.4-8.5. The pH of water leaving the reef flat at night is around 7.9-8.0. This shift is entirely due to removal of CO2 during the day because of photosynthesis by reef organisms, notably corals, coralline algae and ubiquitous, all-pervasive filamentous green algae (note that most of the significant calcifiers on reefs are photosynthetic; examples are green algae, foraminifera and giant clams). During the day photosynthesis considerably exceeds respiration. During the night there is only respiration. Hence, at night, addition of CO2 to the water mass by respiration of benthic organisms decreases the pH.
CARBONATE EQUILIBIUM
Chemical equilibrium is a bit too complex to describe here, but some of the Alarmists make use of it to create scares. Gattuso and Hanson (2011) edited a book called Ocean Acidification, which has many papers with the usual alarms. Strangely there is a very level-headed Foreword by Wallace Broecker, who wrote: “Surface waters are supersaturated for calcite (fixed by oysters and coccoliths amongst others) and aragonite (corals, clams and others), so what is the problem?” Perhaps the problem is that despite the seawaters being supersaturated, bubbling carbon dioxide still causes increased biological activity as described below.
LIFE AND CARBONATES
Many marine organisms need CO2 to make their coral skeletons, carbonate shells and so on. Corals also have symbiotic plants within their flesh that use CO2 in photosynthesis.
Marine life flourishes where CO2 is abundant. Professor Walter Stark (2010) described the relationship between organisms and pH at two carbon dioxide ‘vents’, the Bubble Bath’ and Esa’Ala, near Dobu Island, Papua New Guinea. Here CO2 of volcanic origin is bubbling visibly through the water so that the water is saturated with CO2. Life flourishes in abundance to make the vents spectacular favourite sites for scuba divers. He reported many accurate measurements of pH in the area and concluded “It seems that coral reefs are thriving at pH levels well below the most alarming projections.”
At Esa’Alaa sample taken immediately adjacent to a Porites coral and about 10 cm from a small bubble stream had a pH value of 7.96. A sample from next to a Porites coral at the “Bubble Bath” measured 7.74. This was about 10 cm from a large bubble stream and about 12 m from the main gas vent. A sample next to the main vent measured 6.54.
Other such sites are known around the world, such as the Champagne Reef, a premier diving site in Dominica, which is reported to be ‘full of life’. It is probable that the oceanic carbonate fixers are suffering CO2 starvation. Just as terrestrial plants grow better under elevated CO2 levels, marine life does better with more CO2.
As the modern investigation into the potential impacts of increasing carbon dioxide in sea water on marine life continues, one narrative is beginning to emerge across the scientific literature, which is that rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations will likely benefit the growth of primary producers. For example Pardew et al. (2018) studies the growth responses of seven phytoplankton species from four major taxons to elevated levels of seawater pCO2. Each of the species was grown under controlled-environment conditions under either ambient (~500 µatm) or elevated (~1,000 µatm) pCO2 in either a high-nitrogen or low-nitrogen culture medium.
They say the growth rates of all species “increased with high CO2 independent of culture regime, where on average an increase of 0.12 ± 0.07 per day was observed in phytoplankton exposed to high CO2 compared to ambient conditions” (p < 0.001). The picture painted by this study is quite different from that sold to the public by climate alarmists, who consistently claim that so-called ocean acidification is detrimental to marine life.
In a comprehensive analysis of experimental studies that explored the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on marine biota, Hendriks et al. (2010) assembled a database of 372 experimentally-evaluated responses of 44 different marine species to ocean acidification that was induced by equilibrating seawater with CO2-enriched air. This they did because, as they describe it, “warnings that ocean acidification is a major threat to marine biodiversity are largely based on the analysis of predicted changes in ocean chemical fields,” which are derived from theoretical models that do not account for numerous biological phenomena and have only “limited experimental support.”
They note that “calcification is an active process where biota can regulate intracellular calcium concentrations,” so that “marine organisms, like calcifying coccolithophores (Brownlee and Taylor, 2004), actively expel Ca2+ through the ATPase pump to maintain low intracellular calcium concentrations.” They suggest “there is evidence that calcification could even increase in acidified seawater, contradicting the traditional belief that calcification is a critical process impacted by ocean acidification.”
In brief Hendriks et al. conclude that the world’s marine biota are “more resistant to ocean acidification than suggested by pessimistic predictions identifying ocean acidification as a major threat to marine biodiversity.” Biological processes can provide homeostasis against changes in pH of surrounding water.
For further details of coral adaption see Sully et al. 2019, and Steele, 2019. These authors suggest that corals can successfully adapt to stressful environments.
One of the factors affecting ocean pH is photosynthesis by plants. Experimental results show that plants grow better if CO2 is increased, and greenhouse managers commonly increase the CO2 artificially to increase crops, often by 30% or more. There is every reason to suppose that marine plants also thrive if CO2 is increased. There is also experimental evidence that carbonate secreting animals thrive in higher CO2. Herfort and colleagues (2008) concluded that the likely result of human emissions of CO2 would be an increase in oceanic CO2 that could stimulate photosynthesis and calcification in a wide variety of corals.
Marine life, including that part that fixes CO2 as the carbonate in limestones such as coral reefs, evolved on an Earth with CO2 levels many times higher than those of today, as reported by Berner and Kothaval (2001). It may be true to say that today’s marine life is getting by in a CO2-deprived environment. A sample from next to a Porites coral at the “Bubble Bath” measured 7.74.
CARBONATE FACTORIES
In a book about the coast of South Australia Bourman et al. (2016) provided the concept of ‘carbonate factories’. The coasts are dominated by carbonate sands in the form of beaches and dunes. The source of the sediment was a subtidal carbonate factory with the prolific growth of calcareous marine invertebrates such as molluscs, bryozoans, coralline algae, echinoids, and foraminifers. Attrition of their remains leads to the formation of sand-sized sedimentary particles of calcium carbonate.
In Gulf St Vincent seagrasses thrive with extremely productive calcareous algae, foraminifers and molluscs manufacturing vast amounts of calcareous sediment. In Spencer Gulf the dominant processes of coastal development are related to the massive production and accumulation of biogenic skeletal carbonate fragments derived from coralline algae, foraminifers, molluscs and bryozoans. The site is a major carbonate factory sequestering much CO2.
“The coastline of South Australia is part of the world’s largest aeolianite (dune limestone) temperate sedimentary carbonate province, which extends from western Victoria to north of Shark Bay, Western Australia. The aeolianite deposits attest to the high calcium carbonate bioproductivity of the surrounding continental shelf environments”.
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF CARBONATES
Whether the Earth started as a hot or cold body, any primordial gas would have escaped. Volcanic eruptions produced the gases, including water which formed the oceans, and carbon dioxide which formed 98% of the original atmosphere. The evolution of life changed that. When photosynthesis started, more and more oxygen was introduced into the atmosphere (which changed the course of rock weathering), and when carbonate secretion arrived in the late Precambrian, limestone deposition started to sequester CO2.
Most modern reef coral genera have fossil histories going back from 5-10 million years to over 100 million years. They have survived both ice ages and very warm periods, and times when CO2 was at 5-10 times current levels.
Contrary to popular belief, at 400 parts per million (0.04 per cent), CO2 is lower now in the atmosphere than it has been during most of the 550 million years since modern life forms emerged during the Cambrian period. CO2 was about 10 times higher than it is today. Corals and shellfish evolved early and have obviously managed to survive through eras of much higher CO2 than present levels. Finally, it is a fact that people who have saltwater aquariums sometimes add CO2 to the water in order to increase coral growth and to increase plant growth.
The truth is CO2 is the most important food for all life on Earth, including marine life. It is the main food for photosynthetic plankton (algae), which in turn is the food for the entire food chain in the sea. On top of this some marine organisms use CO2 to produce their skeletons of calcium carbonate. This has led to the ever-increasing amount of limestone amongst the sedimentary rocks, sequestering vast amounts of carbon dioxide.
SPECIAL CONCERNS IN AUSTRALIA
CORAL BLEACHING
There is a completely fake argument used by Alarmists including NASA implying that coral bleaching is caused by carbon dioxide. Bleached coral is perfectly normal, and recovers in a few years by recolonization. It occurs when wave driven mixing ceases during periods of extended calm associated with unusual warming of the surface 1-2 m.
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF
The iconic Great Barrier Reef is one of the best-known features of Australia, and we are constantly told it is in danger. The Australian Government’s Great Barrier Marine Park Authority writes (2018): “In the long-term, ocean acidification is likely to be the most significant impact of a changing climate on the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem”.
Another example is provided by Albright et al. (2016) who claim their research shows, the reduction in seawater pH – caused by carbon dioxide from human activities such as burning fossil fuels – is making it more difficult for corals to build and maintain their skeletons. Possibly the greatest danger to the GBR is the huge amount of money, tens of millions of dollars, made available for research on the reef. This has led to a feeding-frenzy of people wanting to use the money, who maintain that the reef is in danger, to keep the money flowing.
David Barnes has spent many hours measuring the pH in all parts of the reef. He tells me “On the GBR water is pushed onto the front of reefs at around pH 8.1-8.2. It them flows across the shallow reef flat and into the lagoon or back-reef area. The pH of water leaving the reef flat in the daytime is around 8.4-8.5. The pH of water leaving the reef flat at night is around 7.9-8.0. This shift is entirely due to removal of CO2 during the day because of photosynthesis by reef organisms, notably corals, coralline algae and ubiquitous, all-pervasive filamentous green algae (note that most of the significant calcifiers on reefs are photosynthetic; examples are green algae, foraminiferans and giant clams). During the day photosynthesis considerably exceeds respiration. During the night there is only respiration. Hence, at night, addition of CO2 to the water mass by respiration of benthic organisms decreases the pH.
Notice that the organisms at the back of a reef flat are experiencing daily a shift in pH that our alarmist friends would have us believe will bring destruction to coral reefs if it had taken place in the water flowing onto a reef. Coral growth is usually at its most luxurious at the back of a reef flat.”
The Great Barrier Reef has been able to re-establish itself repeatedly during high sea level episodes associated with major environmental fluctuations in sea level, temperature and CO2 over the past several hundred thousand years. The GBR complex goes back about two million years, but the reef as we know it is only about 10,000 years old. Before that there were huge changes in climate and sea level. Where the GBR reef complex is from tens to over a hundred Km in width today, it was reduced to a narrow fringing reef along the edge of a vast coastal plain during the last glacial period. It was not great and was not a barrier reef. It also experienced earlier glacial periods, with sea level falls. The GBR has survived many wide changes in environmental conditions, yet still ocean acidification is singled out by alarmists as the great threat to the reef.
CONCLUSION
Marine life depends on CO2, and some plants and animals fix it as limestone, which is not generally re-dissolved. Over geological time enormous amount of CO2 have been sequestered by living things, so that today there is far more CO2 in limestones than in the atmosphere or ocean. This sequestration of CO2 by living things is far more important than trivial additions to the atmosphere caused by human activity.
The ‘carbonate factories’ described here show that carbon dioxide is vital for the production of carbonate sands and ultimately limestone. Trying to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the ocean by reducing emissions by human activities is not only futile, but if it could be done it would have harmful consequences on all the carbonate fixing animals and plants in the ocean. The continued existence of the Great Barrier Reef, like coral reefs all over the world, depends on corals and other plants and animals fixing carbon dioxide as part of their skeletons, as part of the carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide in sea water does not dissolve coral reefs, but is essential to their survival.

by Mike Bailey
I am a retired Surveyor who spent his whole career (1965 to 2010) measuring and recording:
Water depths, to enable safe navigation of ships and boats into harbours.Coastal features, such as shorelines and beaches, to monitor changes in depth that occur over time.Near shore constructions, such as sea walls, groynes wharves, piers and jetties and boat ramps to monitor their effect on the surrounding areas.
In order for these depth measurements to have any coherence they have to be related to a common reference level. In Australia this common reference level or Datum is the Australian Height Datum (AHD).
AHD is a mean sea level datum and was established by analysis of data from recording tide gauges which operate in ports around Australia and which in some cases have been operating for around a century. (see below) I have not found any proposal that this datum be changed due to the rising sea level.
AHD was adopted by the National Mapping Council in May 1971 as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping was to be referred.

(AHD71 is a surface that passes through approximate MSL realised between 1966 and 1968 at 30 tide gauges around the coastline. (From Australian tides manual).
Due to the fact that tidal ranges vary around the Australian coast, from very large ranges in ports such as Darwin and Broome who experience tidal ranges in the order of 10 metres, to almost no tidal fluctuation in Hobart, each port has established a local datum for charting which is known as Chart datum which in turn is related to AHD.
A charting datum, usually lowest astronomical tide (LAT), is stated to be a height below AHD and is essential for shipping and boating because the depth of water available in a channel or port at a particular time is the depth shown on the chart the plus the height of the tide. In order to plan shipping movements along with many other coastal pursuits and construction activities the tidal height at any given time needs to be known in advance so the calculation and publication of Tide Tables is part of commerce and the overall economy.
It is for these two reasons that great attention has been paid by maritime authorities to the accurate collection of tidal records following the establishment of any port so that there exists a pool of data which can be analysed to determine mean sea level and consequently monitor any changes that have occurred over time.
An appreciation of the degree of effort that goes into the accurate monitoring and analysis of tides can be seen by reading through the Australian tides manual. If sea levels around Australia have been rising significantly it would seem logical that Port Authorities would acknowledge this and plan accordingly. No mention of this is made in this publication, or any authoritative source that I can locate.
From a publication by the Department of Spatial Sciences. December 2010:
An examination of the Australian Height Datum

Michael Shaun Filmer

This thesis is presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of Curtin University of Technology
MSL can also change over long periods (secular changes), which can occur on a global basis (eustatic changes; Pugh,1987 , (301), causing the vertical datum zero-reference to no longer be MSL. Estimates of global sea level rise indicate a 20th century increase of ∼1.7 mm year (Church and White 2006). The sea level change is thought to be the result of thermal expansion of the oceans, with some contribution from melting glaciers and ice caps (Church et al.2008)
This conclusion is from actual measurements from tide gauges not computer models.
From the Australian Academy of Science website:
Globally, sea levels are currently rising

For two thousand years before the mid-19th century, the long-term global sea-level change was small, only a few centimetres per century. Since then, the rate of rise has increased substantially; from 1900 to 2012, sea level rose by a global average of about 19 centimetres.
This is also 1.7 mm annually, or put another way, it will take 588 years to rise a metre using a linear projection. It goes on to state:
In the past 20 years, both satellite and coastal sea-level data indicate that the rate of rise has increased to about 3 centimetres per decade. A similarly high rate was experienced in the 1920 to 1950 period (Figure 6.1 [below]).
This could be interpreted as indicating that sea level change is cyclic not linear and projecting a linear or parabolic progression into the future is likely to be incorrect. The suggestion that sea levels “could” rise by a metre or more in the next century is pure conjecture not forecasting. As nearly all natural phenomena are cyclic it seems reasonable to suggest that sea levels would also be driven in the same manner.
Why then is there a sudden parabolic rise predicted as shown in the (Figure 6.1) particularly as there now seems to be a debate amongst the scientific community that we are entering a period of solar minimum which will cause the energy output of the sun to reduce and consequently the earth’s temperatures to fall. Again this is based on the observation of cycles.
This debate can be found on the NASA website.

The cyclic nature of sea level heights is further backed up by an extract from the NSW Environmental and Heritage website, under the heading “Measurement of sea level rise”. We find the following information which seems to validate the fact that sea level changes are cyclic rather than parabolic or linear.
Larger scale phenomena, like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the nodal tide and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), can cause fluctuations in sea level spanning years to decades and are more difficult to isolate from sea level trends.
At multidecadal time scales sea level also varies with the IPO, which operates over time frames of 20 to 30 years (National Tidal Centre 2010; Holbrook, Goodwin et al 2010). This long period oscillation is a lengthy interdecadal fluctuation in atmospheric pressure and sea surface temperature
. When the IPO is low, cooler than average sea surface temperatures occur over the central North Pacific, and vice versa. During the 20th century the IPO exhibited three major phases: it was positive (southeastern tropical Pacific warm) from 1922 to 1946 and 1978 to 1998, and negative between 1947 and 1976. During positive phases of IPO more El Niño like conditions prevail and sea levels in Eastern Australia are lower than average. During negative phases more La Nina like conditions prevail and sea levels are higher than average.
Again this conclusion is reached using actual measurements not computer models.
Below is one of many scare stories that have proved to be incorrect.
U.N. Predicts Disaster if Global Warming Not Checked

PETER JAMES SPIELMANN June 30, 1989

UNITED NATIONS (AP) – A senior U.N. environmental official says “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000. ”

“Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ‘eco- refugees,’ threatening political chaos”, said Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, or UNEP.

He said: “governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control.

“As the warming melts polar icecaps, ocean levels will rise by up to three feet, enough to cover the Maldives and other flat island nations, Brown told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday.”
30 years on this has clearly not happened. Are the current scare articles any different?

While it should have been recognized long ago as an urban myth, one of those stories that hang around regardless of a lack of any supporting facts. Rarely a day goes that a global warming alarmists do not use it to promote their cause of enlarging government and reducing personal freedom through the promotion of fear about our future.
Many articles have been written to refute this claim but they all dig into the statistical weeds. Common sense alone should set you straight. If the reader wishes he or she read could read the original paper by Naomi Oreskes that started it all in Science Magazine in December of 2004. Be aware you might die laughing.

The biased folks who concluded from a truly bizarre survey of science literature that 97% of all authors believe in man caused global warming would have actually been better served had they concluded that 70% of all scientists believe in their premise. That would actually have been possible. However a little common sense should tell us that no large group of people on our planet could ever reach 97% agreement on anything. Yes anything, including the Earth being round rather than flat or the sun rising in the East rather than West, or even the Earth’s gravitational pull.
Simple proof of this erroneous talking point is provided by the Global Warming Petition Project at the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine in 2015. They obtained signatures on a Declaration from 31,478 American scientists, including 9,021 with Ph.D.s that stated they did not believe man kind had a significant impact on his climate. The declaration included the words: “There is no convincing scientific evidence that human releases of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases are causing or will in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environment of the Earth.”
They made all the names available in a paper back book.It is rather doubtful that these people all comprise the 3% of non believers.
We do not doubt there are many scientists who do believe that man plays a major role in the determination of his climate. However, among the unsuspecting public who do not stop to consider what we are saying, the near universal comment of “the 97%” has done a lot of damage. It leads to poor anti fossil fuel legislation in states all across the nation. It leads to some states embracing the Paris Accord which would redistribute $3 trillion of American dollars to nations who use little fossil fuel. These American states could have none but zero impact on the planets thermometer but they can and will damage their state’s economy and their citizens standard of living.
The fraudulent 97% consensus is clearly a marketing ploy. What makes science different from religion is that only empirical evidence matters not opinion. Consensus does not matter at all in science.
It is not unique in science for incorrect views to hold forth for decades if not centuries before the crowds are turned back by incontrovertible evidence. Medical history is full of the minorities trying to make surgery safer by the simple effort of hand washing. Ulcers were long thought to be a result of type “A” personalities rather than requiring a specific bacteria to allow their development. Einstein himself fought an uphill battle with his theory of relativity. When 100 German scientists collaborated on a consensus to defeat him he said famously “If I were wrong one would have been enough”.
Give some thought to what we are saying next time you are confronted with this dangerous absurdity, which will likely be tomorrow.

Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy would inflict major land, wildlife, resource damage
By Paul Driessen
Extract from: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/07/05/monumental-unsustainable-environmental-impacts/
Solar panels on Nevada’s Nellis Air Force Base generate 15 megawatts of electricity perhaps 30% of the year from 140 acres. Arizona’s Palo Verde nuclear power plant generates 900 times more electricity, from less land, some 95% of the year. Generating Palo Verde’s output via Nellis technology would require land area ten times larger than Washington, DC – and would still provide electricity unpredictably only 30% of the time. Now run those solar numbers for the 3.5 billion megawatt-hours generated nationwide in 2016.
Modern coal or gas-fired power plants use less than 300 acres to generate 600 megawatts 95% of the time. Indiana’s 600-MW Fowler Ridge wind farm covers 50,000 acres and generates electricity about 30% of the year. Calculate the turbine and acreage requirements for 3.5 billion MWH of wind electricity.
Delving more deeply, generating 20% of US electricity with wind power would require up to 185,000 1.5-MW turbines, 19,000 miles of new transmission lines, 18 million acres, and 245 million tons of concrete, steel, copper, fiberglass and rare earths – plus fossil-fuel back-up generators for the 75-80% of the year that winds nationwide are barely blowing and the turbines are not producing electricity.

https://carbon-sense.com/2019/03/24/what-happened-to-global-warming/,,What Happened to Global Warming?,"By David Archibald
The global warming hysteria was reaching a crescendo in the lead up to the climate confab in Copenhagen in 2009 when a civic-minded person released the Climategate emails, deflating the whole thing. Those emails, concocted from the fevered imaginations of the scientists involved.
Nigh on 10 years have passed since then and we are currently experiencing another peak in the hysteria that seems to be coordinated worldwide. But why? Why now? The global warming scientists have plenty of time on their hands and plenty of money. Idle curiosity would have got some to have a stab at figuring out what is going to happen to climate. Do they see an imminent cooling and they have to get legislation in place before that is apparent?

The passage of those ten years has given us another lot of data points on the global warming. There are now 40 years of satellite measurements of atmospheric temperature and this is how that plots up for the Lower 48 States:

What the graph shows is the departure from the average for the 30 years from 1981 to 2010. The last data point is February 2019 with a result of -0.03 degrees C. So we have had 40 years of global warming and the temperature has remained flat. In fact it is slightly cooler than the long term average. Is it possible to believe in global warming when the atmosphere has cooled? No, not rationally. Is it possible for global warming to be real if the atmosphere has cooled? Again no.
Now let’s look at carbon dioxide, which is supposed to be driving the global warming, if it was happening. A lab high up on Mauna Loa in Hawaii has been measuring the atmospheric concentration since 1958. As it is the annual change in concentration that is supposed to be driving global warming let’s see how that plots up:

What it shows is that the driving effect has been in a wide band from 1979 when the satellites to measure temperature went up but the trend is flat. Think about that – 40 years of forcing and no result in the actual atmospheric temperature. If it was ever going to happen it would have happened by now.
The opposite of global warming is global cooling. What are the chances of that? Pretty good in fact. Only one graph is need to show the potential for that – the aa Index which is a measure of the Sun’s magnetic field strength. Records of that have been kept since 1868:

The second half of the 20th century had a solar magnetic field strength that was 50% higher than that of the last 60 years of the Little Ice Age. That ended in 2006. We are now back to the solar activity levels of the 19th century and that will bring the sort of climate our forbears had then.
And so it has come to pass. January-February had record cold over North America. Seemingly the polar vortex was everywhere because Japan also had record cold.
Waiting for global warming to happen is like Waiting for Godot. It is never going to happen and the wait is getting beyond tedious.
In the meantime there is no evidence for global warming and the opposite is happening, as shown by the record cold we have just experienced. It is time to stop giving global warmers the benefit of doubt – they are loons. That includes Rick Perry.
David Archibald has lectured on climate science in both Senate and House hearing rooms.

Dear friends from the English-speaking world,
Just to keep you abreast of what is going on in France…
You may have heard of the Yellow Vests, who triggered our president Macron into embarking on a “Grand Debate”, mainly on the internet. It is mostly a closed questionnaire with circular arguments on the most surreptitious ways to shoehorn the energy transition, without offering to question its legitimacy in the first place. However, looking closely at the fine print, contributors like associations can still express an open opinion.
On our side Rémy Prud’homme is an emeritus professor of economics, former consultant to the OECD, occasionally to the World Bank, and visiting professor at the MIT.

by Jerry Ellis and Sir Rod Carnegie 20 February 2019
The Chairman of the Saltbush Club, Mr Jerry Ellis, today warned that Australia needs more reliable baseload power.
“With the population and the economy growing, but with electricity availability and reliability in decline, we are racing headlong into a brick wall of blackouts.

“Recession and disruption will probably follow, bringing to mind those memorable 1990 words of Paul Keating: ‘This is the recession we had to have’. Except in this case the recession will be self-inflicted.

“Much of my working life was in the steel industry in the 1970s and 1980s. It operated 24×7, with large numbers of electric motors requiring a continuous supply of low-cost electrical power. Un-planned interruptions were rare, but when they occurred they were very costly.
“Now we face the prospect of planned and unplanned loss of power due to the rundown of base-load power capacity. It must be a nightmare for today’s steelmakers and aluminium refineries facing this growing crisis.
“It is essential that Australia rebalances economic imperatives against populist ideas regarding the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
“A strong Australian economy is crucial to Australia’s welfare and will also make a valuable contribution to world prosperity.
“Australia produces a tiny proportion of the world’s carbon dioxide. Even total closure of our industry would have no detectable impact on carbon dioxide emissions or global climate.
“We urgently need new supplies of reliable energy from coal, gas, hydro or nuclear.”
Jerry Ellis was supported by Sir Rod Carnegie, former Managing Director, CEO and Chairman of CRA (Rio Tinto) who said:
It is essential that Australia regains its reputation for cheap reliable electricity or we will lose our manufacturing and refining industries, returning only to our backbone industries of agriculture and mining.


Jerry Ellis once managed Australia’s biggest steelworks at Port Kembla, and one of the world’s largest mining enterprises BHP minerals. He is a past Chairman of BHP and of Landcare.

By Viv Forbes
Earth is a dangerous place. Of all the species that have ever lived, over 95% have already been extinguished by natural disasters.
Just 15,000 years ago
Ice, not global warming, is the big killer and this recurring calamity often strikes quickly. Thousands of mammoths and other animals were killed by ice storms and their snap-frozen bodies are still entombed in ice around the Arctic. Just 15,000 years ago great ice sheets smothered the northern hemisphere as far south as Chicago, Moscow and London and all life had migrated towards the equator. This deadly ice had gripped Earth for about 50,000 years.

Ice ages are also times of dry winds and drought as cold oceans and cold dry atmospheres produce little evaporation or precipitation. Great deserts like the Sahara and the Gobi expand, and wind-blown dust fills the skies and rivers.
Adding to Ice Age woes, cold oceans suck the gas of life (carbon dioxide) out of the atmosphere, thus making surviving plants less able to cope with cold and drought. One of the great serendipities of modern life is that man’s use of carbon-rich fuels like oil and coal not only provides energy but also adds carbon dioxide plant food to the severely depleted carbon stocks of the atmosphere. Satellites have detected the resultant greening of the Earth.
Earth also suffers cycles of volcanism where much life is extinguished by ash, lava, earthquakes and tsunamis, usually followed by more cold and starvation as dust blocks sunlight. Just one era of volcanism covered the Deccan in India with many lava flows in places more than 2 km thick and spewed hot lava into the oceans along the mid-ocean trenches. Earthquakes and resulting tsunamis swept all life from large areas of land and dumped and buried their fragmented remains in heaps of mud.
We also have evidence of massive destruction on Earth from collisions and near misses by comets and other bodies in the solar system.
Humans are not immune to the threat of extinction, but it will not come from today’s warm, moist, atmosphere or from the gas of life, carbon dioxide. It will probably come from the next glacial cycle in the Pleistocene Ice age, where long bitter glacial eras are separated by short warm periods such as the Holocene warm era in which we live.
In every short warm era like today’s Holocene, the warming oceans expel enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to terrify today’s global warming alarmists. And these times have always supported abundant plant and animal life. But never has “global warming” from this “greenhouse gas” prevented the cyclic return of the ice.
When blizzards blow and glaciers grow, the great ice sheets will spread again and mankind will be decimated by cold, drought, crop failures and starvation. A lucky few living in equatorial regions or clustered in shelters and hot houses around nuclear power stations will survive.
Those still able to extract coal, oil or gas may manage to generate enough warmth and carbon dioxide plant food to offset the cold sun, the permafrost and the barren atmosphere. And a few with appropriate skills and tools may become hunters and gatherers again (but the Neanderthals did not make it last time).
We should celebrate, not fear, the Modern Warm Era and give thanks for the many benefits gained from recycling those marvellous batteries of stored and buried carbon resources to our still-hungry biosphere.
When the ice returns, derelict and snow-bound wind turbines and solar panels will remain as stark evidence of the failed Green religion of yet another endangered species.

https://carbon-sense.com/2019/02/13/war-on-beef/,,The War on Beef – Are cows the culprits?,"by David Mason-Jones 
There is an old fake-science idea doing the rounds again at the moment. This is that cows are culprits in the global warming narrative. The problem, however, is that the scary image of cows destroying the planet with their carbon emissions doesn’t fit with how the planet actually works.
No cow alive today, nor any cow that has ever existed, nor any cow that will ever exist, can add single atom of carbon to the atmosphere that wasn’t already there in the first place.
At one point of the carbon cycle, it is true that cows emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, each of which contains one atom of carbon. This is a basic fact of biology – but what about some other basic facts to go with it?
It would seem the fact that ruminants emit carbon gases is regarded as the clincher argument by people like Rosemary Stanton and Kris Barnden, who recently published an article on the ABC News website damning cattle. The problem is they fail to put this isolated fact together with others to give it context and, in this way, create a misleading impression. They fail to describe how a cow exists within the carbon cycle. They fail to ask a fundamental question; ‘Is the carbon a cow emits new carbon to the atmosphere?’

The believer/activists don’t explain that cows eat plants and that all the carbon in a plant comes from the atmosphere, not the ground. The carbon in the leaves comes from the minute traces of carbon dioxide in the air around them via the process of photosynthesis. Even the carbon in the roots of plants comes from the atmosphere and even the carbon in the carbohydrate sugars that the roots exude to soil microbes in a swap for nutrients, comes the air above us. The energy for this is captured by the plant’s own solar panels – its leaves.
The believer/activists don’t explain that when a cow eats a plant it is vicariously ‘eating’ carbon from the atmosphere. They don’t explain that, when that cow exhales carbon dioxide or belches methane, the carbon in those gases goes back to where it ultimately came from – air around them.
Healthy cattle consuming grass containing carbon from the atmosphere. The gas emissions from these cows go back to the atmosphere again with no net gain in carbon.
The implications of photosynthesis are not divulged to the public by the cows-are-culprits believer/activists. They don’t explain where animals get their energy from and how their food sources become laden with energy.  (Hint: it’s ultimately from the Sun and it involves the carbon cycle, the water cycle and photosynthesis.)
Plants combine carbon, hydrogen and oxygen to make carbohydrate chains or ‘sugars’. (C6H12O6)
Cows and other animals consume these carbohydrate sugars and ‘burn’ them as energy to run their bodies. As a result of this ‘combustion’ the by-product of carbon dioxide is produced and exhaled to the atmosphere. We humans do the same thing. Once in the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide again becomes available for photosynthesis in plants, and so the cycle starts over again. This is an example of sustainability in plants and animals.
So, with regard to the carbon dioxide the cow breathes out, it goes straight back to where it came from – the atmosphere.
What about the methane?
The methane issue is a kind of blind spot for those who vilify cows because most bovine critics would see themselves as deeply concerned about preserving a natural and organic environment. Well, methane from cattle is a natural and organic gas but the detractors portray it as something else – something unusual, something particularly sinister. Methane production is also solar powered – another appealing feature to those concerned about natural and organic things. Methane inevitably results from the process of plant growth (photosynthesis) and subsequent fermentation by various agencies such as microbes, insects and ruminant animals. Methane occurs naturally and abundantly in rainforests, wetlands, lakes, swamps, rivers and arid zones.
Methane is produced naturally and organically in the environment by microbes, ruminant animals, wild grazing herds and the prodigious activity of insects such as ants and termites.
A cow has a part of its digestive process that we do not have and this enables it to eat tough cellulose food. This fermentation chamber is called a rumen where, with the aid of microbes, the cow processes tough cellulose foods in the absence of oxygen. The by-product of this combustion is methane (CH4) which is then belched.
The methane molecule is unstable in oxygen and, once in the oxygen-rich atmosphere, reverts to carbon dioxide and water vapour – see equation at end. For the period that the methane molecule is in the atmosphere it is a potential global warming gas but its molecular characteristics – its heat absorption capacity – is not well matched to the frequency at which the Earth radiates heat. For this reason the theoretical heat-trapping potential of methane is curtailed when the gas converts to its original form. And, in any case, it is a natural part of the environment that has been happening for hundreds of millions of years by vast herds of ruminant herbivores across the globe.
It seems that the detractors of cattle are reluctant to concede that the emissions of cows are part of a closed and self-completing carbon cycle in the atmosphere. This organic cycle involves all plants and animals, including ourselves.
In conclusion, the carbon gas emissions of cows are just one point in a giant circle that is the atmospheric carbon cycle. If you plot the other points in the cycle, it forms a giant circle which loops back to the start point. There is no new carbon in the atmosphere as a result of a cow’s existence.
Some relevant equations 
Photosynthesis.
The general equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO2 + 6H2O + Sunlight absorbed = C6H12O6 + 6O2
Note: The C6H12O6 molecule is a carbohydrate molecule – a food ‘sugar’ which can be eaten by an animal and ‘burnt’ to produce energy. When this molecule is ‘burnt’ it produces carbon dioxide (CO2) as a by-product. This is then exhaled to the atmosphere as the same gas as it was prior to the growth of the plant the cow eventually eats.
The Breakdown of methane.
Conversion of methane to carbon dioxide and water is:
CH4 + 2O2 = CO2+ 2H2O + Energy (Heat given off)

https://carbon-sense.com/2019/02/06/unreliable-energy/,,Unreliable Energy,"By Brendan Godwin
The inclusion of unreliable energy sources such as wind and solar (“The Unreliables”) in our supply grids is causing massive fluctuations in electricity dispatch costs from $50-$100/MWh to $14,000/MWh and up to $60,000/MWh in South Australia in the Jan 2019 heat wave (Judith Sloan The Australian Jan 29, 2019) and see the graph below. This ultimately falls on consumer bills. Additionally, the locations for all of these unreliable generation sites are far from current transmission networks and new transmission lines have to be built and footprint cost and capacity factors have to be taken into account. People pushing for “The Unreliables” don’t factor these costs into their costings and neither do government pricing models. Nor do they include all of the subsidies paid to “The Unreliables” plus the state royalties on coal that forced Hazelwood’s closure.


Another major problem is the unreliability of wind and solar which causes these enormous cost fluctuations. On days when the wind doesn’t blow and the Sun doesn’t shine, which happens, the grid needs immediate backup power to cater for demand. Diesel generators and gas are not enough for required backup. In the absence of nuclear power, the only current solution is to have 24 hour coal power plants that cover the full demand, but these cannot be fired up instantly and have to be maintained permanently on ‘hot spinning reserve’. That totally defeats the purpose of having all the ‘The Unreliables’ in the system. This is confirmed in The Australian Energy Regulator’s Wholesale electricity market performance report – (http://catallaxyfiles.com/2019/01/09/the-australian-energy-regulators-wholesale-electricity-market-performance-report/) which states that we need to leave the coal plants running because they can’t be shut down and brought up in an instant. But the ‘must-run’ unreliables are given priority and first preference meaning that we are paying for two power sources just because we have the unreliables in the system. I.e. Unreliables need 100% backup. That’s an additional cost increase that never gets reported or included in any pricing models. Additionally the graph below shows peak demand falling in the lull period for wind and solar.
Coal is still the cheapest source of reliable and continuously available electric power to meet 24/7 x 365 consumer and industrial/infrastructure demand patterns.

Public Policy and Coal fired Power Plants; Isaac Orr and Fred Palmer. The Heartland Institute.https://efis.psc.mo.gov/mpsc/commoncomponents/viewdocument.asp?DocId=936138406http://carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/open-letter-to-dr-alan-finkel.pdf
An additional issue is the cost of blackouts. This is not just a cost to the residential consumer but businesses are forced to shut and workers lose wages and the huge hit to the businesses’ bottom line ultimately feeds through to a drop in tax take by the government. In 2016, South Australia saw a statewide blackout that lasted days. On the 24th and 25th of January 2019, a 40+ degree C heatwave in Victoria saw demand peak way more than supply. On the 24th at 6pm, the Sun wasn’t shining, the wind wasn’t blowing and one third of Melbourne’s suburbs were without power completely for 3 hours. With deception and without notice, authorities dropped the mains voltage to 192V which stopped most appliances from working. This lasted for 30+ hours. On the 25th, the climate alarmists leapt for joy as the wind blew and some wind turbines were able to compensate for one lost coal fired generator, but that still wasn’t enough to prevent 200,000 homes from total blackout. This 30 hour blackout by deception cost Victoria and South Australia an extra $1.1 Bn in energy costs.
These problems are not unique to Australia. A similar graph showing lowest supply timed with highest demand averaged over a year for Minnesota in the US is shown below.

The environmental footprint of wind and solar is something those pushing for “The Unreliables” never talk about. To replace the recently closed Hazelwood coal fired power station with a wind farm would require land area the size of up to 90% of greater metropolitan Melbourne. Even then it would still only produce power when the wind was blowing and its production low point is timed perfectly with peak demand. Wind turbines are also shut down when the wind speeds are too high. This happened when South Australia had a state wide blackout in 2016.
Storage. Batteries don’t work in an electricity grid. They don’t generate power and they can’t power a grid. SA has the biggest battery in the world but it can only power some of Adelaide’s suburbs for about 5 minutes. They are essentially an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). General computer UPSs provide power for 20 to 30 minutes until the power returns. In a major hospital they provide essential power for 30 minutes until either the mains power returns or the emergency diesel generators are fired up. You can’t fire up a gas generator in 5 minutes and it takes 2-3 weeks to fire up a coal generator. That makes batteries totally useless in an electricity grid.
Legislation. The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 is a piece of legislation that needs to be abolished. That legislation makes it a crime to tell the truth about climate science as per the following reference to the criminal proceedings under The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007. In particular Sect. 37, referring to the criminal proceedings of the Act:
37 Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings
Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a pecuniary penalty order has been made against the person.
If a company fails to report their so called greenhouse gas emissions, the directors can be charged with a criminal offence. Telling the truth by saying you are not doing any harm to anything is not a defence. The term ‘greenhouse gas’ is misleading because it does not include water vapor under this legislation. Coal power stations emit far more water vapor than CO2 and that is far more active in absorbing infra red (radiated) heat. The term ‘greenhouse’ is extremely misleading. What happens in a greenhouse is not what happens in the atmosphere. Greenhouses work by blocking convection, not IR. Radiatively Active Gases or RAGs is a much more accurate term. This legislation is founded on lies and telling the truth will still get you convicted of a criminal offence.
Then we have all these Renewable Energy Targets or RETs enshrined into legislation at both state and federal levels forcing electricity generators to use more and more of ‘The Unreliables’.
All of these pieces of legislation provide onerous responsibilities upon electricity producers that comes at a cost to consumers which the politicians ignore.
Wind. The lifespan of generators is not factored into any costings. Wind Turbines are rated at 25 years, half that of coal plants. However in practice, the turbine blades require total replacement after as little as 10 to 12 years and the bearings need constant replacement.
Mass Blade Fail Means Early ‘Retirement’ for Hundreds of Danish Wind Turbines
https://stopthesethings.com/2018/03/30/mass-blade-fail-means-early-retirement-for-hundreds-of-danish-wind-turbines/
Solar. Whilst solar panels can produce electricity for up to 11 hours a day, they produce effective power for about 6 hours per day. When the Sun is on low angles, their power drops off sharply and provides little input to the grid. This means that solar power is only available for one quarter of every day and that’s provided it is not an overcast or rainy day. Also there is very little sun in the southern latitudes during winter. The capacity factor for solar in the USA is between 13% and 19%.
The cost of “The Unreliables”. Businesses are forced to use energy sources that are intermittent and expensive. Businesses can’t compete when forced to run this way and job losses follow as businesses close down and move offshore.
The AEMO dashboard provides a daily demand graph and some useful information.
https://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Data-dashboard
As a by the by, we are much closer to getting nuclear fusion working. This has no CO2 emissions. The loony lefties are even more against nuclear fusion because that is going to fire up industrialisation and the capitalist system. Their sole purpose for this climate change idiot-ology is to de-industrialise the world and kill capitalism.
Summary

“The Unreliables” such as wind and solar have major impacts on an electricity grid. There are a range of cost factors that are ultimately borne by the consumer.
These include:



Massive government subsidies and preferential treatment are required to make “The Unreliables” viable. As the biggest investor in the world, Warren Buffett, said: “We get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That’s the only reason to build them. They don’t make sense without the tax credit.”
Government addition of coal royalties to make coal power unaffordable.
There’s a 14,000% to 60,000% spike in intraday wholesale dispatch prices as the unreliables kick in and out.
The huge cost of blackouts when we have peak demand and the Sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.
The cost to keep coal power stations going permanently but not used because the wind is blowing and the Sun is shining and these “must-run” unreliables have total priority.
The highest demand for power is at the lowest supply from the unreliables. Legislated RETs force more unreliables into the system.

There was the First Atlantic Warm Period about 7750 BC
Second Atlantic Warm Period about 7000 BC
First Saharan Warm period about 5800 BC
Second Saharan Warm Period about 5000 BC
Egyptian Warm period about 3200 BC
Sumerian Warm Period about 2200 BC
Minoan Warm Period about 1200 BC
Roman Warm Period about 0 BC
Mediaeval Warm Period about 1000 AD
Modern Warm Period about 2000 AD

All the warm periods prior to the current one have been warmer (in most cases substantially warmer) than the modern warming that we are having hysterics about.
There have been five significant Little Ice Ages scattered between these warm periods.
If you can explain how man-made carbon dioxide was the temperature driver for these events please go ahead and tell me.
Until you do there are, for me, better explanations, principally the magnetic field of the sun.

Who is KILLING THE DARLING RIVER?
Or
Why has the MDB Plan Failed?
by Ron Pike
As we watch the disturbing daily images of a dry Darling River, parched Menindee Lakes, millions of dead fish, and outback towns without drinkable water, both bush and city are screaming – Why?
 Who is responsible they ask? Name the scapegoats and brand them criminals is demanded.
 Any lesser response would be shameful, but some reactions, while understandable, are not rational.
 Before we look more closely at why and how these unacceptable events have occurred, we need to put to rest some misconceptions about this river and recent claims made by some aboriginal people that the Darling was previously a “Mighty River” that always flowed.
 It wasn’t. After discovery by English explorers Stuart and Hume in 1828, history kept at Menindee tells us it was bone dry there at least 48 times up to 1960 – something that no doubt also happened for hundreds of years before.

 It has only been since the commissioning of several dams on the tributaries of the Darling and the off-river Menindee Lakes storage in 1968 that the river has been kept flowing and successfully supplying fresh water to users along its great length.
That was until recently when the system went from several flood events to the present parched disaster in a very short time.
 The media have been plastered with sensationalist stories accusing “Scapegoats” of water theft, political corruption, calls for closing down Cubbie Station, charging and jailing cotton growers and of course claims of collusion between corporate agriculture and Politicians, even accusing some of them of being responsible for the drought.
 These cries are repeated with ever increasing passion and are garnering sympathy from city cousins, but are mostly incorrect. But while the people are short of water we are awash with political opportunism (laced with hypocrisy) from those who promoted the policies which caused these problems. They now blame others and try to pose as saviours (mostly of their political skin).
 As someone who has been a passionate fisherman of the western rivers, including the Darling for over 70 years, I can attest that the Water Minister’s claim that such fish kills as shown here are “normal” is a lie. Some of the large Murray Cod pictured are 50 plus years old and have survived many droughts. While the exact cause has not been determined I believe it is lack of oxygen caused by nil flow and the growth of blue-green algae also due to nil flow. Claims by the Minister and his Department that fish kills elsewhere are widespread are more beat up than fact.
 So if the scapegoats listed above are not responsible for this unacceptable situation then what is?

Management of the system changed markedly when the Turnbull-inspired Murray-Darling Basin Plan was introduced in details that most don’t appreciate.
 The first was that ownership of volumetric licenses to irrigate was removed from land that could be irrigated. These licenses were then available for purchase by green bureaucracies, speculators and investors. Irresponsibly these licenses could then be bought and moved from one valley to another.
 Secondly, the NSW Government exacted from irrigators 15% of their licensed volumes and vested this water with the Department of Heritage and Environment. Other Government agencies and indigenous groups were also allocated water.
 The result has been that our stored water previously prudently kept to keep our rivers running and supplying basic needs in dry times has been squandered to the sea under the guise of Environmental flows, translucent flows, heritage flows, and indigenous water.
 The prime example is the twice near-draining of Menindee Lakes for the dishonest purpose of flushing the lower Murray. This was flagrant waste of water. It is the reason Broken Hill ran out of water and is now reliant on a $500 million pipeline from the Murray.
 The call for more intense monitoring and extra staff is not necessary as monitoring staff have for years outnumbered end users by a large factor. All that is necessary is that they do their job properly. Why can’t the minister manage this?
 The problems caused by over regulation of our river system, presently vividly apparent on the Darling are in fact spreading south and if not addressed will likely see the whole Basin out of water by this time next year.
 Not only is the Darling being killed, our food bowl and regional communities are bleeding to death because of the counterproductive MDB Plan.
 While Politicians and Governments lack the humility to recognise that the present situation is caused by their legislated, overlapping bureaucratic regulatory mess that is delivering bad outcomes, then Henry Lawson’s prediction rings loud:
“And the land grows old and the people never
Will see the worth of the Darling River.”
Ron Pike.
About Ron Pike:
It was on the dry plains of the Riverina that Ron’s Grand-Parents settled in the early 1900’s and some of Ron’s earliest memories are of fishing on the Murrumbidgee and gaining knowledge around a campfire listening to a Grandfather telling how settlers had transformed what explorers, Stuart and Cunningham described as, “a dry treeless plains unsuitable for human habituation,”into productive land capable of feeding a growing Nation.
Ron grew up on his Dad’s rice farm at Murrami and his earliest memories are of learning how to fish the western rivers and of propagating trees and understanding the need to improve the landscape from a Dad who deeply understood and appreciated every aspect of the land of which he was caretaker. Today he would be called an environmentalist; a word Ron does not remember being used back then.
Ron’s knowledge and understanding of the rivers of the MDB is the result of a lifetime spent on these streams, fishing, boating and using the waters for irrigated agriculture. Maintenance of a healthy ecology on these streams, taught by his Father, is central to everything that Ron advocates.
Ron was one of the first farmers to take up land at Coleambally Irrigation Area and in 1961 was officially the first farmer to use water from the Snowy Scheme when water was turned onto Farm 1 Coleambally.
With the increasing volumes of water then available, Ron began developing irrigated agricultural land on what were grazing properties along the Murrumbidgee Valley and the Yanco Creek. It was work he continued until he retired. All of Ron’s developments included man-made wetlands as part of the irrigation system.
Ron has always been actively involved in political policy development.
His lifetime aim is to see Australia drought proofed with abundant water and power for all for the foreseeable future.
Now recognised as an expert on water and dams, particularly the Murray Darling Basin Rivers, Ron has provided expert advice on water conservation, dams and irrigation to several Government enquires and continues to do so.
“The food we eat the water we drink and the power we use for most of our endeavours, are available only because previous generations invested their know-how and money for the future.
It is time this generation did the same.”

Carbon dioxide must be an almighty gas – it gets blamed for almost every human disaster.
Now we have the alarmist Climate Council blaming bushfires on carbon dioxide and global warming. Focussing on the wrong problem is doing more harm than good. It is disappointing to see respected firefighters like Greg Mullins now blaming “climate change” for more and worse bushfires, and now even promoting the misguided Climate Council.
We have heat waves, dry spells and bushfires in Australia every year – bushfires were burning all up the coast when Captain Cook sailed by in 1770. But today we know what causes dangerous fires. It needs deliberate political mismanagement to create disastrous wild-fires which destroy everything – houses, sheds, fences, wildlife and mature trees.
A good wet season can result in nature building up a dangerously large fuel load. In the past this was usually removed safely by many small fires lit by lightning strikes, aboriginals, graziers or foresters. Today massive fuels loads are too often allowed to accumulate for more than one season in forests, reserves, parks and around suburbs. Then one match or spark on a windy day can produce massive fires.
Image acknowledgement: www.pixabay.com
Today’s stupid green policies that discourage and prohibit burning-off, encourage the accumulation of bushfire fuel and exclude grazing animals from large areas of parks and reserves are making uncontrollable wildfires more common.
Heat does not cause catastrophic fires. Once sparked, naturally or maliciously, two things are needed to create killer blazes – high winds and excessive flammable fuel. We cannot stop the wind, but we can manage the bush so as to minimise the build-up of bushfire fuels. Not only is this effective in reducing the bushfire threat – the benefit is immediate. There is no need to wait another 25 years for the “solutions” posed by the climatists to “fix” the climate (stop using coal, cattle and cars etc).
Blaming the bushfire problem on climate change is offering a weak excuse for government authorities bowing to green extremists. They have failed to meet their obligation to reduce bushfire fuel loads and make life safer for communities and for our firefighters.
As for more and bigger water bombers, we need only to look to the 2018 Californian bushfires, where great fleets of mighty water bombers were unable to control their wildfires. Water bombers may look good on television but they cannot stop wildfires burning in heavy fuel and driven by high winds.

By Dr G M Derrick
Executive Summary
Notwithstanding a data gap from 1791 to 1859, there appears to have been little or no change in the trends of monthly maximum and minimum temperatures for a period of 230 years, from 1788 to 2018, based on comparisons of two data sets—one recorded by First Fleet officer William Dawes, and one from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).Gergis et al 2009, authors of a major study and compilation of the data, conclude that “Remarkably, the records appear comparable with modern day measurements taken from Sydney Observatory Hill, displaying similar daily variability, a distinct seasonal cycle and considerable inter-annual variability.”
This runs counter to the climate alarmism normally published by these authors.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/09/24/real-genius/,,Australian Politicians again show “Real Genius”,"Back in the chaotic dying days of the Whitlam-Cairns-Connor government, Canberra was buzzing with Rex Connor’s grand plans for nationalisation of the mining industry, a national energy grid and gas pipelines linking the NW Shelf to the capital cities, all to be funded by massive foreign loans arranged by a mysterious Pakistani named Khemlani. Malcolm Frazer staged a parliamentary revolt. The economy slumped.
A British observer at that time was asked who was the greater Prime Minister – Harold Wilson or Gough Whitlam. He replied:
“Any fool can bugger up Britain but it takes real genius to bugger up Australia.”
Australian politicians are again showing real genius.
Now, we have incredible tri-partisan plans to cover the continent with a spider-web of transmission lines connecting wind/solar “farms” sending piddling amounts of intermittent power to distant consumers and to expensive battery and hydro backups – all funded by electricity consumers, tax-assisted speculators and foreign debt.
We are the world’s biggest coal exporter but have not built a big coal-fired power station for 11 years. We have massive deposits of uranium but 100% of this energy is either exported, or sterilised by the Giant Rainbow Serpent, or blocked by the Green-anti’s.
Australia suffers recurrent droughts but has not built a major water supply dam for about 40 years, and the average age of our hydro-electric plants is 48 years. And when the floods do come, desperate farmers watch as years of rain water rush past to irrigate distant oceans.
Once, Australia was a world leader in exploration and drilling – it is now a world leader in legalism, red tape and environmental obstructionism.
Once, Canberra and the states encouraged oil and gas exploration with geological mapping and research – now they restrict land and sea access and limit exports.
Once, Australia was a world leader in refining metals and petroleum – now our expensive unreliable electricity and green tape are driving these industries and their jobs overseas.
Once, Australia’s CSIRO was respected for research that supported industry and for doing useful things like controlling rabbits and prickly pear and developing better crops and pastures. Now CSIRO panders to global warming hysteria and promotes the fairy story that carbon taxes and emissions targets can change the world’s climate.
Once, young Australians excelled in maths, science and engineering. Now, they are brain-washed in gender studies, green energy non-science and environmental activism.
Once, Australians were proud of our history, our ancestors and our achievements – now we are supposed to feel guilty and apologise.
Once, Australia had a big coastal fleet carrying passengers and goods and catching fish. Now our roads are clogged with cars and freight and we import seafood.
Once, the opening of a railway or the discovery of oil, coal, nickel or uranium made headlines. Today’s Aussies harass explorers and developers, and queue at the release of the latest IPad.
As Australia’s first people discovered, if today’s Australians lack the will or the knowledge to use our great natural resources, more energetic people will take them off us.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/09/19/the-per-capita-emissions-cross/,,How to Crucify Australia on the “Per Capita Emissions” Cross,"By Graham Williamson
According to Australian Climate Commissioners Tim Flannery, Roger Beale, and Gerry Hueston, in their recent report ‘The Critical Decade: International Action on Climate Change’, the reason why Australians are disproportionately to blame for global climate change is because of so called per capita emissions. According to the Climate Commissioners, (21) “the average Australian produces emissions almost five times that of the average Chinese person and 16 times that of the average person from India.” 
This was confirmed by Climate Change Minister Greg Combet:
“The fact is that Australia has the highest per capita emissions of all developed countries, about 27 tonnes per person. This compares to a world average of about 6 tonnes per person, and an average of about 14 tonnes per person in other developed countries. Developing countries consistently point to Australia’s high per capita emissions to justify why we should take strong action on climate change.”

FACT: CSIRO Endorses Fictitious Per Capita Concept
According to CSIRO in Chapter 9 of Climate Change: Science and Solutions for Australia, Australia’s mitigation strategy or CO2 tax policy is based upon the totally unscientific, discriminatory, and fictitious concept of per capita emissions:
“The position of Australia relative to other countries in terms of emissions per person is shown in Figure 9.1 and in terms of energy sources in Table 9.1. This is the starting point for changes in mitigation strategies for Australia compared with the rest of the world.”
And Australia is still reported to be among the world’s highest per capita emitters.
Given the fact that Australia’s mitigation strategy, according to CSIRO, is based upon per capita emissions as distinct from national emissions, it is astonishing that in a recent report CSIRO scientist Dr Pep Canadell has emphasised that it is the national emissions that are important:
“Mitigation requires energy transition led by the largest emitters of China, the US, the European Union and India”.
Dr Pep Canadell seems unaware that according to Australia’s Climate Commissioners, our high per capita emissions are causing climate change around the world. Even if we halved our national emissions to 0.75% of global emissions, our per capita emissions would still be much too high!
FACT: Climate Change Strategy Based Upon Science Fiction, NOT Science
CSIRO has been completely unable to supply any scientific evidence whatsoever to substantiate the effectiveness of a per capita approach to control global climate. Why, it must be asked, has the government chosen to base its whole climate change strategy on an unscientific fictitious concept?
The totally fictitious and meaningless nature of average per capita emissions is perfectly clear ………
If an (undefined) average Indian person, who allegedly produces only 1/16th the emissions of the (undefined) average Australian, moves to Australia but adopts exactly the same life style in Australia as he/she did in India, then automatically he or she will suddenly be producing sixteen times more emissions!!
But it seems the scientists have also explained why this is so.  Australia’s high per capita emissions are due to our low population combined with relatively high transport and industrial emissions, especially from aluminium and metal production (22, 23). In fact, according to the government’s Fifth National Communication on Climate Change, our high per capita emissions are caused by “the dominance of resource-based industries in our economy and its reliance on low-cost fossil fuels.” Therefore, when our typical low emission Indian citizen moves to Australia, irrespective of his lifestyle, he will become just as responsible for the emissions from Aluminium smelters as are other Aussies!

But wait, it also depends upon what state of Australia our typical Indian citizen moves to! If he moves to Queensland he will produce more than double the emissions of those he would produce if he crossed the border into NSW (Ben Cubby, Greenhouse gas emissions still on the rise, data shows)!
So although the world has been cooling, and although there is no evidence humans are causing this cooling, what we do know is that Australians, or more specifically, Queenslanders, are mostly to blame. More guilty than anyone in the world in fact.
This we are asked to believe, is genuine climate science, endorsed by the Commonwealth government, the Climate Commissioners, and the CSIRO!
Clearly, the practice of targeting people for per capita emissions as a mitigation strategy is unjust, unethical, highly discriminatory, and is based upon a lie. The concept of per capita emissions is nothing more than a political stunt where both scientists and the people are exploited for political purposes. It is astonishing that so many politicians, academics, journalists, and scientists continue to promote the scientific fraud of average per capita emissions mitigation strategies.

‘Evidence’ Shows Australians are Causing Climate Change Around the World
But while the Commonwealth Government’s Climate Commissioners point out that (21) “Australia has the highest emissions per person of any developed country” and “the average Australian produces emissions almost five times that of the average Chinese person and 16 times that of the average person from India,”  they also claim: “Emissions generated in one country will contribute to the impacts of climate change in all countries”. So according to Australian experts, Australians are to blame for climate change in cities and countries around the world.
But if we are so guilty of changing global climate wouldn’t we effect our own country first rather than countries thousands of miles away? Or do our emissions only impact distant non-capitalist countries and dictatorships who want our climate change compensation payments? And shouldn’t the NSW government be taking legal action against all Queenslanders because of their high per capita emissions (24) which must surely be impacting the NSW climate?

September 2018
Controlling Climate and Global Wealth Redistribution – a costly agenda indeed!
2015 was a very big year for the global problem solvers at the UN. In September Australia’s former Foreign minister, Julie Bishop, signed the 2030  Sustainable Development Goals agenda, and in December the UN conducted the Paris climate change conference, which was later signed by Australia’s Environment Minister, Greg Hunt. Earlier, in July the same year, Australia participated in the  Addis Ababa Action Agenda to discuss ways of financing the UN’s exceedingly costly agenda.
The first part of this agenda, namely, controlling the climate, is extremely costly in itself, and the folks at the UN tell us they need much more of our money to turn down the heat. But they also need more of our money to  pay the ‘climate debt’ to compensate socialist and theocratic countries, which seem to be selectively targeted by our ‘damaging’ CO2 emissions, or so the story goes.
However, the really big dollars are needed to implement Julie Bishop’s  2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. For this agenda the UN needs a further  $6 trillion annually so we can all be compelled to manage our properties and lifestyles correctly and meet the UN’s ‘sustainability’ requirements. And under  SDG 4.7 the UN seeks to teach our children, through global citizenship education, that only the UN can ‘solve’ problems which the UN defines as ‘global’ problems. So called ‘climate change’ is ‘global problem’  SDG 13. The $6 trillion figure is expected to blow out considerably as fixing the climate and ensuring the sustainability of the earth, and educating children to believe all this, is a costly business indeed. No wonder virtually  all government departments are devoted to helping the UN.
United Nations Announces 2030 Agenda and Climate Change Agreement are Part of Their Global Wealth Redistribution Agenda or ‘New World Order’ (NIEO)
 On 20thJuly 2016 the UN reported that the three 2015 global agreements,  the 2030 SDG agenda, the Paris climate change conference, and the  Addis Ababa Action agenda, are all part of (see A/71/168) their long term new world order agenda, as initiated by the 1974 Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order (NIEO) (see A/RES/S-6/3201). According to the Report of the Secretary General of the United Nations in July 2016, the 2030 Agenda and the Paris climate agreement are intended to address “inequities in the international system” in line with the requirements of the NIEO.
Moving Ahead in 2018 and Controlling Borders, Migration, and the Media – our politicians helping the UN with their global goals
 Under SDG 10.7, the UN’s  Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was born, and accepted by deposed Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. For the moment at least, it has been rejected by Peter Dutton. It was finalised in July 2018, and will be adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, on 10-11 December 2018 and will be followed by the UNs proposed “2035 agenda for facilitating human mobility.” In the  Migration Compact the folks at the UN are asking our politicians to transfer even more power to them to enable them to generously control our borders for us, and  even control our media. No use wasting money ‘educating’ our children after all, if the media are still telling the truth! And of course, the Global Compact will also seek ‘solutions’ for those displaced from their country because of ‘climate change’.
Julie Bishop’s 2030 Agenda and Malcolm Turnbull’s ‘Environment Pact‘ to Lead to Irreversible UN Controlled Global Law
Most recently the Turnbull government voted to continue to surrender Australian environmental laws to the UN with the  Global Pact for the Environment, which, together with the 2030 Agenda signed by former foreign Minister Bishop, are said to constitute the  pillars of global environmental governance:
“The Global Pact for Environment seeks to create a legal text that, together with the Sustainable Development Objectives adopted at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2015, represents the pillars of global environmental governance… … .In order that this pact becomes reality, it is necessary to fight against climate and environmental insecurity, to cooperate in achieving world environmental law”
 The Global Pact for the Environment is intended to “codify the principles enshrined in the Rio Declaration” and create a “legally binding international instrument under the United Nations… ..to solidify the environmental rule of law around the world and to achieve the  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”
Trouble is,  Article 17 of the Pact introduces the principle of ‘non-regression’, henceforth making it illegal to make any changes which would reduce environmental protections. This includes climate change legislation which would be locked in. And our politicians support this, although the details are still being negotiated and  will be finalised next year.
To the UN they may well be ‘pillars of global environmental governance’. But if our elected representatives in Australia are unanimous about anything, it is the ‘need’ to avoid making this an election issue, and prevent the people from having any democratic vote on these pillars.

Dr. Howard Hayden is Professor Emeritus of Physics, University of Connecticut. He is the editor of “The Energy Advocate” a pro-energy, pro-science, and pro-technology newsletter. www.energyadvocate.com
We have about a dozen pumped-hydro plants in the US. In some places (that’s why they’re not abundant) it is economically feasible to store energy by pumping water uphill to a higher reservoir, and then release it when demand is high.
Hydro has the advantage of being a system that can turn on or off in a hurry. Typically, a dam has a lot of independent water turbines. So you can turn on (say) 50 MW, 100 MW, and so on.
Greenies look at storage systems as their salvation. (Indeed, solar and wind are nearly worthless without back-up.) What they fail to realize is that back-up is far better used with conventional power.
If a back-up system (of whatever type you care to mention) is used with wind or solar, it has to have enough storage to last for days — possibly even weeks — to keep the grid from going down.
Now look what happens in you increase conventional baseload power (the cheapest, most reliable) beyond the actual baseload demand. During times of low demand, you store the excess energy, and then release it during times of high demand. The upshot is that you need to store only something like 20% of one day’s energy rather than 100% energy for many days. (Even a greenie ought to be able to see that 3 or 4 or 5 or … is greater than 0.2.

As to the Australian Snowy 2.0 project, I have no idea whether it makes any sense or not. But if it does, it makes far more sense for conventional power than wind and solar.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/09/01/snowy-elephant/,,The Green Elephant in the Snowy Mountains,"Canberra breeds many white elephants, but now they are breeding a gigantic new breed of pachyderm in Australia’s Snowy Mountains – a Green Elephant. Grandly named “Snowy 2.0 Hydro-Electric”, it has the compulsory green skin, but it is just another big white elephant under a thick layer of green paint.
Snowy 2.0 plans a hugely expensive complex of dams, tunnels, pumps, pipes, generators, roads and powerlines. Water will be pumped up-hill using grid power in times of low demand, and then released when needed to recover some of that energy. To call it “hydro-electric” is a fraud – it will not store one extra litre of water and will be a net consumer of electric power. It is a giant electric storage battery to be recharged using grid power.


This is just the next episode in an expensive and impossible green dream to run Australian cities and industries, plus a growing electric vehicle fleet, on intermittent wind and solar energy and without coal, gas, oil or nuclear fuels.
Surely we can learn from the unfolding disaster of a similar German Grand Plan:

The first stage of Australia’s green dream was to demonise coal and nuclear power, set onerous green energy and CO2 emissions targets, subsidise and mandate the use of intermittent energy from wind and solar, and give electric cars financial and other privileges. All of this costs Australian electricity users and tax payers at least $5 billion per year. This destructive force-feeding of solar and wind power is well advanced.
Solar energy peaks around mid-day, falls to zero from dusk to dawn and is much reduced by clouds, dust and smoke. Over a year it may produce about 16% of name-plate capacity. Thus a solar-battery system would need installed solar capacity of six times the demand. These solar “farms” are very land-hungry per unit of usable energy, often sterilising large areas of agricultural land.
Wind energy is much more erratic – it can produce about 35% of peak capacity but often produces peak power during the night when there is low demand. It may produce zero power for several days. A sudden high wind can send wind power surging onto the grid, and it falls to zero as the wind dies. Wind power driving a wind-battery system would need installed wind capacity of triple the expected demand, but even that may not cope with a long windless spell. There can be days with zero production from either wind or solar, and neither can increase output to meet demand which often peaks around dinner time and breakfast time when green power is scarce. Wind “farms” are a blight on the landscape and are often built in scenic areas where farming and forestry are prohibited.
The price of electricity fluctuates wildly as these floods and droughts of intermittent green energy surge into the grid. This creates instability, increases the chance of blackouts and destroys the viability of reliable coal-fired generators which are unable to ramp up fast enough to profit from soaring power prices during green energy droughts and are forced to keep running while accepting close-to-zero prices during the green deluges. To speed up this destruction of reliable energy, politicians are still using subsidies and targets to encourage more green energy to be dumped randomly onto the grid.
For a short very clear video on the cost and reliability problems caused by wind power in Minnesota see:
https://youtu.be/0vaIYttrL88
Warren Buffett puts it bluntly:
“We get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms.
That’s the only reason to build them.
They don’t make sense without the tax credit.”
The solution to green energy disruption is simple. Do not allow any new spasmodic generators like wind and solar to connect direct to the grid. They must construct or contract for battery or other backup to moderate their fluctuations and increase reliability and predictability. Existing wind-solar farms already connected to the grid should lose all subsidies and be paid what their second class product is worth at the time it floods onto the grid.
Backing up and taming green energy is simple in principle – it can be done using lithium batteries like the Musk monster in South Australia, or giant pumped-hydro schemes like Snowy 2.0. Or conventional reliable generators like hydro, gas, oil, coal or nuclear can be operated intermittently to fill green energy gaps.
Other ways to store and release energy would also work in principle – hydrogen generation, molten salt, compressed air or giant flywheels – all look smart when sketched on the doodle pads of green politicians and then modelled on academic computers. But they become progressively more complicated and expensive as they progress to engineering design, costing, construction, operation and maintenance. Reality will reappear when the bills start hitting consumers and tax payers, but by then it is too late to recover all those wasted resources.
To make things worse for consumers and industry, widely scattered green energy installations usually need new roads for construction and maintenance and new transmission lines to transport their unreliable product to where it can be used (some 30 new transmission lines are currently planned in Australia alone to connect green energy facilities, and more will be needed.) Those who profit from this green infrastructure get guaranteed returns based on capital, maintenance and operating costs, not on the value of its contribution to consumers, and as usual consumers and taxpayers pay the bills.
Industry and households are now waking up to the costs and blackout risks facing them as more coal-fired generators are forced to close as evermore intermittent generators de-stabilise the grid and cause wild price swings. But politicians have yet another plan to paper over the growing supply problems from un-reliables as they try to meet the self-imposed emissions targets.
Recently the Turnbull Federal Government committed over $7 billion in studies and purchase price to buy the existing Hydro-electric complex in the Snowy Mountains from state governments. This valuable project conserves water which is used for irrigation and electricity generation. However they plan to burden this useful profitable project with another green dream – a Giant Battery.
Snowy 2.0 will consume electricity mainly from distant generators in the Hunter and Latrobe Valleys to pump water from lower dams to upper dams, and then recover part of this energy by releasing the stored water back downhill to drive turbines. The electricity recovered will be sent mainly to the big but distant demand centres of Sydney and Melbourne thus incurring more transmission losses. All of these unavoidable losses mean that Snowy 2.0 will only recover about 60% of the energy it takes from the grid. (This low recovery is one reason that existing pumped hydro facilities like Tumut 3 in the Snowy and Wivenhoe in Queensland are seldom used).
The system also imprisons Snowy water which could be used to generate new power and then flow into Snowy irrigation schemes. This Canberra-bred green elephant aims to profit from fluctuating wind-solar supply and prices, but it will make things worse for electricity consumers in the long run by helping to destroy low-cost, reliable base-load energy from coal.
Electricity supply will then become a lottery – every time the wind drops, the panels are shaded and the Giant Battery is flat, the lights will go out. South Australia has shown us how easy this is.
If there is also a long drought affecting hydro-electric supply in the Snowy and Tasmania, base load electricity supply will rely on a few geriatric coal generators. If a major transmission line is then damaged or fails, we will all need all the diesels in the shed. Tasmania has provided a lesson for us all – they had a hydro drought and then a broken transmission cable and were forced to hurriedly purchase 200MW of diesel engines at a cost of $64M to keep their lights on.
In the coming brave new electric world, compulsory smart meters will decide which suburbs, homes, heaters, coolers, pumps, dairies, draglines or factories are switched off when power supply fails to meet demand.
Snowy 2.0 will be the biggest and most expensive storage battery in Australia with some 2,700 times the capacity of South Australia’s lithium Green Elephant. It will probably require upgrading of the transmissions lines to the big demand centres of Sydney and Melbourne and to the remaining real power stations which will supply most of the electricity to run its pumps.
All of this is supposedly being constructed to help Australia meet its costly but self-imposed emissions target. However there will probably be an increase in emissions if this Green Elephant is created. The project will require a huge amount of concrete, steel, copper, diesel and electricity to manufacture, transport and install the pipes, pumps, generators, roads and transmission lines and to bore 27 km of new tunnels. Pumping all that water up-hill regularly and repairing and maintaining the system in the coldest place in Australia will not be cheap in dollars, energy or emissions. Careful accounting of all long term effects will probably show no emissions savings whatsoever.
Snowy 2.0 is being constructed to moderate the fluctuations in green energy production and to kill coal power faster. It will do this. But will not be able to guarantee electricity supply with any certainty – if we have a week of windless cloudy weather, and there is not enough coal or gas power, the demand for electricity will quickly drain the Snowy 2.0 reservoirs. Then where does the power come from to pump the Snowy water back up the hill and keep the lights on? SA’s giant lithium battery may keep Adelaide powered for a few minutes, but what about Townsville, Toowoomba and Tamworth?
However, if politicians are determined to build Snowy 2-0, it could be put to much better use than pumping water uphill to run down again. Our electricity would be more secure and cheaper if we ceased all force-feeding of wind-solar un-reliables, used coal, gas or nuclear power running continuously at capacity to supply the stable “base load” of electricity demand, and used schemes like Snowy 2.0 to cover peak load fluctuations above this base load. This would create a stable grid providing reliable low-cost power (so it has little chance of happening with green gremlins in charge of energy.)
Jo Nova illustrates below what base load is:

Source: http://joannenova.com.au/2017/10/abc-lets-pretend-base-load-power-doesnt-exist-call-it-a-dinosaur-whos-in-denial/
All of this is motivated by the carbon dioxide/global warming scare. This is a planned distraction and that story is wearing thin. But the green energy mess is undeniable – the Snowy 2.0 proposal is proof that some politicians can at last see the increasing dangers of grid instability.
Australia is a land of droughts, and large areas can be affected by seasonal or longer droughts in water, wind or solar energy. We may get regular rain, steady winds and bright sunshine for long periods over large areas, but that is not the best way to place our bets.
The graph below shows how more green energy, produces higher electricity costs.

Source: Fred Rumak: www.friendsofscience.org
There is no longer a cost-free, risk-free energy option for Australia but the risks and costs will rise for each day’s delay. About 40% of Australia’s coal and gas plants are likely to close by 2030, but that will not make the sun shine at night or keep the wind blowing steadily or keep the dams full.
We need to withdraw from all Paris/Kyoto Treaty obligations, abolish NEG, RET and all subsidies, mandates and tax breaks given to wind and solar power. No new wind or solar farms should be connected directly to the grid until they have established sufficient battery storage to produce a guaranteed supply.  Finally all political obstacles to reliable power such as coal, gas or nuclear must be removed.
And if we have spare mega-billions to speculate on Snowy Green Elephants we should first investigate whether there are better plans for water, wind and electricity, such as:

Find sites on either side of the Great Dividing Range that can catch and hold lots of runoff water.
Use the water first for electricity generation, then for irrigation.
Find a way to send that water to the western side of the Great Dividing Range. That could be done using gravity via tunnels or pipes or using electric pumps, wind pumps or syphon-assisted electric pumping (which avoids needing expensive tunnels).
Use the water for irrigation and agriculture in the dry inland. Failing that, use it for towns and irrigation on the more populated eastern side.

Romans, Incas and others could build aqueducts 400-700 km long without jack hammers, diesel engines, boring machines, dozers, draglines and concrete. We can build big dams and long traffic tunnels. Surely we can capture water along our well-watered and often-flooded east-coast, get it over or through the mountains, and then generate electricity as that water is released to drought-proof land west of the divide.
Our grandparents’ generation built an electricity system that was the envy of the world – black coal in Qld and NSW, brown coal in Victoria and SA, plus hydro in Tasmania and the Snowy. It was efficient, resilient and decentralised, and it gave industry and consumers reliable low-cost power.
This generation breeds Green Elephants.

In March 2017, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy published a brochure announcing that the Energiewende, its renewable energy revolution, was ‘a success story’.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The Energiewende (Grand Plan) has the goal of making Germany independent of fossil fuels in the long term. Coal, oil and gas were to be phased out, allowing drastic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. However, these goals have not even begun to be achieved.
The Energiewende was only driven forward in the electricity sector, which, accounts for only one-fifth of energy consumption. There were hardly any successes in the heating/cooling and transport sectors.
And so carbon dioxide emissions in Germany have been rising since 2009, even though well over a hundred billion euros have been spent on the expansion of solar and wind energy over the same period. The financial obligations undertaken in the process will continue to burden taxpayers for another two decades and will end up costing German consumers a total sum of around 550 billion euros.
Despite this enormous effort, security of supply is increasingly under threat. At the same time, people and the biosphere are suffering; wildlife protection has become subordinated to climate mitigation, even though the possibility of achieving the goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions is becoming increasingly distant and the measures for the energy transition seem to become more and more questionable from a constitutional point of view.
800 regional associations in Germany commissioned a report on the achievements of the Grand Plan, supported by 24 German experts in all relevant fields.
“In this review we would like to inform a public debate and set out a reasonable course for energy policy in Germany.”
It details stark lessons for Australia. They have produced a very clear readable summary of all aspects of the German electricity disaster.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/08/20/reliable-infrastructure-before-green-grandstanding/,,Reliable Infrastructure before Green Grandstanding,"Two messages for Canberra:
Firstly, Australia does not have a problem with too much carbon dioxide going to the sky – we have a problem storing enough of the water coming from the sky.
Secondly, Australia does not have a shortage of wind and solar “farms” – we have a shortage of water, stock feed and low-cost electricity on real farms.
Politicians fritter our money on dubious “research”, climate propaganda, foreign adventures and handouts for trendy, vote-seeking green causes. But they have not built a serious water supply dam since the 1980’s, and the last big coal-fired power station was opened 11 years ago. For a country with a growing population, abundant supplies of coal and uranium, and a history of severe droughts, these are serious omissions.
The Snowy Mountain Scheme (opened nearly 50 years ago) was a visionary project that produced large volumes of low-cost water for irrigation plus reliable hydro-power for industry.
The new Snowy 2.0 Scheme is a fraud – it will produce no extra water and will be a net consumer of power. Its sole purpose is to try to plug the holes and fluctuations in electricity supply caused by a bi-partisan love affair with expensive green energy toys producing unreliable, intermittent electricity.
Cease this baseless war on carbon fuels. Carbon dioxide does not drive global warming – it is driven out of sea water by ocean warming.
Australia should cancel Snowy 2.0, withdraw from all Paris and Kyoto Climate Treaty obligations, dump the NEG “plans”, remove all green energy subsidies and start building some real power stations and real water supply dams and pipelines.
No matter what the weather does, we will need more cheap, reliable water and electricity.

The swamp conceals the rubble of demolished coal generators; another plant destined for destruction (Liddell) is gradually sinking into the green ooze.
The swamp is slowly claiming paddocks of subsidised solar panels that, at best, only work for six hours per sunny day. The scene is uglified by spec-built regiments of ailing wind turbines that are often idle, but sometimes whirling madly. To distract the gullible media from this mess, big diesel generators charge a gigantic battery which pumps water uphill and then lets it run down again. A garbage dump of dead lithium batteries fills a nearby gully and the swamp is fenced by locked green gates.
The stagnant water is stirred on sunny days by luxury launches carrying academics-with-models, green media evangelists, climate alarmists, emissions inspectors and power regulators. Speculative sharks constantly patrol the swamp snapping up every smelly subsidy morsel scattered by politicians in posh yachts fishing for votes.


Helicopters full of unelected UN officials hover overhead, creating choppy waves of uncertainty. A pleasant hill overlooking the swamp houses the air-conditioned offices of the power regulators. They have no windows to the world and few power engineers; they stare at screens, run models and press buttons.
The way out of the energy swamp is to retrace the way we got in.
First, get to the root of the problem – UN Climate Alarmism. Disown the Paris and Kyoto Treaties and dump all the obligations, costs, hobbles and distortions they have created. Stop their pointless war on carbon energy. Carbon dioxide does not control climate but it does support all life on earth.
Abolish green energy targets and renewable energy certificates – they belong in museums beside the WW2 ration cards.
Then de-fund and boycott the rotten core of climate alarmism – the UNIPCC. Shun their never-ending climate conferences and cease funding all of their green tentacles. Cancel the tax exempt status of political activists posing as honest scientists.
Then unravel the electricity regulations mess. Stop politicians from banning or promoting their energy favourites – speculators should be permitted to build wind, solar, geothermal, wave, coal, gas, nuclear or pig-poo power generators free of all special taxes, subsidies and market mandates. But no electricity distributer, retailer or consumer should be forced to accept unreliable or expensive electricity.
Then abolish all guaranteed returns on inflated capital for those who gold-plate power lines and poles, or expect big returns on under-used connections to remote wind farms or other green energy toys. Consumers should not be saddled with these hidden green taxes.
All electricity producers and retailers should face competitive market prices, get no special subsidies and obey the same tax laws. But they should be encouraged to enter into long term contracts to supply base-load or peak power at agreed prices. Such contracts could underpin construction of new reliable generation capacity.
De-centralise decision making. Politicians should stop backing losers. Test energy theories properly by letting green states go deep green on intermittent energy (and pay for gas to fill the gaps), while others place their bets on long-term contracts from efficient modern coal generators running on solid reliable “fossil sunshine”. Allow isolated communities to try sealed transportable nuclear power packs.
The choice for our crippled electricity industry is stark – swift surgical reform and practical innovation; or let the lights go out as our once-cheap-and-reliable grid drowns in the smelly regulatory swamp.

By Viv Forbes, 17 July 2018

The climate alarm media, the bureaucracy and the Green Energy industry follow an agenda which is served by inflating any short-term weather event into a climate calamity. They should take a long-term view.
Earth’s climate is never still – it is always changing, with long-term trends, medium-term reversals and minor oscillations. Humanity is best served by those who use good science to study geology, astronomy and climate history searching for clues to climate drivers and the underlying natural cycles and trends hidden in short-term weather fluctuations.
For the last 10,000 years Earth has basked in the Holocene Interglacial which is the latest of many warm cycles within the Pleistocene Ice Age. There are small warm and cool cycles within the Holocene. Today we enjoy the Modern Warm Cycle (which started about calendar 1900) following the Little Ice Age which bottomed in about 1750.
What does the future hold? The past gives clues to the future.

In every warm era, glaciers retreat, ice sheets melt and sea levels rise. Coastal land, ports and settlements are lost under the rising seas but tundra, grasslands and forests expand. Some corals manage to grow as fast as the seas rise, but others are drowned in deep water. The warmth drives more carbon dioxide from the seas, plants thrive, deserts shrink and humans are well fed.
Then solar intensity wanes, solar orbits change, less solar energy is received by the big northern lands, and the warm Earth radiates more heat to space. It starts cooling.
As Earth enters a cold era, not all of the winter snow melts over summer. The extra snow reflects more solar radiation, leading to even colder winters. The snow-line and the tree-line fluctuate lower, mountain passes are closed, and advancing glaciers threaten mountain villages. Sea ice expands, ice sheets grow, lakes and rivers are frozen, sea levels drop and coral reefs are stranded above the water line. The cooling seas absorb life-giving carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and crops fail; deserts expand, humans suffer poverty and famine, settlements are abandoned, armies march, empires fall and some species disappear.
This has happened many times before and will probably happen again.
But there are clues to the next big phase for Earth’s climate.
Earth has two natural global thermometers which can reveal short and long term trends – the advance and retreat of glaciers, and the rise and fall of sea level.
If glaciers are growing and ice sheets are advancing and getting thicker, it indicates that average global temperature is falling.
Glaciologists have drilled and analysed many of today’s glaciers. They have been surprised to discover that, outside of Antarctica and Greenland, no glacial ice older than 4,000 years has been found. For example, the Fremont Glacier in Wyoming half-way towards the Equator is only a few hundred years old.
Naturally some of these new glaciers can show melting and retreat during long spells of warm weather, but the mere existence of glaciers today where none existed at the peak of the Holocene warming over 3,000 years ago confirms what other studies show – Earth is gradually cooling towards the next Glacial Cycle.
Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) – Temperature Reconstruction – “Falling for 3000 Years” From “The Inconvenient Skeptic” p 115 by John Kehr 2011, http://theinconvenientskeptic.com/
The second natural thermometer is the changing sea level caused by fluctuations in the volume of ice and snow trapped on land, and by the expansion or contraction in the volume of sea water as it warms or cools. Coastal and near-shore locations show much evidence of past and recent sea level changes. In warm eras, glaciers and ice sheets melt, sea water expands, sea levels rise and offshore coral reefs become submerged and drown. Then as peak warming is passed, ice starts to accumulate on land, cooling sea water contracts and sea
levels fall.
Even a moderate cooling event such as the Little Ice Age was sufficient to cause lowering of sea level and stranding of port cities and beaches.

Earth’s natural thermometers are now flashing an amber warning. The long-term trends point to growing glaciers and falling sea level. These warn us that the warm moist bountiful Holocene Era is past its peak. The next chapter in Earth’s History will be a long, hungry, ice-bound era. Only humans who are good at hunting and gathering or have easy access to nuclear power or carbon energy will survive.
Temperature Reconstructions using deep sea sediment cores. (Raymo, 2005) From “The Inconvenient Skeptic” 2011 p42, by John Kehr http://theinconvenientskeptic.com/
People who try to create a “Climate Crisis” out of extreme weather events or short-term climate fluctuations (such as today’s Modern Warm Cycle) are like Lord Nelson – their telescope is applied to the blind eye. They point to the choppy waves from summer storms behind the ship, but fail to see the blizzard approaching on the horizon ahead.

Al Gore was right in one thing – warm cycles coincide with high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The warmth drove CO2 into the atmosphere, and then the cooling oceans removed it again. Carbon dioxide variations are the result, not the cause, of climate changes.
But never once, over eleven warm cycles covering the last million years, have those high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide prevented the onset of the next glacial cycle.
“Carbon Dioxide
Causes Global Warming
Like Wet Roads
Cause Rain.”
Trying to remove or limit atmospheric carbon dioxide is a futile and costly gesture. Even if it were to succeed, by removing plant food from the atmosphere, it would increase the misery of the approaching cold, hungry era.
We may still have warm decades or even centuries ahead. But even when there is a heatwave in autumn, the winter still comes.

Fall is Fading . . . .

No Turbines Turning
At first light this morning (14th July), at our home in Southern Queensland, there was frost on the grass and the chook water was frozen. There was not a breath of wind to turn a turbine, and not a ray of sunshine struck our solar panels.
But at the flick of a switch our stove, electric jug and heaters were energised.
What supplied the power – the old reliables of course – coal, gas and hydro.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/07/13/paris-accord-based-on-fraud/,,Paris Accord Based on Fraud,"By Brendan Godwin
The Paris Accord is based on fraud. Carbon Dioxide or CO2 is essential for all life on earth. Without it we are all extinct. There is nothing unusual happing with the globe’s temperatures. No unusual warming. Our interglacial warm period peaked 8,000 years ago and we are cooling. We’ve come to the end of this interglacial and are about to enter the next ice age. Humans can do nothing to stop that. The globe has no temperature control knob, it is impossible for humans to control the globe’s temperature. CO2 does not produce warming. There’s not enough of it to do anything. It is warming that produces CO2. It is impossible for the cause to be the effect. CO2 has lagged temperature by 1,000 years for the past 1 mil years and it has never stopped the earth from entering an ice age, even when it was 4,000 ppm. CO2 is the gas of life. We need more not less of it and we should be regulating for more not less emissions. It is needed to grow our food crops.
Paris is based on IPCC reports. The IPCC rely on their GCM models. None of the models rely on past climate history but rather a mathematical theory based on refuted, negated, fake and fraudulent science. They all incorporate:

A “human fingerprint” or THS (Tropical Hot Spot) on the earth’s climate that doesn’t exist. IPCC’s AR2 report was fraudulently altered to remove scientific reports that were negative of their GHE definition;
Lewis Fry Richardson’s flawed atmospheric model equation;
Michael Mann’s fraudulent hockey stick graph in AR3;
Arrhenius’ flawed hypothesis of the greenhouse effect; Arrhenius invented heat from nothing.
The multiplier effect of water vapor feedback. The flawed CO2 increases water vapor hypothesis based on Arrhenius and the Charney report; From observations, water vapor is decreasing.
A corrupted peer review process.

Then back all this up by fraudulently altering the data to support the failed models that can’t even predict the last 30 years of hindsight.
The money wasted on Paris will do absolutely nothing to the globe’s temperatures and is a waste. Paris is economic vandalism disguised as environmentalism. It is the political agenda of the communist movement. A wealth redistribution scheme to get rich countries to give away money to poor countries with the end goal to destroy capitalism.
The problem with Turnbull is that he only listens to one side of the science, the side that suits him. There are 32,000 real scientists in the NIPCC who dissent from the IPCC. Politicians need to listen to the real science, not the fraudulent science. During the last ice age CO2 levels dropped to 180 ppm. Plants don’t grow with CO2 at 150 ppm or less. That’s our food crops. If we lower CO2 will face human extinction. It is the interglacial warm period that is causing CO2 to be released from the oceans. Only 3% of annual emissions are from humans. We need more not less to starve off human extinction in the next ice age that is about to hit us.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/06/23/lynching-bystander/,,Innocent Bystander to be Lynched?,"What Produces Warmth?
I live in SE Queensland. Yesterday the surface air temperature rose from a frosty 2ºC at sunrise to a balmy 22ºC in mid-afternoon. The enormous heat needed to achieve this 20ºC of warming came via radiation from the sun. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays no significant part in this daily heating event – in fact it may intercept a tiny proportion of the incoming solar radiation and re-radiate it in all directions, thus keeping the daytime surface temperature a tiny bit cooler than it would have been otherwise.
At the deep Mount Isa Mine in NW Queensland, the surface temperature may average about 25ºC but it increases by about 1ºC every 50 metres of depth – rock walls are red hot in places. The enormous heat causing this comes via conduction from Earth’s internal geothermal heat plus some oxidation and heating of the sulphide ores as they come in contact with natural air containing oxygen. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays no part in this heating.
There are volcanic windows open right now in Hawaii, Japan and the Galapagos revealing the vast resources of volcanic geothermal heat which is always migrating towards the cooler surface, sometimes violently.

Temperatures vary greatly over Earth’s surface, making a mockery of attempts to calculate an “average” for the globe. Air surface temperature may be minus 30ºC at the South Pole, while at the same time it can be plus 30ºC at the Equator. This enormous difference is caused by the varying intensity of solar radiation striking the surface – carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays no significant part in creating this variance.
Surface air temperatures in big cities can be 5-10ºC hotter than surrounding rural land partly because bitumen roads, roofs, solar panels and runways heat up more than grassy or forested countryside. Mega-cities are also full of heat-producing humans, engines, trains, vehicles, air conditioners, heaters, stoves, fridges, pumps and mowers.

Image acknowledgement: www.pixabay.com
Urban heat also comes from the warm bodies and hot exhalations from millions of humans digesting carbon-based foods, from stored chemical energy from burning hydro-carbons (wood, lignite, coal, oil and gas) or from nuclear power. Using green energy also adds to urban heat. Wind towers and solar farms extract energy from wind and sun in the country-side and release it where most of the electricity is used, usually in cities and suburbs. Aging black rooftop solar panels convert much of the solar radiation into heat not electricity, thus adding to urban heat. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays no measurable part in producing these islands of urban heat.
Longer term, global temperature changes such as the Medieval Warm Era and the Little Ice Age were probably caused by natural cyclic fluctuations in orbits and orientations within the solar system which affected the intensity of solar radiation received by land and oceans.
Earth’s bigger Ice Ages (like the one that ended just 12,000 years ago) were probably triggered by changing galactic cycles and associated magnetic reversals which activated submarine volcanic activity along Earth’s extensive mid-ocean trenches/ridges.
Human production of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere played zero part in these natural global warming and cooling episodes
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere varies annually with the seasons reaching a maximum in the South Hemisphere summer for two perfectly natural reasons.
First, the huge southern oceans expel carbon dioxide as the surface water warms with the return of the summer (like an opened bottle of soda water in the sun).
At the same time it is turning to winter in the large northern hemisphere landmass where deciduous trees and forests are dropping their leaves, and crop residue is accumulating on cultivated lands. As this dead plant material decomposes it recycles its CO2 to the atmosphere. And as winter grips these densely populated lands, humans are also burning wood, peat, cow dung, coal, oil and gas to keep warm, releasing even more CO2.
Then as the sun-driven seasons change, the southern oceans cool again and much of this carbon dioxide returns to the sea from whence it came. And the northern farms and forests grow faster in their summer, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide and solar energy to produce food and lumber.
This annual fluctuation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a result, not a cause, of the seasonal temperature changes.
What happens in the seasonal weather cycle also occurs as a result of longer climate cycles of cooling and warming. The ice core records show that the changes in global temperatures precede by about 800 years any changes to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is probably a result of large slow overturning in the oceans as global temperatures change in response to cycles of solar energy and earth volcanism.
Despite all of this evidence of natural changes in Earth’s temperature, man’s production of invisible life-supporting carbon dioxide is being slandered daily with words like “dirty” “black”, “polluting” “heat causing”. And those who point to dissenting evidence are called “deniers”, “shills” and worse, and gagged by intimidatory law suits and media silence.
Billions of dollars are also being spent on a propaganda storm of anti-carbon scare stories, Papal proclamations, cunning calculations, doctored data, and poignant pictures about polar bears, penguins, koalas, super-storms, social costs, floods, fires, mega-droughts, heat waves and blizzards, all supposedly impacted by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. With just 0.04% in the atmosphere, to create such havoc carbon dioxide must be the most powerful super-gas ever imagined by the alarmists.
The green mafia is trying to lynch an innocent victim – the gas of life, carbon dioxide. They would be better served by focussing on real pollution of air, land and water caused by their own well-travelled, air-conditioned, electronic, fast-food, throw-away, tax-supported lifestyle. If they fear carbon dioxide so much, they should stop exhaling.
We need more light and less heat in the climate debate.

Powering the Portland Aluminium Smelter 
Lessons for Victoria from South Australia
Alumina chairman, Mr Peter Day, said recently that his company was “agnostic” about the source of power to the smelter, so long as it was affordable and reliable.
“There have been many years of energy policy making that have effectively reduced energy security and reliability and substantially increased energy costs for industry.”
Victoria has plans to follow South Australia’s example by installing a grid-scale battery, but Mr Day said even Tesla’s new Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia (the world’s largest lithium ion battery) would not be sufficient to run Portland.
“If it was fully charged and available, it could run Portland for around 20 minutes,” he said.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/06/16/past-present-future/,,The Past is the Key to the Present… and the Future,"A Corollary of the Principle of Uniformitarianism
By Howard Dewhirst, Geologist
This document aims to contextualise the scientific debate concerning Climate Change (CC) and Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW). Examining Earth history, it is indisputable that CC has been operating for many hundreds of millions of years, in cycles that span many different time-scales (millennial-plus to decadal), all without human influence. Understanding the causative factors in past CC provides a solid basis for framing the present debate. AGW is a notion which says that human activities, notably the addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, are causing an increase in the global heat budget. That higher-energy state of Earth’s environment it is argued sets the stage for damaging CC effects. Political and economic decisions have been influenced by this claim. Some of those decisions harm efforts to better the health and welfare of the world’s population, including both the poorest and those who are better off. If the CC and AGW arguments are incorrectly based, as we outline here, there is a need to re-consider those decisions.
CC in Earth History

Paleo-temperature (of atmosphere and ocean) is taken as a proxy indicator of climate, since climate is a complex concept that includes precipitation amounts and patterns, wind, etc whose history and future cannot be extracted or classified in a satisfactory way
Earth’s equatorial region has had a consistent temperature during the climate swings over hundreds of millions of years, but the polar areas have varied, thus altering the pole-to-equator gradient of heat energy, which is the principal driver of climate on the planet
Causes of CC (changes in temperature gradients) are dominated by orbital and solar effects, with added signals from volcanoes (both dust and chemicals), tectonics and plate motions, and biological feedbacks
Oceans (which cover ~70% of the planet) are the main heat reservoir, but with patterns of warmer and colder water distributions that reveal decadal and longer cyclicity that is not understood

Global Warming 



Earth’s temperature has been generally rising since the end of the last ice age, with an apparent acceleration during the last century, but not since
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have also been rising more uniformly, now reaching 410ppm or 0.04% of atmosphere
CO2 has been identified as a ‘greenhouse gas’, based on an argument that it traps and reflects heat
The physics of CO2 heat retention are over-stated, as only a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelengths of heat energies) can be captured by this molecule
Because CO2 concentration is rising and is implicated in global warming, and because CO2 is a by-product of combustion, energy sources from fossil fuels have been demonised – via social and political suppression of their use, and a push towards 100% renewable energy
There are three key challenges to the idea that CO2 is the primary cause of GW:

   Long-term records of CO2 and temperature show good correlation, but the CO2 concentrations lag behind temperature increases by thousands of years. Thus, CO2 increase is the consequence of rising ocean temperature, not the cause
   Numerical models of climate systems, which involve simplifying assumptions and methods that are associated with serious artefacts, consistently fail to ‘predict’ the known past temperature patterns. Such models cannot justify the suppression of hydrocarbon fuels.
   Average temperatures are no longer increasing despite the inexorable rise of CO2





Human activities are not the driver of global warming (or cooling). Earth’s systems are governed by processes that operate over a wide range of time- and length-scales, many of which far exceed the usual scope of human perceptions. The demonization of carbon is scientifically unjustified.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/06/07/conquering-famine/,,Carbon Conquered Famine (but green zealots can let it loose again),"The Long War on Famine
by Viv Forbes, 8th June 2018
Famine has haunted humans for most of their history.
In the days of the Pharaohs, whenever the Nile River failed to flood, Egypt starved. Joseph was called in and he organised stockpiling of grain for famine relief.
Even mighty Rome suffered famines – in 436 BC thousands of starving people threw themselves into the Tiber.
The cold Middle Ages in Europe were haunted by famines. In the 11th and 12th century, famines averaged one in 14 years. Even in England there were 22 recorded famines in the 13th century. In 1235, 20,000 people died in London and people ate horse flesh, bark and grass. There were great famines in India, Bengal, France, China and Russia.
Victims of the Great Famine of 1876–78 in India (British Royal Photography Services)
In more recent times, man-made famines were more common in the Comrade Societies – some wit once remarked that “Soviet agriculture has just suffered its 23rd consecutive year of unseasonal weather”.

Some famines were deliberate policy such as Stalin’s liquidation of the Kulaks in 1918 and his starvation of Ukraine in the 1932-33, while other dictators like Mao in China and Pol Pot in Cambodia caused famine with destructive collectivist farm policies.
Famines eased in Europe and North America from about 1860, partly because crops improved with warmer weather and also because of the great increases in land opened up in the Americas for farming and grazing.
But the biggest expansion in food production started with the invention of the coal-powered steam engine – the iron and steel smelted with coal, and the engines, generators and machines powered by coal and then oil, created a food and population explosion.
First were the steam-powered traction engines which pumped water and pulled iron ploughs, planters, harvesters, freight wagons and forest logs. Millions of crop-eating draught horses and oxen went to the butchers and no longer consumed half of the farm crops produced.
Then hunters armed with carbon-powered gunpowder decimated the wild herds of bison, antelope and deer grazing the prairies of the Americas, replacing them with barbed wire and beef cattle. (Most people today probably disapprove of such species slaughter; but it happened, and the food produced on that land now supports farmers, towns and millions of people.)
The cumbersome steam tractors were replaced by internal combustion engines burning kerosene, petrol and diesel.
The model T utility and Fordson tractors created another farming revolution with more food produced with fewer food-consuming draft animals and farm labourers.

Coal-powered trains and petrol-powered trucks and buses moved food, and motorised artillery, cavalry, baggage trains and ambulances moved armies. Millions of ever-hungry and ever-thirsty horses, mules and oxen were removed from the food and water queues.

The vast crop-lands which had been used to produce food for draft animals now produced meat, eggs, milk, butter and grains for humans.
Galvanised iron, steel and concrete (all made using two carbon emitting raw materials, coal and limestone) became invaluable for hay sheds, dairies, cold rooms and silos allowing farmers to store farm produce for droughts and winters.
Engines were soon powering refrigerated trucks, road trains, trains and ships that moved food quickly from farms, factories, abattoirs and mills to refrigerated storage in distant cities, thus greatly reducing the amount of food wasted. (But some stupid/green French politician wants an end to the internal combustion engine by 2040, and some foolish Australians want to put a carbon emissions tax on vehicles.)
Australian Road TrainImage acknowledgement: www.pixabay.com
The next revolution in food production was the discovery and manufacture of nitrate fertilisers and urea using the natural gases nitrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. These fertilisers, assisted by vast irrigation schemes, gave a huge boost to crop growth.
This stunning food revolution based on combustion engines, hydro-carbon fuels, natural gas fertilisers, irrigation and refrigeration has banished famine from the first world.
But every system has its limits. Famine is always just a season or two away. It bides its time, waiting for a failure in the complex carbon-fuelled agricultural, transport and storage network that supports every city.
When hunter-gatherers experienced food shortages, they followed the rains, scavenged for food and largely survived. When farmers and fences replaced hunter-gathers they cultivated large areas of land to grow grasses and grains for poultry, cattle, goats, sheep and pigs. This created a huge increase in food production, but it also tied the farmers to the land – when drought struck, they could not follow the storms.
As farming grew, so too did the dependent cities of factory workers, merchants, tax collectors, rulers, bureaucrats, policemen and soldiers, none of whom produced food. More recently this hungry overhead has been joined by a growing army of welfare and aid recipients, political immigrants and refugees. However, when drought or severe cold threatens the food supply, the cities cannot move away.
Just one thing is now required to create a modern famine – widespread crop failure.
What causes crop failures? Unsuitable conditions in one or more of just three key atmospheric conditions: temperature (unseasonal frost, snow or heat); moisture (extreme floods or droughts); and carbon dioxide (too little to sustain healthy plant growth).
The Little Ice Age ended around the start of the 20th century. Today’s warm climate is very farm-friendly and tends to have most effect on the cold lands of the northern hemisphere, thus increasing the acreage and productivity of the vast crop lands there. Warmth also drives moisture and carbon dioxide plant food out of the oceans into the atmosphere, creating a much more crop-friendly environment. The extra moisture shows up as more precipitation and the extra carbon dioxide we see today makes plants grow faster and stronger. Extra warmth, moisture and carbon dioxide help greatly to increase crop yields and banish famine.
However, Earth’s climate is always changing, and there is significant evidence that we are past the warm peak of this climate cycle and are on the road to the next advance of the ice.
“Every source of climate information in the Northern Hemisphere shows that the Earth experienced the warmest climate of the last 100,000 years about 6,000  years ago and since then (especially over the past 4,000 years) the Northern Hemisphere has been experiencing a gradual cooling. That does not mean that each century is colder than the one before, but it means that each millennium is colder than the one before.”
John Kehr, “The Inconvenient Skeptic”
http://theinconvenientskeptic.com/2012/04/himalaya-glaciers-are-growing/
All we hear from the climate industry and the dark green media are the claimed dangers of global warming. However it is global cooling that poses a dire threat to world food supplies.
First the frosts and snow come earlier and stay later – the growing season gets shorter. Then winter snow persists into summer, ice sheets and glaciers advance and boreal forests and tundra invade grasslands – the great northern crop lands are forced to move south. The cold also reduces evaporation from oceans, lakes and streams, thus reducing rainfall. Growing ice sheets cause falling sea levels, dewatering coastal fish farms and breeding grounds. And, in the final blow, cold oceans and lakes absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, further reducing plant growth. Icy eras reinforce all three crop destroyers: cold, drought and carbon-dioxide starvation.
In addition to climate dangers, foolish green zealots in the comfortable western democracies are also nibbling away at the area of land and sea allowed for harvesting food. They also reduce the land devoted to growing food by subsidising crops for ethanol and biodiesel production.
They are also seeking global powers in an anti-life campaign to encourage global cooling by reducing the carbon dioxide content of Earth’s atmosphere. Luckily their costly anti-carbon goals will have no effect on the grand cycles of global climate, but they will harm the cost, capacity and reliability of our complex energy-dependent food production storage and distribution system.
The Green energy they idolise is intermittent and unreliable – it breeds network instability and power failures.
The fierce dog of famine is tethered outside the city gate. Our abundant supplies of reliable energy for the production, harvesting, transport, processing, storage and distribution of food have kept him at bay. But still he waits patiently for foolish politicians or dreadful weather to let him loose.
A natural disaster affecting key Asian oil refineries or a naval blockade of the fleet of tankers carrying petroleum products to Australia would stop road transport of food to Australian cities in a few days.
Just one decent regional blackout would empty supermarket shelves and create long queues at every service station; two frigid winters would see food prices soar; and a return of the Little Ice Age or worse will see starvation stalking the cities.

Greens are inviting famine, humanity’s ancient enemy, into our cities via the green door.

Paul Driessen and Roger Bezdek
Judge William Alsup has a BS in engineering, has written computer programs for his ham radio hobby, delves deeply into the technical aspects of numerous cases before him, and even studied other programming languages for a complex Oracle v. Google lawsuit.
As presiding judge in People of the State of California v. BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell, he insisted that the litigants present their best scientific evidence for and against the state’s assertion that fossil fuel emissions are causing dangerous climate change. Now he wants to see, not just the alleged damages from burning oil, natural gas and coal – but also the immense benefits to humanity and the people of California from using those fuels for the past 150 years and more.
Environmental and climate activists, including cities pursuing climate lawsuits against oil companies, almost never acknowledge those benefits, which are far-reaching and indisputable. We can only hope attorneys Anne Champion, Philip Curtis, Diehl Kemper, et al. and friends of the court will do justice to the many blessings attributable to our use of these once unimaginable energy resources.
For countless millennia, our ancestors struggled to survive amid deprivation and backbreaking dusk-to-dawn labor, often on the brink of starvation – with the bulk of humanity living little better than their domesticated animals. Average nasty, brutish and short life expectancy hovered in the low thirties.
But then, suddenly and miraculously, in barely two centuries, health, prosperity and longevity began to climb. First coal, then oil, then natural gas paved the way, providing the fuels for transportation, communication, refrigeration, electricity and other incredible technologies that improve, enhance, safeguard and save lives. Incomes increased eleven-fold. Mass die-offs so confidently predicted by Malthus and Ehrlich never materialized. In fact, global life spans more than doubled, and today billions of people enjoy living standards that even kings and queens could not dream of 120 years ago.
Sadly, equal numbers of people still struggle on the edge of survival. A billion and a half are still without electricity, two billion still exist on a few dollars a day, and millions still die every year from insect-borne, lung and intestinal diseases – largely because they still burn wood and dung, instead of fossil fuels.
In 1900, New York City’s 3.4 million people relied on 100,000 horses whose “tailpipes” emitted 2.5 million pounds of manure and 60,000 gallons of urine every day. Sanitation crews cleaned it up, dumped it mostly in local rivers, and hauled dead horses to rendering plants. Farmers devoted thousands of acres just to growing horse feed. Imagine what today’s 8.6 million NYC residents would require and emit.
Today, far more powerful, far less polluting, trucks, cars, buses, trains, subways and airplanes move people, food and products far more quickly and efficiently. They take us to work, school and worship services; to the grocery, bank, drug store, doctor and restaurant; to movies, picnics and sporting events. Fire trucks help us battle devastating conflagrations, and ambulances take our injured to hospitals.
All these vehicles (internal combustion and electric) exist because of, are fueled by – and travel on roadways made with fossil fuels: asphalt from oil, metal and concrete manufactured using fossil fuels.
Even electric cars require oil, gas and coal for manufacturing and recharging. Indeed, the earth-moving machines, drilling rigs and production platforms, pipelines, foundries, factories and other technologies needed to extract, process and fabricate raw materials into the world around us exist because of fossil fuels. Every bit of metal, plastic, concrete, wood, fabric and food we see results from fossil fuels. Even wind turbines, solar panels and biofuels are impossible without the fuels that California so loves to hate.
Medical devices, computers, cell phones, radios and televisions, kitchen appliances, household and office heating and air conditioning, millions of other products of every description require fossil fuels for their components, manufacturing and daily operation. The schools and research laboratories that made our amazing technologies and other advancements possible are themselves made possible by fossil fuels.
The modern agricultural equipment and practices that feed the world share the same ancestry: tractor and harvester fuel, ammonia fertilizer from natural gas, pesticides and herbicides from petrochemicals. Carbon dioxide from burning these fuels helps crop, forage, forest and grassland plants grow faster and better, with less water and better resistance to droughts and diseases. Our bounteous grain and other crops mean fewer famines, except where forced starvation is used to subdue and eliminate enemies.
Indeed, between 1961 and 2011, the total monetary value of CO2 enhancement for 45 crops reached an estimated cumulative value of $3.2 trillion! Carbon dioxide’s annual enrichment value rose from $19 billion in 1961 to $140 billion in 2010. Between 2012 and 2050, these benefits will total $9.8 trillion!
Pharmaceutical and cosmetic products all have their roots in petrochemicals – as do paints, synthetic fibers and plastics. Hockey and football players are dressed head to toe in fossil-fuel-sourced materials.
High-rise office and residential buildings made possible by steel and concrete allow our cities to grow upward, instead of just outward, preserving millions of acres of wildlife habitats and scenic areas.
Then there’s electricity. Look around you, and try to imagine your life without this wondrous, pervasive energy source. Electricity was properly ranked humanity’s second most significant innovation of the past 6,000 years, after the printing press! It has created, shaped, defined and powered the modern world, and facilitated virtually every technological achievement of the past century. Electrification of nations is undeniably the world’s most significant engineering and life-enhancing achievement of the past century.
Economic growth, quality of life and longevity are directly correlated to sufficient, reliable, affordable electricity. In today’s world, nothing happens without it: communication, transportation and research; the operation of every home, office, hospital, factory and airport; refrigeration to preserve food and medicine; heating and air conditioning to save lives and enable people to survive and prosper in any climate.
Electrification will be increasingly important in the 21st century, and world electricity consumption is forecast to double within four decades, as electricity supplies an increasing share of the world’s ever-increasing energy demand. Fossil fuels will continue generating at least 75% of electricity, even in 2050.
Hydroelectric and nuclear (which radical environmentalists also despise and oppose), a bit of geothermal, and a smattering of unreliable, weather-determined wind and solar power will supply the rest. The land, resource and environmental impacts of building and operating wind and solar must also be considered.
Social media and internet search engines (to run biased searches for alarmist climate news) also depend on electricity – 91.4% of which was generated by fossil fuels, nuclear and hydro in 2016 in the USA.
Increased productivity generated by all these technologies creates the leisure time and wealth that enable everyone to enjoy evenings, weekends and holidays – and the fossil fuel transportation to go places (including to faraway, exotic locales and 5-star hotels for IPCC climate change confabs).
Finally, aside from nuclear-powered ships, our highly mechanized military gets there “the fastest with the mostest” thanks to fossil fuels, to combat terrorism and provide for our national defense.
Judge Alsup’s case is thus really about highly speculative manmade climate disasters versus indisputable fossil fuel benefits – as further documented here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and elsewhere. Indeed, today’s undeniable fossil fuel benefits outweigh any hypothesized climate, sea level and other costs by literally orders of magnitude: at least 50:1 to more than 200:1.
Barring major efficiency, battery storage and other technology improvements, renewable energy cannot possibly replace fossil fuels. Judge Alsup has no choice but to rule in favor of the oil company defendants … and all who rely on oil, gas and coal for the countless, life-enhancing benefits barely touched on here.

Most chapters of human history are defined by the tools and machines that were used.
In the Stone Age, the first tools were “green tools” – digging sticks, spears, boomerangs, bows and arrows made of wood; and axes, clubs, knives and grinders made of stone. These were all powered by human energy.
Then humans learned how to control fire for warmth, cooking, warfare and hunting.

Steve Hunter http://stevehunterillustrations.com.au/political-cartoons/
Another clever person invented the wheel and we harnessed animal power using donkeys, horses, mules and oxen, and made better tools like bridles, saddles and yokes from wood, fibre and leather.
All of these tools made hunting, gathering and trade easier and more reliable.
Then wooden ploughs revolutionised the cultivation of wild grasses for food for animals and humans. Farming started.

Image acknowledgement: www.pixabay.com
Trade and exchange was made easier with money using rare commodities like gold, silver, gems and shells.

Image acknowledgement: www.pixabay.com
Tool-making made a huge advance in the Bronze Age with the discovery of how to extract metals like copper, lead, zinc and tin from natural ores using charcoal. Brass, bronze and pewter made many useful tools. These were then replaced with better tools when man discovered how to smelt iron and make steel.
Then along came the game-changers – engines and electricity.
The steam engine, running on wood and then on coal or oil, revolutionised life with steam-driven pumps, traction engines and locomotives releasing millions of draught animals from transport duty.

Image acknowledgement: www.pixabay.com
Then came electricity when steam engines were used to drive generators. All the windmills, coaches, sailing ships, lamps, stoves and dryers powered by green energy (wind, water, wood, animal energy, whale oil and beeswax) became obsolete.

Image acknowledgement: www.pixabay.com
Mankind made another leap forward with the invention of internal combustion engines using petroleum liquids and gases for fuel.
An even bigger leap was the harnessing of nuclear power to produce almost unlimited clean energy from controlled reactions using tiny amounts of fuel.

Image acknowledgement:
Steve Hunter http://stevehunterillustrations.com.au/political-cartoons/
Nothing in life is without risk, and every tool or engine can be misused. On balance, however, tools, engines and electricity have allowed humans to live better from less land and natural resources per person than ever before. Societies with an abundance of capital equipment are richer, have lower population growth and have the leisure and resources to provide far more environmental protection.
Therefore we should spend “Earth Day” celebrating “Engines and Electricity”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/04/14/green-dictatorship/,,"Tomorrow’s Grim, Global, Green Dictatorship","Greens hate individual freedom and private property. They dream of a centralised unelected global government, financed by taxes on developed nations and controlled by all the tentacles of the UN.
No longer is real pollution of our environment the main Green concern. The key slogan of the Green religion is “sustainable development”, with them defining what is sustainable.
Greens hate miners. They use nationalised parks, heritage areas, flora/fauna reserves, green bans, locked gates and land rights (for some) to close as much land as possible to explorers and miners – apparently resources should be locked away for some lucky distant future generation. And if some persistent explorer manages to prove a mineral deposit, greens will then strangle it in the approvals process using “death by delay”.
Greens hate farmers with their ploughs, fertilisers, crops and grazing animals. They want Aussie grazing land turned back to kangaroos and woody weeds. They plan to expel farmers and graziers from most land areas, with food produced in concentrated feedlots, factory farms, communal gardens and hydroponics.
Greens hate professional fishermen with their nets, lines and harpoons. Using the Great Barrier Reef as their poster-child, they plan to control the Coral Sea using marine parks, fishing quotas, bans and licences, leaving us to get seafood from foreign seas and factory fish farms.
Greens hate foresters and grass-farmers. They want every tree protected, even woody weeds taking over ancient treeless grasslands. Red meat and forest timber are “unsustainable”. Apparently they want us to live in houses made of recycled cardboard and plastic and eating fake steak and protein powder made from methane generated from decomposing rubbish dumps.
Greens despise the suburbs with their SUV’s, lawns, pools, rose gardens, manicured parks, ponies and golf courses. They prefer concentrated accommodation with people stacked-and-packed in high-rise cubic apartments, with state-controlled kindies in the basement, and with ring-roads of electric trams and driverless cars connecting apartments, schools, offices and shops.
Greens hate reliable grid power from coal, nuclear, oil, gas or hydro generators. Their “sustainable” option is part-time power from wind and solar with the inevitable blackouts and shortages needing more rules and rationing.
Greens lead the war on fracking and pipelines. The victims are energy consumers. The beneficiaries are Russian gas and Middle-east oil.
Greens think it is “sustainable” to uglify scenic hills with whining wind towers, power poles, transmission lines and access roads, and to clutter pleasant estuaries and shallow seas with more bird-slicing turbines. They think it is “sustainable” to keep smothering sunny flatlands under solar panels and filling the suburbs with extra power lines and batteries of toxic metals.
Greens think it is “sustainable” to clear forests for bio-mass to feed large wood-fired power stations, or for establishing biofuel plantations. They think it is “sustainable” to keep converting croplands from producing food for humans to producing ethanol for cars.
Greens hate free markets where prices are used to signal changing supply and demand. There is no room for fun, frills or luxuries in their “sustainable” world. They want to limit demand by imposing rationing on us wastrels – carbon ration cards, electricity rationing meters, water rationing, meat free days, diet cops and bans on fast foods and fizzy-drinks.
They also favour compulsory recycling of everything, no matter what that process costs in energy or resources. Surveillance cameras will keep watch on our “wasteful” habits.
None of this vast green religious agenda is compatible with individual freedom, constitutional rights or private property – and none of it makes any economic or climate sense.
The Despotic Green New World is coming. Climate alarm is the stalking horse, “sustainable development” is the war cry, and global government is the goal.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/04/14/wanton-worship-woody-weeds/,,The Wanton Worship of Woody Weeds,"

Greens worship woody weeds. Their proposed tree-clearing bans in Queensland are the latest salvo in a long war favouring trees and damaging grasslands and pastoralists.

For millennia Australia’s open forests and treeless plains have supported our national emblems – the kangaroo and the emu, which in turn sustained aborigines, eagles and dingos. Australian grasslands also nurtured now-endangered species such as bustards, quail, pigeons, finches and grass parrots.
Nothing stands still in nature. Savannas are forever a battleground between grassland, scrub and desert. Greens gaze in rapture at the trees but ignore the valuable grasses beneath their feet – native plants like Mitchell Grass and Kangaroo Grass and cultivated grasses like wheat, barley, oats, sorghum and sugar cane.

Greens hate grazing animals like cattle and sheep (but not wildebeest!) and, like trained parrots, repeat the hard-hoof fairy-tale about soil compaction and erosion. In reality, hoof action breaks crusty soil. 
A short burst of concentrated animal impact with hoof cultivation, seed burial, and application of dung and urine fertilisers does wonders for the long-term health of the pasture. It is not a question of hard hooves or soft paws – it is a grazing management question. A healthy pasture needs grasses, herbs, legumes and periodic grazing animals – shut out the ruminants, or stock heavily and continuously, and you will get weeds and desert.

Greens favour “Do Nothing Pasture Management”. Along with their bans on mechanical or chemical control of tree invasions, they try to prevent bushfires which have for millennia maintained the vigour of the grasslands. To have healthy pasture requires recycling of nutrients from old dead grass before the summer rains. This is best achieved by concentrated short-term hoof impact or by controlled burning (both of which may also kill tree seedlings that are forever trying to invade the grasslands).
Greens are always nibbling away at grasslands and open forests by demanding ever more nationalised parks, conservation zones and other green blockades. Instead of supporting graziers with their productive pastures and grazing animals they create ever-expanding sterilised un-managed areas which become havens for weeds like lantana, prickly pear, cactus and wait-a-while and pests like feral dogs, wild pigs and wild cats.

Proposed new Queensland laws will hinder landowners in harvesting mulga scrub during drought and controlling invasion of grasslands by woody weeds. These destructive green bans plus the unjust Kyoto tree-clearing land seizures are part of the global Green plan to drive farmers and graziers from much of the land.
The great value of ruminants is their efficiency in converting the vegetation of poorer grasslands and open forest into edible proteins and fats. ALP/Green policies will reduce the supply of this truly free-range food and increase our dependence on feedlot food, which is worse for the environment and our health.

And for those who believe the greenhouse warming fable, grassland plants remove the bogey-man (carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere. This carbon collected by grazing animals ends up in long-term storage in human bodies via meat and other animal food products. At the end of their life, most human bodies get sequestered in carbon-based coffins and buried in carbon cemeteries.
Greens should be happy with that, but the plant world will gradually suffer from this relentless loss of the gas of life from the biosphere.
The bureaucracy of our “Brave New Green World” will use drones, spy cameras and computer programs to trap and punish any grazier who dares to defend his grassland from invading trees.

Instead of tree clearing bans we need to free our land managers for a war on woody weeds using controlled burning, better grazing management and reversal of the unjust Kyoto land sterilisation program.

https://carbon-sense.com/2018/03/28/benefits-of-human-co2-emissions/,,The Benefits of Human CO2 Emissions,"“The Benefits of Human CO2 Emissions” by Dr Patrick Moore
All life is carbon based and the primary source of this carbon is the CO2 in the global atmosphere.
As recently as 18,000 years ago, at the height of the most recent major glaciation, CO2 dipped to its lowest level in recorded history at 180 ppm, low enough to stunt plant growth. This is only 30 ppm above a level that would result in the death of plants due to CO2 starvation.
It is calculated that if the decline in CO2 levels were to continue at the same rate as it has over the past 140 million years, life on Earth would begin to die as soon as two million years from now and would slowly perish almost entirely as carbon continued to be lost to the deep ocean sediments.
The combustion of fossil fuels for energy to power human civilization has reversed the downward trend in CO2 and promises to bring it back to levels that are likely to foster a considerable increase in the growth rate and biomass of plants, including food crops and trees.
Human emissions of CO2 have restored a balance to the global carbon cycle, thereby ensuring the long-term continuation of life on Earth.
This extremely positive aspect of human CO2 emissions must be weighed against the unproven hypothesis that human CO2 emissions will cause a catastrophic warming of the climate in coming years.
The one-sided political treatment of CO2 as a pollutant that should be radically reduced must be corrected in light of the indisputable scientific evidence that it is essential to life on Earth.

The Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council in its Comment Calls on President Trump and EPA to Repeal and Not Replace the Clean Power Plan(CPP). 
CHECC CPP ANPRM Replacement Comment Overview FINAL 022718 PDF
 Key Comment Conclusions*: 


CO2 is a Beneficial Gas, not a Pollutant. As a result, the Social Cost of Carbon is Negative since CO2 is so very critical to plant growth and therefore human life.


The 2009 Endangerment Finding must be reconsidered and rescinded/vacated. Thus, the CPP would not be replaced.


All future Federal, State and private sector decisions regarding the Nation’s electric power grid must focus solely on minimizing consumer electricity prices as well as maximizing Grid Reliability and Resilience. No consumer electricity price increases should be permitted by regulators that result from increased Renewables/Energy Storage Grid penetration.


The Current Reconsideration of future vehicle MPG Standards must treat CO2 reduction as a cost, not a benefit, so that only consumer preferences matter, not climate change issues. Currently, with low gasoline price expectations, most consumers prefer trucks & SUVs.


*Based on the Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council (CHECC) Comment in response to EPA’s ANPRM CPP Replacement
CHECC CPP ANPRM Replacement Comment FINAL to EPA 022618 (1)
Filed February 26, 2018

March 24, 2018
The Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council (CHECC) announces that on February 26, 2018 it filed a Comment in response to EPA’s Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) Clean Power Plan (CPP) Replacement. (see 
CHECC CPP ANPRM Replacement Comment FINAL to EPA 022618 (1) ) 
This Comment provided EPA and the Trump Administration with Legal, Climate Science and Energy Economic analysis findings, each robustly supporting the conclusion that EPA should Repeal and Not Replace the Clean Power Plan.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the Legal Analysis: The CPP should not be replaced with anything at all until a lawful, scientifically robust, highly influential scientific assessment (HISA)-compliant positive endangerment finding has been made. The 2009 EF analysis process was fundamentally flawed requiring that it must be rescinded and reconsidered.
Based on the Climate Science Analysis: The scientific basis for the 2009 Endangerment Analysis has been invalidated – in fact, by two separate and distinct analyses. Hence, a GHG endangerment reconsideration is highly unlikely to yield a new endangerment finding. And, thus CPP replacement would have no legal basis and then should not be replaced.

Based on the Energy Economic Analysis: The current Federal, State and private sector policies that are now increasing the fraction of electricity generation from Intermittent Renewables must be stopped/reversed in order to avoid/mitigate very severe micro and macroeconomic impacts and National Security ramifications involving skyrocketing electricity prices as well as dramatically reduced power grid reliability and resilience. The climate science findings suggest that taking such action will have no impact on the climate.

Legal Findings
The legal analysis contained in the Comment is written to satisfy lawyers conversant in “Administrative Law,” but the bottom line is that the 2009 Endangerment Finding, upon which all current CO2 regulation is predicated, was rammed through EPA and the courts and shown in the Comment to have not been carried out consistent with statute law.
 The 2009 Endangerment Finding did not comply with the requirements for highly influential scientific assessments (HISA), and Obama’s endangerment finding supporting the CPP is demonstrated to be grossly deficient. In short, the CO2 Endangerment Finding must be reconsidered because the 2009 finding was not made consistent with easy to understand statute law – a point made to EPA by its Inspector General but ignored by EPA and both the D.C. and Supreme Courts.
The only lawful way to regulate GHG emissions is to prepare a proper, HISA-compliant positive endangerment finding. Until that has been completed, and a lawfully conducted and scientifically robust positive finding returned, the CPP should not be replaced with any regulation at all.
Climate Science Findings
 New research findings now make it all but certain that CO2 is not a pollutant but rather a beneficial gas that should not be regulated. This is because at this point, there is no statistically valid proof that past increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have caused what have been officially reported as rising, or even record setting, temperatures.
 Moreover, new research findings demonstrate that adjustments by government agencies to the Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST) data render that data totally inconsistent with many other published and credible temperature data sets and therefore totally useless for any policy analysis purpose.
Adjustments over time to previously reported official data that imparted an ever-steeper upward trend in the data by removing the natural cyclical temperature patterns previously present in the data. These adjustments have deprived the GAST data from NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU of the credibility required for policymaking or climate modeling. This is particularly true when such data are relied on to drive trillions of dollars in expenditures. 
Finally, it is therefore inescapable that: if the official GAST data from NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU are invalid, then both the ‘basic physical understanding’ of climate and the associated climate models will also be invalid – resulting in tens of billions in wasted climate research funding.
The CHECC Comment also referenced two recent letters to the EPA Administrator from over 85 highly credentialed scientists. They stated as follows: “We the undersigned are individuals who have technical skills and knowledge relevant to climate science and the GHG Endangerment Finding. We each are convinced that the 2009 GHG Endangerment Finding is fundamentally flawed and that an honest, unbiased reconsideration is in order.”
The Comment’s science findings section also presents rebuttals of ten typical climate change alarmists’ claims. The authors of these rebuttals are all recognized experts in the relevant scientific fields. The rebuttals demonstrate the falsity of all ten of the claims merely by citing the most credible empirical data on the topic. The ten now rebutted alarmist claims are as follows:

Heat Waves are increasing at an alarming rate and heat kills.
Global warming is causing more hurricanes and stronger hurricanes.
Global warming is causing more and stronger tornadoes.
Global warming is increasing the magnitude and frequency of droughts and floods.
Global Warming has increased U.S. Wildfires.
Global warming is causing snow to disappear.
Global warming is resulting in rising sea levels as seen in both tide gauge and satellite technology.
Arctic, Antarctic and Greenland ice loss is accelerating due to global warming.
Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are causing ocean acidification, which is catastrophically harming marine life. 
Carbon pollution is a health hazard.

This parade of horrible calamities that the 2009 Endangerment Finding predicts and that a vast program of regulation seeks to prevent have been comprehensively and conclusively refuted by empirical data. The 2009 Endangerment Finding should be rescinded and the Clean Power Plan replaced with nothing at all.
Energy Economic Findings
 The Energy Economic Argument for rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding is that the CPP should not be replaced with anything because increasing the Fraction of Electricity Generation from Intermittent Renewables causes Enormous Consumer Electricity Price Increases and Serious Negative Macroeconomic Impacts. Real world examples in the Comment demonstrate that jurisdictions that have succeeded in increasing the percent of electricity from renewables validate the proposition that the more their power grid relied on renewables, the higher the electricity price -with price increases accelerating as the percent of electricity from renewables gets higher than 20% or so. 
These real world case studies are corroborated by a September 2017 study by IHS Markit, titled  Ensuring Resilient and Efficient Electricity Generation: The Value of the Current Diverse U.S. Power Supply Portfolio  which analyzed the economic effects of state and federal energy policies that are driving electric utilities away from coal, nuclear and hydroelectric and towards renewables and natural gas. Such policies are forecast by IHS Markit to lead to a tripling of the current roughly 7% reliance on wind, solar and other intermittent resources, with natural gas-fired resources supplying the majority of generation. (This assumption now appears optimistic for NG penetration; that is, current trends would favor higher renewable penetration.)
The Study’s Findings are that current policy driven market distortions will lead to the: U.S. power grid becoming less cost-effective, less reliable and less resilient, … Id. at p. 4 (Emphasis added). The study forecasts that these policies will cause a 27% increase in the retail price of electricity.
The following economic impacts of these policies were forecast: 
The 27% retail power price increase associated with the less efficient diversity case causes a decline of real US GDP of 0.8%, equal to $158 billion (2016 chain-weighted dollars). 
Labor market impacts of the less efficient diversity case involve a reduction of 1 million jobs. 
A less efficient diversity case reduces real disposable income per household by about $845 (2016 dollars) annually, equal to 0.76% of the 2016 average household disposable income.” 
Id. at p. 5. (Emphasis added).
It should be noted that the Study’s projected 27% increase in average retail power prices is predicated on the wind and solar renewables share rising by three-fold from 7% to “only” about 21%. The case studies discussed in the Comment make very clear the enormous increases in power prices that would result as policy makers attempt to move the renewables grid penetration higher than that. Moreover, the study found that policies that promote increased use of wind and solar would likely result in little to no reduction in the level of electric sector CO2 emissions. 
 Based on these Energy Economic findings, the CPP should not be replaced with anything because increasing the fraction of electricity generation from Intermittent Renewables will cause (1) enormous consumer electricity price increases, (2) the Grid to become even less reliable and less resilient, and (3) even more serious negative micro and macroeconomic impacts – but would have zero impact on the climate.

“Arguably, the former environmental activist Patrick Moore is difficult to overcome” – Source: Martin U. K. Lengemann
Patrick Moore once helped to found Greenpeace. Today, the ecologist considers the organization an unscientific lobby group. He has a provocative message: carbon dioxide is not poison. It is good for life on the planet.
The week was not bad for the climate protection movement. France’s head of state Emmanuel Macron had summoned the Climate Chancellor Angela Merkel to the summit in Paris and or emerged with the rank of European “Climate President”. And his plan worked out: UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged that he no longer supports fossil fuels because this would amount to an “investment in destruction”. The World Bank announced that it would stop promoting oil and gas production from 2019 onwards.
With so much international involvement in the fight against CO2, the Greens in Paris missed senior German officials. Merkel was represented by Barbara Hendricks (SPD). From the perspective of green climate politician Annalena Baerbock, the Federal Minister for the Environment only completed an “unmotivated courtesy visit”.
Baerbock’s indignation would certainly have been even greater if she had known which alternative program numerous members of the Bundestag of the Union (CDU) and the FDP had preferred to the Paris climate summit. They had followed the invitation of the Federal Association “Liberaler Mittelstand” to a parliamentary breakfast.
There, Canadian Patrick Moore, one of the founding fathers of Greenpeace, presented his view on climate change, CO2 emissions and energy policy, which – if true – would undermine the foundations of official energy and climate policies. For years, Moore has been one of the archenemies of the world’s largest environmental organization, which he had once brought to the baptism. For today’s activist generation he is the fallen angel of environmental protection.
Carbon dioxide increase did not increase temperature
Nuclear power, genetically modified food, forest conservation, chemicals use, climate change – in almost every major environmental issue Moore represents a view that directly contradicts the Greenpeace policy. In doing so, Moore studied biology, biochemistry and forestry, a doctorate in ecology, and was for years the only trained scientist in the Greenpeace leadership.

Good argument is difficult to master. His quarrels with Greenpeace often end at a high level at a stalemate, statement against statement. Everyone claims that his view of things is the truth. This is how it was when Moore presented diagrams of global temperatures and CO2 concentrations of the last 500 million years to a parliamentary breakfast of about 30 members of the Bundestag.
In another chart, the curves derived from the ice cores of the Russian Antarctic station Vostok, provided no evidence, according to Moore, that the CO2 content in the atmosphere had raised the temperature. On the contrary, he explained to the perplexed MPs: “The CO2 value follows the change in temperature, not the other way around.”
Moore does not deny that the CO2 concentration has risen sharply since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Nor does he shake the fact of global warming. Only he claims that one has nothing to do with the other. The curves of shark attacks and ice-cream consumption also showed a strong correlation, he reveals. “Correlation does not prove causation.”
The Sun’s activity affects the world climate
According to Moore, there are many complex factors that change the climate. Solar activity is part of it, cloud formation and much more. When the earth’s temperature rises, the oceans “emit” more CO2. A rise in carbon dioxide would be the consequence, not the cause of global warming. The basic assumption of many climate scientists that carbon dioxide is the main trigger of global warming is a “hypothesis” for Moore, nothing more.
“There is no definitive scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is responsible for the slight warming of the global climate that has occurred in the last 300 years – since the Little Ice Age,” says Moore. “Such a proof would have been documented – that’s not the case.”
The objection that 97 percent of all climate scientists attribute CO2 to the role of the greenhouse gas does not impress Moore. He refers to a booklet from 1931. The title: “100 authors against Einstein”. With great numerical superiority, scientists attacked the theory of relativity that a young patent attorney named Albert Einstein had published a few years earlier.
Einstein responded as relaxed as Moore today: “If I was wrong, it would be sufficient for a single author to refute me.” the IPCC of the United Nations, the ultimate judge in matters of climate change, certainly does not impress Moore.
Climate council focuses on human influence
His skepticism derives from the statutes of the IPCC: The committee has the mission to explicitly investigate only the human impact on climate change. For the study of the natural causes of climate change, therefore, the IPCC lacks any mandate. This leads to a conflict of interest: If the UN body finds no human cause of global warming, it loses its right to exist.
In any case, because of its composition, the IPCC does not enjoy the confidence of the former Greenpeace chief. The IPCC was founded by the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). According to Moore, “people who care about the weather forecast for the next week” and environmentalists “who focus on daily politics”. That does not indicate competence for the evaluation of the ages of the Earth.
“Why does no one ask geologists, paleontologists, astrophysicists?” After all, the IPCC always expresses only a “concern” about climate change in its progress reports, Moore states. “Greenpeace always makes a disaster out of it”.  Since leaving Greenpeace in 1986, Moore repeatedly accuses the environmental organization of unscientific alarmism.

When Greenpeace was planning a worldwide campaign against the use of chlorine in the 1980s, Moore’s loyalty ended. Chlorine is the eleventh most common element in the earth’s crust, the most important element for public health in human history, and the raw material for countless medicines.
He does not want to force environmental protection at the expense of people. In the environmental organizations, however, the belief has spread that humans are the enemies of the Earth, which he could not support. Moore withdrew himself after 15 years in the Greenpeace peak body. He first became a salmon farmer and then an independent environmental consultant.
He also accepted positions from the nuclear industry and forestry companies in Asia and North America, but he still does not sacrifice his environmental credentials. Although 70, Moore does not expect his crusade against environmental fear mongering is coming to an end anytime soon.
Without CO2, our earth would have long been a dead planet
It annoys him that CO2, the basic building block of all life on earth, is denounced by climate protectors to school classes as a “poison”. Without the gas, Moore said, “our Earth would be a dead planet.”
In the Bundestag he projected graphs on the wall, showing that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been steadily reduced for 150 million years by natural deposition on the seabed and in the earth’s crust.
In primeval times, the amount of carbon dioxide was ten times higher than today’s levels – at the same time there was an explosion of flora and fauna. “Even today, the plants would like to have more CO2,” says Moore, pointing out that “every professional greenhouse farmer fertilizes his plants with CO2 input.”
Concentration approached dangerously low levels
The real drama is not the warming, but the decay of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. From more than 4600 parts per million (ppm) it had dropped to barely 180 ppm during the last glaciation. “This is only 30 ppm above the level at which plants begin to die,” says Moore. This was only 18,000 years ago, a geological blink of an eye. It is largely due to the burning of fossil fuels by humans, that the CO2 content has increased again to about 400 ppm today.
If man were to support natural CO2 reduction and ban fossil fuels, “life on earth would be over in less than two million years,” claims Moore. “The fact is that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been dropping to a dangerously low level for a very long time”.
“Human combustion of fossil carbon sources helps restore a balance to the global carbon cycle,” says Moore. More carbon dioxide would contribute to more plant growth, more trees and larger food harvests.
Climate goals risk Germany’s prosperity
Germany will miss its climate targets for 2020 – and more drastically than expected. The Federal Environment Ministry has calculated this. Above all, the cause is the increasing fuel consumption in road traffic. Source: N24 / Daniel Franz
Germany is missing its climate goals by miles. From an economic point of view, it is impossible to live up to the promises made by the government for CO2 reduction by 2030. This results from a calculation from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  If the analysis of the former Greenpeace leader is correct, it would undermine the basis of an energy policy that derives its legitimacy from mainstream climate science. A layman may wish for open discussion in the face of such a fundamental dispute. But such a serious discussion is not expected in today’s political climate.
The climate “scientists” had already declared their knowledge before the summit in Paris was completed: The climate debate is finished. A dictum that makes Moore quite certain that “in the best scientific tradition, skepticism is almost mandatory.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2017/11/29/part-time-power/,,Part Time Power,"Solar power only works while the sun shines – it is part-time power.
Wind power only works when suitable winds blows – also part-time power.
Batteries only work when charged – part-time power again.
Hydro fails in droughts – more part-time power.
And using full-time power like gas to fill the inevitable supply gaps from part-time power forces backup gas to operate like part-time power.
Moreover, on sunny windy days, wind and solar generators spew out electricity at little extra cost. These erratic surges of part-time power drive short-term electricity prices so low that even low-cost full-time producers like coal cannot operate profitably at those times. They are throttled back and forced to operate as yet another part-time power plant.
24/7 electricity users such as hospitals, trains, factories, refineries, fuel and water pumps, cash registers, infrastructure and mines cannot operate on part-time electricity.
Moreover, every part-time power producer (using sun, wind, batteries, hydro, gas or coal) consumes money full-time for operations, standby, maintenance and replacement. Each also has to fund its own specialised generators, transmission lines, access roads and workforce. Electricity becomes both unreliable and expensive, and consumers suffer.
Using taxes, subsidies, dictates and mandates to replace a full-time power producer like coal with up to five part-time power producers only makes sense in the part-time minds that inhabit Greentopia.
Canberra cannot improve any of this with more laws and regulations – they must REPEAL all the legislation, regulations, subsidies and taxes that created the mess in the first place. State governments too should repeal their silly energy laws, and stop shutting and destroying power stations. More laws and regulations can only make things worse.

Good. Let’s use them as a full-blown test of “zero emissions” before we all jump over that cliff.
Canberra passes thousands of laws for us. If their zero emissions dream is fair dinkum, they need to pass just three laws for themselves.
First, ban all petrol, diesel and gas-powered trucks, cars, boats, generators and aeroplanes from Canberra. That should remove emissions from their atmosphere, food from their supermarkets, and leave their roads free for pedestrians and bicycles. Idle airport runways would be ideal sites for solar panels and wind turbines.
Second, prohibit the importation of electricity generated by coal or gas – they can demonstrate how to survive on wind, solar, hydro, batteries and fire-wood. They should work at home using bees-wax candles on cloudy windless days.
Third, introduce a CCT (Canberra-carbon-tax) whereby all carbon dioxide emitted elsewhere in the production and transport of imported cement, steel, aluminium, bitumen, timber, vehicles, bicycles, solar panels, wind turbines, fire wood and food is charged to ACT end users.
If people flock into emissions-free Canberra we know that this is the way for Australia. But if there is a mass exodus, it will signal that the policy is a failure.
Let’s test the convictions of Canberrans.

No longer.
Australia used to have 11 oil refineries, spread around the country. There are just 4 left, all over fifty years old, and all in danger of closing down. Green barriers to oil exploration have forced most of them to rely on costly imported crude oil.
We buy our jet fuel from North Asia and have just 19 days supply of aviation fuel in the country. Australia’s diesel supplies sometimes fall to just 13 days of consumption.
Now, for the first time in at least 60 years Australia no longer produces motor vehicles.
China and India have about 430 coal power plants under construction but Australia has not built a single coal-fired power station for seven years – some politicians even rejoice when they manage to close and demolish one.
Brisbane’s new trains are being made in India, Victa mowers are made in China and most coastal shipping died decades ago. Steel works and refineries producing aluminium, copper and zinc are under stress. All these industries are being pushed overseas by costly unreliable electricity and other government barriers and burdens.
Red-green policies being pushed by all major parties are making Australia more dependent on bolted-down industries such as mining and farming that can’t be sent overseas because their basic resources are here. And green opposition to nuclear power increases Aussie reliance on coal.
A century ago Australians relied on wool, wheat, gold, silver, copper, lead-zinc, butter, beef and timber – all products of bolted-down industries.
Red-green policies are pushing us back to those days. Politicians need to remember Newton’s Law of Bureaucracy – whenever the government tries to use the force of law to achieve economic goals the long term results will be equal and opposite to those intended.
So in the long run, red-green energy and environmental policies will make us more dependent on the bolted-down industries they now attack – mining, farming, forestry and fishing.

Hon Keith DeLacy AM
As an inherently impressionable person I have been dealing with the coming apocalypse all my life. It started with the bible. The Book of Revelation in the New Testament vividly warned of impending doom, and many of the Hebrew prophets forecast the apocalypse.
Pope Sylvester II at the beginning of the millennium year 1000, predicted the Millennium Apocalypse, the end of the world. Riots occurred throughout Europe and pilgrims headed to Jerusalem seeking salvation.
And the Apocalypse was always associated with sin, it was deserved. “And these will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” (Matthew 25:40) If I had been thinking sinful thoughts, I trembled at night, dreaming of the fires of hell. There was no escape.
Thomas Malthus wrote an Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798 and became the preeminent father of doom. Unchecked population growth would lead to inevitable catastrophe – population growth was exponential while the growth in food supply was arithmetical.
We were impressionable kids, we grew up with Malthusiasm, waiting for doomsday. It was a compelling argument. Yet 200 years later, despite exponential population growth the world is so much wealthier and better fed. The Malthusian apocalypse was no better than Pope Sylvester’s.
Paul Erhlich became a cult figure in the 1970’s. Malthus’ inability to deliver on his population apocalypse proved no deterrence to Erhlich. He wrote The Population Bomb in 1968 forecasting that “sometime between 1970 and 85 the world will undergo vast famines, hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.”

Yet while he was prophesizing doom the green revolution (nothing to do with Bob Brown) was dramatically changing global food production. The number of people in acute poverty decreased from 40% of the population to just 10%. Calorie intake per person increased by one third.
He became the Father of misanthropy and alarmism. In a 1971 speech he said “If I were a gambler, I would take even money England will not exist in the year 2000.”
In fact he was a gambler. In a celebrated wager with Julian Simon he bet the average price of 10 commodities (selected by Ehrlich) would increase over the next 10 years. They reduced by 30%, rendering Ehrlich’s doomsday thesis a joke.
Ronald Bailey said Erhlich was “an irrepressible doomster who, as far as I can tell has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe” But he knew no shame. He is still around prognosticating doom, but is anybody listening?
The Club of Rome, a group of world leaders, celebratory scientists and industrialists met in Rome in 1972 and published The Limits to Growth, banging on about overpopulation and resource depletion. They said exponential use could exhaust known world supplies of zinc gold tin copper oil and natural gas by 1992 and cause a collapse in civilization in the subsequent century.
If only they were a bit right, a resource rich nation like Australia could get much better prices for our raw materials today – a resources boom that goes on forever! But they became a very influential group, and some of their scary solutions on curbing population and economic growth were enough to make one wake up in a cold sweat.
It was inevitable that the United Nations would jump on board, who could resist such an opportunity to save the world and soak in the virtue? In their Agenda 21 summit in Rio in 1990 they said “Humanity stands at a defining moment in history We are confronted with a perpetuation of disparities within and between nations, a worsening of poverty, ill-health and illiteracy, and a continued deterioration of the ecosystems on which we depend for our wellbeing.” Notwithstanding the fact that the following decade saw the sharpest decrease in poverty, hunger, ill health and illiteracy in human history.
It was around this time that I came to realize that there was a great dividend in alarmism, we seem to lap up darkness and reject the light. Good news is no news. The media megaphone is at the disposal of any activist who can forecast Armageddon. And the beauty is that the forecast doesn’t have to bear any relationship to reality. There is no comeuppance.
The last straw for me was Y2K – a calendar change at the turn of the millennium that spooked fears of the end of the world. I thought who could believe this nonsense? But the frenzy became overpowering. Time magazine staff set up a generator-powered “war room” in the basement of the Time/Life building in New York filled with computers and equipment ready to produce the magazine in the face of a catastrophic breakdown of electricity and communications.
2000 came and went without a whimper, apart from extinguishing billions of dollars world wide on the impossible scare. My impressionability was finally extinguished also.
The UN Agenda 21 inevitably morphed into the global warming scare.
Global warming? As a tropical boy who couldn’t stand the cold I had been terrified in the 1970’s at the prospect of an ice age. In 1975 Newsweek in an article “The cooling world” warned that the changes may portend a drastic decline in food production. Time magazine ran a front page story “The Big Freeze”. Professor Kenneth Watt, in his 1970 Earth Day speech warned “If present trends continue, the world will be eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”
Now Global Warming! Please forgive me but I have surrendered the faith.
Climate change, potentially the greatest potential apocalypse of them all – we were all going to fry and the cardinal sin was human emissions of CO2. The United Nations Environment Program predicted in 2005 that global warming would create 50 million climate refugees by 2010.
And they talk of consensus. Well I know one area where it has been overwhelming. 97% of IPCC climate models have grossly over exaggerated observed global temperatures over the last 25 years. The bloody climate just won’t obey the models.
The high priest of global warming, Al Gore, predicted in December 2008 that “the entire North Polar ice cap will be gone in five years”. Arctic sea ice area was 12.5 million sq kms in 2008 and, would you believe, 12.5 million sq kms in December 2013.
The ABC (Australia) reported in 2005 that our own worthy apostle Professor Tim Flannery, then Climate Change Commissioner, predicted that the ongoing drought could leave Sydney’s dams dry in just two years. The prediction missed by 2.5 billion litres. In fact more than 10 years later he is still out by 2.5 billion litres.
I could go on forever. Maybe one day one of these horsemen of the Apocalypse will reach the finishing post, but I won’t be backing it. I have a chronic case of Apocalypse Fatigue Syndrome.

TUMUT 1 HYDRO ELECTRIC POWER STATION.

There has been so much talk and false information about Hydro Electric Power Stations, pump storage and System battery storage that I felt it was time to put the facts straight.
Some of the most incorrect and misleading information is from self appoint university experts who have made all sorts of ridiculous statements. As well as from some politicians who either live in fairy land or are deliberately lying. You decide.
Do I know what I’m taking about; I was with the Electricity Commission of N.S.W. for 26 years in a number of positions including the commissioning and in charge of the Coal Fired Thermal Generators at Tallawarra, Wallerawang and Munmorah Power Stations.

As part of our job we supplied power for the Snowy when required and of course supplied and controlled the State power grid along with a number of other power stations.
Without doubt the Snowy Mountain Hydro Electric Scheme is the greatest project Australia has ever undertaken. A magnificent project that the governments of today would be incapable of matching. Why; because they lack the vision, the courage and the foresight to plan and create such a project.
The money that should be put into this type of project being wasted on almost useless Wind and Solar Farm subsidies. Then billions more to the U.N. in the name of ‘Global Warming’ which after nearly 40 years still does NOT have a shred of proof that our climate is affected by man.
The Snowy River has the greatest source of water in Australia and draws away a large proportion of the waters from the south-eastern New South Wales snowfields.
Prior to the ‘Snowy scheme’s’ construction nearly all the water from the  Snowy Mountains in the Australian Alps flowed down through mountainous and practically uninhabited country until discharging onto the river flats of East Gippsland, and a major proportion of its waters flowed wasted into the sea.
This was while the inland regions of NSW on the inland side if the Australian Alps desperately required water for irrigation.
After a great deal of planning the idea of the Snowy River Scheme was created and was considered and excellent means of employment for the new migrants coming from all over the World.
The primary intention was to turn the waters inland as well as maintain a flow to the Snowy River. The ability to generate hydro Electricity was a major bonus to the original plan.
The construction began in 1949 and was finally completed by 1974.
It consists of sixteen major dams; seven power stations; two pumping stations; and 225 kilometres (140 mi) of tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts. The Scheme was completed under the supervision of Chief Engineer, Sir William Hudson and is the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia.
The melting snow and rainfall flows into the Snowy River and some of its tributaries, much of which formerly flowed southeast onto the river flats of East Gippsland, and into Bass Strait of the Tasman sea, is captured at high elevations and diverted inland to the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers irrigation areas, through two major tunnel systems driven through the Continental Divide of the Snowy Mountains, known in Australia as the Great Dividing Range. The water falls 800 metres (2,600 ft) and travels through large hydro-electric power stations which generate power generally for peak-load for New South Wales EC of NSW two thirds, Victorian power one third and small amount for the ACT.

The added bonus of the Hydro electric generators is; They not only made it possible to supply cheap power for the states but also enabled a share the load of the spinning reserve of the power supply grid system.
Hydro Electric generators can be run up to full load in two minutes. No expansion problems, no fuel feed problems, just a quiet smooth run up to synchronise and then to full load if required.
Also the lower Hydro stations such as T3 can run three of their generators in reverse and (when available) pump the water back up to the higher levels. But this does not come free and requires 25% more power than they generate.
But this is offset by the improved efficiency of the Thermal coal fired power stations supplying the power.
The maximum thermal efficiency in a coal (or gas) fired power station is at full load due to maximum heat transfer in the boilers and minimum heat loss. As the units decrease in load so does the thermal efficiency.
The units at Munmorah power station For example; At full load of 350 MWs generate power at 10,000 b.t.u. per kilowatt. At 180 Megawatts that falls back as low as 14,000 B.T.U. per kilowatt.
When the units are doing load control and are down in load in the early mornings, due to reduced demand, this is the time power is supplied to the Snowy Hydro units to pump the water back up to higher level.
By increasing the unit load the efficiency is increased and that gain is offset against the 25% loss of pumping the water back up. This can reduce the overall loss to as low as 12% approx..
Pumped Hydro has always existed at the Snowy but it is ONLY available when the water is available and that is after the snow melt and any rainfall. By mid to late summer there is little to spare but depends on amount of snowfall and rain.
The primary purpose of the Snowy Scheme is to provide permanent water flow for irrigation inland to the Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers. Plus a few tributaries and the Snowy River on the eastern side.
The idea that pumped Hydro is some sort of new saviour is typical Green day dreaming. Where do they think the power comes from to do it: Thermal Power Stations.
Without them there is no power to drive the Hydro pump/generators. Also it is not the pumping water back up is the answer, it is sufficient water/snow falling on the Snowy mountains to be able to do it.
Increasing the storage capacity may make a slight improvement but knocking down the Thermal power Stations without building replacement new ones is insane to say the least.
I and many others in the power industry have said that knocking down Thermal Power Stations without replacement is absolute insanity. The mass destruction of these power stations, initiated and organised by the Green Communists, will be the downfall of our power industry and both sides of politics are too stupid to see it.
The grid system ALWAYS had a spinning reserve of 20% of load. This has now gone and the power supply companies have moved us much closer to blackouts and power failures that most certainly will be occurring in South Australia and probably Victoria.
The sale of the power industry to private enterprise is the worst thing that the previous governments could have done. It was almost an act of treason placing our total existence in the hands of the overseas moguls whose only interest is to extract as much money as possible and could NOT give a damn about reliability of power supply for Australia.
Worse is the Green Communists whose plan is to totally destroy the thermal power stations and put Australia on her knees.
Instead of wasting so many billions of dollars on unreliable and inconsistent Wind generators and solar farms the State and Federal governments could build the latest high efficiency, low emission power stations of say 4 x 660 Megawatts for two billion dollars each.
The idea of building battery storage is ludicrous. A thermal Generator say Bayswater’s 4 x 660 Megawatt generators supplies 63,360 Megawatt hours in 24 hours and add infinitum.
The battery bank storage in S.A., drawing power from the grid to charge the batteries, will supply less than 100 Megawatts for ONE HOUR. The supply After that nothing.
The suggested construction of battery storage by the Turnbull government is just as ridiculous with the same result. A TEASPOON of power for a VERY short time when they should be building ASAP new thermal power stations.
For not too much more cost you can have 633.6 times more power and add infinitum.
The Green Communists say coal is finished-that is why there is over 700 of them being built right now in India, China, USA, Europe and South America and many other places.
The People of Australia may start to listen when they are sitting in the dark with no power for their employment or business. Maybe then it might sink in that they have been lied to and deceived for years.
One tip I can give and that is for residents in the southern states to buy a 5 Kilowatt portable generator. There is every possibility you will need it.

Lights Out
For yonks they waged a war on coal
And painted miners black;
They threw explorers on the dole
And shut the gates outback.
The land was closed to oil and gas
And nukes were always banned;
While wind and sun got all the brass
And uglified the land.
Poles and turbines all in ranks
Sprouted on the hills;
The carbon credits pleased the banks
And households got the bills.
Then all the factories fled offshore
As puny power flickered;
More jobs were lost for evermore
As politicians dickered.
Then one still night the lights went out
And blackouts stalked the land;
The pollies quickly turned about
And Greens were spurned and banned.

Daring to Doubt by Tony Abbott:
Climate change is by no means the sole or even the most significant
symptom of the changing interests and values of the West. Still, only
societies with high levels of cultural amnesia could have made such a religion
out of it. Beware the pronouncement, “the science is settled”. It’s the spirit of
the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim
that “99 per cent of scientists believe” as if scientific truth is determined by
votes rather than facts.

Thanks to all of those who sent well-wishes on our moving adventure and downsizing of our lives. Some even sent contributions to the depleted Carbon Sense cause.
We are making progress on the shift. As an experienced shifter predicted, we have reached the “where did we put that” stage.
Next we will be saying – “why did we keep that stuff”.
But our office is now working and more Carbon Sense will flow again. Thanks for your support.

https://carbon-sense.com/2017/10/13/open-letter-to-the-prime-minister-of-australia/,,Open Letter to the Prime Minister of Australia,"OPEN LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER, AND TO THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION.
We are a group of retired scientists and engineers in Queensland, and we are alarmed at the direction our country is being taken through your respective policies, which are virtually identical, on renewable energy. Our names are listed here. We have studied this issue for years now, and we have here outlined the serious defects in your energy policy, and asked some questions which have thus far remained unanswered.
Energy Policy. By far the greatest risk to Australia’s electricity supply is the false belief that renewables (wind and solar) can be a like-for-like replacement for dispatchable fossil fuelled generators. They are not, and can never be. A one-MW wind or solar plant does not replace a one-MW coal plant. Not even close. Solar plants will produce electricity on average at 20% of their installed capacity. They produce power for little more than eight hours per day and none at all at night or on rainy days. Wind plants can be expected to produce electricity on average 25% to 30% of installed capacity, but output can be as little as 2% or as much as 70% with little warning.
Media reports in June this year referred to a “wind drought” across Southern Australia resulting in wind production being “40% below the previous corresponding period”. This is a problem but masks an even more intractable false belief; that an energy grid can run on averages. It can’t, because energy consumed has to be generated in real time. Just one example of that wind drought: at 2.20 PM on 5 th May this year, all the wind farms in Australia (4400 MW installed capacity in WA, SA, Vic, Tas and NSW) were producing just 121MW. (That’s 4400 MW capacity generating only 121MW). In fact for May and June this year this was not uncommon. Large high pressure systems over southern Australia meant little or no wind for weeks at a time.
The grid has to meet demand every minute of every day. AEMO can and does order fossil fuelled plants to produce electricity. Clearly it cannot do so for wind or solar. Just imagine Australia with a largely renewable energy system — it is night time so no solar power is being generated, and the whole of Southern Australia is dominated by high pressure systems (this is not unusual) and wind is producing at only 2% of installed capacity! To date dispatchable fossil fuelled generators have been able to shoulder the load but as dispatchable capacity is retired this may no longer be possible, with disastrous consequences.
On the face of it the answer is storage, either battery, pumped hydro or molten salt. This brings us to the next false belief; that storage is some sort of magic pudding. The capacity of current storage technologies is miniscule compared with daily demand. Australian grid demand varies between 18,000 MW minimum and 30,000 MW maximum. Over 24 hours this works out to about 600,000 MWh per day. The Tesla battery being installed in South Australia is said to be the world’s largest and to hold 129 MWh fully charged. This may be enough to support the local grid for a short time until dispatchable capacity can be started, but an unimaginable number of Tesla batteries would be necessary to maintain grid supply for a day or a week, or even longer in the worst case.

It is not clear what the capacity of the proposed Snowy II pumped hydro might be but similar limitations apply and there has to be enough surplus energy to pump the water in the first place.
A battery in the garage may be useful for a household but it must rely on the grid for the cloudy and rainy days. However household demand is only a minor part of total demand. In the 100% renewables future earnestly desired by many it is hard to imagine and impossible to calculate the amount of storage required to maintain supply during the inevitable periods of low wind and solar production. It is even harder to imagine ever being able to generate enough renewable energy to recharge these batteries and refill pumped storages as well as meet current demand.
These false beliefs must be addressed in any new policy on energy.
Questions. Since Australia started spending money on renewable energy, all successive governments have failed to hold any independent inquiry into the facts which should support this policy. This failure means that the majority of our citizens, who do not have the time to research the facts, are unaware of the real science. It also allows activist groups free rein to make unsubstantiated claims unchallenged. This would be a standard due diligence exercise in private industry, and would give you good justification to challenge “green” activists with facts.
Why has no independent inquiry ever been held?
We can find no evidence to support the assumption that the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere can influence the climate.
What hard evidence supports your policy?
Australia has spent many billions of dollars on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. At the same time you have enthusiastically endorsed coal exports, and new coal mines. Even our current coal exports wipe out any emissions saved many times over.
How do you explain the logic here? Do you not believe your own policy?
We know that hundreds of coal-fired power stations are now under construction around the world. Australia’s emissions of carbon dioxide already are inconsequential, and this will make them even less important.
Why are you continuing to promote renewable energy, to the detriment of Australian industry and consumers?
“Clean energy” is the latest euphemism in this debate. Carbon dioxide is an essential plant food through photosynthesis, and life on Earth could not exist without it. The latest information from the IPCC shows that the actual temperature increases are only a small fraction of those predicted by the climate models.
What is not “clean” about coal fired power generation?
As experienced engineers in a wide range of industries, we can show that your policies have failed the due diligence test, are not sound economically, and do not exhibit good engineering practice. The huge increase in power pricing, through the imposition of unnecessary technical restrictions on the power grids, and distorting of the market in favour of renewable energy, have the country now facing an economic emergency, which is entirely self-inflicted. What remains of Australia’s heavy industry requires low cost and reliable power, and is now under very serious threat.
How is this consistent with good engineering and good economics?
As engineers with considerable experience and skills in analysing problems, economic justification and project management, and who understand the problem, we ask that you answer the questions we have posed. If you are acting in Australia’s best interests you will cease this pointless, destructive and expensive flirtation with renewable energy, and hold a Royal Commission into the facts, to give credibility to future energy policy.

It is 7pm on a cold still night in the city which boasts “100% Green Energy”.
Thousands of electric cars are in their garages plugged into chargers; electric lights,
heaters and TVs are running; electric stoves are cooking dinner, electric trains and lifts
are moving late commuters and early revellers, and the pubs and clubs are busy.
The hills bristle with turbines, but there is no wind and not one is turning. Every roof is
covered with solar panels, but there is no sunshine and the panels are fast asleep. The
green city is facing peak electricity demand… on batteries.
But for several days, clouds have shaded the solar panels and there has been no wind
to turn the turbines – the battalions of batteries are running out of juice. One by one
they drop out. The street lights fade and the city goes dark.
In this green energy utopia all the wicked coal-powered generators have been closed
or demolished, exploration for gas is forbidden, no one dares to mention nuclear, hydro
schemes have gone (replaced by “Wild Rivers”), new hydro developments are stalled
by green lawyers, and diesel generators and petrol cars are banned.

This cartoon may be used with acknowledgement to www.carbon-sense.com
There is only one problem with this green perfection.
When the city wakes to another cloudy windless day, where will its electricity come
from?
And when all the stoves and fridges, computers and TV’s, lifts and trains, traffic lights
and water pumps, checkouts and ATM’s, heaters and coolers – – – all stop working,
there will soon be an angry mob seeking the nearest politician to punish.

A Personal Explanation
We received the note below recently, and there have been several others asking similar questions:
Hi Viv
Haven’t heard from you for a while.
I hope you have not resigned from the “Cause” out of disgust.
The man-made energy crisis is a disgrace and the political class worse.
If only we could delete all reference to emissions from the Black Board of Climate.
I still have a hope that Trump will do what he promised in election-speak.
Any chance you could be induced to consider a political role?
The money is unbelievably good.
Best Wishes
Howard

The Explanation: After 27 years at “Sherana” at Rosevale, Judy and I decided it was time to downsize. It is 9 months since that decisive decision, but at last we have almost achieved it. We went from 700 acres to 40 acres and sold all of our cattle, 70% of our sheep, had a huge clearing sale of machinery, tools, stock equipment, office furniture and assorted stuff. Prior to that we had to empty 16X4 drawer filing cabinets of a lifetime of work and political agitation as well as a hay shed full of boxes of files and paper. (I even found my letter of resignation from the Liberal Party in 1974. What I said to them then still applies now, only more so.) I threw out files on Workers Party, Progress Party, The Foundation for Economic Education, Tax Payers United, The Council of Resources and Energy, the Grasslands Protection Society, Common Sense and thousands of words in speeches, letters and articles. Also threw out a life- time of working files starting with my first job on the public payroll at the Geological Survey of Queensland to my last job as a non-executive director of Stanmore Coal Ltd. We now have no regular income apart from savings, but we do produce our own lamb, eggs, dairy products and citrus and will work on a garden.
The whole long arduous process felt like I was throwing our life away, but we could store it no longer. Yesterday I got my new office working at the new place, so now am preparing more “Carbon Sense”.
And, if our patient supporters return, we will continue the fight for Carbon Sense, Clexit, and sensible energy policies.

As Australian Engineer, Bob Brock, puts it clearly: “the solution to Australia’s growing energy crisis is blindingly simple:
1.  Defer until 2030 the implementation of the UN Climate Agreement.
2.  Cancel all Renewable Emissions Targets (RETs) and Clean Energy Targets (CETs).
3.  Cancel all Federal subsidies for Renewable Energy.
4.  Advocate 99.98% availability targets for all energy suppliers to ensure reliability of supply.
5.  Advocate building only traditional coal-fired power stations in the future for base load.
6.  Do not support the use of gas as a base-load fuel as it is more expensive than coal.
7.  Do not advocate High Efficiency Low Emission (HELE) power stations unless the economics justify their more expensive construction costs. The extra CO2 that conventional coal-fired power stations emit is neither dirty nor a pollutant – despite advice from the Green Coalition which dominates the Labor, Liberal and Green Parties.
8.  If, in the face of scientific evidence, you still want to believe that CO2 is a problem, commit to a concurrent long term plan for developing a Nuclear Industry.
If these policies were implemented, we would not need expensive interconnecting transmission lines, or the costly, parasitic Energy Marketing Operator (States would be responsible), or PM Turnbull’s energy recycling scheme, Snowy Mk 2.0.”

",['Finkel Report'],2017/07/14
https://carbon-sense.com/2017/07/13/climate-of-confusion/,,Climate of Confusion,"By Keith Orchison
By coincidence I have come across the new “Climate of the Nation” report from the strongly green-leaning Climate Institute on the same day I have been reading the latest Essential Report polling and just after looking at a pre-dawn snapshot of east coast market capacity on a pretty standard winter’s day.
Taking the latter first, at 6.30am today 97.6 per cent of the New South Wales load was being met by black coal generation as the State’s population was getting up and its substantial factory sector was gearing up. If you take NSW, Victoria and Queensland together – they represent 90 per cent of the east coast market – at this point 88.9 per cent of the three-State load was being met by brown and black coal generation with wind power providing 0.4 per cent and solar (naturally as the sun wasn’t yet up) 0.04 per cent.
(Eight hours later, I see, at 2.30pm, black coal generation is still bearing 89.7 per cent of NSW load and coal is accounting for almost 82 per cent of required capacity in the three largest States of the market – with hydro power providing 7.5 per cent and wind/solar 4.3 per cent.)
The question that comes to my mind when I look at data like this is what would be required to replace even half this coal power (let alone all of it) with mostly wind power and solar PVs? What would the total system cost be in a set-up where supply is assured and how would this translate in to retail bills?

Despite all the stuff being thrown around in the public arena at present, this is still a substantially unanswered question. Lots of people have opinions, assertions abound but we still lack an independent, widely-accepted-as-credible modeling effort communicated in language the Averages can understand – and this despite the South Australia nuclear royal commission report telling us 13 months ago that “identifying whether a particular generation portfolio will deliver electricity at the lowest possible cost requires an analysis of the future cost of the system as a whole.”
Indeed, one can read the Finkel report just released and see in it validation of the earlier royal commission declaration that “for those planning a future electricity system (and the market in which it will operate), the relevant issue is total systems cost, accounting for the cost of generation, connection, inter- and intra-regional expansion of transmission and distribution networks, and grid support costs.”
But, without this being available in straightforward terms, how can the community at large and the body politic in particular (especially the CoAG Energy Council and the Turnbull cabinet’s energy committee) come to a landing on a policy that will take us at least to 2030?
Modelling done for the Finkel task force, which inevitably is being challenged from left and right, tells us that its preferred approach (via a clean energy target, a topic already of furious political debate) would see a 2030 NEM generation mix that was 53 per cent coal-fired, five per cent reliant on gas, eight per cent on hydro power and 33 per cent on variable renewable generation (the other one per cent green power would be biomass).
Would this outcome satisfy the community as represented in the latest Essential Report poll (and which, of course, includes West Australian respondents and not just those living on the east coast, still less just those in the above-mentioned trio of States that are home to most consumers, household and residential and where most of the impact will fall)?
The Essential poll, taken 11 days after release of the Finkel report, sees 64 per cent of respondents supporting a preference for “more investment in renewable sources” (meaning what exactly?) – and, I can’t resist pointing out, 18 per cent saying “don’t know,” the same number “preferring coal-fired power.”
This poll also returns a preference, responding to the notion of a CET, by 41 per cent of respondents for a measure in which end-user price rises are limited to five per cent, falling to 21 per cent if the rise is 10 per cent and just eight per cent if it is 20 per cent.
Bear in mind in this context that the Finkel report doesn’t suggest prices will drop under what it recommends but that they will be lower than they are likely to be if we continuing muddling along.
Now the “Climate of the Nation” report runs to 48 pages and you really need to read it all to get a picture of what it conveys – you can find it at www.climateinstitute.org.au.
Of course, the interesting (to me) information is well-padded with pejorative promotion of acceptance of climate change but this is only to be expected – green advocates are permanently in a fret that, as is acknowledged in the report, the climate issue is not top of mind for a community plagued by “hip pocket” problems. This bent shouldn’t detract from the value of learning what views about today’s policy game flow from such polling and from focus groups because this is the sort of feedback through their own party research that is influencing our political leaders.
What the Climate Institute asserts is that 96 per cent of Australians “want our primary source of energy” – they are talking about electric power and that’s just 35 per cent of energy used in this country – to come from renewables. What this actually means, we are then told, is that 58 per cent of respondents want their power based on renewables supported by storage and 38 per cent want renewables “supported by fossil fuels.”
The soundbite the institute wants to sell us is that “the public almost universally endorses transitioning our energy system to renewables.” Why do peas and thimbles spring to my mind when I see stuff presented in this way?
The institute goes on to explain in the report text: concern that (an energy system dominated by renewables) “should be properly managed to minimize disruption” lies behind the 38 per cent believing fossil fuels should have a role “in the meantime.”
Which makes me wonder how the respondents and the broad community would react to explanations in plain language from a credible source about the realistic power supply options the east coast has for the foreseeable period from now to around 2030?
By the way, I am interested to see buried in this report that nine per cent of those canvassed think nuclear energy should be Australia’s main source of power. The boosters of nukes among my friends and acquaintances believe this number is higher and would be much more if the legal anathema of the technology was removed and it could be discussed on its merits.
Be that as it may, what remains lacking as the Turnbull government, then CoAG leaders and, sooner or later, the federal parliament grapple with next steps in energy and climate policy – I see the Grattan Institute’s Tony Wood reminding us in an op-ed today that secure and reliable power at affordable prices can’t happen without a credible, national climate change approach – is a community understanding of realistic electricity supply options presented in a form they can actually comprehend.
Until this happens, community perceptions will remain shrouded in a fog of confusion. There is no prospect I can see, under present circumstances, of it lifting any time soon.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Scorching temperatures. Melting ice caps. Killer hurricanes and tornadoes. Disappearing polar bears. The end of civilization as we know it!
Are emissions from our cars, factories, and farms causing catastrophic climate change? Is there a genuine scientific consensus? Or is man-made “global warming” an overheated environmental myth being used to push for drastic government control and a radical “Green” energy agenda?
This film, hosted by award-winning journalist Marc Morano of CFACT’s ClimateDepot.com, features interviews and comments from no fewer than 30 renowned and well-regarded scientists and experts.

These include a number of individuals who were former global warming believers or came from the political Left but were compelled to speak out after re-examining the evidence or watching the debate about global warming degenerate into absurd political demagoguery.
These are people like:
Dr. Judith Curry, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology
Ivy League geologist Dr. Robert Giegengack of the University of Pennsylvania
Former Greenpeace co-founder and ecologist Patrick Moore
UN IPCC lead author and economist Dr. Richard Tol of the Netherlands
and the late Dr. Bob Carter of James Cook University.
Viewers of Climate Hustle will get an informative and entertaining look at the media hype stoking the climate fires, along with the science refuting the outlandish claims of activists and alarmists who want to blame every strange weather event – and bizarre societal evil – on man-made global warming.

This US Clexit follows the first step taken in 2010 when the canny Japanese refused to extend the Kyoto Protocol. And then Tony Abbott killed off Australia’s Carbon Tax.

Re: Withdrawal from the 2015 UN Climate Change Agreement.
I write to you as an LNP Member. The announcement that President Trump will withdraw from the 2015 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is wonderful news because it shows that in the face of huge vested interests he has had the courage to challenge the hoax that the minute traces of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are causing disastrous Climate Change.
Australia should also withdraw.
The objectives of the UN’s Climate Change Policies have never been about Climate.

Destroy Industrialisation. The first objective was to destroy the world’s industrialisation as advocated by Maurice Strong, Chairman of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. The Greens are well on the way to achieving this in South Australia and Victoria.
Follow the Money Trail. The second objective was a means for a Global Transfer of Wealth. Ottman Edenhofer, a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in 2010, “But one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy … One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy.” Under the terms of the Climate Change Policy, the UN is seeking US$100 billion per year from Developed Countries for a Green Climate Fund to “help developing countries fight climate change”. In 2015, there were some 136 Developing Countries listed and only 51 Developed Countries so the affirmative vote for the UN’s Climate Policy was a foregone conclusion.

Many advocates of the Climate Policies have been wilfully opportunistic and avaricious,Skin problems but many have believed in it because they have not understood the essential and benign role of CO2 in Nature.
President Trump, a major figure on the world political stage, has now had the courage to call the bluff of the Leftist Green Warmists who claim that CO2 is harmful.
I would suggest that you join with other Conservative Politicians to strongly urge the Prime Minister to cancel all Renewable Energy Targets and Subsidies.
If our Government fails to do this, we will not only be politically out of step with the USA, we will be condemned to a future of expensive and unreliable electricity, higher costs of living, diminished living standards and an exodus of industries to countries with cheaper power.

and your turbines on the hills;
You can use the warmth of sunshine
to reduce your heating bills.
You can dream you’re self-sufficient
as you weed your vegie bed;
As long as you make sure to keep
A diesel in the shed.
When I was a kid on a dairy farm in Queensland, we relied on green energy – horses and human muscles provided motive power; fire-wood and beeswax candles supplied heat and light; windmills pumped water and the sun provided solar energy for growing crops, vegies and pastures.Railway Jobs 2017 There were no refrigerators – things were kept cool by evaporation of water in a Coolgardi safe. Cold water for drinks came from a water bag hanging in the shade near the back steps. We had no hot water systems – we bathed one after another in warm water heated in a kettle on the wood stove. The only “non-green” energy used was a bit of kerosene for the kitchen lamp, and petrol for a small Ford utility. We were almost “sustainable” but there was little surplus for others. Labour was cheap and food was expensive.bluestacks for windows 10
Our life changed dramatically when we put a thumping diesel in the dairy shed. This single-cylinder engine drove the milking machines and an electricity generator which charged 16 lead-acid 2 volt batteries sitting on the veranda. This 32 volt DC system powered a modern marvel – bright light, at any time, in every room, at the touch of a switch. This system could also power Mum’s new electric clothes iron as long as someone started the engine for a bit more power.
There were no electric self-starters for diesels in those days – just a heavy crank handle. Here is the exact model which saved us from a life of dairy drudgery, kerosene lights and Mother Potts irons:
See and listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itxY98A8wHQ
But all that effort, noise and fumes were superseded when every house and dairy got connected to clean silent “coal power by wire”, and coal was used to produce coke for the new slow-combustion stoves. Suddenly the trusty “Southern Cross” diesel engines disappeared from Australian sheds and dairies, AGA coke-burning cookers displaced the old smoky wood-burning stoves in the kitchen, and clean-burning coal gas replaced wood stoves and dirty open fires in the cities.

In just one life-time, human muscles, draft horses, wood, candles and kerosene were replaced by diesel, which was then replaced by coal via coal-gas, coke, and clean silent ever-ready electricity.
Today, after Aussies have enjoyed decades of abundant reliable cheap electricity from black coal, brown coal and hydro, green energy gambling has taken Australia back to the era which had to keep a diesel in the shed.
Tasmania is the greenest state in Australia. It once had a vibrant economy that created mines, saw-mills, farms, orchards, oil and metal refineries, dams, hydro-power and railways. It is now a green no-go land. Greens have stopped new hydro developments, opposed mining, crippled the timber industry, prevented new wood-chip developments and will probably celebrate when their last refinery closes.
Tasmanians get their electricity mainly from hydro assets created long ago by their more productive ancestors. But recently, a long drought caused a shortage of Tasmanian hydro-energy – they became reliant for up to 40% of their electricity needs on the Bass-Link undersea cable bringing electricity from reliable coal-fired stations in Victoria and NSW. However the overloaded Bass-Link cable failed, and an old gas-powered station was brought back into service (importing gas from Victoria) to keep the lights on. Subsequently their politicians hurriedly put 150 diesel generators in their shed (costing A$11 million per month).
See: Tasmania’s Bass Link cable fails. Gas imports boom:

South Australia is the next greenest state in Australia, hosting about 35% of Australia’s wind turbines. These were force-fed into existence by mandatory green energy targets and tax benefits. In a burst of green destruction they also closed their gas-fired power stations and demolished their coal-fired station. However wind power failed recently and a storm tore down their life-line bringing reliable coal power from Victoria. Now Premier Weatherill is planning to install up to 200 megawatts of diesel generators in his shed. Many residents are following his lead.

The UK has been badly infected by the green energy virus. Engineers warned that this intermittent and unpredictable supply had increased the risk of blackouts, so the UK government offered subsidies for emergency backup power. This subsidy, plus consumer concerns, put so many diesels in British sheds that they now provide a major backup capacity for UK electricity.

Many Spaniards found a diesel in the shed was very profitable. Their government had been drinking green-ale and offered attractive subsidies for solar power produced.
The subsidy was very successful – so successful that someone eventually noticed that some suppliers were even producing “solar” power at night. It was coming from diesels in their sheds.

Finally, our green media likes to feature some green energy enthusiast who is “off the grid”. But it usually emerges later in the show that there is a diesel in their shed too.
Those who remember the days of relying on a noisy smelly diesel in the shed and a smoky wood stove in the kitchen have no wish to be dragged back there by green zealots.

Every day some green energy promoter or a battery salesman tells us how green energy with battery backup will supply Australia’s future electricity needs.
A battery stores energy. Energy can be stored using lead-acid, nickel/cadmium, lithium, molten salt, pumped hydro, hydrogen, flywheels, compressed air or some other smart gizmo. But NOT ONE battery produces new energy – they simply store and discharge energy produced by other means.OnePlus 5 specs They all deliver less energy than they consume. Moreover, to manufacture, charge, use and dispose of batteries consumes energy and resources.
The idea of producing reliable grid power from intermittent green energy backed up by batteries looks possible in green doodle-diagrams, but would be absurdly inefficient and expensive.
Solar works a Six hour day
Consider a solar panel which is rated to collect say 100 units of energy per day at full capacity, in full mid-day sunlight, with a clean panel, properly aligned to face the sun.
No solar energy arrives overnight and only minimal amounts arrive during the three hours after dawn or before dusk. That means that significant solar energy can only be collected for about 6 hours per day, providing it is not cloudy, raining or snowing. No amount of research or regulation will change this – the solar energy union only works a six-hour day and takes quite a few sickies. So instead of feeding 100 units of energy per day into the grid, at best, the panel supplies just 25 units.
Can the addition of batteries give us 24/7 power from solar?
To deliver 100 units of energy in 24 hours will require an extra 75 units of energy to be collected, stored and delivered by the batteries every sunny day. This will require another three solar units devoted solely to re-charging batteries in just 6 sunny hours.
Cloudy/wet days are what really expose the problems of solar plus batteries. (This is why isolated green power systems must have a diesel generator in the shed.)
To insure against, say, 7 days of cloudy weather would require a solar/battery system capable of collecting and storing 700 units of energy while still delivering 100 units to consumers every day. However if several consecutive weeks of sunny weather then occur, this bloated system is capable of delivering 7 times more power than needed, causing power prices to plunge, driving reliable generators out of business and wasting the life of solar panels producing unwanted electricity. 192.168.l.254
Solar energy obviously does best in sunny equatorial deserts, but that is not where most people live. And the huge Desertec Solar Power Dream for the northern Sahara has failed.
The report card on wind energy is different, but equally depressing.
When Australia had reliable, predictable coal-gas-hydro power in every state, the need for heavy interstate transmission was minimal. But green power will require robust and costly interstate transmission facilities to send large amounts of power at short notice from sunny coal-rich Queensland to cloudy Victoria, windless South Australia or droughted Tasmania.

https://carbon-sense.com/2017/03/19/the-social-cost-of-carbon-regulations/,,The Social Cost of Carbon Regulations,"Anti-fossil fuel SCC (Social Cost of Carbon) relies on garbage models, ignores carbon benefits and hurts the poor. 
By Paul Driessen and Roger Bezdek 
“If you could pick just one thing to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy,” Bill Gates has said. “Access to energy is absolutely fundamental in the struggle against poverty,” World Bank VP Rachel Kyte and Nobel Prize Laureate Dr. Amartya Sen agree.
The UN Development Program also calls energy “central to poverty reduction.” And International Energy Agency Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol notes that “coal is raising living standards and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.” In fact, all fossil fuels are doing so.
Indeed, fossil fuels created the modern world and the housing, transportation, other technologies and living standards so many of us take for granted. They are essential for electricity and life, and over the past 250 years they more than doubled average life expectancy in countries that took advantage of them.
But the Obama Administration and radical environmentalists despise fossil fuels and used every tactic they could devise to eliminate them. One of their most important schemes was the “social cost of carbon.”

Federal agencies used the SCC to calculate the “hidden costs” of carbon dioxide emissions associated with fossil fuel use, by assigning a dollar value to every ton of CO2 emitted by power plants, factories, homes, vehicles and other sources. However, the entire process was little more than junk science and Garbage In-Garbage Out forecasting. 
First, each ton of U.S. emissions averted would initially have prevented a hypothetical $25/ton in global societal costs allegedly resulting from dangerous man-made climate change: less coastal flooding and tropical disease, fewer droughts and extreme weather events, for example. But within three years regulators arbitrarily increased the SCC to around $40/ton.
That made it easier to justify the Clean Power Plan, Paris climate agreement, and countless Obama Era actions on electricity generation, fracking, methane, pipelines, vehicle mileage and appliance efficiency standards, livestock operations, carbon taxes, and wind, solar and biofuel mandates and subsidies. 
Second, the supposed bedrock for the concept is the now rapidly shifting sands of climate chaos theory. New questions are arising almost daily about data quality and manipulation, the degree to which carbon dioxide affects global temperatures, the complex interplay of solar, cosmic ray, oceanic and other natural forces, and the inability of computer models to predict temperatures, sea level rise or hurricanes. 
Meanwhile, as the 2015-16 El Nino dissipated, average global temperatures rapidly fell back almost to their 1998-2014 level, according to Britain’s Met Office and other experts. That means there has been no measurable planetary warming for 18 years. Nor are other predicted disasters happening in the real world. 
That means the very notion that U.S. emissions impose major climate costs is increasingly indefensible. Moreover, developing nations are burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide at many times the U.S. rate; that means even eliminating their use in America would have no effect on atmospheric CO2 levels. 
Third, the SCC scheme blames American emissions for supposed costs worldwide (even though U.S. CO2 emissions are declining each year). It incorporates almost every conceivable cost of oil, gas and coal use on crops, forests, coastal cities, property damage, “forced migration,” and human health, nutrition and disease. However, it utterly fails to mention, much less analyze, tremendous and obvious carbon benefits.
That violates a 1993 Bill Clinton executive order requiring that federal agencies assess both benefits and costs of proposed regulations. It is also irrational, and completely contrary to human experience. 
Fossil fuels created the modern world and lifted billions out of destitution and disease. They supply over 80% of the energy that powers United States and other modern civilizations; they will continue doing so for decades to come. They generate up to $70 trillion in annual global GDP. 
Using readily available data on global living standards, economies, disease, nutrition, life spans and other benefits – and the government’s own SCC cost figures and methodologies – we estimate that carbon benefits exceed costs by orders of magnitude: at least 50 to 1 and as much as 500 to 1! 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that fossil fuels will provide 75-80% of worldwide energy through 2040 – when the total amount of energy consumed will be at least 25% greater than today. That means these notable benefit-cost ratios will continue. The Obama Era SCC ignores all of this, too. 
Fourth, SCC schemes likewise impute only costs to carbon dioxide emissions. However, as thousands of scientific studies verify, rising levels of this miracle molecule are “greening” the Earth – reducing deserts, and improving forests, grasslands, drought resistance, crop yields and human nutrition. No matter which government report or discount rate is used, asserted social costs of more CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere are infinitesimal compared to its estimated benefits.
Fifth, government officials claim they can accurately forecast damages to the world’s climate, economies, civilizations, populations and ecosystems from U.S. carbon dioxide emissions over the next three centuries. They say we must base today’s energy policies, laws and regulations on those forecasts. 
The notion is delusional and dangerous. The rate of change in energy generation and other technologies has become exponential over the past several decades, with forecasting ability declining at an equal rate. Uncertainties over man and nature-driven climate changes during the next 300 years are equally colossal. Combining all the SCC assumptions, methodologies, fabrications and omissions, and injecting its absurd predictions into high-speed computer models, just means bogus forecasts are generated more quickly. 
Finally, the most fundamental issue isn’t even the social cost of carbon. It is the costs inflicted on society by anti-carbon regulations. Those rules replace fossil fuel revenues with renewable energy subsidies; reliable, affordable electricity with unreliable power that costs two to three times as much; and mines, drill holes, cropland and wildlife habitats with tens of millions of acres of wind, solar and biofuel “farms.” 
Anti-carbon rules are designed to drive energy de-carbonization and modern nation de-industrialization. Perhaps worst, their impacts fall hardest on poor, minority and blue-collar families. Those families spend proportionately three to ten times more of their incomes on energy than families earning $50,000 to $250,000 a year. They have little discretionary income and face the greatest risk of having their electricity cut off – as happened to 330,000 families during 2015 in ultra-green Germany. Worldwide, billions of people still do not have electricity – and the SCC would keep them deprived of its benefits. 
Bureaucrats, activists, scientists and corporate rent-seekers certainly welcome the SCC mumbo-jumbo. They have profited the most from the countless billions that Obama regulatory agencies lavished on them every year, and from the tens of billions that Mr. Obama stashed in dozens of agencies, programs and crannies throughout the government, so they couldn’t easily be found or cut. 
Above all, they would profit massively from the $93 trillion that the Financial Stability Board’s climate task force says the world must spend in low-carbon infrastructure programs over the next 15 years, as part of the Obama-UN-FSB-Climate Crisis, Inc. plan to de-carbonize and de-industrialize the planet.
Taxpayers, consumers and families would be hammered if the Climate Cabal got even more power over energy policies, economic growth, livelihoods and living standards. Thankfully, eliminating the social cost of carbon and programs implemented under it requires little more than applying the same rules and standards that government regulators have imposed on Volkswagen, Fiat and Wall Street dishonesty. 
That is why the Trump Administration is challenging the SCC, climate cataclysm deception, and the bloated EPA budget behind so much of it. It’s why the House Science Committee’s Environment and Oversight Subcommittees held a hearing on the SCC, and why we and other experts will eviscerate it during the upcoming Heartland Institute 12th International Climate Conference in Washington, DC.
It’s time to rescind and defund the SCC – and replace it with honest, objective cost-benefit analyses.

The fifth and latest IPCC assessment report, published in 2013, showed that climate models failed to predict the absence of warming from 1998 and 2012, and that climate scientists have no clear idea of why they failed. (NB. I have added the bolding in the following extracts.)

“… the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05 [–0.05 to 0.15] °C per decade) … is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] °C per decade).” [WG I SPM, page 5, section B.1, bullet point 3, and in full Synthesis Report on page SYR-6]
“… an analysis of the full suite of CMIP5 historical simulations (…) reveals that 111 out of 114 realisations show a GMST trend over 1998–2012 that is higher than the entire HadCRUT4 trend ensemble ….” [WGI contribution, chapter 9, text box 9.2, page 769, and in full Synthesis Report on page SYR-8]
“There may also be a contribution from forcing inadequacies and, in some models, an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing (dominated by the effects of aerosols).” [WG I SPM, section D.1, page 15, bullet point 2, and full Synthesis Report on page SYR-8]
“This difference between simulated [i.e. model output] and observed trends could be caused by some combination of (a) internal climate variability, (b) missing or incorrect radiative forcing and (c) model response error“. [WGI contribution, chapter 9, text box 9.2, page 769]

IN MY SIMPLER WORDS …
1 – According to statistical practices the trend in temperature from 1998 to 2012 (the 15 years prior to the report being drafted) falls somewhere between slight warming and slight cooling. In other words there is no certainty that any warming occurred.
2 – Despite claims of the accuracy of climate models most of the model runs (97%) wrongly predicted warming from 1998 to 2012.
3 – The IPCC is admitting that “some models” – we are not told how many, so maybe it’s almost all – exaggerate the influence of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
4 – The models could be wrong for a number of very basic and general reasons; the IPCC really doesn’t know why the models failed.

https://carbon-sense.com/2017/01/22/no-time-for-resting/,,No Time for Resting,"Napoleon’s Grand Army was defeated in the Battle of the Nations in 1813. The Emperor abdicated and was banished to Elba. But his army was not disarmed and destroyed by the victors – they rested.
Just 2 years later, Napoleon escaped and quickly re-mobilised his army. Only Wellington blocked his path to Brussels, at Waterloo.
After a fierce day of battle, a weary line of redcoats still held the ridge at Waterloo. But Napoleon’s Old Guard had been held in reserve for this decisive moment. Advancing like a spear, three columns wide, “The Invincibles” aimed to pierce the middle of the thin red line.
But a miracle occurred. Withering fire on both sides of the spear from the thin red line sapped their strength – Napoleon’s “Invincible” Old Guard broke and ran.
This was the critical point of that battle (and for the Climate War now). It is at the moment of defeat, with the enemy disorganised and demoralised, that the greatest gains can be made. Too often, however, the weary victors waste this opportunity to pursue and destroy the enemy.
Wellington’s exhausted army was incapable of pursuit, but a miracle occurred – General Blucher arrived at sundown with fresh Prussian troops. The avenging German lancers pursued, captured, disarmed and slaughtered the fleeing French all the way back to Paris. They captured Napoleon. Never again did the Grand Army threaten Europe.
In the global Climate Wars, Trump and Brexit have given us a victory of Waterloo dimensions. But this will be only a temporary setback for the Green Globalists unless they are now ruthlessly disarmed and de-funded. If we rest and relax, we will soon be ground under their green sandals again.
We must immediately deny them funds, tax shelters, manpower and legal support.
Not a cent more for climate conferences – send just one representative whose only power is to “vote no to everything”. Rescind or ignore past climate “agreements”, defund all UN/IPCC activities, remove all green energy subsidies and mandates and halve government funding of the ABC, BBC and all other GreenBC’s.
Subtract all “climate aid” from foreign aid budgets, divert all climate research funding to weather-proofing infrastructure, and replace green propaganda with hard science in education agendas.
Starved of public funding and propaganda, and with constant fire at their flanks with bullets of truth, the “invincible” green army will soon falter and run.
Chase them all the way back to Paris. Give them no rest until their infamous Grab for Global Power called the Paris Climate Treaty is rejected, never to rise again.

Many on the alarmist side of the climate debate seem to struggle to find rational arguments or evidence to support their cause so they usually resort to character assassination or defamation. A common attack on me is “Viv Forbes is just a coal industry stooge.”
This was put to the test recently at the year’s biggest Mining Industry function – the Queensland Resources Council Annual Forum and Lunch. The delegates on stage at the forum included very senior managers from BHP Billiton, Shell, Anglo-American, Peabody and Glencore. The audience was invited to ask questions.
I asked why people who employed many competent geologists, physicists and chemists never questioned the science behind the global warming scare.

Indeed, there was an awkward silence before the group, including top guns from Glencore and Shell, quickly moved on.

https://carbon-sense.com/2016/12/17/mines-love-greens/,,Why Big Mining Loves Big Green,"The Labor/Green coalition in Australia has declared war on coal, oil and gas and industries that use them. So why is Big Mining not fighting back?
BHP Billiton is a big producer of coal, oil, gas, iron ore, copper, nickel and uranium. Rio Tinto is a big producer of uranium, coal, iron ore, copper and aluminium. Glencore is a big producer of coal, copper, zinc and nickel. And Shell is big in oil, gas and bitumen, manufactures biofuels, and generates peak power with natural gas.
These companies employ competent geologists, physicists and chemists who could tell them that CO2 is not a pollutant, that it is not the primary driver of climate and that climate has been changing since time began. They must know there is no scientific justification for the green war on hydro-carbon fuels – but none of these big miners speak out against this baseless war on their products. UC Browser for Windows Some even waste shareholder funds producing glossy brochures promoting the green agenda – the BHP Billiton document “Climate Change: Portfolio Analysis” reads like it was produced by the Greens.
Big Mining is not that dumb. Their climate “concern” is more motivated by self-interest – they see long-term profits flowing from the silly green agenda. They are also political cowards wanting be loved by guilt-stricken billionaires, business haters from Hollywood and the green mob controlling the ABC/BBC.
Wind and solar power are indeed “free”, but to extract electricity from them is not free – it needs turbines and solar panels, generators and transformers, transmission towers and power lines – all of which boosts demand for metals like steel, copper, zinc, nickel and rare earths.
Moreover, wind and solar are very diffuse power sources and need large areas of land together with webs of access roads and power lines in order to collect significant power. The heavy machinery needed for construction, maintenance and replacements in these green power networks provide ongoing demands for petroleum and mining products. Before one watt of green electricity is generated for consumers, green power has boosted demand for most products of Big Mining.

Green power also needs back-up power ready to swing into action immediately the wind drops (or blows a gale) or clouds, fog, snow, rain, dust or night-time obscure the sun. This is great news for reliable energy suppliers capable of rapid backup, which usually means gas. Happy New Year 2018 Quotes So Big Gas loves Big Green – it is secretly delighted by the war on coal and the force-feeding of Green energy, as this will cause a boom in gas demand. Lead, nickel, cadmium and lithium miners are also delighted with the soaring demand for energy-storing batteries.

Intermittent energy producers like wind and solar also cause destructive fluctuations in electricity supply and prices – prices can fall to zero on a sunny, windy afternoon, but soar during still, sunless periods. Coal power stations cannot adjust quickly to this destructive variability in electricity demand and prices and will be sent broke, thus providing even more markets for gas.
Big Gas is thus delighted to secretly support the war on coal as it will do wonders for the demand for gas; but they fail to understand that once Greens have destroyed coal power, they will then turn their green guns onto gas.
Uranium producers love the greens. They know that if coal and gas are banned from power generation, and all hydro-power sites are “world-heritage protected”, all that is left to stabilise the electricity grids of modern society is nuclear power.
Even coal producers see short-term benefits in supporting inane green ideas like carbon capture and burial. This would greatly increase the amount of coal needed to generate the electricity consumed to collect, separate, compress, transport and bury exhaust gases as well as to refine and fabricate all the metals needed for gas collectors, compressors and pipelines. Even more silly is the academic dream to burn coal using oxygen, not air, for combustion to reduce the huge quantity of exhaust gases to be handled (mainly by removing nitrogen). This will consume even more energy and metals. Long term, the main beneficiaries of this industrial silliness will be nuclear power and uranium miners like Rio and BHP.
So Big Mining can extract benefits from green energy while earning political credits. And their PC executives can polish their green credentials in their posh suburban circles by supporting the silliness.
On the debit side are the usual victims – taxpayers and consumers of coal, oil, gas, electricity and metals; and employees and shareholders of industries being forced to close or emigrate because of expensive and unreliable electricity.

Dear Prime Minister
The Paris Climate Agreement.

You ratified the Paris Climate Agreement on Thursday 10 November 2016 without discussion with the Australian people and without revealing the implications or the cost.
You did this despite protests from Liberal and LNP Branches in NSW and Queensland.

The Cap and Trade Emissions Trading Scheme.

Mr Abbott handsomely won the 2013 election by committing to revoke Labor’s Carbon Tax.
We didn’t know then that Mr Abbott had apparently made an unpublicised deal with Greg Hunt to support a Cap and Trade Emissions Trading Scheme.CamScanner for PC
You broke faith with the Australian people by usurping Mr Abbot as leader in September.
Then, on the last sitting day of Parliament in December 2015, you enacted Greg Hunt’s bill, supported by Labor and the Greens, for “The Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard”.
This bill was in effect a Cap and Trade Emissions Trading Scheme, not dissimilar to Ms Gillard’s Clean Energy Act 2011 which the people had previously rejected.
We only learned of it when we read Alan Kohler’s article in The Australian on May 23, 2016.

Renewable Energy.

Australia has an ambitious and scientifically unjustifiable target to reduce CO2 emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
Subsidies for Renewable Energy are currently running at over $2.8bn a year.
Estimates of the total cost to Australia of renewable energy are up to $60bn.
There is a worldwide commercial failure of renewable energy projects,
There are no foreseeable prospects of affordable bulk energy storage technology,
There is a TOTAL lack of any scientific evidence justifying the closure of thermal power stations because of their CO2 emissions in favour of renewable energy plants,
It is essential that we have the lowest cost electrical energy technically available, and
Mr Trump and the Republicans have said they will wind back President Obama’s Climate Change policies. When they do, you and your policies will be left politically high and dry.

You have not been practicing Open Government Prime Minister, so now please tell us:
1. Why are you ratifying unexplained secretive Climate Change Agreements with the UN?
2. Why did you introduce a Cap and Trade ETS contrary to public expectations?
3. Why are you supporting costly and unreliable renewable energy?
4. What is the cost to Australia of these Climate Change Agreements?
This week’s Newspoll and Mr Trump’s Presidential victory are clear warnings that if you don’t start acting like the leader of a true Right-of-Centre Political Party, we will all have three years of a Labor Government and you will be yet another failed Australian Prime Minister.
Yours faithfully,

For years now CSIRO and their UN/IPCC puppet-masters have claimed that “climate science is settled”. Tinder PC If so, why are Australian governments still wasting some $150M annually on creating climate scares and producing propaganda for a political war on carbon energy and carbon dioxide?
Australia should cease all government funding for global warming “research” and carbon-centric climate models and leave the honest, useful and difficult business of weather forecasting to the BOM, which should revert to its once-proud name and role as “The Weather Bureau”.
The neurotic focus of Australian politicians and their research puppets on the UN man-made global warming agenda has starved useful research into real factors that do affect global climate. These include cycles and oscillations in solar activity, cosmic rays and clouds, crustal and magmatic movements, volcanic eruptions, and the periodic changes in planetary orbits and axial tilts within the solar system.
Australia is an island surrounded by the vast oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. But CSIRO is mesmerised by atmospheric greenhouse mirages and largely ignores the causes and timing of ENSO oscillations, the amount and locations of submarine volcanism, and the timing, drivers and locations of deep ocean currents and upwellings.
If CSIRO and the government Universities cannot do such basic research in our region their funds should be diverted to the deficit, or applied to weather-proofing our infrastructure.

Grasslands and arable land cover just 10% of Earth’s surface but (with the oceans) they produce all of our food and fibre. But the productivity and health of our grasslands, farms and livestock are under threat from global warming alarmists and green preservationists.
We are afflicted by climate crazies and methane madness. It is poor public policy that condones restrictions on grazing operations, or taxes on grazing animals, based on disputed theories that claim that bodily emissions from farm animals will cause dangerous global warming.
New Zealand was the first cattle country to propose a “livestock fart tax”. Four hundred farmers then drove 20 tractors to the Parliament in Wellington waving placards and banners saying “STOP THE FART TAX”. The proposal was laughed out of Parliament. But the war on farmers and livestock continues.

Ruminants such as sheep, cattle and goats cannot make long-term additions to the gases in the atmosphere – they just recycle atmospheric carbon and nitrogen nutrients in a cycle-of-life that has operated for millennia.
Grazing ruminant animals with their emission products have always been part of healthy grasslands. Only when large numbers of animals are fed artificially and confined on the one patch of land do pollution problems appear.
Many otherwise genuine environmentalists are assisting the destruction of grasslands with their native pastures and endangered grass birds. Blinded by their love for the trees, they neglect the grasses, legumes, herbs and livestock that provide their food. In Australia they pass laws to protect weedy eucalypts invading the grasslands but ignore the valuable and declining Mitchell grass that once dominated Australia’s treeless plains.
Grasslands are also under threat from cultivation for biofuel crops, from subsidised carbon credit forests and from the remorseless encroachment of fire-prone government reserves and pest havens.
Trying to control atmospheric carbon-bearing gases with taxes is futile and anti-life. Even if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere doubled, or more, the climate effect if any, is probably beneficial (warmer at night and near the poles and with more moisture in the atmosphere). More importantly, all life on Earth already benefits from the additional CO2 plant nutrient in the atmosphere, and would benefit even more were CO2 levels to double.
Nitrogen is the most abundant natural gas in the atmosphere, inhaled in every breath and an essential component of all protein. Grazing livestock merely recycle a few compounds of nitrogen, all of which either return to the atmosphere or provide valuable nitrogen fertilisers for the plants they graze on.
We also have the modern methane madness. Mobs of grazing ruminants have been roaming the grasslands since cave-man days. Methane has also been seeping from marshes, bubbling out of oceans, leaking from coal seams and oil seeps and being released in huge quantities from volcanoes. So what more can a few domestic cows and sheep do to affect this? Methane from domestic ruminants is a non-problem.
It is a foolish and costly fantasy to believe that Earth’s climate can be controlled by passing laws, imposing taxes, attempting to manipulate the bodily emissions of farm animals or trying to prevent farmers from clearing woody weeds invading their pastures.

25 Sep 2016
Some 375 political activists attached to the National Academy of Sciences, supporting the totalitarian view on the climate question, have recently issued an open letter saying we “caused most of the historical increase in atmospheric levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.”
In fact, the extent of our influence on climate is not “settled science.” Only 0.3% of twelve thousand papers published in learned journals claimed that recent warming was mostly manmade. The 375 activists are entitled to their opinion, but the scientific community’s peer-reviewed results overwhelmingly fail to endorse their narrow view that recent warming was predominately manmade.
True, we influence climate, by returning to the air some of the carbon dioxide that was there before. But so do termites, by emitting more methane than all the world’s farm animals combined. So do plants, by taking carbon dioxide; storing the carbon in leaves, stems, and trunks; and returning the oxygen to the air. So does the Sun, by supplying nearly all the Earth’s radiant energy. So do volcanoes, by emitting hot rocks that warm the air and ejecta that shade the Earth from the Sun and cause cooling. So do the oceans, by helping to keep the Earth’s temperature within a few degrees either side of the period mean for more than 800,000 years.

The activists say we are warming the oceans. But in the first 11 full years of the least ill-resolved dataset we have, the 3500+ Argo bathythermograph buoys, the upper mile and a quarter of the world’s oceans warmed at a rate equivalent to just 1 Celsius degree every 430 years, and the warming rate, negligible at the surface, rises faster the deeper the measurements are taken. The oceans are warming not from above, which they would if we were warming the air and the air was warming the oceans, but from below.
The activists say we are warming the lower atmosphere. Yet on all datasets, the atmosphere is warming at less than half the rate originally predicted by their fellow-activists at the error-prone Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — who have a vested interest in overstating the supposed extent of our influence on climate. For, otherwise, the Panel would be – as it should now be – abolished. The Panel is political, but science is not science unless it is scientific, and unless it is free, in particular, from the political totalitarianism that sullenly insists that only one opinion – the Party Line – may be uttered.
The activists say the oceans are “acidifying.” The truth is that, aside from a few transects and a few local studies, science has no idea whether or at what rate the oceans are “acidifying.” What is known, however, is that the oceans are not acid (as rainwater is): they are pronouncedly alkaline. It is also known that, under anything like modern conditions, they are so powerfully buffered that alkaline they must remain.
The activists say our influence on climate is evident in “altered rainfall patterns,” but in this they are at odds with their fellow-activists at the ill-fated Intergovernmental Panel, whose special report on extreme weather (2012) and whose fifth and most recent (2013) Assessment Report on the climate question find little or no evidence of a link between our industries and enterprises on the one hand and global rainfall patterns on the other.
The activists say we are to blame for retreating Arctic sea ice. But Arctic sea ice variations, if objectively quantified with proper error estimates, are fully within the large natural range of changes that have no need of any unique explanation by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. In addition, Antarctic sea ice, which they somehow do not mention, has largely offset the loss of Arctic ice.
True scientists, like any other citizens, are entitled and even encouraged to take part in the political process, and to state their opinions. This applies to non-USA-citizens, which many of the 375 are. What true scientists must not do, however, is pretend, as the activists did, that their totalitarian point of view is unchallengeable. In all material respects, unfolding events have proven their extremist viewpoint prodigiously exaggerated at best, plain wrong at worst.
Specifically, the activists complain that, during the presidential primary campaign, “claims were made that the Earth is not warming.” Yet early in the primary campaign it was correct to say the Earth had not been warming for almost 19 years. More recently there has been a naturally-occurring El Niño event, which has raised the trend a little, but it remains true that the early predictions of medium-term warming were badly exaggerated.
The activists declare their faith in the doctrine “that the problem of human-caused climate change is real, serious and immediate, and that this problem poses significant risks” to everything from national security via health and agriculture to biodiversity. But this statement is based wholly on faith and is unsupported by reality. We know this because of the serially failed predictions made by alarmists.
The activists say, “We know that the climate system has tipping points.” Yet, revealingly, “Tipping point” is not a scientific but a political term. The activists say that “rapid warming of the planet increases the risk of crossing climatic points of no return,” but there is no evidence for rapid warming of the planet today. At the end of the Maunder Minimum, the Earth’s atmosphere warmed more rapidly in response to the naturally-occurring recovery of solar activity from 1695-1735 than it has warmed in any subsequent 40-year period. There is nothing unprecedented either about today’s global temperatures or about the rate at which those temperatures have been changing.
The activists say warmer weather will “possibly” set in motion “large-scale ocean circulation changes.” The scientific truth is that, while the wind blows, the Earth rotates and its land-masses are approximately where they are, the ocean circulation must remain much as it is now. To suggest otherwise is mere rodomontade.
The activists say warmer weather will cause “the loss of major ice sheets.” But if the great ice sheet that covered most of North America to a depth of two miles had not melted owing to naturally-occurring global warming 10,000 years ago, where would the United States be today? Antarctic snowfall accumulation has not exhibited a massive meltdown over the past 40 to 60 years, and there has been no change to speak of in northern-hemisphere snow cover. There is little evidence that the tiny global warming that has occurred is at all likely to have major effects, whether on the cryosphere or on anything else, and still less evidence that those effects would be deleterious, and still less that, even if they were deleterious, the proposed measures to prevent them would make any detectable difference, and still less that, even if proposed measures might work, the imagined benefits would exceed the extravagant cost of their implementation.
The activists are also wrong in their assertion that any appreciable human influence on the climate will be detectable for many thousands of years. Their fellow activists on the Panel say that very nearly all of the feedbacks from the small warming that may be caused by our enriching the atmosphere with plant food act over timescales of hours to – at most – decades.
The activists are wrong to state that “it is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord.” On the scientific evidence to date, it is abundantly clear that the original predictions made by the totalitarians were extreme exaggerations; that, though the world may warm a little, it will not warm a lot; that adding CO2 to the air will be of benefit to plants in reducing their need for water, which is why the world’s desert regions are beginning to green; and that the cost of futilely playing Canute with the climate is 10-100 times greater than the cost of any realistically foreseeable net disbenefit from warmer weather.
Rooting basically means to gain root access to the device. There are various rooting apps available, but KingRoot Apk is one with a high success rate.
It would, therefore, be entirely proper for a presidential candidate to argue that the United States should withdraw from the Paris climate treaty, except for one inconvenient truth. The United States has not ratified the treaty. Any such ratification requires a two-thirds majority of the Senate, and the collapse of the totalitarians’ scientific case for “climate action” now renders any such two-thirds majority impossible to achieve.
Though the activists have attempted – falsely and improperly – to convey the impression that it is somehow illegal, immoral or damaging to the planet to vote for the Republican party’s candidate in the forthcoming presidential election because he disagrees with the totalitarian position on the climate question that they espouse with such religious fervor and such disregard for science, in truth it is not the business of scientists to abuse the authority of their white lab-coats by collectively suggesting that “Science” demands the voters should or should not cast their vote in any particular direction.
Therefore, the signatories hereto repudiate the letter issued by the 375 activists as reflecting not scientific truth but quasi-religious dogma and totalitarian error; we urge the voters to disregard that regrettable and anti-scientific letter; and we invite every citizen to make up his or her own mind whom to elect to the nation’s highest office without fear of the multifarious bugaboos conjured into terrifying but scientifically unjustifiable existence by the totalitarian activists who have for decades so disrespected, disgraced and disfigured climate science.

http://www.predictweather.co.nz/ArticleShow.aspx?ID=585
This is an age in which some aspects of science have completely reversed. Despite the planet remaining exactly the same, plus the sun, moon, stars, and people, nevertheless what we learned in school appears now to be irrelevant and replaced by concepts empirical physicists like Newton would have had difficulty comprehending. In this new age, new science is driven by funding rather than facts, and ideology rather than ideas. They are interesting times, because the future of science itself may be at stake. If the new trend of politically-directed science is to completely replace the scientific method, which called for rigorous standards of evidence and proof, then it will be entirely up to the politicians of the future to decide what is true or false. What follows is a brief description of some aspects of this new science.

We now have far more earthquakes, according to studies, than ever before, and the planet is being described as almost at the point of breaking apart. Previously, earthquakes were natural, and formed hills and valleys over time. But now, due to oil drilling, fracking and the impact of civilization, new science tells us that the continental plates are moving more violently against each other, the impact then diving down to epicentres 500kms below the earth’s crust, then bouncing back up,firefox for Mac in time to be detected at the plate boundaries by strategically-placed sensors. The earthquakes then form fault lines, which we are told by geologists were responsible for causing the earthquake in the first place. It means earthquakes create themselves retrospectively, which before did not happen under the rules of old science. We have lucrative research grants to thank for these new ideas.
How wondrous, too, to live in an age where heat no longer just goes up – it goes down now as well. We were always taught in school that heat only rises, but in the new science, from an invisible greenhouse ceiling in the high altitudes of the atmosphere, heat can flow downwards to warm the earth, which in the days before global warming was the prerogative solely of the sun. In the olden days the sun warmed the ground and the ground then warmed the air just above the ground, meaning the air cooled the earth. But now it is the air warming the earth (because of planet-harming greenhouse gases contained in it) and not the sun.
Although the sun has apparently retired from its former global heating job, it can still burn freckled people, and of late it has turned into a public menace. Any exposure to it leads directly to fatal skin cancer. Fortunately new science has invented skin cover products to combat this but the whole body must be covered all the time. Even ten minutes of exposure to the Sun now will lead to grave harm. Whereas before, sunshine was healthy, now, only the application of extensive (and expensive) skin cream is healthy.
Then we have the moon, that huge lump of rock between a quarter and a third the size of Planet Earth, which according to new science, has zero effect on the air. If everyone who goes to the beach looks out they will notice that the bottom of the air is joined to the sea, yet this makes no difference, because the moon can differentiate between the two. Also the moon has zero effect on the land that is holding the sea up, even though land and sea are joined beneath the oceans throughout the globe. Despite land, sea and air being joined and forming a joined system, the moon has 100% effect only on the sea, which sits squarely in the middle of the land and the air, this effect being called ‘tides’. Yet the moon’s forces have to find a way of getting past air and land to find the sea, in order to have this 100% effect on it, without disturbing the other two. Without a brain or eyes to see, the way the moon is so successfully selective is mysterious, nevertheless it constitutes the new science. And that means anyone who claims the moon can also affect land and air must be a charlatan.
There are a handful of little islands, with names like Tuvalu, Kiribati and Marshalls, and we learn in the media how they are the only ones in the world which the sea is bullying by attempting to rise over them. That does not happen anywhere around bigger countries like Australia or New Zealand, where there are far more people but no one seems to have noticed this to be any problem; neither swimmers, boaties, fishermen nor beach combers. Old photos and paintings show no sea-level changes. It is why overcrowded Bangladesh which is on the coast, also downtown Manhattan, also Greater London and all of Holland, about a billion people, are not concerned about any sea level rising. But then new science tells us that sea-level rising is not widespread, in fact only a tiny handful of Pacific island families are really affected. According to new science the sea changes its level around these island locations because not enough people in NZ, Australia, UK, US, India, China etc, are looking after the planet by riding bicycles to work.
You may also have heard about the Poles and how they are melting so fast that soon there will be no ice left. Al Gore in 2005 said all polar ice would be gone by 2013. He just missed mentioning the left-over ice that ships still get icebound in and have to wait several months to break free of. Today’s temperature at the South Pole is -60°C. New science says that Antarctic ice is melting at a rapid rate. It means that whereas ice used to only melt at 0°C, now it all melts at -60°C. That must mean that at -60°C, it can no longer exist as ice. This in turn means that our ice-blocks will stay permanently frozen now in our drinks, because room temperature will have to reach Antarctic’s winter temperatures for the ice-blocks to even start to diminish. But even then we’ll have to wait, because Antarctic still ices up in winter, and gets down to about -89°C, and still doesn’t all melt away. New science again, completely changing what we once knew as physics.
Equally intriguing is the ‘global temperature’ which is rapidly rising so much that whole species of life are becoming extinct which never happened before, according to the IPCC. Despite requests, scientists won’t disclose where their global thermometer is standing. But new science measures the whole temperature of the whole world in any one moment such that it can tell if the world is warming, despite that at any moment half the population of the world is in the freezing icy grip of winter while the other half are sweating it out on beaches. Also, one half are fast asleep in night time and the other half are running around with the hot sun shining on them. Fairly irrelevant, though, because scientists have worked out that all ground, sea and air temperatures are now rising at exactly the same time. No one knows by exactly how much, but the latest figure is 0.7 of a degree over a century, or 0.00002°C per day, which is something we cannot ever hope to adjust to and need to take very seriously for the sake of coming generations. Although we don’t know what decimalised temperatures were before digital thermometers were invented about 30 years ago – we know they must be rising because 97% of government-paid scientists receiving research funding to study them are in absolute agreement.
And what is making the planet’s temperature rise? Well, if you have to ask (because that is not very polite), scientists say it is obvious, because we are running engines that were not invented 200 years ago, and they get warm. So do bedside lamps, kettles, electric blankets, cigarettes, rubbing hands together and the top of your head when you eat curry. These all add up. Also humans are now breathing out a warm polluting atmosphere-wrecking gas called carbon dioxide, which is now lethal to the environment in a way it has not been in all past centuries of civilization. All this heats the earth more than it ever did before and our fragile planet has not worked out how it can adjust to these new warming factors. Although the Earth is 4.5 billion years old and in that time has experienced the violent impacts of meteors, the cataclysms of earthquakes and destructive tsunamis causing whole cities to topple, huge shifts of continental plates, devastating floods and relentless tides, drought-causing famines, desertification of continents over several centuries, islands erupting out of the ocean to form new countries, glaciations that last 50,000 years and catastrophic volcanoes, the plant’s biggest challenge yet is how to brace itself against the farts and belches of cows, and car fumes. But new science is again aware of this and knows what to do. It is a wondrous coincidence that humans, the only true caretakers of the planet, have come along at exactly the right time to save it.
By paying more taxes to politicians, this problem can be sorted, because the planet-destroying warmth will then stop. About a billion dollars per day is being paid now towards fixing these issues but more is needed because the warming is continuing unabated. According to Barack Obama and ex-Prime Minister of NZ, Helen Clark, global warming is a far worse problem than global terrorism. We would all agree that a slightly warmer-than-normal afternoon is far more terrifying than having snipers on your roof. How wonderful that such caring and levelheaded leaders are/were in charge of our countries. It is to be remembered that PM Clark signed a deal with China to supply them with all our Southland coal, so the Chinese could pollute their skies which are far, far away from our own.
So just look at how we as a society have progressed. In the old days people believed that the sun warmed the ground and the seasons came and went in cycles. They thought that storms and floods and droughts were all normal things that occasionally arrived. These events even received regular mention in the Bible. People of the past also assumed that all around the house and even the different rooms of the house had different temperatures, some warm and some cool, and you put heaters in the cool areas and fans in the hot ones. They didn’t know that everything would one day be all warming up at once.
In the past they also thought that sometimes tides were higher than others when the moon came closer, and that earthquakes happened which formed mountains, and not vice versa. They thought that forests grew only where lots of rain fell. It just demonstrates how misguided the science was back then. Now, new science informs us that it is the mountains and Alpine Faults that will cause future earthquakes, and the trees that cause the rain, and when all the rain forests in Brazil are finally cut down all world weather will be forever changed.
And then there are the polar bears. If you don’t know what they are it is because they are extinct. Despite being all white with four legs and identical in appearance, through new science a way was found to count them all. It was not easy – they covered a quarter of a million square miles, are only at the North Pole in winter time in conditions of pitch black Arctic winter darkness, and are all asleep in hibernation beneath it, and yet an accurate count was possible (due to a $10,000 research fund) in 1995. The count revealed (because no polar bears were seen) that there were none left. Using similar methods we know there are 7 Maui dolphins in all the oceans (because they were seen), and only 15 killer whales remaining.
It is a problem for administrators when a minority choose to be skeptical of new science, ask to be left alone, try to stay happy for their children’s well-being and wish to ignore gloom and doom. They are made to feel they are letting the side down because their skepticism makes taxes harder to gather, and there is less money available for essentials like electoral advertising, which is more necessary than houses and jobs, because choosing the right political party tops our list of priorities. In the days before new science men and women could work and have houses and feed young families which could grow up not being hungry. Now, machines perform much of the manual tasks that previously were done by working people, and wages do not have to be provided. It means the unemployed poor can now stay in bed and relax, freed from the responsibility of decision-making and from the trappings of wealth and having to own houses.
What a successful, caring and interesting civilization we have become. For that we can thank the new science and those who advance it.

https://carbon-sense.com/2016/09/22/the-carbonate-sand-factory-of-the-south-australian-coast/,,THE CARBONATE SAND FACTORY OF THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN COAST,"By Cliff Ollier
A new book has been produced on the coast of South Australia (1). It is essentially about coastal geomorphology and includes much that I shall not mention here such as tectonics, coastal processes, coastal management and human impacts on coasts. This brief note presents, mainly in their own words, what they have to say about aspects of carbonate production.
BACKGROUND
The South Australian coast originated with the separation of Antarctica and Australia about 43 million years ago, but the continental margin is well to the south of the present coast. During higher sea levels of the Late Eocene (37 to 34 Ma), the coast stood several hundred kilometres landward of its present location.

Some parts of the South Australian coast are exceptionally stable while other parts have moved up and down, to make a series of fault blocks. The Last Interglacial (130-118 ka ago) shoreline stood ~2 m higher than present sea level on the stable parts. Sediments deposited at that time are called the Glanville Formation. Fringing the coast of Eyre Peninsula on the stable Gawler Craton, the Glanville Formation lies at 2 m above present sea level but it has been tectonically depressed (-7 m at Port Adelaide), uplifted on Fleurieu Peninsula (+10 m at Normanville; +6 m at Victor Harbor), depressed at Goolwa (-0.8 m) in the Murray Estuary and progressively uplifted on the Coorong Coastal Plain to a maximum of +18 m near Mount Gambier.
The Glanville Formation contains inter-tidal, warm water fauna, including the mollusc Anadara trapezia (now locally extinct) which shows this higher than present shoreline was warmer than the present. At the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, some 22,000 years ago, sea level was about 125 m below the present level. Large areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, and wind blew sediments inland. After that sea level rose and reached present levels about 7,000 years ago.
THE CARBONATE SAND FACTORY
Apart from bedrock areas the coasts are dominated by carbonate sands in beaches and dunes. At many points in the book the authors refer to the ‘carbonate factory’ that produces it, and even claim it is “… part of the world’s largest temperate carbonate factory”.
“The sources of the sediment for these coastal successions were the Lacepede and Bonney Shelves, which represent a subtidal carbonate factory with the prolific growth of calcareous marine invertebrates such as molluscs, bryozoans, coralline algae, echinoids, and foraminifers. The post mortem attrition of these organisms leads to the formation of sand-sized sedimentary particles of calcium carbonate”.
“In Gulf St Vincent seagrasses thrive in the subtidal and intertidal shallow warm waters, with extremely productive calcareous algae, foraminifers and molluscan organisms manufacturing vast amounts of calcareous sediment. The accumulation of these … sediments has generated the resultant wide intertidal and supratidal flats visible today by causing the shoreline to aggrade (build up) and prograde (build seawards)”.
“The dominant processes of coastal development in the protected, tidally dominated waters of the northern Spencer Gulf are related to the massive production and accumulation of biogenic skeletal carbonate fragments derived from coralline algae, foraminifers, molluscs and bryozoans; the site is a ‘major carbonate factory’, sequestering much CO2.”
Furthermore aeolianite dunes also depend on the process. “The aeolianites are primarily composed of marine carbonate, reflecting the absence of streams delivering terrestrial, quartzose sediments to the coast”.
“The sand-sized particles of calcium carbonate derived from the mechanical abrasion of marine invertebrates were entrained landwards by inner-shelf currents, and subsequently brought on land by aeolian processes to form thick dune deposits, which are interbedded with relict soil profiles (paleosols) that formed during periods of lower sea levels. The presence of aeolianite reflects the prolonged history of aridity of the Australian continent and the paucity of terrigenous-clastic sediment delivered to much of the coastline of southern Australia”.
“The coastline of South Australia is part of the world’smobdro for ios largest aeolianite (dune limestone) temperate sedimentary carbonate province, which extends from western Victoria to north of Shark Bay, Western Australia. The aeolianite deposits attest to the high calcium carbonate bioproductivity of the surrounding continental shelf environments”.
And the carbonate sand is important even offshore:
“It has been demonstrated that the Murray Canyons Group [submarine canyons] is still being actively modified, with sediment transport to the oceanic deeps more than 100 km from the foot slope. Given the lack of river sediment supply, the marine carbonate ‘factories’ of the Lacepede Shelf provide the main supply of sediments for turbidity currents. Initially, canyon erosion involved mainly land-sourced sediment, with later cutting predominantly by biogenic carbonates produced on the continental shelf”.
In the debates about Global Warming, now usually referred to with the less specific title Climate Change, the alarmists place much emphasis on the role of carbon dioxide. First its role as a greenhouse gas was supposed to cause warming. Then to demonise it further it was supposed to cause ‘acidification’ of the oceans, despite the fact that the oceans have been alkaline throughout their existence on Earth. We are supposed to reduce the production of anthropogenic carbon dioxide to ‘protect’ the ocean.
The ‘carbonate factories’ described here show that carbon dioxide is vital for the production of carbonate sands and ultimately limestone, and of course for the formation of the past and presents coasts. It is part of the big geochemical picture: carbon dioxide originates from volcanic eruptions and is fixed by limestone formation. Trying to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the ocean by reducing emissions by human activities is not only futile, but if it could be done it would have harmful consequences on all the carbonate fixing animals and plants in the ocean, and ultimately on the shape of the continent.

A Short Easy-To-Read Book On Climate
Mirrors and Mazes: A guide to the climate debate. Dr Howard Thomas Brady.
Emeritus Professor Cliff Ollier, has reviewed this book in the New Concepts in Global Tectonics Journal (V4,no1,2016). Ollier explains that the title Mirrors and Mazes reflects the author’s idea of how the IPCC and others have acted like magicians tricking their audience and Ollier comments: I have read many books on climate but have found much new material here. 
The late Professor Bob Carter commented: this book is just plain interesting and reads extremely well.
Emeritus Professor Peter Flood in his review comments: “This is indeed one of those rare book on climate: it is a concise and clear reader, while also profoundly rich in its concepts, analysis and scope, addressing the critical issues in the climate debate. There are no distracting emotional attacks on individuals. There is humour. There are interesting stories.

31 August 2016

For at least a decade we have been told by the UN/IPCC, by most government media and officials, by many politicians, and by the Green “charities” and their media friends that “the science is settled”. We are lectured by Hollywood stars, failed politicians and billionaire speculators that anyone who opposes the World War on Carbon Dioxide is ignorant, mischievous or supporting some hidden vested interest. We endure calls for an end to free speech for climate sceptics, smearing with derogatory terms like “denier”, and even aggressive punishments like dismissal and legal action against sceptics for speaking out. The new low is the use of anti-racketeer legislation against sceptics:
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/08/29/rico-charges-against-climate-deniers-a-case-of-goose-and-gander/
We notice the sudden and unexplained denial of pre-booked sceptic conference facilities and the steadfast refusal of alarmists to debate facts and issues.
Why are they so afraid of words? Surely this is a sign that their facts are shonky and their arguments are feeble? They fear they are losing the confidence of the public.

The tide is turning, and informed opposition is growing. It is time for the thinking media to give sceptical evidence and conclusions a fair go in the court of public opinion.
In a short time with no costly international meetings and very little publicity, Clexit has gathered the support of over 115 members in 20 countries. Please look at the list of Foundation Members and countries:
http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit-members.pdf
Look at the skills, qualifications, experience and wisdom of our founding members; and the many other well-qualified dissenters listed at the end. The science is not settled.
This global warming alarm started with UN sponsored groups such as the IPCC. But Clexit has members who were official IPCC reviewers but they dissented from the final public IPCC reports which were prepared by political appointees.
The climate alarm rests totally on computerised models of atmospheric physics. But Clexit has highly qualified meteorologists, physicists, astro-physicists, radiation experts, climate modellers and long-range forecasters who reject the science, maths, assumptions and forecasts of the greenhouse-driven computer models.
We are told that Earth’s climate is controlled by the gradual increase of a tiny trace of one colourless gas in the atmosphere. But Clexit has specialists who can show that the warm and cold currents in the deep and extensive oceans, the variable water vapour in the atmosphere and Earth’s changing cover of ice, snow and clouds have far more effect on weather and climate than carbon dioxide.
We are told that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. But Clexit has organic chemists, biologists, physicians, naturalists, graziers, foresters and farmers who know that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is very beneficial for Earth’s biosphere – deserts are contracting, bush and forests are expanding, and crop yields are up.
We are told that sea levels are rising alarmingly. But Clexit has experts on sea level history and measurement who can prove that there is nothing unusual or alarming about current fluctuations in sea levels.
We are told that today’s climate is extreme and unusual. But Clexit has geologists and geographers who have studied eons of climate history via ice cores, stratigraphy, paleontology, deep-sea drilling, historical records, glaciers, ice sheets and landscapes and who say that climate change is normal and today’s climate is not extreme or unusual.
We are told to fear the coming global warming. But Clexit has geologists and researchers who have studied the cycles of the ice ages and the climate effects of the Milankovitch cycles in Earth’s orbit – obliquity, eccentricity and precession. They say we have passed the peak of this modern warm era and the long-term trend is now towards global cooling. We will still have short-term periods of hot and extreme weather, and some heat records may still be broken, but the 1,000 year climate averages are trending down towards the next glacial epoch of the Pleistocene Ice Age.
We are told that global warming threatens human health, and even our survival as a species, but Clexit has medical researchers who point to evidence that exposure to cold remains up to twenty times more lethal than exposure to heat. And Clexit has farmers who know that global cooling will slash food production, quickly causing hunger and starvation.
We are told repeatedly that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed by dangers that change annually – rising seas, river sediments, warm seas, ocean acidity, fertiliser run-off, coal port development, over-fishing or marauding star-fish. But Clexit has qualified members who have studied oceanography and ancient and modern corals and report that the Reef is healthy, and corals have survived far more dramatic changes in sea levels and climate in the past.
Solar cycles get no consideration in the IPCC climate models but Clexit has astro-physicists and long range weather forecasters who have demonstrated that solar and lunar cycles have big effects on Earth’s climate and weather cycles. In addition, while billions of dollars are spent fruitlessly on failed climate models and endless climate conferences, little is known about the strings of undersea volcanoes or how much geothermal heat is released from Earth’s molten interior during orogenic upheavals.
We are told that we must embrace zero-emission green energy. But Clexit has power engineers and logistics experts who say that wind and solar power cannot run modern industrial societies, modern transport or big cities except by installing massive overcapacity and giganticShowbox for iPhone transmission webs at exorbitant costs. 100% wind/solar is a recipe for blackouts and starvation. Clexit also has naturalists and conservationists who see more harm than good in extensive wind, solar and bio-fuel developments.
Finally, we are told that to save the world we need to hand powerful taxing and regulating powers to unelected officials of the United Nations. But Clexit has politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen, columnists, lawyers, army officers and bloggers who see that this political agenda will destroy the freedoms we cherish.
Many Clexit members have held very senior positions in research, industry or academia but no longer have sensitive positions, careers or incomes to protect, so are free to express honest opinions, which they have done by supporting “Clexit”.
We ask the media to give our soundly-based dissenting conclusions a fair hearing – there are two sides to most stories, but only one side is being aired.
The Clexit initiative was launched with no budget, promises or funds. So, unlike the alarmists with an agenda, those receiving rivers of government funds and those posing as tax-exempt charities, we cannot afford massive advertising costs.
We hope, in the interests of fair play, you see fit to give our valid concerns some space in the free media.
Note: The first informal meeting of many Clexit members will take place in London on Sept 8/9, 2016 at this conference (whose first booked venue had to be changed because of controversy and opposition):
https://geoethic.com/london-conference-2016/
Disclosure: The formation of Clexit was not prompted or supported by any industry, corporation, group or lobby nor have they had any say in our statements or conclusions.

Graham Williamson
July 2016
The UN, having spent  more than half a $trillion in 70 years, is an undemocratic, unaccountable international policeman that is in the business of inventing ‘global problems’ which can only be ‘solved’ by a transfer of power and money from nation states to the UN. It has been elevated to this status by cooperative national governments.  As noted by Peter Faris QC, thanks to the eager cooperation of successive Australian governments “laws are imported (as some sort of universal truths) from the UN.”
On 27th September 2015 the UN continued their campaign of global control and undemocratic interference in the affairs of nations around the world with their ‘Transforming Our World‘ 2030 SDG agenda which was  signed by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on behalf of all Australians. With a predicted  annual price tag of $2-3 trillion, the agenda is to be sold to the people as ‘voluntary’, although  the people will be given no choice, and essential provisions will be undemocratically enforced by national governments. Although both major Parties refused to mention this during the recent election campaign, implementation of this undemocratic bipartisan supported agenda commenced in Australia on 1st January 2016.
The 2030 agenda is a UN driven “master plan” or “roadmap to global socialism” aimed at controlling the planet, including so called ‘climate change’, and the life styles and energy consumption of all people and all countries.  Their 15 year goals include:


Redistributing the wealth of Australia and other Western nations, under the control of the UN, to poorer countries, especially impoverished dictatorships, around the world. According to the 2030 Agenda, ‘poverty’ can only be addressed by undemocratically giving money and power to the UN.


 The  COP21 Paris climate change agreement, comprising SDG 13, is just one part of the 2030 Agenda. The UN version of climate change though,  is about global power and money. As UNFCCC chief  Christiana Figueres pointed out, the aim of the UN is to bring about a “centralized transformation“… “one that is going to make the life of everyone on the planet very different.”  Figueres continues: “global society, is moving to the point where we are going to need more and more global governance muscle… Climate change is only the first of the major, major planetary challenges that we are being given, almost as a playground… to go into that playground and exercise our global governance capacity”


Controlling lifestyles, energy use, and consumption by defining which activities are accepted by the UN as being ‘sustainable’. Only the UN can control ‘sustainability’.


Controlling education around the globe to ensure all children become activists promoting the UN sustainability agenda.


Moving towards global enforcement by developing global monitoring, accountability mechanisms, and surveillance systems so “no one is left behind”.


The UN 2030 agenda is completely open ended, stating no total costs, and stating no limits as far as loss of sovereignty and enforcement mechanisms are concerned.


The American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) advances the interior design profession and communicates the impact of design on the human experience. Laurel & Wolf interior designers in Banglore specialize in every design style, space type and specification. See designer portfolios and styles here!
 The people have been betrayed. The 2030 Agenda is all about  betrayal, UN control, and global socialism, and  expanding global law. The United Nations has “conned governments, citizens andbusiness into adopting the 2030 Agenda“, but “business does not understand” that it will destroy “Capitalism and Free Enterprise.” And all this has been made possible by the Australian government, and governments of other ‘democratic’ countries, who invite the UN to interfere in the domestic affairs of their respective countries  WITHOUT the democratic approval of the people.
The choice is clear: do you want UN control and interference, or do you want democracy, freedom and prosperity? Should our destiny be decided by us, or by the dictators that comprise the UN?  Do you want democratic Australian laws, or foreign laws dictated by the UN?

Only 850 billion tons of CO2 is in the atmosphere (2% of the total CO2), and of that, less than 10% is man-made!
Over 90% of the atmospheric CO2 is produced naturally from decaying vegetation, fires, volcanoes, and the oceans. Also 80% of the world’s active volcanoes are under the sea bubbling out both liquid and gaseous CO2 and methane (and the sea is still alkaline). Indeed combustion reactions (power stations, fires, cars etc) produce CO2 and water, but it is the fine pollutant particles and chemicals (like oxides of sulphur and nitrogen) resulting from incomplete combustion that are the major problems affecting local temperatures, weather, as well as human health. Ruminating animals produce more greenhouse gases that all the buses, trucks and cars in the world combined!
Water by far the major greenhouse gas, cannot be controlled or taxed, so CO2 is measurable, blamed and potentially made taxable, even though most of it naturally occurring.Music paradise pro App But by contrast, in the sea, plankton growth from extra CO2 has grown tenfold over 50 years, and this is the main supplier of the oxygen that we breathe. Higher crop yields and greater vegetation growth rates have been reported worldwide due to the increased CO2 over the last 3 or so decades.

https://carbon-sense.com/2016/07/09/renewable-energy-suicide/,,RENEWABLE ENERGY SUICIDE,"By Keith DeLacy AM, Queensland business identity and former Labor Treasurer of Queensland.
First published by The Australian [$ Paywall]
One policy which seems to have escaped scrutiny during this election campaign is Labor’s commitment to increase the Renewable Energy Target (RET) to 50% by 2030.
I am surprised because it is a proposal that has enormous ramifications for economic growth and living standards, and disproportionate impacts on traditional Labor constituencies.
The problem we have in Australia is when we talk renewable energy we are talking wind and solar only – low value, expensive, unreliable, high capital cost, land hungry, intermittent energy. 
According to the Department of Industry and Science wind currently generates 4.1% and solar 2% of Australia’s electricity. But even this is highly misleading because it is such low value power. You could close it down tomorrow (which it regularly does by itself) and it would make no difference to supply.
If we talk about total energy, as opposed to just electricity, wind and solar represent 1% of Australia’s energy consumption. This despite  billions of dollars of investment, subsidies, creative tariffs, mandates, and so on. 
Solar and wind simply don’t work, not here, not anywhere. The energy supply is not dense enough. The capital cost of consolidating it makes it cost prohibitive.

But they are not only much more expensive because of this terminal disadvantage, they are low value intermittent power sources – every kilowatt has to be backed up by conventional power, dreaded fossil fuels. So we have two capital spends for the same output – one for the renewable and one for the conventional back up. Are you surprised it is so much more expensive, and inefficient, and always will be!
So wind and solar, from a large scale electricity point of view, are duds. Now I know that will send the urgers into paroxysms of outrage. But have you ever seen an industry that so believed its own propaganda. Note, when they eulogise the future of renewables they point to targets, or to costly investments, never to the real contribution to supply.
Let’s look overseas where there are many countries that have been destroying their budgets and their economies on this illusion for longer and more comprehensively than we in Australia.
The Germans are ruing the day they decided to save the world by converting to solar and wind. Germany has spent US$100 billion on solar technology and it represents less than 1% of their electricity supply. Energy policy has been a disaster.  Subsidies are colossal, the energy market is now chaotic, industry is decamping to other jurisdictions, and more than 1 million homes have had their power cut off.
It is reported that electricity prices in Germany, Spain and the UK increased by 78%, 111% and 133% between 2005 and 2014 as they forced additional renewable capacity into their electricity markets.
Sunny Spain used to be the poster boy for renewables in Europe – photovoltaic cells and wind turbines stretching on forever. Now they are broke, winding back subsidies, even the feed-in tariffs which were guaranteed for 20 years. 
But wait, what about the green energy jobs that everybody gushes about? Spain has an unemployment rate of 21% with a youth rate of 45.5%.
The UK is little better. Subsidies are being wound back, and a Department of Energy report points out that in 2013, the number of households in fuel poverty in England was estimated at 2.35million representing approximately 10.4% of all households. 
It is no better in the US either. States with Renewable Energy Mandates (REMs) are back-tracking faster than Sally Pearson can clear hurdles! 
Ohio has halved its mandate level (was 25% by 2025) because of high costs. West Virginia has repealed its REM because of high costs, and New Mexico has frozen its mandates.  Kansas was repealing its mandate which reportedly would save ratepayers $171 million, representing $4,367 for each household, and so the dismal story goes on.
The US Department of Energy has found that electricity prices have risen in States with REMs twice as fast as those with no mandate.
As of 2013 California was the only State to adopt a feed-in tariff for solar power. It was immediately dubbed a failure by the renewable energy community because it offered only 31 US cents per kwh, only 5 times the rate for conventional base load power!
Ah but Asian countries are jumping on the band wagon! Maybe. China built one new coal fired power plant every week in 2014, and India’s coal powered investment in that same year equaled the total electricity capacity of NSW and Qld.
To summarize – with all of the trillions spent world wide on wind and solar, wind currently (2015) represents 1.2 % of global consumption of energy, and solar 0.2%. 
The good news, it is possible to reduce fossil fuel use in electricity generation – through hydro-electricity and nuclear fuel. Plenty of countries have done it – Canada 60% hydro and 15% nuclear; Sweden 45% hydro and 48% nuclear; Switzerland 54% hydro and 41% nuclear; France 11% hydro and 79% nuclear.
But Australia has zero tolerance of these two workable alternatives to fossil fuels. At least we are consistently inconsistent!
So where does that leave us.  On the basis of evidence everywhere we could easily double the price of electricity and get nowhere near the 50% target. What would that mean? 
Firstly, it means rapidly disappearing blue collar jobs in high energy industries like manufacturing, car and ship building, smelting and refining, steel making and food processing. There may be still some construction jobs, but they will largely be assembly only, as all of the components will come from those countries more interested in growing the economy and eliminating poverty than stoking the warm inner glow!
Make no bones about it, a clean green economy has no place for high viz shirts! 
Secondly, rapidly rising electricity prices and the subsequent increase in the cost of living, disproportionately affects those at the bottom of the income scale.
Policies like this are OK for the Greens. They can keep their virtue intact because they never have to deliver. As Gough Whitlam once said, only the impotent are pure. 
Mainstream parties don’t have that luxury. They need to look at the true costs, and benefits, of all policy proposals.

In a long life of observing and participating in many election campaigns, I have never before seen anything approaching the ferocity and stupidity of the “war on carbon”. Are we fighting –

“Carbon” which is the essential element at the centre of every molecule of life on earth?… OR
“Carbon Dioxide” which is the natural atmospheric gas-of-life that feeds all plants?… OR
“Carbon Fuels” such as oil, gas and coal which are natural hydrocarbons which store ancient solar and hydro-thermal energy and which provide most of the electrical and motive power that supports and feeds every society on Earth?
The Answer? Judging from their statements and sloppy language, the alarmists and green zealots are fighting all three. They aim to make “carbon” a dirty word and to deny all humanity the great benefits of hydro-carbon energy.

Like all futile wars, this one will eventually collapse. But it has already done tremendous damage to the global economy and financial stability.
Ominously, Malcolm Turnbull signed Australia onto the Paris Climate Agreement. This appalling document should be forever draped around his neck like a dead albatross. We need our own CLEXIT – climate exit from the climate Czars of Europe. Julie Bishop and Greg Hunt supported him and were collaborators in wasting or committing over one billion dollars on climate nonsense. Please put these three and their supporters last in their electorates.

Most governments and politicians have no idea what would be required of them under this agreement, so Greenpeace recently commissioned a study into what would be needed to achieve the Paris targets.
Read the whole sad story here: http://www.thegwpf.com/the-energy-absurdity-of-the-paris-climate-agreement/
“According to the calculations of study author Volker Quaschning of the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin (HTW), “the production of cars with gasoline and diesel engines has to end by 2025 and main roads will have to be fitted with overhead electrical lines for freight transportation.”
The study also finds that Germany’s Autobahn too will need to have overhead catenary akin to overhead railway lines because the entire bus and freight transport needs to be electrified within a short period of time.” –
Here is the future according to the Greens, the ALP and the Turnbull “Liberals”.

The Vested-Interest-Voting Bloc embraces Climate Alarmism
Democracies are at the point of no return.
There are too many “vested-interest-voters” who are totally or partially dependent on governments for controlling and/or funding their salaries, services, taxes, subsidies, allowances, medical care, research, education, news, retirement rules, pensions, urban transport, infrastructure and energy. There are many deserving recipients among these groups, but government has never been able to separate the needy from the greedy, and the system has become untenable.
This huge bloc (and near majority) of vested-interest-voters will always vote for “more free stuff”. Those supporting internationalism and socialism have been adroit at harvesting these votes.
The climate battle has been embraced by another powerful coalition of globalists and centralists who now see the chance to use natural climate and weather variability as evidence for the need for a suffocating world government. The hidden agenda is to deliver more power to unelected UN agencies. The tactics are to make developed countries destitute, dependent and obedient using carbon taxes; and to keep the failed states in perpetual green poverty – trading their liberty for “climate aid”.
The battle over the science of what controls Earth’s climate is being won. The alarmists produce no new evidence or theory to support their global warming doomsday story, but real evidence of Earth’s changeable past climate keeps getting unearthed.
It is now mainly a political battle. It is not about improving the science; it is about winning the battle for votes by scare campaigns and parroted slogans (every weather event is now “weird weather”, “wild weather” or yet another “super storm”).
The political climate battle is close to its climax so the alarmists are now desperately trying to establish a network of taxes, rules and regulations designed to bring quick bankruptcy to those in the hydro-carbon energy business and perpetual protection and subsidies to the green energy promoters.
But the rocks continue to release their records of past climate change and new flaws are discovered in the massive climate models and their failed predictions.
In short, the true climate science continues to show that change is normal and man has no control over it.
So please play a part in this great political battle at every opportunity.
Luckily, the political tide is on the turn and for once there are several candidates and parties offering sound climate policies. Please vote for them and deny your vote for their enemies.
How to Vote
The government has been frustrated because some small parties have managed to get a voice in the senate, so they changed the voting rules in an attempt to shut most small parties out, leaving the field to LNP, ALP and Greens.
But their rules may backfire if enough voters are clever enough to understand and use them or too stupid to understand how they work.
The main battle will be in the Senate, and it appears that minor parties will get significant support from people who can’t stand Greens, the ALP or the Turnbull Liberal faction.
The worst thing voters can do is put “1” in just one box for a micro-party. Unless that candidate or party is elected on the first count, that vote will “expire” leaving the field to the big boys. So number every box either above or below the line. Below the line go at least as far as the big party candidate you think is least worst – your vote will get there and probably be counted. 
Judged just on their climate policies, put all Greens last and all ALP second last, or if voting below the line in the senate, don’t vote for them at all.
Who are the Climate Smart Candidates?
All candidates and parties mentioned below are rated solely on their climate policies. Generally those with sense on climate are also sensible in other policies, but this is not guaranteed. It is a case of “Voter Beware”.
There are at least 8 individual candidates deserving full support, including (in alphabetical order):

David Archibald, ALA candidate for Curtin in WA
George Christensen, LNP Candidate for Dawson in Queensland
Bob Day, Family First Senator for SA
Mark Imisides, Senate Candidate WA,  Christian Democrats
Dr Dennis Jensen MP, Independent Candidate for Tangney
David Leyonhjelm, LDP Senator for NSW
John Madigan, Senator, Manufacturing and Farming Party
Malcolm Roberts, No 2 on Senate ticket for Pauline Hanson in Queensland

Of the parties whose written climate policies we have seen, the outstanding one is that of the Pauline Hanson’s One Nation. All of the other parties listed above also deserve support.
The following minor parties by word or deed have also shown better than average climate sense:

Citizens Electoral Council
Shooters Fishers and Farmers
Rise Up Australia
Australian Christians
DLP

And of course we must not forget Tony Abbott, who did axe the tax. Vote for him and his supporters.
Who should NOT get our Vote?
Put the Greens or their candidates last in every contest.
What about the ALP? This is what they say:  “The key to tackling climate change is to drastically increase our investment in renewable energies like solar. That is why we’ll commit to 50% renewable energy by 2030 because it will cut pollution, help create jobs of the future and lower energy prices.”
So put the ALP second last. The two “Independents” who allowed Julia Gillard to mis-rule should also go last in their electorates – Mr Tony Windsor and Mr Rob Oakeshott – put them last.
The following minor parties show no climate sense but are marginally better than the Greens. Do not give them help.

Nick Xenophon
Animal Justice Party

What about the LNP?
The Turnbull faction of the LNP should be denied all support.
The National Party faction is probably worth supporting after the sound parties and candidates listed above. Barnaby Joyce understands the climate issues, but is muzzled by coalition solidarity.

https://carbon-sense.com/2016/04/23/true-green-fuels/,,On Earth Day we should Celebrate the True Green Fuels,"On Earth Day we should Celebrate The True Green Fuels – Hydrocarbons and Nuclear.
The Carbon Sense Coalition today urged people to celebrate the true green fuels – oil, coal, gas, nuclear and, in places, geothermal and hydro.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that these fuels have reduced man’s pressure on the environment to such an extent that they should be celebrated on “Earth Day”.

Quotes:
It was petroleum that provided the kerosene that replaced whale oil in lamps and greatly reduced the slaughter of whales.
Coal saved the forests that were being cut down for smelters, forges, charcoal, heaters and stoves. Steel made with coke then replaced wood for mine props, bridges and tall buildings. As steam engines and iron ships replaced wooden wind-jammers in world navies and merchant fleets, the forests expanded.
Coal gas and clean coal cured the smogs of London and Pittsburgh. Piped gas for home heating and street lighting and the even better “clean-coal-by-wire” (coal powered electricity) worked wonders to reduce air pollution in “The Big Smoke”.
Petrol driven cars and trucks removed horse manure from the big cities, and tractors reduced the amount of land required to grow food for those cities.
Nuclear power is the ultimate “green energy” – enormous amounts of clean energy generated on a tiny footprint, by minute quantities of fuel, with little effect on air or water quality. Its only disadvantage is that, unlike coal and gas, it does not recycle the gases of life to the atmosphere.
Naturally there are risks in every human endeavour but modern energy sources kill far fewer people and wildlife than were once lost in timber getting, horse breaking, wind-jammers, sulky capsize, air pollution and city wildfires. And to believe that man can tweak the climate with carbon taxes is non-sense.
In contrast, the so called “green energy” sources usually lauded on Earth Day have a heavy toll on the environment to produce piddling amounts of unreliable and costly energy.
Both wind and solar energy are so dilute that large areas of land must be sterilised by roads, transmission lines and construction sites to collect significant energy. Already many wind towers have been abandoned and others are being de-commissioned because of high maintenance costs or poor energy production.
Roof-top solar is a joke as a reliable supplier of energy for most of humanity. In most installations of wind and solar power, the facilities would not be built without subsidies and other political props, and it is doubtful that the green-power turbines and panels will generate enough useful energy over their limited life to recover the energy needed for their raw materials, manufacture, construction, roads, power lines, earth works, maintenance and decommissioning.
Green energy is not environmentally friendly.
Where big wind/solar facilities are constructed, many native birds and bats are sliced by whirling swords, or singed and fried by concentrated solar heat rays. Blinded by their obsession with blaming fossil fuels for everything, greens pretend that this unnecessary slaughter of wildlife is not occurring.
Without carbon and nuclear fuels, Earth would be raped for fuel and food by destitute people trying to eke out a living without the greatest boon to modern living – cheap reliable energy. As Alex Epstein, from the Centre for Industrial Progress says eloquently, “fossil fuels are the greenest energy”.
Fossil Fuels: The Greenest Energy
“Despite what most environmentalists would have us believe, fossil fuels have made our lives more livable, not less. Thanks to coal, oil, and natural gas, the developed world has routine access to clean water, better sanitation, and yes, cleaner air. Watch the video below and find out how, rather than destroying the planet, this miracle energy source is actually saving lives.

Every time a north wind blows hot air over Adelaide, some Chicken Little cries “Global Warming”. And when an El Nino predictably causes a hot year like 1998 or 2015/16, some sensation-seeking celebrity will trumpet “hottest year eevah”.
They are watching short-term weather ripples and waves and ignoring the underlying climate tide. Daily, monthly and yearly temperature records will always be equalled or broken. That is what weather does – it fluctuates.
In the medium term, Earth temperature trends are influenced by variations in solar activities as evidenced by sun-spot cycles. These variations affect solar intensity, cosmic rays, clouds and Earth temperature, causing medium-term climatic events like the Little Ice Age and the Modern Warming. There are persuasive signs that recent solar activity has peaked. So maybe we can expect cooler weather soon.
See:  http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images/Cycle22Cycle23Cycle24big.gif
But to see what the climate is doing we must look longer-term and study the glacial cycles. The Milankovitch cycles of Earth in the solar system control these.
See: http://www.indiana.edu/~geol105/images/gaia_chapter_4/milankovitch.htm
Is it warming or cooling now?
See this very informative video by the late Professor Bob Carter:

There are many signs that Earth’s climate is gradually cooling (as Prof Carter shows in the video above).
For example, snow and ice is accumulating.
In the Antarctic, Mawson’s Hut and the Colbeck Hut are being progressively buried in ice.
In Greenland, “The Lost Squadron”, which was forced to land on the Greenland Ice sheet in 1942, was rediscovered 50 years later buried under 268 feet of ice.

https://carbon-sense.com/2016/02/27/build-more-dams/,,Be Like the Beaver – Build More Dams,"
Water is essential for all life, and happily it is abundant on our blue watery planet.
However, salty oceans cover 70% of Earth’s surface and contain 97% of Earth’s water. Salt water is great for ocean dwellers but not directly useful for most life on land. Another 2% of Earth’s water is tied up in ice caps, glaciers and permanent snow, leaving just 1% as land-based fresh water.
To sustain life on land, we need to conserve and make good use of this rare and elusive resource.
Luckily, our sun is a powerful nuclear-powered desalinisation plant. Every day, solar energy evaporates huge quantities of fresh water from the oceans. After a stop-off in the atmosphere, most of this water vapour is soon returned to earth as dew, rain, hail and snow – this is the great water cycle. Unfortunately about 70% of this precipitation falls directly back into the oceans and some is captured in frozen wastelands.
Much of the water that falls on land is collected in gullies, creeks and rivers and driven relentlessly by gravity back to the sea by the shortest possible route. Allowing this loss to happen is poor water management. The oceans are not short of water.
Some animals and plants have evolved techniques to maximise conservation of precious fresh water.
Some Australian frogs, on finding their water holes evaporating, will inflate their stomachs with water then bury themselves in a moist mud-walled cocoon to wait for the drought to break. Water buffalo and wild pigs make mud wallows to retain water in their private mud-baths, camels carry their own water supply and beavers build lots of dams.
Some plants have also evolved water saving techniques – bottle trees and desert cacti are filled with water, thirsty humans can even get a drink from the roots and trunks of some eucalypts and many plants produce drought/fire resistant seeds.
Every such natural water conservation or drought-proofing behaviour brings benefits for all surrounding plants and animals.
People have long recognised the importance of conserving fresh water – early settlers built their homes near the best waterholes on the creek and every homestead and shed had its corrugated iron tanks. Graziers built dams and weirs to retain surface water for stock (and fence-crashing wildlife), used contour ripping and good pasture management to retain moisture in soils, and drilled bores to get underground water. And sensible rules have evolved to protect the water rights of down-stream residents.
In some snow-fed rivers like the Nile, floods are generally a reliable and predictable annual event. For millennia the Nile delivered water and silt fertiliser to the farmers on the flood plains in Lower Egypt. The massive High Aswan Dam may have done more harm than good – it certainly did great harm to the farmers and land down-stream by stealing the silt and the water that supported the productivity of farms that have fed millions since Roman times. The value of the electricity generated by the dam probably does not compensate for these losses.
But in Australia, rainfall is usually a boom and bust affair. Much fresh water is delivered to the land surface suddenly in cyclones, storms and rain depressions. But “The Wet” is always followed by “The Dry”, and droughts and floods are normal climatic events. People who fail to store some of the flood must put up with the drought.

Those who think the political war on carbon will lower Earth’s temperature or keep climate stable need to study climate history.
Temperatures on Earth dance to a cyclic rhythm every hour, every day, every month, every season, every year, and to every beat of the sun-spot and glacial cycles.
The daily solar cycle causes continual changes in temperature for every spot on Earth. It produces the frosts at dawn, the mid-day heat and the cooling at sunset. It is regulated by rotation of the Earth.
Superimposed on the daily solar cycle is the monthly lunar cycle, driven by the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. These two cycles interact to produce variations in atmospheric pressure and tides, and currents in the oceans and the atmosphere. These are the daily weather makers.

The yearly seasonal cycle is caused as the tilted axis of Earth’s rotation affects the intensity of solar energy received by each hemisphere. This produces spring, summer, autumn and winter for every spot on Earth.
Then there is the 22 year sun-spot cycle, which correlates with cycles of floods and droughts. Sunspot cycles are indicators of solar activity which causes periods of global warming and cooling.
Original Research on Sunspots and Rainfall Cycles – Prof Will Alexander:
http://carbon-sense.com/2008/05/26/alexander-2008/
Variations on the sun also affect the intensity of cosmic rays reaching Earth’s surface – cosmic rays create nuclei for low level cloud formation, and the shading from such clouds reduces surface temperatures.
See:  http://www.globalwarming-sowhat.com/warm–cool-/cosmic-rays–clouds-0500.pdf
Earth’s climate is also disrupted periodically by the effects of changing winds, ocean hot spots and submarine volcanism that produce the El Nino Southern Oscillation.
The least recognised but most dangerous climate cycle is the glacial cycle. We are fortunate to live in the Holocene Epoch, the latest warm phase of the Pleistocene Ice Age. The climate history of the Holocene, and its predecessor the Eemian, are well documented in ice core logs and other records in the rocks. Each cycle consists of a glacial age of about 80,000 years followed by a warmer age of about 20,000 years, with the peak warming occurring over about 12,000 years. Our modern warm era commenced 12,000 years ago and peaked during the Medieval Warming, so it is probably nearing its end.
The Holocene Warmth as revealed by the Greenland Ice Cores:
http://carbon-sense.com/2009/10/03/climate-always-changing/
The Eemian Warm Period was warmer than today:
http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/news/news13/greenland-ice-cores-reveal-warm-climate-of-the-past/
There have been eight warm eras separated by long glacial winters over the last 800,000 years of the Pleistocene. In every beat of this cycle, the vast ice sheets melt, sea levels rise dramatically, coral reefs and coastal settlements are drowned, and forests and animals re-colonise the higher land released from the ice. Warm climate animals such as hippos, water buffaloes and elephants got as far north as Germany in the last warm era. Then suddenly the ice returned, covering the northern hemisphere as far south as Chicago and London, destroying the forests, lowering the seas, stranding the relocated coral reefs and eliminating unprepared species. (Some dopey grizzly bears got stranded in the Arctic Ice and the most enterprising of them survived to evolve into white grizzlies now called polar bears.)
How Grizzlies evolved into polar bears:
http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/arctic-bears-how-grizzlies-evolved-into-polar-bears/777/
This regular repetition of natural climate change is partially explained by the Milankovitch cycles relating to changes in Earth’s precession, orbit and tilt. These drive variations in solar energy received by Earth and have the greatest temperature effect on the large land masses of the Northern Hemisphere.
On an even longer time scale, oscillation of the solar system through the plane of the Galaxy seems to trigger magnetic reversals and violent spasms of volcanism, crustal movements, glaciation and species extinction. Earth is never still for long.
These cycles interact to produce a wide range of ever-changing temperatures. Even at the same moment, temperatures vary dramatically from the equator to the poles and from the surface to the stratosphere. For would-be climate “managers” to claim they can calculate a mythical “global temperature” with precision greater than thermometers can measure is statistical nonsense.
It is a wonder of the modern era that people who cannot accurately forecast next weekend’s weather claim they can regulate the temperature of the whole globe by bashing industry and taxing carbon.
What is the role of carbon dioxide in climate? Al Gore did a great job to dramatise the recurring glacial cycles in his widely acclaimed work of science fiction. But he missed two inconvenient truths.
First, ice cores show that in the glacial spring-time the temperature rose BEFORE the CO2 levels rose. Therefore the rising CO2 cannot be a CAUSE of the warming – it is a RESULT of CO2 being expelled from the warming oceans.
Second, at the top of every summer-time in the glacial cycle, the high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere were unable to prevent the cooling into the next cycle of ice.
We are already in the autumn of the current glacial cycle and nothing man can do will change that. Global temperatures today are lower than they were in Roman and Medieval times. They will still fluctuate with the effects of daily, lunar, yearly and sun-spot cycles, but the long-term trend of maximum and minimum temperatures will continue drifting downwards. Once summer temperatures in places like Siberia are unable to melt last winter’s snow, the already growing glaciers will join to form ice sheets and Earth will once again be gripped by another long Glacial Winter.
The transition from Greenhouse Earth to Icehouse Earth always occurs suddenly. Once our verdant greenhouse is gone, life on Earth will never be the same again. Greenhouse Earth will surely come around again, but many of today’s species will probably not survive to welcome the return of the warmth.
The warm days, seasons, years and epochs have never been a deadly threat to life on Earth. Frost, snow, hail and ice are the killers. If our descendants do not have the energy, resources and wisdom to keep their people warm and fed through the coming glacial epoch, humans may follow our Neanderthal cousins who perished in the last glacial winter, just 20,000 years ago.
There is NO evidence in climate history that carbon dioxide has a detectable effect on global temperatures. However if our continued use of cheap reliable hydro-carbon energy does slightly delay the onset of the next glacial winter, we and all life on Earth should count ourselves extremely lucky.

Nov 2015
Paris climate talks this week descended into madcap all-night negotiations, as delegates desperately tried to salvage some kind of agreement beyond empty promises to do something sometime about what President Obama insists is the gravest threat to our planet, national security and future generations.
In the end, what we apparently got out of Paris is voluntary emission caps, voluntary progress reviews, no international oversight of any voluntary progress, and voluntary contributions to the Fund.

Outpourings of climate bulldust over recent decades have been more alarming than changes in the climate.
Drought and above-average temperatures during recent El Niño-dominated years from 2001 to 2010 were deliberately and relentlessly marketed as global-warming. Driven incestuously by WWF and its Wentworth Group; green groups; Climate Commissioners; and a bunch of pretend-institutes, superlatives flew-up every greasy-pole out through talking-heads into the community’s ear.
Australians endured an endless chatter-based marketing campaign involving the ABC, CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology that intertwined CO2; the hot/critical decade; Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) “health”; and the carbon tax; grinding them into our national psyche. Science was reorganised with rivers of tax-payers cash enticing once-proud universities to lend brand to the cause. Every hot/cold/dry/wet day, clamouring professors popped out of disused broom-cupboards across the land, waving models and “new reports”. It was an overt scientifically-disingenuous beat-up.

https://carbon-sense.com/2015/11/29/what-message-will-malcolm-turnbull-take-to-paris/,,What message will Malcolm Turnbull take to Paris?,"By Geoff Derrick.
Our Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull lives on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour, and is in a favoured position to observe the climate moods and weather of the Sydney area in the 21st Century.
However, he should be aware that a considerable database exists that scientifically documents the climate history of Sydney Harbour and adjacent beaches, mainly temperature and sea levels, at least from the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788.  When Captain Philip arrived in 1788 and landed at Sydney Cove, he quickly established a weather recording framework to help him better understand what the climate trends might be in this new colony.  
Over a three year period from 1788 to 1791, two officers Bradley and Dawes recorded temperatures in the fledgling colony 6 times a day.  A log of this data was found in 1977 in a remote corner of the Library of the Royal Society of London, and the data were analysed and plotted by Gergis, Karoly and Allan in 2009. They compared the First Fleet data with BOM data from the Sydney Observatory for the period 1859 to 2014, using monthly averages for Tmaximum and Tminimum.  A graph comparing the First Fleet data set 1788-1791 with the BOM data set 1859 to 2014 is shown below, for Tmax.

Remarkably, the First Fleet data (red circles), are almost totally coincident with the later BOM record 1859 to 2014 (green dots); the same result is seen also for average minimum temperatures, and so Malcolm could justifiably claim that in the Sydney area there has been no change in trend of maximum and minimum temperatures over 256 years.
Data from the Fort Denison tide gauge in the harbour also shows an almost stable sea level trend for 129 years from 1886 to present day.  In addition, a fisherman’s hut built in 1875 along the high water mark at Long Reef, Collaroy has been photographed in 1907, 1936, 1950 and 2014; remarkably, it exists in precisely the same position now as in 1875, and Malcolm could also justifiably claim that in the Sydney northern beaches there has been no documented sea level rise for about 140 years.

A study of human history shows what a grave threat this poses to all of us.
Our distant ancestors were hunter-gatherers. They killed and ate wild animals, which provided much of their energy needs. Solar energy warmed their days, and gave life to the herbs, roots and fruits they gathered and to the grasses and shrubs that sustained their prey. Sunlight reflected from the moon allowed them to hunt and fish during moon-lit nights. The sun and moon dominated their world, so naturally many of them worshipped these heavenly bodies.
The invention of stone and wooden weapons and tools increased their access to energy – hunting and gathering was more efficient with tools.
The discovery of how to control fire multiplied man’s access to energy. Fire provided heat and light and could be used to clear vegetation, fight enemies and trap wild animals.
Hunter-gatherers need access to land, preferably free from competitors. This led to the development of territory with defined and defended property boundaries. Property rights are thus an essential ingredient to provide guaranteed access to food and energy.

Some hunters discovered they could harvest more food by maintaining their own tended plots of crops and vegetables and protecting domesticated goats, pigs, cattle and sheep from wild animals and poachers. Farms with fences allowed humans greatly increased access to the solar energy collected by plants and processed into human food by domesticated animals.
The long experiment with collective and tribal farming showed that individual farmers with secure property rights produce more food and are better at protecting the long term value of their land. Tribalism and open range grazing are key factors in the recurring famines in Africa.
Farmers soon realised that land with good soils, reliable water supplies and warm moist climate produces more food. A warrior class emerged to acquire and defend the tribe’s exclusive long-term access to these fertile fields.
Some tribes discovered they could trade their surplus food, tools or weapons for other goods in scarce supply. This free trade increased their access to food and energy.
Trade requires transport, and the use of oxen, horses, donkeys, mules and camels for transport was a great boost to trade. With a bridle and saddle, the horse allowed humans to hunt, patrol and defend a far larger territory.
The discovery of how to smelt metals from ores using charcoal provided another great leap in human access to energy. Metals made better ploughs, spears, swords, shields and digging forks.
But the giant leap for mankind was the progressive discovery of how to use that black shiny rock called “coal”; first in camp fires, then to smelt ores and, in a great energy leap, to power steam engines. Soon thousands of water pumps, factories, locomotives, traction engines, ships and electric generators were being driven by coal. Mankind gained access to an almost unlimited supply of energy via heat, light and motive power wherever it was needed.
The discovery of that other marvellous hydrocarbon, petroleum, gave humans access to a powerful source of portable energy. Tractors, trucks and buses replaced wagons, coaches, horses and bullocks, releasing more energy for humans.
This access to cheap reliable energy created widespread prosperity, families became smaller and people took more interest in conserving their heritage and environment.
Try to picture our world before we gained access to hydrocarbon energy – there was limited energy from wood, sun, wind and water but there were no trains, electricity, motor vehicles, appliances, hi-rise buildings, hi-tech hospitals or the millions of products produced by reliable electric-powered mining machinery, smelters, refineries, fabricators and factories. Famine and poverty were common occurrences and there was little concern for welfare, culture or the environment.
Cities which were choking in smog from open fires and boilers were also rescued by electricity – “the clean-coal-by-wire”. And in another bit of environmental serendipity, burning of these buried hydrocarbons is returning carbon dioxide to Earth’s carbon-deficient atmosphere to support more plant growth all over the globe.
We and the entire biosphere should celebrate having more CO2 in the atmosphere:
http://www.thegwpf.com/28155/
The harnessing of nuclear power then gave mankind the key to almost unlimited power for as long as people have enough sense to use it safely.
Earth’s growing human and animal population depend, more than ever, on maintaining this hard-won heritage of resources, rights, inventions and infrastructure. It is what ensures future access to reliable affordable food and energy.
Today the biggest threat to human well-being is the global war on carbon being run by climate-scare/sustainability zealots. They are trying to undermine and reverse centuries of discoveries and legal heritage.
But they know there is no practical possibility that we can reliably energise our world with the green energy of our ancestors, even if we smothered the surface with windmills and solar shades. Their secret dream is to destroy urbanised and industrialised humanity, ban private property and free trade, close the mines, factories, farms and fisheries, tear down the fences and dams and return the decimated human race to rationed, taxed and globally-controlled dormitories and urban play-grounds.
This is what these enemies of humanity really think:
“Giving society cheap, abundant energy would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun.”
-Prof Paul Ehrlich, Stanford University
“Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?”
-Maurice Strong, founder of the UN Environment Programme
“We must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and their projects. We must reclaim the roads and ploughed land, halt dam construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land. My three main goals would be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial infrastructure and see wilderness, with its full complement of species, returning throughout the world.”
-Dave Foreman, co-founder of Earth First!
“My vision is for a country, a society, a world where we don’t use any coal, oil, or natural gas because we have zero-emissions electricity in huge abundance,”
-Dr Alan Finkel, Australia’s new green government-appointed “Chief Scientist”.
And see here to learn what they think is “Unsustainable”: http://www.freedomadvocates.org/what-is-unsustainable/
These foes of freedom and their clandestine controllers are planning to forge the green chains of a global government for humanity in Paris next month.
They must not succeed.
We must defend our right to develop and use our own land, resources and property to produce abundant, reliable and affordable energy and food.
Tell our politicians: “Sign NOTHING that we can’t get out of, in Paris in December.”

Wednesday 28 October 2015
 Here is a list of key organisations actively promoting the war against civilisation. These are the internationalist thugs who want the poor to stay impoverished and the hungry to remain starving. These are the people who fraudulently claim tax deductibility for their actions in attacking every kind of genuine human progress. These are the dangerous elements who campaign to divert gigantic sums of public money into subsidising sources of energy which cannot function competitively without the assistance of stolen money.
Here is the list: Number one is GetUp!, leading the racist campaign against the Adani company, pushing the line that the poor of India have no right to the inexpensive energy which they crave because they are only Indians.
Number two is Greenpeace, infamous for many reasons including its campaign against DDT, which according to Robert Gwadz of the US National Institutes of Health “may have killed 20 million children” who died unnecessarily from malaria.
Number three is the Australian Conservation Foundation, which confers demigod status on the totally discredited fraudster Al Gore, and persists in its wholly false claim that governments give massive subsidies to the coal industry.
Number four is Seed, a relatively new arrival on the anti-civilisation block. Seed asserts on its Website: Climate Change is the biggest threat to Black Australia, which is a big call. Seed also proclaims: “Opening up our lands to mining is not a solution to black poverty.” Wise Australians such as Warren Mundine keep repeating that the solutions include jobs and training. Seed seems to be on the wrong team.
Number five is the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, which specialises in recycling. That is recycling propaganda from all the other anti-civilisation groups without contributing anything original or imaginative. And of course the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, like its allies, has an expert fundraising pitch to part the unwary from their dollars.

Number six is 350.org. On 21 May this year I had something to say about this bunch of economic saboteurs who were illegally occupying offices of the Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne. One clown fell off the roof and injured his ankle, poor chap. The same mob staged protests earlier in the same week in Auckland and in Ho Chi Minh City.
Number seven is Doctors for the Environment Australia which has three identifiable members one of whom is a doctor. Doctors for the Environment Australia hates coal and seems to have missed out on the information that without coal, medical science could not have progressed beyond the eighteenth century.
Number eight is Friends of the Earth, founded in 1969 and now with four and a half decades of expertise in posturing as some kind of charitable institution while pushing hardline anti-enterprise, anti-energy politics.
Number nine is Market Forces, a daughter organisation of Friends of the Earth. Market Forces specialises in bullying financial institutions into divestment campaigns. In other words they have chosen a name exactly the opposite of their beliefs and aspirations.
Number ten is the Wilderness Society, spawned as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society around 1976 to provide a spiritual home for lonely Lake Pedder Activists. For practical purposes the Wilderness Society is an extension of the Greens.
All ten of these anti-civilisation organisations have sponsored a letter signed by sixty-one self-appointed prominent Australians asking world leaders to consider a ban on new coal mines. I will have more to say about this in coming days, but II should mention some of the useful idiots – to use Lenin’s term – who have signed this fool letter. Professor Fiona Stanley, author Richard Flanagan, Bernie Fraser, Bishop George Browning and Wallaby David Pocock, who endorses the example of Peter Fitzsimons that skill and courage on the Rugby field do not necessarily bestow common sense.
I remind these sixty-one easily misled busybodies that their war on coal is a major threat to the poor and disadvantaged of the world. How dare you campaign to entrench their poverty and intensify their misery!
If you agree with me, back me up. If you disagree, prove me wrong.
More about the War on Coal
Grant Goldman Editorial, Super Radio Network Thursday 29 October 2015 Yesterday I listed ten organisations which are expert at extracting money from the public to purse their war against civilisation. These internationalist thugs skilfully portray themselves as motivated by humanitarian or conservationist ideas and love to illustrate their websites with furry animals which of course will all become extinct unless one immediately sends money. I explained that these are the people who fraudulently claim tax deductibility for their actions in attacking every kind of genuine human progress. They want the poor to stay impoverished and the hungry to remain starving. These ten organisations campaign to divert gigantic sums of public money into subsidising sources of energy which cannot function competitively without the assistance of stolen money.
And those ten organisations have again proved the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin dictum that there will always be plenty of useful idiots willing to help destroy society. They have found sixty- one useful idiots who have signed a letter asking world leaders to consider a ban on new coal mines. This foolishness has had wall-to-wall coverage on the ABC. In promoting hour after hour the self-styled sixty-one prominent Australians, to the best of my knowledge the National Broadcaster has scrupulously failed to mention the ten malign organisations who have been calling the shots. They are GetUp!, Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Seed, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, 350.org, Doctors for the Environment Australia, Friends of the Earth, Market Forces, and the Wilderness Society.
An interesting coincidence appears too good to be true for the enemies of civilisation. The war on coal letter just happened to appear concurrently with the appointment of Australia’s new chief scientist, who also wants to abolish coal. This chap also wants to abolish oil and gas. In fairness to Alan Finkel, his professed enthusiasm for nuclear energy sets him apart from most of the enemies of coal and saves him from being a total fool.
All nine of these anti-civilisation organisations have sponsored a letter signed by sixty-one self-appointed prominent Australians asking world leaders to consider a ban on new coal mines. I will have more to say about this in coming days, but II should mention some of the useful idiots – to use Lenin’s term – who have signed this fool letter. Professor Fiona Stanley, author Richard Flanagan, Bernie Fraser, Bishop George Browning and Wallaby David Pocock, who endorses the example of Peter Fitzsimons that skill and courage on the Rugby field do not necessarily bestow common sense.
Here are five facts about Australia Coal, quoting from Australasian Science Magazine of June 2012:
1. Coal was Australia’s first known export. It was first exported from Newcastle in 1799, and destined for Bengal in India.
2. The coal industry directly employs over 40,000 people and a further 100,000 indirectly.
3. Total production of raw black coal in Australia was 405 million tonnes in 2010-11. After processing, 326 million tonnes of black coal was available for both domestic use and for export.
4. Coal is the fuel for around 77% of Australia’s electricity.
5. Every year, the coal industry pays billions of dollars to Commonwealth and state governments in the form of corporate taxes, natural resource royalties, and payment of freight charges. Coal mines will pay an estimated $4.5 billion in royalties to state governments in 2011-12. This provides funding for hospitals, schools and roads.
There we are, just five of the important facts about coal.
Coal is part of Australia.
If you agree with me, back me up. If you disagree, prove me wrong.

https://carbon-sense.com/2015/10/09/know-about-the-terms-of-the-pokemon-go/,,Know About The Terms Of The Pokemon Go,"Games are one of the best pastime people consider. There is a huge variety of apps and games that game lovers can get on different devices like Android, iOS, and much more. These days, one of the most popular games is the Pokemon Go, which is an iOS and Android game that can be played without paying anything. This game comes from developer Niantic Labs. When you are interested in playing this game, there is no need to have proper knowledge of the Pokemon lore. With this game, you can have control on the cameras and GPS to serve up AR experience.
Know About The Terms Of The Pokemon Go
It is good to have a complete understanding of the terms used in this game. The below-mentioned names and phrases are used in the game play, have a look at them:
Pokeballs 
These are used to catch the Pokemon and help to build your team.
Pokestops
These are the blue supply stores that are dotted around the map. In these stores, all the items are stored that you are needed to play the game.
Lure and Incense Modules 
These are utilized to attract more Pokemon to your place. In the beginning, it is important to have a huge team that players can use to trade or fight for goodies further into the gameplay.
Factions 
This is the term that has considered as teams, which players are asked to join after grasping to the level 5. These teams will help you in determining which color a gym switches to when you are going to claim it. All you need to do is to choose your favorite color. Pokemesh apk Download
Stardust and candy 
One can consider these in the form of the supplements, which are helpful to make your Pokemon developed and stronger. These are of greater assistance to take over higher gyms.
Gyms
This is the term, which is available from level 5. These are situated at points of landmarks and interest. Controlling gyms is what you need to consider. Gyms are the landmarks, where the fights between the Pokemon and players take place.
Revives, Super Potions, and Potions 
Once you have played the hard fight, you need to get recovered for the next challenge. This is where these terms are considered.
Razzberries 
These are the terms that make the Pokemon to catch harder, which can be cultivated by feeding them these and getting their trust.
Eggs 
Pokemon Gois huge on XP. These are the lucky eggs, which you are interested in earning twice on XP. In fact, these normal eggs permit you in hatching more Pokemon to add to your Pokemon team.
When you realize these terms, you can easily play this game so that you can get an enhanced overall gameplay experience.

She came back agog: “Our Professor is flying business class to Canberra hoping to get on the climate cavalcade going to a classy conference in Paris soon. He says they have this important job to prepare the secret first draft of a new international treaty to save the world from your wicked coal-mining mates.”
I said they should put them all to work underground.
Later, I had a whinge about such travel rorts to our sensible neighbour, Fred McNally.
But Fred had a totally different view.
“It was not a bunch of airborne academics who concocted the Kyoto land grab that stopped me from feeding mulga to starving sheep – it was climate industry busybodies at their desks. Better if the whole green industry is kept in the air flying, or sipping champagne in Paris, rather than modelling carbon ration plans for us, or tramping over every proposed development site looking for skinks, toads and butterflies.”

Yesterday morning, before the frost had left the grass, I was sitting quietly beside my fashionably-green wood-burning heater reading the latest explanation in “The Green Gospel” on why the Arctic ice had not yet melted.
Suddenly Flora burst into the room like an Arctic Blizzard with a look on her face that said I was in big trouble.
“Did you tell that awful Professor Percival he could cut holes in Maria’s belly and leave her with a bum bag and a rubber sausage strapped to her back?”
Can’t believe this is happening? See the sheep torture paddock:
http://www.scienceimage.csiro.au/tag/sheep/i/1898/testing-sheep-for-methane-production/10
And see here where a whole team of apprentice professors are also torturing cows:
http://www.smh.com.au/victoria/diet-change-cuts-methane-emissions-in-cow-burps-20150804-girf6l.html
“It’s all right dear” I explained patiently, “The Prof has a new job researching how to stop sheep from adding carbon compounds to the atmosphere.” (Which means, translated crudely – “how to stop sheep from burping and farting”.) 
“Well tell him to torture that awful Dorper ram that butts me, not my darling Maria. Where are those animal cruelty people when I need them”?
The Prof had coached me on the settled-science story which I now relayed confidently to Flora: “Sheep and cows release lots of carbon-rich gases from both ends. The science says this will affect the atmosphere, heat up the globe, melt the ice caps and we will all drown.” 
“He is being paid big bucks to postpone that watery judgement day.”

Fred McNally, my crusty old neighbour on the other side, was not impressed with the Prof’s reasoning. 
“Surely even a dopey hobby farmer like Percival understands the carbon cycle? Every sheep has two inlet pipes – one for food and water, one for air. And it has three exhaust pipes for wastes – liquid, solids and gases. Sheep cannot manufacture carbon. Every atom of carbon coming out of a sheep’s exhaust pipes must have come in via that sheep’s feed pipes. And every atom of carbon in the sheep feed must come from the grass which gets it from… the atmosphere.” 

Cartoon credit: http://stevehunterillustrations.com.au/political-cartoons/
“Sheep live on recycled burps, belches and farts. Along the way, lots of carbon is tied up in woolly jumpers and in the bodies of sheep, lambs, dingos and hungry humans.”
“Why pick on a non-problem like sheep? Wild dogs have already eaten half of Australia’s flock – we need a predator among the plague of clueless Professors.”
“Can’t the silly old fart see that all sheep are green?”
In the sanctimonious cant of those who preach the green religion, sheep (and cattle) should be hailed as “carbon neutral”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2015/08/23/farmer-fred/,,Farmer Fred and the Professor,"The Percival Effect
Correlations, Causes and Dis-proofs
Every morning just before dawn our rooster crows and soon afterwards the sun comes up. We have observed no exceptions over three months – clear evidence of perfect correlation. Therefore we have concluded that the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise.
My wife Flora (who believes that the Cooee birds bring the rain) said: “I knew that ages ago – Professor Percival told me.”
So I consulted Professor Percival, our neighbour. He is Professor Emeritus in the “Science in Society” Department at Top-Line University. He specialises in the effect of sound waves on atmospheric transmissivity. He says that some roosters produce sound waves of just the right frequency to affect the dawn visibility through the thick morning atmosphere. He has written pal-reviewed papers on the subject which has been named “The Percival Effect”. In all the hallowed halls, it is regarded as “settled science”.

Cartoon credit: http://stevehunterillustrations.com.au/political-cartoons/
However, we decided that our rooster was not doing his day job, so he ended up as roast dinner last night.
Flora was very concerned – “what if the sun does not appear at all tomorrow?” she wailed.
But the sun rose as normal.
Flora was relieved but a concerned Professor Percival went off to check his calculations “for feedback loops”. He is still checking.
One thing was proved conclusively in just one day – the rooster’s crowing does not make the sun appear. Something else causes the sun to rise. Our ninety-two correlations did not prove causation. But just one disproof was needed to kill the Percival Effect.
So it is with the Greenhouse Effect. For about 20 years now, carbon dioxide levels have risen steadily but global temperatures are trending level. Therefore CO2 does not control global temperature.
One disproof is all that is needed.
“No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.” – Albert Einstein

https://carbon-sense.com/2015/07/17/stealing-from-biosphere/,,Green Energy Steals from the Biosphere,"Earth has only three significant sources of energy.
First is geothermal energy from Earth’s molten core and decaying radioactive minerals in Earth’s crust. This energy moves continents, powers volcanoes and its heat migrates towards the crust, warming the lithosphere and the deep oceans. It can be harvested successfully in favourable locations, and radioactive minerals can be extracted to provide large amounts of reliable heat for power generation.
Second is energy stored in combustible hydrocarbon minerals such as coal, oil, gas, tar sands and oil shale. These all store solar and geothermal energy collected eons ago and they are the primary energy sources supporting the modern world and its large and growing populations.
Third are radiation and gravitational energies from the Sun and Moon which are captured by the biosphere as heat, winds, tides, rain, rivers and in biomass such as forests, crops and animals. These are the natural “Green” energies that support all processes of life and still support a peasant existence for some peoples.
Green zealots believe that we can and should run modern societies exclusively on “Green” energies, and they have embarked on a war on hydrocarbons. They need to be told that their green energy favourites are just stealing from the biosphere – they are not as green as they claim.

The most obvious example is the ethanol industry which takes food crops like corn, sugar and palm oil and uses heaps of water and a lot of hydrocarbon energy to convert them to ethanol alcohol which will burn in internal combustion engines, but has less energy density than petrol.
See: The Water and Corn costs to produce Ethanol:
http://gazette.Com/the-water-and-corn-cost-for-a-gallon-of-ethanol/article/1506579
This process is replacing natural grasslands and forests with artificial monocultures.
The latest stupid ethanol suggestion is to power Obama’s “wanna-be-green” US Pacific Fleet using Queensland food crops. Feeding ethanol to the engines of the US Navy would consume far more food than was used feeding hay and grain to the thousands of horses used to move our artillery and Light Horse Brigades in the Great War. Sailors in the British Navy got much of their energy from Jamaican Rum, but the American navy will not run on Queensland ethanol whiskey.
More: World turning against Biofuels:
http://www.cfact.org/2014/06/02/a-world-turning-against-biofuels/
Biomass is a fancy name for plant material and vegetable trash which, if maintained in/on the soil, will provide the fertility for the next crop. Burning it reduces the humus that maintains fertile soil. The ultimate biomass stupidity is to harvest American forests, pelletise them, dry them and ship them across the Atlantic (all using hydrocarbon fuels) to burn in a UK power station. Burning biomass produces the same emission gases as coal.
Most plants will not grow without energy from the sun. Solar arrays steal energy directly from the biosphere. Some incoming solar energy is reflected to space by the panels, some is converted to waste heat on the panels, and some is converted to electricity – much of which ends up as waste heat. Solar radiation that could have given energy to growing plants is largely returned to the atmosphere as waste heat and much is then lost to space.
Some solar farms are built over land that is already a desert – the rest create their own deserts in their shadow. Because solar energy is very dilute, very large areas of land must be shaded and sterilised by the panels in order to collect significant energy.
Solar radiation also evaporates water from the oceans and provides the energy for rain, winds and storms. Much of this moisture falls as useful rain when the winds penetrate land masses. Wind turbines create artificial obstacles to the wind, reducing its velocity and thus tending to create more rain near the coast and rain shadows behind the turbine walls. And they chop up many birds and bats. Again, green energy harms the biosphere.

Hydro power is one of the few green energy sources that is “grid ready” and can supply economical reliable energy. So, naturally, many greens are opposed to it. However, in most places there is competition for fresh water for domestic uses, irrigation, industry and environmental flow. Hydro power is just one more competitor for this valuable green resource.
So… Green energy is not so green after all. It reduces the supply of food, water and energy available to all life on earth, and it often consumes large amounts of hydrocarbon energy for its manufacture, construction, maintenance and backup.
Green advocates are enemies of the poor. They want to burn their food, waste their water and deny them access to cheap reliable energy.
Hydrocarbon fuels are the true green energy sources. They disturb less land per unit of energy produced, they do not murder wildlife, and their combustion produces new supplies of water and carbon dioxide for the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere enables plants to grow faster, bigger and more able to cope with heat or drought.
It was coal, and later oil, which created and still largely supports the populations, prosperity and industry of developed nations. With a backdrop of freedom under the law, they can do the same for the whole world.
Those professing concern for the poor need to realise that Green Energy steals from the biosphere and that hydrocarbons are the real friends of the poor.
Finally, those who have swallowed the carbon dioxide scare should be told that nuclear energy is the most reliable and least damaging “low carbon” option.

Before Constantine, Romans worshipped 12 main gods including Apollo (the Sun), Diana (the Moon), Flora (the plants), Uranus (the sky), Ceres (the crops), Gaia (the Earth) and of course Bacchus (wine), Venus (love) and Mars (war). Some of these gods demanded tribute and sacrifice.
Christianity, the worship of one forgiving God, slowly absorbed or eliminated its pagan rivals. The Popes in Rome came to lead a Catholic empire of Christians. In modern times, the old Greek/Roman goddess, Gaia, has been resurrected by the world green movement.

Pope Francis seems to seek an alliance with these nature worshippers. Unfortunately the Green wolf will never lie down with the Christian lambs. Christians promote care for humanity especially the weak and the poor. The Gaia worshippers have subordinated humans to “nature” and their attitude to other humans ranges from contempt to deep hatred. Under their extremist Agenda 21, the priests of Gaia would sacrifice humans by restricting their access to land, oceans, food, minerals and energy, and then concentrate the survivors in soul-destroying dormitory cities and food factories. Greens want all descendants of Adam and Eve expelled from our Gardens of Eden.
Christians generally value individual freedom and private property. The Green priesthood will not rest until there is a world government in which there is no private property and all humans are numbered, controlled and planned. They are using climate alarmism to achieve these goals.

Source: http://stevehunterillustrations.com.au/political-cartoons/
Modern industrial society commenced with the use of coal and oil to power factories, trains,
ships and agriculture and to generate electricity. With abundant energy, prosperity increased,
and people could save enough to support leisure, education, culture and environmental
concerns.
But the dark greens have a dream to dismantle all this, and return society to the hunter/gatherer
era.
In an unguarded moment Maurice Strong, a leader of the international green movement, said:
“Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn’t it our
responsibility to bring that about?”
Greens have thus gleefully spread the global warming scare to justify a massive political war on
hydro-carbon fuels. Timothy Wirth, ex-President of the UN Foundation, spilt the beans:
“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is
wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.”
http://carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/exposing-the-green-agenda.pdf
To mask their real aim of de-energising modern industry, they continually promote “alternative
energy”.
The only alternatives to coal, oil and gas for stable, reliable and economical grid power are
nuclear energy, and in favourable locations, hydro or geothermal.
Nuclear power could be one of our cheapest and safest energy sources. However greens have
opposed and denigrated it for decades, and erected such bureaucratic and financial hurdles that
it is seldom considered in most pampered western societies.
They are in favour of hydro, providing it does not disturb one fish or frog on their favourite river.
But they continually spruik the benefits of wind and solar power.
Wind/solar can be useful in some mobile or remote locations, and for some people with deep
pockets who wish to become independent of the grid. But being totally unable to supply 24/7
grid power, they need reliable backup (or massive batteries) for about 75% of their rated
capacity. Once we subtract the energy and resources needed to build and maintain the
towers/panels, plus the roads and transmission lines, plus backup/batteries and then run it all
intermittently, the whole-of-life net-contribution of wind/solar to energy supply or emission
reduction is negligible or negative.
Another dark green leader, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountains Institute, said:
“It would be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap,
abundant energy, because of what we might do with it.”
Green energy policy promotes this dictum by supporting “Nothing that Works”.
The world focus on carbon dioxide is simply a useful tool in a much larger political agenda:

This crystallised in my mind the idiocy of this event – everyone knows candles produce more CO2 per lumen than the incandescent bulb, and lots more than a fluorescent bulb. 
This is symbolic of the retreat from reason that is Earth Hour – not one single coal-powered station in the country will shut down for earth hour, so no power will be saved, it will instead be wasted.
The fact that “2,848 cities, towns and municipalities in 84 countries have already committed to Vote Earth for Earth Hour 2009” is evidence of nothing but a form of mass hysteria.
The fact that China, India and emerging countries lead the call for action on climate change is a cynical act of hypocrisy, given that they are calling for action by everyone else but China, India and emerging countries. 
These countries are themselves the fastest growing “polluters” in the world – China now exceeds the carbon footprint of the USA, and India is not far behind.
The Vote Earth movement seems to me to be a rejection of the Age of Enlightenment in favour of a return to the dim glow of medieval ignorance, where modern-day peasants will sit smugly in the dark as a form of Mother Nature worship. 
As Earth Hour asks us to symbolically turn off the light of reason, I have decided to Vote Human instead and turn every light in the house on tomorrow night – I encourage you all to do the same.

What great cause could unite Prince Charles, President Obama, the Pope, the Arab Oil sheiks, the United Nations, the European Union, the Russians, the Chinese, Pacific Island Nations, most undeveloped countries, the glitterati of Hollywood, left-wing politicians, unrepentant reds, government media, the climate research industry, Big Oil, Big Gas and the Green Blob. It must be something posing a clear and urgent danger to all humanity?
No, the crusade that unites them all is the War on Carbon Fuels, focussed mainly on that most vilified target, coal.
The biggest group, and the generals in this war on carbon, have no real interest in the facts or science of global climate change – they see climate alarmism as a great opportunity to achieve their goal of creating an unelected global government. They have even laid out their plans in a document called Agenda 21.
This group naturally includes the United Nations and all of its subsidiaries, the EU, and left wing politicians and media everywhere. At a news conference in Brussels recently, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, admitted that the goal of environmental activists is not to save the world from ecological calamity, but “to change the economic development model” i.e. destroy what is left of free enterprise and private property. See:

http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/10/10/shell-oil-lego-greenpeace-and-the-environmental-movement-s-war-on-capitalism/

The next big group of carbon warriors is the anti-western failed states who see this as their big chance to enrich and entrench their ruling classes with “climate reparations”.
Then there are the enviro-entrepreneurs forever seeking new crusades to energise their supporters and get the donations rolling in – Greenpeace, WWF, Get Up etc…
In the dark corner are the anti-human Malthusians and the Deep Greens who want to get rid of most of us other people – personified by the rich and powerful such as Prince Charles and Maurice Strong. They know that carbon fuels support millions of people by cultivating, harvesting, transporting, processing and storing most of the food that supports the cities of the world. Killing the use of carbon fuels will certainly achieve their goal of reduced world population. See:
http://explosivereports.com/2013/01/12/prince-charles-openly-endorses-draconian-conclusions-of-new-population-study/
Naturally, government media usually supports a bigger role for government, and all media likes a scare story. Truth or logic does not matter greatly for most of them – just so long as they can coax a looming disaster story from someone. The daily diet of natural calamities soon heightens climate anxiety, which then motivates politicians to be seen to be “doing something”.
And then there are those who see that fighting carbon fuels also suits their pockets. As someone said “When placing a bet, the best horse to back is the one called ‘Self-interest’ – at least you know he is trying”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2015/02/03/the-global-warming-scare-is-based-on-an-error-in-feedback-assumptions/,,The Global Warming Scare is Based on an Error in Feedback Assumptions,"A group of leading climate researchers has identified a fatal flaw in the climate models that leads them to produce triple the global warming predicted from doubling the CO2 in the air.
CO2 in the atmosphere has some warming effect on Earth’s climate, but undisputed science shows that each additional CO2 molecule we emit has less warming effect than all its predecessors already in the air.
The direct warming effect of doubling the CO2 in the air is generally agreed to be little more than 1 C°. However climate models produce exaggerated warming forecasts by assuming that strongly positive or amplifying temperature feedbacks, such as the increased capacity of warmer air to carry water vapour, a greenhouse gas. They assume that these positive feedbacks will turn 1 C° of direct warming into 3 C° of imagined catastrophe.
They model this assumed feedback with a feedback system-gain equation which is at the heart of every climate model. The equation, however, is borrowed from electronic circuitry. It is not applicable to dynamical systems such as the Earth’s atmosphere.
However, a growing body of learned papers in the climate-science journals (e.g. Lindzen & Choi, 2009, 2011; Spencer & Braswell, 2010, 2011) consider that climate feedbacks are net-negative, moderating rather than intensifying the 1 C° direct warming from a CO2 doubling.

Global temperature has fluctuated by little more than 3.5 C° either side of the long-run average over the past 810,000 years. That range is little more than the range of settings on your home thermostat. If the rogue equation applied to the climate, it could not have been this stable for so long.

https://carbon-sense.com/2015/01/17/green-energy-is-past/,,"Green Energy Powered our Past, but cannot Provide for our Future","Climate Alarmists turn back the Clock
Three centuries ago, the world ran on green power. Wood was used for heating and cooking, charcoal for smelting and smithing, wind or water-power for pumps mills and ships, and whale oil or tallow for lamps. People and soldiers walked or rode horses, and millions of horses and oxen pulled ploughs, wagons, coaches and artillery.
But smoke from open fires choked cities, forests were stripped of trees, most of the crops went to feed draft animals, and streets were littered with horse manure. For many people, life was “nasty, brutish and short”.
Then the steam engine was developed, and later the internal combustion engine, electricity and refrigeration came along. Green power was replaced by coal and oil. Carbon energy powered factories, mills, pumps, ships, trains, and smelters; and cars, trucks and tractors replaced the work-horses. The result was a green revolution – forests began to regrow and vast areas of crop-land used for horse feed were released to produce food for humans. Poverty declined and population soared.
But new environmental problems emerged. Smoke pollution from burning cheap dirty coal in millions of open fires, old boilers and smelters produced massive smog problems in cities like London and Pittsburgh.
The solution was improved technology, sensible pollution-control laws and the supply of coal gas and coal-powered electricity to the cities. The air was cleared by “Clean Coal by Wire” at the flick of a switch and “Piped Coal Energy” at the click of a gas-lighter. In some places use of hydro, geothermal and nuclear power also helped.
In recent years, however, affluent urban alarmists have declared war on the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal, oil and gas. They claim it is a pollutant and it causes dangerous global warming.

The pollutant claims are easy to refute.
The worst air pollution in the world today is the Asian smog. Smog is very visible – but carbon dioxide is a transparent gas that is exhaled by all living creatures.
Smog is air polluted with particulates and noxious gases – but there are no particulates or noxious components in carbon dioxide. Therefore carbon dioxide plays no part in creating smog.
Smog consists of ash particles, unburnt fuels and noxious gases produced by the inefficient combustion of anything, usually in open fires or obsolete boilers engines or smelters with no pollution control equipment. Wind-blown dust, bush and forest fires, blue haze from forests and drifting volcanic ash add to the smog. Modern coal-fired power stations with efficient pollution controls do not release detectable particulates or noxious gases. Bans on dirty combustion and more clean electricity will clear the smog of Asian cities.
All gases in the atmosphere have an effect on global climate, usually a moderating one, reducing the intense heat of the midday sun and reducing the rate of cooling at night. But only in theoretical climate models does carbon dioxide drive global warming – real evidence contradicts them.
The unrelenting war on carbon fuels has far greater risks, with some zealots advocating “Zero Emissions”, while also, incredibly, opposing nuclear and hydro-power. They would take us all back to the BC Era (before coal).
Already urban environmentalists are polluting city air by burning wood (“biomass”) and briquetted paper in stoves and home heaters; and trying to prevent millions in Asia and Africa from getting cheap clean electricity. Other misguided nations are clearing forests and transporting low-energy wood chips to burn in distant power stations. And the high costs of green energy are already forcing some poor people to burn old books and strip parks and forests for fire-wood.
In addition, crops that once fed people are now making “green” ethanol to fuel cars, and native forests are being cleared and burnt to make way for more fuel crops. Our modern “Iron Horses” are eating the crops again.
The use of carbon fuels in the production, fertilising, transport and storage of food has been a major factor in allowing the world population to grow by several billions since the start of the industrial revolution. If climate alarmists succeed in turning back the clock, food and energy will again become reserved for the rich and powerful, and billions of poor people will die of starvation or exposure.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/12/07/green-and-defenceless/,,Green and Defenceless,"Wake Up Australia: we are becoming Green and Defenceless.
As Australia’s industrial capacity declines, Australia is becoming green and defenceless. History holds lessons.
Back in Dec 1941, Japan suddenly attacked the huge US Naval base at Pearl Harbour. Three days later, two “invincible” British warships, “Repulse” and “Prince of Wales” were sunk by Japanese planes off Malaya. Soon Japanese armies were rampaging through Asia towards Australia. By Feb 1942, the “impregnable” British fortress of Singapore surrendered and Japanese bombs were falling on Darwin. By Sept 1942 the Japanese army had slashed their way down the Kokoda Track and could see the lights of Port Moresby. They were looking across Torres Strait to Australia. At that time, most of our trained soldiers were fighting Rommel in North Africa or in Japanese prison camps.
Suddenly Australia was on its own and needed to defend itself with what we had here.
Armies need soldiers, weapons, bullets, vehicles, fuel, food, alcohol (and cigarettes).
Soldiers volunteered and were conscripted. Australian conscripts formed part of the force that met the Japanese on the Kokoda Track.
Of course Australia had very few engineering tools when war broke out, especially key tools like lathes. F W Hercus Manufacturing started making a copy of the famous American Southbend lathe in the 1940’s. These machines were installed in factories around Australia and used to make small parts for the war effort. Most of the lathe operators were women.
Enfield Rifles, Bren Guns and Vickers Machine Guns were produced in large numbers at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow supported by feeder factories in the area. Britain lost so many weapons at Dunkirk that Australian factories were sending guns to them. We could not do that now.
Motor oil was produced in limited quantities from oil shale at Glen Davis, but petrol was in serious short supply, and had been rationed since 1940. With the fall of Singapore, this shortage became severe, and charcoal burners suddenly appeared to keep cars and trucks moving. Kerosene was scarce so carbide lights were widely used. The demand for charcoal was so great that firewood became scarce so it was also rationed.
To conserve supplies for soldiers, rationing was introduced for tea, clothing, butter, sugar, meat and cigarettes. Hotels were only allowed to serve alcohol twice a day for one hour at a time of their choosing.
An immediate critical shortage was copper for cartridge cases and communications – Australia had mines producing lead, zinc, silver, gold and iron, but there was a critical shortage of copper. Fortuitously, just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, an exploration drill hole at Mount Isa had struck rich copper ore.
Mount Isa was called on to avert a calamitous shortage of copper in Australia. With government encouragement, Mount Isa Mines made the brave decision to suspend the profitable silver/lead/zinc operations and convert all mining and treatment facilities to extracting copper.
The lead concentrator could be converted to treat copper ore, but the biggest problem was how to smelt the copper concentrates. Luckily the company had skilled engineers and metallurgists in the lead smelter. In a miracle of improvisation, scrap steel and spare parts were purchased and scavenged from old mines and smelters from Cloncurry, Mt Elliott, Mt Cuthbert and Kuridala and cobbled into a workable copper smelter. In 1943 the first Mount Isa blister copper was produced. Production continued after the war when Mount Isa returned to extracting the then more profitable silver/lead/zinc. Later new plant was built enabling both lead and copper metal to be produced from this fabulous mine.
This story of the importance of self-reliance has lessons for today.

The war on carbon energy, the carbon tax, the renewable energy targets, escalating electricity costs and the voices in Parliament calling for Emissions Trading Schemes have all unnerved our big users of carbon fuels and electricity. Smelting and refining have become threatened industries in Australia, and closure of the Mount Isa copper smelter and the Townsville copper refinery has been foreshadowed. Already six major metal smelting/refining operations have closed in Australia this century and more are likely. The closures have affected copper, lead, zinc, steel and aluminium – the sinews of modern industry. And the car industry, with all its skills and tools, is closing. Like many of Australia’s engineering shops, F W Hercus ceased production of lathes in 2001.
More and more land and offshore waters are totally closed to exploration and mining. Offshore exploration for oil is very limited, except in the north-west. On land, there is no exploration in green no-go areas and the “lock-the-gate” rent-a-crowd are trying to prevent gas explorers from drilling even on their own exploration tenements. Local production and refining of oil is also declining, and it was estimated recently that by next year, half of Australia’s oil refining capacity will have closed. In the event of a disruption to tanker routes, Australia has just 12 days of diesel supplies before city fuel and food supplies start to dry up. Will we see charcoal burners on cars and trucks once again?
Heavy industry is scorned, and is migrating to Asia. We are losing the resources, skills and machinery needed for our own security, while we fritter away precious resources on green energy, direct action, carbon capture and storage and other pointless anti-carbon chimeras.
Our foolish green energy policies and the suicidal war on carbon fuels are killing real industry leaving us unskilled and defenceless – like a fat toothless walrus basking on a sunny beach.
Wake up Australia.

In his new book, The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, Alex Epstein makes one of the most compelling arguments for the moral value of fossil fuels and the need to increase their use I have ever read.
Epstein is an ethical humanist; for him, the well-being of human life is the standard of value public policy should maximize. This ethical theory goes back to the ancient Greeks and went virtually unchallenged as a basis for judging right and wrong throughout human history, at least until recently.
Unfortunately, many prominent environmental writers have rejected humanism, instead embracing a biocentric philosophy that views human changes to the environment as morally wrong and unnatural. For those biocentrists, minimizing human impacts on the environment is the primary moral goal. As such, biocentrism is a prescription for human poverty, disease, starvation, and premature death – in other words, an endorsement of the world as experienced by all but the wealthiest individuals for the vast majority of human history.

Epstein points out the development and use of fossil fuels have benefitted the poor far more than the rich, making available to the person of average means, food, goods, and services which even the rulers of old could hardly dream of.
Chapter by chapter, through clear and concise analysis, Epstein demonstrates why fossil fuels are the greatest energy technology of all time; why renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are in no position to replace them; why concerns about global warming are overstated and largely misplaced; how fossil fuel use actually improves environmental quality; and why, with more than 1.3 billion people in the world today without access to electricity and the labor and life-saving bounty it makes available, it would be immoral to artificially restrict growth in the use of fossil fuels to prevent climate change.
Assuming human welfare is one’s primary moral standard, a number of important takeaways from this book arise. I’ll list three:

One should look at the big picture when determining the value of using fossil fuels – not just the costs or potential harms to humans. If one has an open mind, it is apparent fossil fuels provide important benefits to humankind, unmatched by any other fuel source at current prices with current technology. The benefits of fossil fuels far outweigh the harmful by-products resulting from their use, even if one believes they contribute to global warming.


“Climate is no longer a major cause of deaths, thanks in large part to fossil fuels. … Not only are we ignoring the big picture by making the fight against climate danger the fixation of our culture, we are ‘fighting’ climate change by opposing the weapon that has made it dozens of times less dangerous. The popular climate discussion has the issue backwards. It looks at man as a destructive force for climate livability, one who makes the climate dangerous because we use fossil fuels. In fact, the truth is the exact opposite; we don’t take a safe climate and make it dangerous; we take a dangerous climate and make it safe. High-energy civilization, not climate, is the driver of climate livability.”


Even if human-caused CO2 emissions do pose a significant threat of dangerous climate change, the way to deal with climate danger is to develop technologies that allow humans to adapt to, mitigate, or prevent climate harms.

Restricting or ending fossil fuel use is a recipe for disaster. It would set human civilization back centuries – a true death knell for present and future generations. The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels makes this point as well or better than any other book I recall reading. The book is easily readable by anyone who has passed high school freshman English, and I encourage all those interested in learning about the threats of global warming and the relative benefits and harms of fossil fuel use to read it with an open mind. It will give you much to think about.

Governments are running huge deficits, but still spend billions on “climate research” especially trying to model the effect of the atmosphere and its trace of carbon dioxide on surface temperature. Benefits are hard to find. It may have improved weather forecasts by a day or so, but official long-term predictions have not improved in the last fifty years. This is because carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is not the main driver of weather or climate.

“What is referred to reverently as “climate research” is mainly just grubby advocacy supporting the political war on carbon. Why are we still funding scientists who believe that “the science is settled”? If they believe that they know the answers, what are they are doing with their research funds?”
Around the world there are five official weather data-bases, about 14 weather satellites (some say there are 88 of them!), 73 climate computer models, at least 30 research groups and thousands of academics receiving grants and attending never-ending climate conferences. Much of this torrent of public money is now focussed on trying to torture a climate confession out of one normally un-noticed and totally innocent trace gas in the atmosphere – carbon dioxide.
The major determinants of surface weather are latitude, earth’s rotation, the seasons, the sun with its variable radiations and orbital changes; and nearness to the oceans which maintain the water cycle, moderate temperatures and house massive volcanic chains.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/11/15/does-carbon-dioxide-cause-warming-the-data-say-no/,,Does Carbon Dioxide Cause Warming? The Data Say NO," On 22 September, the winter maximum ice sheet extent across the Antarctic reached its greatest area since satellite measurement of the ice extent began in 1979 [1].
This is consistent with satellite lower tropospheric temperature data for the South Polar region at Dr Roy Spencer’s Web site [2] which reveals a slight but not statistically significant rate of cooling for the region for the 36 years of satellite measurement.
Coinciding with this, measurements of the atmospheric CO2 have been collected by NOAA at the South Pole and the data is available on the World Meteorological Organisation Web site [3]. It shows that the CO2 concentration has increased by 17.7% in the same period.
Confirmation of this disparity is available on the WMO Web site where measurements by CSIRO are provided for the CO2 concentration at the Antarctic stations of Casey [4] and Mawson [5]. Comparison of the CO2 concentration with the station’s average temperature data, available at the Bureau of Meteorology Web site [6], showed that both stations have experienced slight, -0.78 deg C per century at Casey and -1.43 deg C per century at Mawson, but not statistically significant cooling over the terms of the measurement. However the CO2 concentration has increased at Casey by 9% in 16.5 years and at Mawson 11.4% in 23 years.
These results are clear evidence that the IPCC proposition that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration causes warming of the Earth’s surface is invalid. As the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 has been much the same across the whole of the globe, the above puts paid to the CO2 – global warming fraud.

By Richard Treadgold
Len Mills sends us a study of wind farms reported in the Daily Mail. It emerges that their real production history falls a long way short of the breathless claims some make for them.
I too wish to save the world, but not by using wind turbines, because they’ll ruin us first. They’re expensive, ugly, short-lived, noisy to the point of ill-health, ugly, kill bats and birds, they stop generating if there’s too little or too much wind, they demand lots of rare metals and they’re ugly. 
Incidentally, if you actually want to contaminate a dependable schedule with a wind turbine’s unpredictable variability, a wind farm needs instant, reliable backup (meaning fossil-fuelled spinning reserve), meaning you greatly increase your establishment costs, about double your operating costs and your CO2 emissions are not reduced by a jot or tittle. I ought to mention they brutalise the landscape.

 Carbon Farming Initiative Bill
 2nd Reading
Parliament House, Canberra
 31 October, 2014
Bob Day AO
 Senator for South Australia
Thank you Mr President.
This year the world will enjoy its greatest grain crop on record. Let me say that again. This year the world will enjoy its greatest grain crop on record. After the world food security crisis of 2007 which saw civil unrest in some countries, it is fantastic to see that in just 7 years we are producing record amounts of food for a growing world population. The US Department of Agriculture recently raised global crop predictions for corn, soy and wheat. Yet the World Bank indicates that over the last 10 reporting years, the percentage of agricultural land worldwide has not changed.
So what is driving this world food production boom?
Mr President, plants are thriving on the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A recent study showed that climate modellers over-estimated the amount of carbon dioxide that would remain in the atmosphere. Lo and behold, they have now discovered that plants are soaking up the additional carbon dioxide and growing more vigorously. Plants and trees and crops will absorb 130 billion tonnes more carbon dioxide this century than expected. It’s called the ‘carbon dioxide fertilisation effect’. This is not just a benefit to food crops- it is a boon to native vegetation, from the ancient forests to desert scrub that environmental activists have been trying to preserve for decades. Then there is the latest science on how the oceans are absorbing carbon dioxide with plankton growing faster than previously thought.
So why is this Government spending billions of dollars to reduce this airborne saviour of vegetation and food crops?
I am stunned by the number of politicians who are either ignorant or wilfully misleading the public on this topic. A whole political industry has developed around new arcane language to describe what we have known for centuries about producing food and improving our environment. A whole false economy has developed, fuelled by taxpayer funding through an Emissions Reduction Fund, An Emissions Trading Scheme, Renewable Energy Targets, The Renewable Energy Agency, The Climate Change Authority, Climate Change Departments and more. This Bill seeks to subsidise activities because they have so-called ‘co-benefits’ – well, if there are benefits in activities that also arguably help the environment, people should be doing them anyway without massive taxpayer subsidies – just as landfill operators have been doing – and I commend them for doing so over the years – in capturing gas emissions from landfills, until the rent seeking, carpet-bagging, bootlegging crony capitalists jumped on the climate change bandwagon to suck money from the taxpayer.
With the carbon tax, families felt and could clearly see for the first time the direct impact on their personal budgets from spending money to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This Emissions Reduction Fund is no different, but by sleight of hand people will be less able to see how their taxes will need to stay higher than they should be in order to pay for this scheme.
Taking money from low-income families and spending it on dodgy activities with a spurious scientific basis punishes the poor, rewards the rent-seekers and churns money in taxes, grants and rebates.
Mr President, Australia can not afford this Emissions Reduction Fund during what the Government has told us is a budget emergency.
While many families struggle with the cost of living, while mums and dads struggle to find jobs to make ends meet, the Government spends their money appeasing high-income elites enthralled by this latest cause and championed by celebrities, self-promoting ‘experts’ and certain elements of the media.
Rent-seekers like wind tower companies and solar panel manufacturers get paid handsomely and advocates in the climate change industry are living very nicely off the system flying around in private jets irrespective of whether these schemes improve the environment or human living conditions.
$2.5bn of taxpayers money spent on reducing carbon dioxide to stop so-called global warming while Arctic and Antarctic sea ice is growing. Growing, not shrinking. It’s bizarre!
I am dismayed that honest, intelligent people in this place can sit mute and watch this blatant trashing of both science and economics.
Mr President, I have a science background but any high school student can tell you that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. CO2 in the atmosphere is not pollution!
Now I know there are colleagues in this chamber who agree with me on all this but feel they must toe a party line but I for one am not so constrained and perhaps I speak for them also in saying that I will not sit mute and support this nonsense.
Minister Cormann told this place just two days ago, and I quote:
“Coal is good. Coal is good. It is at the heart of our economic prosperity here in Australia and around the world. It has helped lift living standards for people right across the world. It will continue to help lift living standards around the world.”
If that is so, if colleagues believe in all good conscience that this Bill is wrong, then I urge them to speak up – don’t be scientific girly men!
I oppose the Bill.

Dr. Patrick Moore has been a leader in the international environmental field for over 40 years. He is a co-founder of Greenpeace and served for nine years as President of Greenpeace Canada and seven years as a Director of Greenpeace International. The leader of many Greenpeace campaigns (e.g. “Save the Whales”, seal hunting), he was a member of the Rainbow Warrior crew when the anti-nuclear testing ship was bombed in Auckland Harbour.  Dr. Moore was a driving force shaping policy and direction while Greenpeace became the world’s largest environmental activist organization.
He left Greenpeace in 1986 because of his concern at the anti-science and extreme political policies it was adopting; nevertheless, he remains passionately concerned about the environment and describes himself as a “sensible environmentalist”. This, of course makes him a most controversial figure as the current Greenpeace policies are not aligned with his “sensible” view.  He is visiting Australia to explain why his view of catastrophic global warming differs from that of the extreme green movement.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/10/06/time-to-kill-kyoto-protocol/,,Time to Kill Kyoto Protocol?,"The Kyoto Protocol was dreamed up by the Climate Jet-set in Kyoto, Japan in 1997.
One of the first decisions of born-again-green PM, Kevin Rudd, was to commit Australia to Kyoto Phase 1 in 2007. This treaty required signatories to reduce production of carbon dioxide to 5% below 1990 levels by 2012.
As a late joiner, Australia got a lower target, involving no actual cuts. And they achieved that easy target by robbing Australian landowners – they stole carbon credits from landowners by imposing tree clearing bans. That larcenous trick can’t be pulled twice.
Ironically, the death notice for the Kyoto misadventure was posted by Japan, the birthplace of Kyoto, when they announced at Cancun in 2010 that Japan would not agree to any further targets. Japan was shocked at the billions in liabilities they had accumulated by not meeting Kyoto 1 target cuts.
Undeterred by this warning, another ALP/Green government agreed to Kyoto 2 in 2012 – 5% below 2000 levels by 2020.
This target, agreed to without due diligence, is dreamland stuff for Australia. Once the growing population is taken into account, this target would require Australians in 2020 to maintain industries and create new jobs using 30% less hydro-carbon energy per capita than was used in 2000.
Mining and mineral processing, agriculture, manufacturing, transport, tourism, electricity generation, cement, forestry and fishing are the backbone industries of Australia.
Not one of these industries could maintain production while also significantly reducing their production of carbon dioxide, unless Australia embarks on a crash program of building new hydro and/or nuclear power stations. The chance that green regulators or politicians will allow either of these options any time soon is zero.
The use of carbon fuels, more than any other indicator, measures the growth and health of modern economies. The only way to kill carbon is to kill the economy – close industries or send them overseas. The Global Financial Crisis probably did more to reduce the use of hydro-carbon fuels than Kyoto will ever do.
Japan’s exit from Kyoto obligations was soon followed by Canada and Russia. USA never signed, nor did China, India, South Africa or Brazil.
Thus the four biggest economies in our region (USA, China, Japan and India) are not burdened by Kyoto. Nor are our big competitors – Brazil (iron and beef), Indonesia (coal), Chile (copper) and Canada (wheat). We only have the Kiwis and the faraway Europeans sharing the sinking Kyoto ship.
The Kyoto Agreement is a failure. Australia repealed the costly carbon dioxide tax. Next we should get rid of Kyoto liabilities.

“I think they should be in jail … with all the other war criminals.” Republican politicians too – “those guys are doing the Koch brothers bidding and are against all the evidence, saying global warming does not exist. They are contemptible human beings,” he fumed.
“So RFK the younger wants to punish us for the “crimes” of exercising our First Amendment rights, demanding actual evidence to support alarmist assertions, saying people’s needs for reliable, affordable energy must be part of the conversation – and insisting that those needs take precedence over absurd claims that climate change is “the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction,” posing “greater long-term consequences” than ISIL, terrorism or Ebola, as Secretary of State John Kerry insists.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/09/22/the-climate-change-enigma/,,The Climate Change Enigma,"By Ian McClintock.
There is an old scientific tenet that says “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof”.
I commenced an independent, comprehensive investigation of CAGW (Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming) some 25 years ago because of the direct potential impact this would have on my farming enterprise.
Farmers work directly with nature and climate as they pursue their farming and grazing activities and if the world was going to warm, possibly catastrophically, it would at the very least mean a substantial change in my enterprise mix and management approach, and at worst, might mean I could no longer continue to farm.
I therefore had a strong vested interest in attempting to understand the science (and politics) behind the claims that were being made so that I could take appropriate action as future climatic events developed and demanded.
It goes without saying that I needed to seek out the actual truth with an open mind as it would be clearly counter- productive to delude myself with preconceived or incorrect ideas and assumptions.
It is a long story but what I found, quite early on in my investigation, is that the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), despite having spent many billions of dollars on attempting to find compelling evidence to substantiate their hypothesis, have been totally unable to do so.
At first I could not believe this, I must be wrong, so I carefully and critically re-read the IPCC Reports and much other relevant information. The result was the same, NO valid empirical evidence 1 has ever been cited. I was and am astounded.
A very careful study has shown that ‘Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming’ has proven to be no more than a politically generated fairy tale, yet the media, most Governments, many scientific organisations, Universities and others continue to ignore any and all evidence that challenges the IPCC claims and blindly accept what they say.

Like any good bureaucratic committee, they soon established sub-committees on sustainability, pollution, development, energy, forestry, water, biodiversity, endangered species, poverty, health, population and Agenda 21 (this item alone had 40 chapters each with its own sub-committee). Environmental conferences became the greatest multi-national growth industry in the world financed mainly by tax-payers via participating public servants, climate academics, employees of nationalised industries and tax-sheltered green “charities” such as Greenpeace and WWF.
They really hit the Mother Lode with their creation of the “United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change” which, in good bureaucratic tradition, duplicated the work of the “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” (IPCC). These then created their own brand-names called “Global Warming”, and its proxies “Climate Change” and “Extreme Weather”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/09/06/global-hot-air/,,Global Hot Air,"BACK in the 1980s anthropogenic global warming was resurrected. Its emphasis was that man-made CO2 would dangerously heat up the world and had to be controlled.
And there was lots of money available if this could be proved. So a multi-billion dollar industry was born.
The first thing was to speed up the rate of warming. This was done by ignoring a large number of temperature measuring stations from cold areas like Siberia, places with altitude such as Bolivia and only one above the Arctic Circle. So far so good.
Two distractions were the Medieval Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age. Michael Mann removed those with his hockey stick graph. It has since been shown that feeding random numbers into his program always resulted in a hockey stick. It rapidly went from the 1995 IPCC report’s cover and Al Gore’s presentations into obscurity.
There was also a problem with the record high temperatures from the 1930s–1940s. To lower them, the major measuring agencies started to adjust the original temperatures. This can be legitimate if weather stations have been moved or their surroundings compromised. A photographic record of every station in the US shows that 80% are no longer correctly positioned mostly due to urbanisation (green fields are now asphalt parking lots). Logically the old readings should have been regarded as valid and current readings would need to be lowered. They’ve done the opposite.
They started reducing the temperatures pre-1960 (give or take) and increasing them since then. NOAA for example was adjusting temperatures this way by 0.01 Fahrenheit per month, but then went to doing it twice a month. But hey, when you’re on a good thing, do it more often! The Australian, NZ and GB BOMs, and the US’s NOAA and NASA have all been doing this. They have also stopped providing historical data to other weather forecasters.
Parts of NOAA were so concerned with their official figures they established 100 green field stations across the US. After 10 years they show a steady drop, whereas the “official” adjusted figures just keep rising. Satellite measurements, which are difficult to fudge, are also showing a stable or dropping temperature pattern.
So what does this all mean? Our temperature records have been modified to meaningless; the computer models are useless (87 of 89 major models can’t get within two standard deviations of actuals); the actuals haven’t risen for 17 years; our governments do not class CO2 as a pollutant (look it up); environmentalists should embrace the benefits of more CO2; windmills and commercial solar should be junked.
Let’s get back to using coal and gas, which are more reliable, cheaper and are less dangerous (actually beneficial) to our environment.
We have experimented with square wheels and they have been a failure; we need to get back to ones that make the world go round.

History
The Carbon Sense Coalition was founded seven years ago. Its 7 th birthday was on 12 th July, 2014. To see the historical formation documents go to: http://carbon-sense.com/carbon-sense/
No one asked or paid us to start this crusade, and we have never changed our policies as the result of external pressure or inducements. My personal motivation was hearing stupid or scheming politicians calling carbon dioxide a “pollutant”. I was also concerned by the increasingly anti-human, anti-industry ethos of the extreme Greens.
Since then we have fought quietly and persistently to explain and popularise the fallacies underlying the Mania of our Times. We have not been diverted to other causes, believing this is the biggest and most destructive political folly we have seen in a life-time of watching politicians. And the more we look, the more convinced we are of the cost and stupidity of the whole man-made global warming scam.
Our Main Focus
Our main problem is politics, not science. Politicians persevere in their climate/energy stupidities even though the science and the evidence no longer support them. They will only change when voters demand a change. Therefore our main focus is putting all aspects of the climate stupidity into short simple articles and spreading them into all media outlets and web sites available to us via letters, opinion pieces, media statements and newsletters. We also make submissions to public enquiries, and appear in person when invited.
We do not confine our activities to Australia – this is a world-wide problem requiring world-wide response.
Our Activities
We aim to get our message spread widely among ordinary voters and opinion makers. We welcome any website, newspaper, radio or TV station that will spread our message and we have had successes in all fields (except the Melbourne Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times, which, I believe have never published a thing we have said.) I believe the ABC also falls into this category of one-eyed media. But even among the green media, someone in there reads our things before shredding them, and some points may take root, lying there in their brain like unexploded bombs.

Wind and solar are parasitic power producers, unable to survive in a modern electricity grid without the back-up of stand-alone electricity generators such as hydro, coal, gas or nuclear. And like all parasites, they weaken their hosts, causing increased operating and transmission costs and reduced profits for all participants in the grid.
Without subsidies, few large wind/solar plants would be built; and without mandated targets, few would get connected to the grid.
Green zealots posing as energy engineers should be free to play with their green energy toys at their own expense, on their own properties, but the rest of us should not be saddled with their costs and unreliability.
We should stop promoting parasitic power producers. As a first step, all green energy subsidies and targets should be abolished.

There was a time, before the baby-boom generation took over, when we took pride in the achievements of our builders, producers and innovators. There was always great celebration when settler families got a phone, a tractor, a bitumen road or electric power. An oil strike or a gold discovery made headlines, and people welcomed new businesses, new railways and new inventions. Science and engineering were revered and the wealth delivered by these human achievements enabled the builders and their children to live more rewarding lives, with more leisure, more time for culture and crusades, and greater interest in taking more care of their environment.
Then a green snake entered the Garden of Eden.

In the Kattegatt Sea, between Denmark and Sweden, the glacial isostatic component factor is well established and the axis of tilting has remained stable for the last 8000 years. At the point of zero regional crustal movements, there are three tide gauges indicating a present rise in sea level of 0.8 to 0.9 mm/yr for the last 125 years.

We are lectured monotonously about the “consensus” that carbon dioxide produced by human activities is “highly likely to cause dangerous global warming”. The alarmist computer models are all based on this assumption, with predicted warming multiplied by also assuming strong positive feedbacks.
A consensus of opinion never determines a scientific question – real proof depends on evidence and logic. Consensus is a tool of politics and a guidepost for lemmings.

[We and the cartoon creator, Steve Hunter, have full rights to this cartoon, and grant permission for anyone to reproduce it in any media as long as the Steve Hunter signature remains on it. For electronic media, the source link should also be displayed.]
The so-called “Greenhouse Effect” depends entirely on the known property of carbon dioxide gas to intercept radiant heat in certain wavelengths. This process starts operating as soon as the extra gas enters the atmosphere.
If this influence is strong enough to drive “dangerous global warming”, its effect should be noticeable even in the short term, with Earth’s surface temperature increasing in step with increasing carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing for over a century, but global temperatures have fluctuated in broad cycles decades long, and the temperature trend has been flat for the last 17 years.
This evidence suggests that increasing carbon dioxide is not a major driver for dangerous global warming, no matter what the consensus says – even if a million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.
We may still get natural global warming, as the vast restless oceans roll over or the solar cycles change, but man-made carbon dioxide is not driving these processes. Moreover, a bit of warming is not our greatest risk – history shows that ice ages extinguish more species and habitats than warm eras.
The consensus of alarmists is trying to lynch an innocent party.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/06/24/sea-levels-are-not-rising/,,Sea Levels are Not Rising,"
At most, global average sea level is rising at a rate equivalent to 2-3 inches per century. It is probably not rising at all.
Sea level is measured both by tide gauges and, since 1992, by satellite altimetry. One of the keepers of the satellite record told Professor Mörner that the record had been interfered with to show sea level rising, because the raw data from the satellites showed no increase in global sea level at all.
The raw data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON sea-level satellites, which operated from 1993-2000, shows a slight uptrend in sea level. However, after exclusion of the distorting effects of the Great El Niño Southern Oscillation of 1997/1998, a naturally-occurring event, the sea-level trend is zero.
The GRACE gravitational-anomaly satellites are able to measure ocean mass, from which sea-level change can be directly calculated. The GRACE data show that sea level fell slightly from 2002-2007.
These two distinct satellite systems, using very different measurement methods, produced raw data reaching identical conclusions: sea level is barely rising, if at all.
Sea level is not rising at all in the Maldives, the Laccadives, Tuvalu, India, Bangladesh, French Guyana, Venice, Cuxhaven, Korsør, Saint Paul Island, Qatar, etc.
In the Maldives, a group of Australian environmental scientists uprooted a 50-year-old tree by the shoreline, aiming to conceal the fact that its location indicated that sea level had not been rising. This is a further indication of political tampering with scientific evidence about sea level.
Modelling is not a suitable method of determining global sea-level changes, since a proper evaluation depends upon detailed research in multiple locations with widely-differing characteristics. The true facts are to be found in nature itself.
Since sea level is not rising, the chief ground of concern at the potential effects of anthropogenic “global warming” – that millions of shore-dwellers the world over may be displaced as the oceans expand – is baseless.
We are facing a very grave, unethical “sea-level-gate”.

Air’s black as pitch, your nostrils twitch, but what a great solution
Electric trains proved right as rain, the power’s from a station
Where chimney flues scrub out all hues of soot particulation.
The only vapours from the site are CO2 and water
When carbon mates with oxygen, they have a lovely daughter
Her beauty though is not for show, her hidden charms unlisted
Like Cinderella pre the ball, soot-faced and ugly-sistered.
There is no doubt a glass of stout is good for our well being
And that there brew needs CO2 to make the cork worth freeing
And soda water isn’t short’a carbonated gases
Or do you think that CO2 pollutes our lads and lasses.
The dry ice in your Esky won’t contaminate your food
It’s CO2 in solid form, its gas will not intrude
Solid CO2 won’t melt, it sublimates instead
And doesn’t turn to water which would soak your picnic bread.
The great sponge cakes your mother makes need CO2 for lightness
Champagne contains some CO2, to stimulate its brightness
So what about that greenhouse gas, the monster that we fear
It’s harmless as that self-same gas that frothifies our beer.
This greenhouse thing has gone too far, the hoax must be exposed
A greenhouse is a building with glass ceilings interposed
Allowing sunlight to come in to power photosynthesis
Where Cinderella has a ball and plants can only win with this.
The heat is trapped, and heat transfer obeys the laws of heat
Conduction is through contact, that’s a hot-cold, one-way street
Convection only happens within liquids and with gases
Radiation’s wild and free, but slows down in molasses.
Our planet is no greenhouse and for that we’ve gotta thank it
Its atmosphere is mostly clear and wraps us in a blanket
And H2O it rules you know, in fact it’s pretty neat
If you meet an iceberg please respect its latent heat.
The blanket that surrounds us is a blanket in a squillion
The CO2 part’s pretty thin, four hundred parts per million
When yarns are stretched as thin as that, it’s like a nylon stocking
It’s measured by deniers, what it covers up is shocking.
King Coal has brought us from the slums, to fortune and to favour.
The real deniers criticise. King Coal’s supporters waver.
But truth will win and then the fraud of taxing carbon users
And trading air to our despair, will join the list of losers.
The fragrance of the sweet fresh rain, the moisture, drops and dew
Owe so much of their sparkle to our friend called CO2.

It is not surprising that most glaciers and ice sheets show melting and calving while snow is being added at their source. If this did not occur, much of Earth’s water would eventually become tied up in the ever-growing ice sheets, as happened in the Ice Ages. And when land-based ice caps melt during periodic warm eras, the sea level inevitably rises and all life-forms must adapt to the new shoreline.

A New York Times headline reads “Scientists Warn of Rising Oceans From Polar Melt” and goes on to say:
“A large section of the mighty West Antarctica ice sheet has begun falling apart and its continued melting now appears to be unstoppable, two groups of scientists reported on Monday. If the findings hold up, they suggest that the melting could destabilize neighbouring parts of the ice sheet and a rise in sea level of 10 feet or more may be unavoidable in coming centuries.”
The story, based on studies of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica, went ballistic in the news media with dire predictions of the ‘unstoppable’ catastrophe about to unfold.  
The authors of the Pine Island paper, Justin Gillis and Kenneth Chang say in their paper:  “…we find no major bed obstacle that would prevent the glaciers from further retreat and draw down the entire  basin.”
In  a  second  paper, “Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Underway for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica,” the authors (Joughin, Smith, and Medley) also infer that the entire West Antarctic ice sheet will soon disappear, resulting in a sea level rise of up to 10  feet.  The  governor of California is now suggesting moving  LAX and San Francisco airports!

Complex computer models are continually being used to generate incessant alarms about the future for our environment and resources – climate, weather, minerals, oil, food, water, pollution and the oceans.
Every year the computers get more expensive, and the models more complex, but their doomsday forecasts still fail.

Models are simple in principle. They have a formula linking two or more variables, such as rainfall in a catchment area and the water level in a dam. The model can tell us that 200mm of rain will fill the dam. But a few failed forecasts will result in a more complex model that tries to take account of obvious complicating factors such as ground cover in the catchment area and the rate of precipitation. Then more rainfall recording stations will be needed, and more complicating factors will be identified… needing a bigger computer.
Imagine the complexity of a mathematical model designed to forecast something as simple as next Wednesday’s weather in Brisbane, Birmingham or Boston.
The British Met Office owns Britain’s most powerful super computer. It can make 1,000 billion calculations every second while consuming more electricity than a small town. The Met claimed that it “will enable the Met Office to deliver more accurate forecasts, from hours to a century ahead”. Some 400 climate high priests attend this electronic monster. But it has totally failed to forecast several frigid European winters because the model makers believe their own story and have programmed the models with a global warming bias. They assume without proof or evidence that carbon dioxide controls global temperature.
The global models of IPCC climateers also have a warming bias and have failed spectacularly to date – their global temperature predictions have been wrong for 17 years straight.
When do they give up?
In 2000, the UK Met Office told us that snow was a thing of the past; in 2007, Australian Climate Commissioner Tim Flannery predicted cities such as Brisbane would never again have dam-filling rains; in 2008, Al Gore predicted “The entire north polar ice cap will be gone in five years”.
Are the people who work on the climate models smarter, wiser, more ethical and more experienced than the people who worked on financial models for governments, central banks, commercial banks, hedge funds, brokers and investors and who failed to predict the global financial crisis?
The atmosphere and the oceans are far more complex than the currency markets.
And yet there are still “experts” claiming that if they had bigger computers they could forecast global climate for a century ahead!
If the assumptions in the models remain wrong, then more powerful computers will just produce wrong answers faster.
Doing the same thing, and expecting a different result, is proof of climate modelling madness.

Weather statistics can be averaged over larger areas, such as by region, state, continent or the globe. This is a mathematical abstraction, becoming less accurate and less meaningful as the time or area covered increases. A global average annual temperature which (after debatable adjustments) includes winter in the Antarctic and summer in the Sahara is irrelevant. No one lives in the global average temperature. Weather and climate have been so politicised that most commentaries are now merely propaganda.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/03/30/engineering-depression/,,Climate Boffins Target Depression,"The Climate Change Authority wants Australians to cut their production of carbon dioxide to 19% below 2000 levels by the year 2020.
The climate boffins should employ a demographer before they set such unrealistic goals.
The population of Australia in 2000 was about 19 million and it is now 23 million. By 2020 it will probably be over 25 million.
If Australia’s production of carbon dioxide was merely frozen at the 2000 level, that would require a 24% reduction per head of population by 2020.
If we add to that a real reduction in total emissions of 19% by 2020, emissions per capita would need to fall by 39% in just 6 years.
Even more unbelievable, China (supported by the UN/IPCC) thinks that developed countries “need to cut emissions by 40% from their 1990 levels by 2020”. This would require Australia’s per capita emissions to fall by 60% to just 40% of their 1990 levels. All achieved within the next six years.
Nothing real gets produced or done without generating carbon dioxide. Every working car, truck, tractor, dozer, quad bike, boat, helicopter, bulk carrier and aeroplane generates carbon dioxide. None of these will be powered by wind-mills, sunbeams or nuclear power in the next six years. How will they force us to use 39% less of them – carbon ration cards?
Making steel, bricks, cement, bitumen, minerals, metals, food, fertilisers and roads produces carbon dioxide – shall we each use just 61% of what we did in 2000?
Humans, cattle, sheep, pigs, barbeques, champagne and beer also emit carbon dioxide – shall we ration these too?
And Australian trains, lifts, supermarkets, operating theatres, refineries and power stations will not keep working 24/7 without base-load electricity from coal and gas, both generating carbon dioxide. Who is volunteering for living solely with Green Energy – brown-outs, blackouts or irregular “Earth Hours” for about four months of the year?
There is one way to achieve these goals – “The Tasmanian Solution”. Send 40% of our remaining industry to Asia, and convert Australia into a quiet green utopia of genteel poverty. This should create sufficient unemployment and reduced consumption to achieve the required emissions austerity.
Is the Climate Change Authority engineering an emissions target depression to achieve its savage cuts, or is this just another mindless model-driven target? We should demand to see their detailed plans for achieving these targets.
Carbon dioxide is hugely beneficial for all plant life, and its effect on global temperature is tiny and probably beneficial for most people. There is no evidence that carbon dioxide causes extreme weather. Man-made Climate Policy is a far greater and more certain danger than Man-made Climate Change.
Meanwhile, in the real world, the tide has turned in the war on carbon. Global warming stopped seventeen years ago; the carbon price collapsed a year ago; the EU is backpedalling on its disastrous green energy gamble; Russia, China, India, Japan, Canada, USA, Brazil and South Africa will not sign any binding Kyoto agreement; China has plans to build 160 new coal fired power stations in the next four years; and Tim Flannery has been sacked.

Every day some place in the world has “wild weather”. And in recent times, human industry gets the blame. “It’s all caused by man-made global warming” (generally shortened to “global warming”, or GW by alarmists).
Floods or droughts – blame GW; bushfires or snowstorms – blame GW; frosts or heatwaves – blame GW; hail storms or dust storms – blame GW; cyclones or tornadoes – blame GW.
In fact, here is a complete list of all the things blamed on global warming:

If all of this were true, then carbon dioxide is surely the most powerful and disruptive gas on the planet. That great scientist, John Kerry, even calls it a “weapon of mass destruction”.

Thanks to cartoonist Steve Hunter who has gambled again that we may raise enough money to pay him.
But carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most stable, predictable, unreactive and puny of all climate
factors. And its effect diminishes for each addition of CO2 to the atmosphere. Adding more now has
almost zero effect on temperature.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/01/23/sun-water-winds-and-weather/,,"Sun, Water, Winds and Weather","What determines surface temperature at any spot on earth?
Apart from a tad of geothermal heat and a wisp of heat from nuclear power generators, every bit of surface energy (including coal and biomass) comes directly or indirectly from the sun. There is no other source of surface heat – everything else just stores, releases or re-directs solar energy.
Surface heat is maximised when the sun is directly overhead, near a peak in the sunspot cycle and when Earth’s orbit comes closest to the sun (perihelion). The hottest places on earth will be found near the equator, after mid-day, in mid-summer, at perihelion and when there are no clouds in the sky to reflect solar radiation. Temperature will be maximised when there is no cooling wind and no nearby surface water or moist soils to cool things by evaporation. Since higher temperature also occurs at lower altitudes, one of the hottest places on earth is Death Valley, a desert below sea level, where the temperature can reach 56 °C on a mid-summer afternoon.
Frigid temperatures are found near the poles, where solar energy is weak. The coldest place on Earth is Vostok at high altitude in Antarctica where the air is very dry and where the temperature can go as low as minus 89 °C with a cloudless sky in the dead of winter.
Since both extremes could occur simultaneously, Earth’s maximum daily temperature range is thus up to 145 °C. But at any single place, the diurnal variation is more likely to be about 15-40 °C.
Carbon dioxide has no effect on any of the above temperature drivers – it generates no new heat, cannot affect latitude, solar orbits, sun spots, altitude, season, time of day, clouds or the proximity of water. All it can possibly do is encourage plant growth, and intercept, absorb and redirect a tiny bit radiant energy passing either way between the sun, Earth’s surface and space. But that effect is almost exhausted at current levels of carbon dioxide. Doubling the carbon dioxide content from 400 ppm to 800 ppm (which may take the next 100 years) might possibly increase surface temperatures by up to 2 °C – not even noticeable compared to the daily temperature ranges we cope with now.
Everyone can feel the powerful warmth of the rising sun, the variations between summer and winter, the moderating effect of clouds and the shock of hot and cold winds.
But even if carbon dioxide levels doubled overnight, most people on earth would not notice any difference.

It is often said that many people do not read the minutes of the last meeting.
For days now we have been hearing, about “unprecedented heat” and record temperatures. Naturally the government science and media arms are quick to blame carbon dioxide or man-made global warming for this (and every other unusual weather event).
Three comments:
Firstly, when the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reports a “record” temperature, they mean “since 1910 in BOM’s adjusted records”. They ignore all records earlier than 1910 on the excuse such records were not taken in the shade according to their method.
Secondly, they have “adjusted” their raw data for various reasons, and the adjustments have generally “cooled the past” thus increasing the apparent warming trend, and increasing the chances that a recent heat wave will produce “highest ever temperatures”.
Thirdly, neither the BOM nor their lazy media megaphones have learnt to look at the past as recorded in newspapers of the times.
Rick Dean has had such a look and his report, taken verbatim from newspapers of the times, shows that heatwaves (and associated bushfires) are nothing new. He records at least 24 heatwaves in Australia in the period 1886 to 1929. For example:
In 1895 at Bourke there were 66 deaths from heat apoplexy over a period of six weeks, during which time the heat was never under 114 degrees shade heat and, what was worse, never under 100 degrees at night. The maximum temperature recorded under true shade conditions was 128 DegF (53.3 DegC). In Sydney in Jan 1896 the temperature reached 131 DegF in the shade (55 DegC). Publications at the times recorded many earlier heat waves back to 1791.

https://carbon-sense.com/2014/01/13/the-effects-of-the-moon-on-earths-weather/,,The Effects of the Moon on Earth’s Weather,"The moon causes tides on Earth. The most obvious ones are in the oceans, but they also occur in the atmosphere and also in ground water and even in the crustal material.
The moon also reflects solar radiation, maximized at full moon and minimized at new moon.
These effects are also maximised at perigee, when the moon is closest to the earth.
Ken Ring is a New Zealand based private weather forecaster. Ken provided the following brief summary of the importance of the Moon on Earth’s weather.

The Effects of the Moon on Earth’s Weather
By Ken Ring
Phase
The moon is responsible for the daily atmospheric tide, which changes air height according to the inconstant position of the moon. When the moon is above the horizon the air-tide is “in” and when it sets below the horizon and until the moon rises the air-tide is “out”.
This changing air height varies ground temperatures throughout the day, depending on the moon phase. It is well known that the full moon increases the temperatures on earth:
http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19950319&id=UB9OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5517,3976094
When the moon is out of the sky in daylight hours (1stQ moon dawn-noon, full moon time dusk-dawn, and lastQ time noon-dusk), the sun’s heat can reach the ground more intensely, with no absorbent air to block its path.
When the moon is out of the sky at night (lastQ dusk to midnight, new moon (midnight-dawn), and 1stQ midnight-dawn), the airtide is “out” letting in more of the heavier cold air from the edge of space which cools the ground more than otherwise.
In summer the full moon time is the hottest of the month, and consequently is around the time of the month when tropical cyclones form, because the water within 6 deg of the equator can be heated to 26-28degC which is required for sufficient evaporation to occur that will provide enough to fuel the cyclonic system. The new moon is also a cyclone breeder, because the new moon is in the sky all day which tends to clear the sky, thus allowing the sun’s heat to again penetrate closer to the ground.
Declination
The moon changes hemispheres on a 27-day cycle, due to the tilt of the earth. In summer the new moon is always over the southern hemisphere, the full moon is over the northern hemisphere, and the quarter moons are over the latitude of the equator. In winter the full moon is over the southern hemisphere and new moon over the northern hemisphere.
Perigee
The perigee is the shortest moon-earth distance, and varies over a 27-day cycle. Perigee exaggerates whatever else is going on. When it is, e.g. full moon and perigee in summer, there is extra heat around. It may be noted that TC Ian began to form around 1st-2nd January, when it was new moon + a very powerful perigee (second closest moon-earth distance) for all of 2014.
There is no way to measure global temperature at any one moment, when at that moment half the world is experiencing freezing winter and the other the half burning heat of summer. Also, half the globe is enjoying daylight and the other half the cold night temperatures. There is no thermometer invented that can measure the temperature of the whole globe at once, nor the temperature of anywhere a day ahead and certainly not measure temperature of anything, let alone the whole world, over a whole decade or century ahead. Anyone who thinks they can is just guessing.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/12/31/thank-the-sun-for-our-benign-warm-era/,,Thank the Sun for our Benign Warm Era,"Most of the last 500,000 years have seen Earth gripped by snow and ice, with short warm periods of about 10,000 years long every 100,000 years. We live in this continuing glacial era but are lucky to exist in one of the regular short warm periods.
There is nothing at all unusual about the current warm period, except maybe that it is the period during which modern human civilisation developed.
Within our warm era, we live in a time that is not unusual either – there have been periods warmer and cooler than today, with no real evidence that mankind has caused global warming (apart from minor urban heat bubbles around mega cities).
There is evidence of a correlation between sunspots and Earth temperature, as well as suggested mechanisms to explain this link. The sun clearly has an effect on Earth temperature, and the evidence tends to suggest we could expect global cooling in the near future.  
Even within historical times, the Central England Temperature Record, which goes back to 1659, shows a general rising trend since the depths of the Little Ice age, rising to a peak with the solar cycles, and now signalling a falling trend.
Statistics on human usage of carbon fuels show that it is the undeveloped world not the developed world where usage is rising most sharply. Even in emissions per head of population, it is countries like China where the significant growth is occurring. Carbon taxes and targets are costly and futile.
However when we look at how carbon dioxide affects global temperature, the effect is so small as to be insignificant. It is the behaviour of the sun we should be watching.

Sea levels are very sensitive to temperature changes, and the oceanic indicators are currently reading “steady”.
So are all other thermometers.
Apart from bubbles of heat surrounding big cities, the thermometers and satellites of the world have not shown a warming trend for 17 years. This is in spite of some inspired fiddling with the records by those whose jobs, research grants and reputations depend on their ability to generate alarming forecasts of destructive global warming.
To explain this absence of warming on Earth’s surface, the warmists now claim that “the missing heat is hiding in the deep oceans”.
This sounds like a water-tight alibi, hard to disprove because of our inability to measure “average ocean temperature” directly.
However, the ocean itself is a huge thermometer – all we have to do is to read the gauges.
Most liquids expand when heated, and this property is used in traditional thermometers. They have a glass reservoir filled with liquid (usually mercury) and a graduated scale to measure any thermal expansion of that liquid.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/12/02/endlich-sea-level-claims/,,Inconvenient Facts about Sea Levels by Robert Endlich,"Sea levels have been rising and falling for as far back as we have evidence, and current sea levels are lower than they were during the Roman Warm Period.
Robert Endlich has looked at the evidence still visible today:
An important turning point in British history occurred in 1066, when William the Conqueror defeated King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings. Less well-known is that, when William landed, he occupied an old Roman fort now known as Pevensey Castle, which at the time was located on a small island in a harbor on England’s south coast. A draw bridge connected it to the mainland. Pevensey is infamous because unfortunate prisoners were thrown into this “Sea Gate,” so that their bodies would be washed away by the tide. Pevensey Castle is now a mile from the coast – further proof of a much higher sea level fewer than 1000 years ago.
Before modern Italy, the region was dominated by the famous City States of the Mediterranean, among which is Pisa, with its picturesque Cathedral Square and famous Leaning Tower. Located near the mouth of the Arno River, Pisa was a powerful city, because maritime trade brought goods from sailing ships right into the port. Its reign ended after 1300 AD, the onset of the Little Ice Age, when sea levels fell and ships could no longer sail to her port. Once again, some say “river silting” was the cause.
However, Pisa is now seven miles from the Tyrrhenian Sea, with large meanders upstream from Pisa and little meandering downstream. When a river is “at grade,” the downstream gradient is as low as possible, as with the meandering Mississippi River and delta in Louisiana. Rivers with a strong downstream gradient flow to the sea in a direct route, with few meanders, as with the Rio Grande in New Mexico.
The facts of history are clear. Sea level was 400 feet lower at the end of the Wisconsin Ice Age, 18,000 years ago. Sea levels rose rapidly until 8,000 years ago. As recently as 1066, when the Normans conquered England, sea levels were quite a bit higher than today. 
During the Little Ice Age, 1300 to 1850 – when temperatures were the coldest during any time in the past 10,000 years – snow and ice accumulated in Greenland, Antarctica, Europe and glaciers worldwide. As a consequence, sea levels fell so much that important Roman Era and Medieval port cities (like Ephesus, Ostia Antica and Pisa) were left miles from the Mediterranean. 
Since the Little Ice Age ended about 160 years ago, tide gages show that sea level has risen at a steady rate – with no correlation to the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. 
Sea level is a dynamic property in our planet’s climate cycles, which are closely linked to changes in solar energy output and other natural factors. It is unlikely to change in response to tax policies that make energy more expensive and economies less robust – no matter what politicians in Washington, Brussels or the United Nations might say.
Much to their chagrin, Mother Nature doesn’t listen to them. She has a mind of her own.

Many articles and claims about sea levels are in conflict with the evidence.
For instance, sea level has been rising at something between 2 and 3 mm per year since the end of the Little ice age. As you can see from the graph, there is no indication that the rate of sea level rise is increasing. There is some indication that the rate of rise has reduced slightly since 2006.
http://sealevel.colorado.edu

In addition, the  Australian Bureau of Meteorology set up a chain of sea level measuring stations around Australia and in the Pacific that are the most accurate in the world. As you can see from the chart, the sea level at Tuvalu dropped markedly during the 1997 – 1998 El Niño and since 2000 it has been substantially constant. Claims that Tuvalu is sinking beneath rising sea levels caused by man-made carbon dioxide therefore cannot be true. it is most unfortunate that many people who  choose to spread this rumour have not bothered to look at the data. It is particularly unfortunate for the population of Tuvalu because they have been told that their very real problems with erosion are beyond their control when, in fact, they have largely caused them by taking too much fresh water out of the water table and by mining the reef for coral to reclaim land. If the powers that be recognised that this is the case, then aid could be concentrated on solving the real problems, not the imaginary ones.
One division is 100 mm.

Others claim that Pacific Islands are disappearing. Once again, this does not stack up against the evidence:

None of these benefits have appeared, and ethanol promotion must cease.
The only people who truly benefit from government promotion of ethanol are corn farmers and the builders, owners and operators of ethanol plants. This stupid policy has huge costs everywhere else.
Just like their one-sided promotion of wind and solar energy, environmentalists choose to turn a blind eye to the environmental damage caused by ethanol promotion. These include:

Ethanol now consumes 40% of the US corn crop, pushing up the costs of feed for cattle, pigs, poultry and humans.

Millions of acres of native grasslands, prairie, conservation areas and wetlands have been cultivated for corn ethanol.
The extra corn grown has caused a large increase in nitrogen fertiliser applications and run-off. Nitrogen fertiliser is made from natural gas.
The diesel and other carbon fuels used to cultivate, fertilise, plant, harvest, transport and ferment corn and distribute ethanol to reluctant consumers creates more carbon dioxide than is saved by using ethanol in cars.
Ethanol is a poor quality fuel for combustion engines and has damaged many of them.

If ethanol is so good it does not need market mandates, tax breaks and tax penalties on its competitors. It should compete fairly with all other fuels and also with competing needs for corn.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/11/25/typhoons-and-taxes/,,Typhoons & Carbon Taxes,"The Carbon Sense Coalition today accused the UN Warsaw climate conference and some world media of callous exploitation of human suffering in the recent typhoon in order to promote their international carbon tax levelling plans.
The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the leaders of the global warming scare campaign who are blaming the use of carbon fuels for Typhoon Haiyan should read their own IPCC scientific report which makes no such claim.
Damaging typhoons have been a fact of life in the Western Pacific for all of recorded history. In 1274, Japan was saved from invasion by Kublai Khan when a typhoon destroyed a huge Mongol invasion fleet. A second bigger fleet in 1281 was destroyed by another typhoon which was named Kamikaze or “divine wind” by the grateful Japanese. Typhoons were also frequent and severe during the Little Ice Age around 1670.

Living on the flood plains and beaches around the huge Pacific Ocean is pleasant and productive for billions of humans for most of the time – generally the climate is mild, the rains are regular, the soils are fertile and food is abundant from land and sea. But every sea-side settlement must expect to suffer huge damage or destruction some time from a rogue cyclone, typhoon, hurricane or tsunami. Moreover, as a “Ring of Fire” also circles the Pacific, they can also expect the occasional severe earthquake or volcanic eruption.
To promote the belief that carbon taxes and related handouts will change the natural reality of cyclones and typhoons is no better than modern witchcraft in which western consumers are to be sacrificed on the climate scare altar.
The UN/IPCC frequent flyers attending the Warsaw gabfest should have stayed home and donated their time, energy, air fares, hotel bills, croissants and expense accounts to helping the real victims.
Nowhere in the world are cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons or tornadoes powered by the tiny trace of well-dispersed, invisible carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Anyone who studies storms can observe that the energy of tropical storms comes from localised heat and moisture. Thunderheads are not composed of carbon dioxide – they are composed of water in its various forms. Water is unique in the atmosphere in that it can change phase from a gas, to a liquid, or a solid all within the temperature ranges found on Earth’s surface. Every phase change generates or absorbs considerable energy. It is these latent energies of evaporation and condensation that sustain storms. All such processes are driven by the energy of the sun.
Storms form in areas of sun-heated low pressure where there is a plentiful supply of warm moist air over the sea and masses of cooler high-pressure air over the nearby land. A mega-storm grows as air rushes from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. It starts spinning because of the rotation of the earth. This low-pressure vortex is then maintained by the release of latent heat as moisture in the rising air condenses into rain and hail.
Mega-storms are common in warm tropical waters which supply solar heat and abundant moisture. They tend to die over land, often bringing welcome rain.
Carbon dioxide plays no part in any of these storm processes. Even if it were to cause some global warming, it would tend to warm the poles, reducing the temperature contrasts that power major storms. However, average land and sea temperature has not risen for 16 years; nor has the frequency or intensity of destructive storms.
Clearly, typhoons and cyclones have not been stopped by Australia’s carbon tax. They are tragic, but not our fault. Arguing that a carbon tax and global wealth redistribution are required to prevent typhoons and cyclones is just nonsense. Using this mad logic, it would make more sense to have a “hydrogen tax” on emissions of steam and water vapour (H2O) in an equally futile attempt to remove the real driving energy from tropical mega-storms.

We support the immediate repeal of the carbon tax. This tax was introduced by stealth, and the justification for its introduction is spurious. It should be repealed or made ineffective immediately.
We are told its purpose is to “reduce carbon pollution” – just three words, each of which is based on a lie.

“Reduce”: The effect of Australia’s carbon tax on the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is so tiny as to be undetectable and any miniscule reduction would be totally swamped in the far bigger natural seasonal variations of carbon dioxide levels. The effect on global climate, if any, would also be too small to be measured and of no benefit to the climate or life on Earth.
“Carbon”: It is NOT a tax on carbon. Carbon is a solid – either soft and black like graphite and soot, or crystalline, hard and beautiful like diamond. It is definitely not the colourless gas created when carbon is burned. The “carbon” tax falls mainly on carbon dioxide, a colourless, harmless natural gas which has always been present in Earth’s atmosphere, usually in far greater amounts than at present. The use of “carbon” when referring to “carbon dioxide” is a deliberate deception. It would be like calling liquid water by the name “hydrogen”, a major element in the water molecule which is a dangerous explosive flammable gas. Based on the carbon example, a tax on water vapour (another “greenhouse gas) would probably be called “The Hydrogen Tax” by government propagandists.
“Pollution”: Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, and should never have been called one. It is the essential gas-of-life for all plants and they support all animals on Earth. It is no more a pollutant than oxygen, which is the gas-of-life for animals, or water vapour which is essential for all life. All three gases have effects on earth’s surface temperature, and on surface life, and such effects are usually highly beneficial. Additional carbon dioxide has been improving and will continue to improve the growth rate and drought tolerance of all plants on earth. Far from polluting the Earth, extra carbon dioxide has been greening the globe for decades.

There has been no attempt at an independent cost benefit analysis to justify the tax.

The Carbon Sense Coalition has accused those waging a war on carbon dioxide of being “anti-green”.
The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that carbon dioxide is the gas of life, feeding every green plant, producing food for every animal and in the process releasing oxygen, another gas of life, into the atmosphere.
A recent report on measuring global vegetation growth notes that data from remote sensing devices show significant increase in annual vegetation growth during the last three decades. They also report that CO2 fertilization is more important than climate variation in determining the magnitude of the vegetation growth. “The CO2 fertilization effect of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by mankind’s burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, is beginning to assume its vaulted position of being a tremendous boon to the biosphere…”

The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the repeated failures of the IPCC theories and climate models shows that the money spent on these activities would be better spent on disaster-proofing public infrastructure – “whatever we spend on IPCC activities is too much”.
Quote: 
The science debate is over. They lost.
Decades ago the IPCC proposed a theory that Earth’s temperature is controlled by the 0.04% trace of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
This theory was used to make predictions by at least 73 computer models.
Thirty years of observations has proven every prediction wrong.
Therefore their theory is wrong. That is how science works.
Now, faced with collapse of their theory and de-funding of their activities, the alarmist crew have switched to politics.
The IPCC Summary document released last week with all the hoopla of a political convention is a political document produced by consensus. It was negotiated by a faceless committee of international bureaucrats for their government masters, most of whom have a vested interest in proving there is a continuing problem needing international taxes and controls.
Consensus is the tool of politics. Public opinion is where the next climate battle will be fought.
They will lose again. It is time to stop wasting money on a lost cause.

DEARBORN, MI—The Ford Motor Company announced on Wednesday that it has developed a new SUV that will be powered exclusively by gasoline, a 100% reliable, oil-based energy source. “We’re very proud to introduce the Ford Petrola, a vehicle that runs on a specialized fuel derived almost entirely from naturally occurring organic compounds,” said Raj Nair, the company’s vice president of global product development. “Whether you’re commuting to work or heading out for a little adventure on the weekend, just fill the Petrola with gasoline and you’ll be ready to go. Best of all, this pure hydrocarbon fuel source is currently available at more than 100,000 filling stations across America.” Nair also noted that prototypes of the new vehicle have been able to travel more than 300 miles on a single “power charge” of gasoline.

The climate alarmists and carbon taxers have suffered a body blow in the recent Australian elections – it was a turning point in the war on carbon.
The victorious leader, Tony Abbott, had made it absolutely clear throughout the campaign and in the days immediately after his victory, that abolishing the carbon tax is one of his immediate priorities. Many factors played a part in his victory, but his outspoken and steadfast opposition to the carbon tax was an important one.
Thank you to our supporters for all the congratulatory comments about the role of “Carbon Sense” in preparing the way for this public revolt. Here are a couple:
Well Done Oz, well done Carbon Sense.
I congratulate Australia for chucking out those who were destroying your country, and congratulate you and “Carbon Sense” for the unyielding, persistent stream of useful scientific and logical argument against the climate lobby. Your message has been so powerful and so well presented for so long, surely it played a significant part in keeping the majority on the side of reason?
M.R.
I have followed your crusade and cheered for you. After all, your personal energy and determination must have had an important role in reminding your fellow Australians that the scare tactics and policies of climate change fanaticism are nothing more than a scheme of the political left.  I am amazed by your lasting commitment to defend the professional and scientific truth about carbon, and challenge the claims and lies of demagogic politicians and opportunistic “scientists”.  I must thank you for your efforts and would be honoured if we could maintain our professional link and friendship.
M.M.
And a General Comment:
Maybe you should change your name from “Carbon Sense” to simply “good sense”.
Even though I think you’re stark raving mad sometimes – other times I think you’re maybe the only sane one left! You remind me of Sisyphus at times!!   Keep up the battle.
K.C.
There was good news and bad news in the election.
The good news was that the Labor/Green/Independent coalition that had led Australia into the unwinnable war on carbon was decisively rejected. The Labor vote fell to its lowest level for a century, the Green vote fell 3% and the independents who helped create and support this destructive green coalition are no longer in Parliament.
The other feature of this campaign was the high public interest in the election and the big dissatisfaction with all major parties. Lots of small single-issue parties were formed and contested the election. Most of these small parties were also opposed to the carbon tax.
And a few of them were smart enough to maintain strict discipline among themselves on how preference votes were directed, ensuring that some of them were elected to the Senate.
There was one bad note in the election. Two prominent new small parties, the Palmer United Party (PUP) and the Katter Australia Party (KAP) foolishly directed significant preferences to the ALP and/or Greens ahead of the Liberal/Nationals. This was done partly out of spite, but mainly in a big gamble that did not always pay off.
Bob Katter’s largely conservative supporters reacted badly to him “assisting the enemy” and his primary vote fell dramatically. His hold on his own electorate has become marginal. Clive Palmer’s pact with the Greens got less publicity before the election and he did surprisingly well all over Australia. He probably got one Senator elected because of his shady deal with the green devils, but then in another state a Green Senator will probably be elected on Palmer preferences. So we may be stuck for six years with at least one Green senator who should not have been elected.
Another feature of the election was the minimal support for the anti-coal-seam-gas party.
Now we need to make sure the new government dismantles the whole climate industry.
Stop Press: Germany’s conservatives also just won a massive victory in their latest election. Greens lost heavily, their vote falling from 16% in polls early in the year to 8% now (from 11% last election). More:

With Acknowledgement to: John Droz at the Alliance for Wise Energy:  http://www.wiseenergy.org/
“Wind energy has a highly intermittent output that significantly mismatches demand and delivers energy largely when it is less needed. Wind cannot satisfy the demand requirements of a utility unless it is backed up with fossil fuel plants and/or energy storage projects. This results in duplication of resources and additional costs, with little, if any, carbon mitigation. Further, the steep increases and declines in power delivery of wind put the reliability of the grid in question. The tactic of switching off excess wind supply only diminishes the already weak pattern of intermittency and adds to the per kWh cost of wind. Typically, wind resources are located far away from where the power is needed and require significant additional costs of building new transmission. Intermittency, duplication and grid operations all significantly increase the already high cost of wind energy.
“Wind becomes even more questionable when proven solutions like natural gas can deliver even greater reductions in emissions at half the cost.
“While solar power is much more grid friendly than wind, it is generally the most expensive form of renewable energy. Solar energy quasi-matches system peak load periods, but the peak solar output significantly misses actual electric system load peaks. In addition, solar facilities still produce only about 18 to 25 percent of the time. Without electricity storage, solar energy will not be able to do more than serve as a supplement to other forms of energy. It is not currently a full-scale alternative to baseload energy.
“A Renewable Portfolio Standard, or mandate of 20 percent, can result in a utility-scale duplication of net investment in generating plant of 100 percent or more. The mandate can also cause the wide variation of rate impacts, depending on availability of renewable energy projects and other utility specific parameters.”

Best Election Advice, Edgecliffe NSW
Lots of small parties wrote to tell us how much they opposed the war on carbon and the futile attempts to use taxes to change our climate. We were told that Rise Up Australia Party and Palmer United Party are opposed to all the carbon tax/trading stuff. Good – support their candidates if you like their other policies. Also Cori Bernardi is worth supporting. Our concern with many small parties is that they may have preference deals with the ALP/greens (Palmer votes could end up with Greens, Katter votes could end up with ALP, and even our favoured Climate Sceptics have preferenced Labor above LNP in half of the states, because of the silly utterings of Greg Hunt and his Direct Action Dreams).
There are two ways to handle this Senate election. The lazy way is just vote LNP 1 above the line. That should ensure the defeat of the ALP/Green coalition. But to really vote against the climate alarmists, be selective and vote below the line, numbering all squares. Start with all the sceptic parties you know and vote for their candidates in order. Then vote LNP (this is most important to ensure your vote does not cascade down and accidentally elect an ALP/Green candidate). Then fill out all the other squares in any order PUTTING THE GREENS LAST. We have no other changes to previous advice. If you cannot be bothered taking some time to work it out, vote 1 above the line for the LNP.

The growing failure of green energy in Europe should warn Australia to abandon bi-partisan policies dictating targets, mandates and subsidies for “green” energy.
I grew up at the end of the last green energy era – solar energy powered our growing crops and dried the washing, but it was weak in winter and ceased under clouds and at night; wind energy pumped water, but only when the wind blew; draft horses powered farm machinery, but they had to be fed whether they were working or not; wood gave us home heating and cooking, but it consumed energy to collect and chop it up; kids walked to school or rode bikes or ponies and ladies took the horse and sulky.
Our only help from carbon energy was kerosene for the kitchen lamp and coke used to smelt and forge the metals for farm tools and machinery.
We also practiced “sustainability” – we purchased little, and most of the farm produce was consumed on the farm by family, farm labourers and draft horses.
We were rescued from this life of sustained labour by carbon energy – a kerosene-powered tractor, a petrol-powered truck, and coal-powered electricity for lighting, heating, cooking, refrigeration, milking machines and pumps. The horses and farm labour were no longer needed and, for once, the farm produced a decent surplus of food for the growing cities.
Wind, solar, wood and muscle power are tools of the past and they work no better now than they did then. Forcing people to use these ancient technologies will just return us to laborious poverty on the farms and hunger in the cities.
Green energy should not be forced on consumers – those who want it should pay for it.
Green energy will eventually be abandoned, but the cost rises for each day’s delay.

So-called “renewable energy” is not clean, renewable, reliable, affordable or sustainable. 
“Renewable energy” is a sexy term used to drive public policies and spending  The Obama Administration and like-minded Green zealots have said repeatedly that they are waging a “war on coal,” intend to bankrupt coal-based power plants, and delay or block oil, natural gas and nuclear projects – while fast-tracking and subsidizing ethanol, wind and solar programs
Another apostle of the renewable energy, anti-hydrocarbon movement is Senator Harry Reid. The chief organizer of and keynote speaker at this week’s falsely named National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas, Reid is a true believer in destroying conventional energy through subsidies, regulations and strong-arm tactics. He even wants to shut down every coal power plant in Nevada.
Senator Reid may believe that compelling and subsidizing increased renewable energy use, while undermining and even outlawing conventional energy, is the way to economic growth and energy independence. In reality, this reckless scheme could easily cause the collapse of our energy grid, job creation, economy and living standards, just as it is already doing in Europe.
Unfortunately, Reid and his allies could get away with it, because “renewable” confers an almost Holy Grail status that ensures widespread political, media, public and corporate support (for a lot of wrong reasons). That lofty status, however, ignores two fundamental facts:

1) Wind, solar and biofuel energy are not renewable, eco-friendly, reliable, affordable or sustainable.
2) Renewable energy schemes can no longer be justified by claims that we are rapidly running out of fossil fuels or causing dangerous manmade global warming. Oil sands and hydraulic fracturing have obliterated the depletion myth, while climate change fears are belied by a 16-year hiatus from planetary warming, historic lows in hurricane and tornado activity, and the abject failure of CO2-focused climate computer models.
In other words, the craze for “renewables” is driven by religious zeal, not science or economics.
Capturing, converting and transmitting energy from any source requires an infrastructure – which involves construction, maintenance and eventual replacement, all of which require land disturbance, raw materials extraction and processing, energy and investment. There is no pure fountain from which to drink – only limited options, each with its own upsides and downsides.
To compare energy sources honestly and rationally for specific purposes (heating, lighting, transportation or manufacturing, for instance), we need to apply the same standards and analytical methods for each alternative. However, those who champion “renewables” have consistently misrepresented the human, environmental, capital, manufacturing and maintenance costs of providing reliable, affordable energy in sufficient quantities to power a modern economy and maintain desired living standards.
For example, the subsidies needed for wind and solar projects are many times higher per unit of energy actually produced than is the case for oil, natural gas, coal or nuclear power. And yet, even with those subsidies, electricity delivered by “renewable” sources is far more expensive than is power from conventional alternatives. That means families and businesses pay much higher bills for lighting, heating,   air conditioning and machinery power, when renewable mandates are imposed – and higher costs for all consumer goods, since higher energy and manufacturing costs are passed along to consumers.
When we factor in the natural gas, coal or nuclear power plants needed as backup for intermittent, unreliable wind and solar facilities, supposedly environment friendly renewable options also require more land, raw materials, energy and money than alternative, conventional energy sources. Solar arrays also impact vast areas of wildlife habitat, while wind turbines slaughter millions of birds and bats annually – necessitating broad, long-term exemptions from endangered species and other environmental laws.
The high cost of taxpayer subsidies and consumer electricity rates also results in two to four jobs being lost in traditional industries for every wind and solar job created via government manipulation of the marketplace. Blue-collar, poor and middle class families feel the worst impacts from this enormous wealth transfer to lobbyists, pressure groups, bureaucrats, and “green energy” companies and investors.
These subsidies are not sustainable; nor are the birds and bats and wildlife habitat being sacrificed on the altar of politically correct energy. Even worse, President Obama’s determination to slash hydrocarbon use by 80% – to stave off manmade global warming catastrophes that exist only in computer models, White House statements and Hollywood movies – will require a 25-fold increase in wind and solar electricity generation, resulting in the annihilation of numerous species in regions all across the Lower 48 States.
Renewable energy hucksters ignore all of this, as they seek more grants, tax credits, production mandates, feed-in tariffs, production tax credits, and guaranteed annual returns on investments. They seek to claim the high moral ground, by chanting “renewable” while ignoring the environmental, economic and human costs of capturing and delivering energy from their preferred sources.
A recent BBC News article notes that, while wind turbines are typically permitted for up to 25 years, developers anticipate upgrading or replacing them after as few as 10 years in many locations.  Offshore life spans are even shorter. A new Scottish Natural Heritage report says, by 2034, the industry will need to recycle or dispose of some 225,000 metric tons of turbine rotor blade material per year. This means 225,000 metric tons of new rotor blades will have to be manufactured, using materials extracted from the Earth via mining, drilling and other processes that use energy and generate mountains of waste.
A 2009 article in MacLife magazine acknowledges that, while “solar-powered gadgets have become de rigueur in our attempts to shrink our carbon footprint,” there is a rarely discussed “dark side” to solar energy. Many solar panels are made with cadmium, a highly toxic carcinogen, and when these panels are decommissioned after about 20 years there will be a huge accumulation of “e-waste.” Manufacturing polysilicon (a key component in sun-capturing wafers) generates four tons of toxic silicon tetrachloride for every ton of product – and Chinese firms that produce the bulk of this material and rare earth metals for solar panels and wind turbines have been dumping their wastes on farmlands and wildlife habitats.
Electric cars are likewise “environment friendly” only in the minds of renewable zealots.  They require multiple large batteries that typically last up to three years and cost about $8,000 apiece, not including disposal costs, Diane Bacher points out in eHow. Battery disposal involves putting their hazardous metal wastes in special landfills, and the mass production of electric car batteries will create large volumes of hazardous wastes, while placing as much demand on the power grid as traditional vehicle equipment manufacturing, Bacher notes. Increased use of electric vehicles would put enormous strain on power grids that rely increasingly on intermittent wind and solar energy and less on coal, natural gas and nuclear.
Meanwhile, Europe’s obsession with climate change and fossil fuel eradication has caused it to spend $882 billion on wind and solar power since 2005. Over 800,000 Germans have had their electricity cut off, because they could not afford to pay their soaring electricity bills; millions of British families have been driven into fuel poverty; and millions remain jobless in a stagnant EU economy.
“Renewable energy” is a deliberate false labeling strategy, designed to curry favor with trendy urbanites who are ignorant about energy and economic reality. The real cost to U.S. economic growth, jobs and living standards from following the Green Brick Road to ecological paradise is equally beyond their ken.
This is energy policy by and for not-so-bright lights, who let their religious fervor for anything not hydrocarbon get in the way of common sense and fact-based analysis. Their policies will result in dim bulbs in our future light fixtures – and expensive, job-killing energy for other needs. We cannot afford to continue going down this suicidal path.

The ETS is a variable and unpredictable carbon tax. It creates business uncertainty, is complex in operation, encourages brokers, lawyers and speculators and it will drain our money to middlemen and into the European carbon credit casino. And it will create a growing army of vested interests who will forever oppose its abolition.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/07/10/zero-emissions/,,Zero Emissions Foolishness,"The Australian Climate Commission says Australia needs to reduce emissions “to nearly zero by 2050”.
Such a reduction can only be achieved if the Climate Commission has a secret plan to use nuclear power or for a massive expansion of hydro power.
If they do not have such a plan, their “nearly zero” emissions target would force the shut down of most of the energy, transport and industrial infrastructure developed since James Watt invented the steam engine.
Imagine Australia with “zero emissions” – which means zero production of carbon dioxide from human activities and industries.
This would mean zero usage of coal, oil, petrol, diesel or gas, zero production of cement or steel and the shut-down of 92% of Australia’s electricity generators.
Sunbeams and sea breezes cannot supply 24/7 electricity – the only feasible non-carbon options for Australian grid power are nuclear or hydro. Has the Climate Commission joined the nuclear power lobby? Or do they have a secret plan for big hydro developments on the Snowy, the Franklin and the Tully-Millstream?
And how do we keep our diesel-fuelled transport fleet operating? Using big, big batteries and even more nuclear or hydro power to recharge them at every roadhouse in the outback? (But once they eliminate our grazing animals and their emissions, we will not need road trains.)
And how do we keep planes operating? Are they suggesting that we divert most of our sugar production to producing power alcohol?

For cement and steel we could of course try to catch and bury every molecule of carbon dioxide produced, but in reality the costs involved in such stupidity would force closure of these industries, and cement and steel would be imported from more sensible nations.
Some zealots would even like to see the end of our vast herds of cattle, sheep and goats, replacing them with kangaroos.
Unless the Climate Commission can show us a realistic plan for “zero emissions”, with cost benefit analyses, we know it is just more hot emissions from academic zealots.
They must put up, or shut up.

The primary source of surface heat is radiant energy from the sun. Minor heat comes from geothermal energy from volcanoes and hot rocks. Trivial quantities of local heat are brought to Earth’s surface by humans using stoves, cars, boilers, engines and factories powered by mined fuels such as coal, oil, gas and uranium. Even using “green” energy such as ethanol, wind or wood has a tiny temperature effect by transferring solar energy from farms and forests, to be released eventually as waste heat in cities.
Solar energy is more concentrated in equatorial areas and is moved pole-wards by the circulation of air (99.9% nitrogen, oxygen and argon), and by water and water vapour via evaporation, condensation and ocean currents. These processes are all driven by conduction, convection, latent heat and Earth’s rotation, not carbon dioxide. They are the major forces creating weather. Variations in solar cycles and cloud cover control longer term climate change.
Carbon dioxide plays almost no part in any of these dominant weather processes. Moreover, it does not burn, nor is it radioactive – it cannot produce heat.

By Ron Arnold 
It uses tons of fossil fuels every day, emits a greenhouse gas that’s like CO2 on steroids, can’t do the job it’s made for, costs taxpayers exorbitant fees, and makes the federal government look mentally ill for giving it outrageous subsidies. It also chops up birds, bats and scenery with roads and monstrous 400-foot-tall machines. “It” is wind power, of course.
These harsh facts were condensed into a preliminary draft study of wind subsidies by researcher Teresa Platt, who circulated it to specialists for vetting. I obtained a copy of the extensively footnoted working draft, which gave chilling reality to the truth behind wind industry claims.
“Every year since the 1980s,” Platt’s study said, “the 5,000 turbines at NextEra’s Altamont Pass in California kill thousands of slow-reproducing red-tailed hawks, burrowing owls, kestrels, as well as iconic golden eagles, and bats.” The birds Platt mentions are raptors – birds of prey – particularly valued for their agricultural role in killing mice and other crop-damaging rodents. Eagles, both golden eagles and bald eagles, have long impressed Americans for their majesty, and the bald eagle was selected by our Founding Fathers as our national emblem.
I asked Bob Johns, spokesman for the American Bird Conservancy, about wind farm eagle mortality. He confirmed Platt’s study and told me the Altamont operation alone has killed more than 2,000 golden eagles. But that’s not all. “Nationwide, the wind industry kills thousands of golden eagles without prosecution,” Johns said, “while any other American citizen even possessing eagle parts such as feathers would face huge fines and prison time.” 
Huge is right. Violate either the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Eagle Protection Act, and you could get fined up to $250,000 or get two years imprisonment.
Not a single wind farm operator has yet been prosecuted for killing birds, yet in 2009 ExxonMobil got whacked with a $600,000 fine for killing 85 common ducks and other birds that flew into uncovered tanks on its property. Other similarly outrageous revenge-style penalties have been assessed on oil companies by the viciously ideological anti-fossil fuel Obama administration.

So Big Oil clearly doesn’t have an Obama Big Wind Get Out of Jail Free card. This unaccounted wind industry bird-killer subsidy reveals a federal multiple personality disorder that must be cured.
Domestic oil and gas production is setting records – thanks to fracking on state and private lands, despite efforts by Obama, Cuomo, Brown and environmentalist lunatic groups to slow or stop it, and despite Obama and Comrades continuing to shut down ANWR, OCS and other federal drilling opportunities. 
We could totally end reliance on Middle East oil, if we would drill more here and permit Keystone XL pipeline. Instead, Obama is still pushing wind and solar, and working with “green” industry to minimize or conceal impacts, while subsidizing renewable energy to the tune of $11.4 million per permanent job. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hedges its annual windmill bird death estimates at between 100,000 to 444,000 dead birds. That smells like political appointees and staff biologists had both insisted on publishing their numbers – and too many staff biologists promote Big Wind, don’t want bird butchery to hurt Big Wind’s “eco-friendly” image, and don’t want to cross swords with subsidy-hungry politicians.
This body count issue has become a genuine data war, with experts hurling “my data are better than your data” cudgels at each other in the press and scientific literature. For example, a 2013 report by K. Shawn Smallwood estimates that in the U.S. in 2012, some 573,000 birds (including 83,000 raptors) were killed by wind turbines, at a rate of 11 birds per MW of installed capacity. 
That’s ridiculously low-balled, says Jim Wiegand, California raptor specialist and Berkeley-trained wildlife biologist. I asked Wiegand what the real number was. “At least 2 million birds per year,” he told me, “and I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if over 10 million birds were killed each year by wind turbines.” 
Wiegand is an on-the-ground, count-the-corpses type of wildlife biologist who does not take anyone’s word for the facts – a basic requirement of real science. Wiegand’s motto could be “Go and look.”
Therein lies Wiegand’s most potent argument for the Smallwood study’s underestimation: The wind industry has adopted bird-death counting standards that limit counts, so the results look lower than reality: Counters go and look only every 30 to 90 days – letting scavengers remove and devour large numbers of dead birds, artificially lowering the body count. Counters examine only a very small footprint around the windmill tower base – artificially lowering body counts.  Rotor blade tips can be whirling at 200 miles per hour, enough to whack an unfortunate bird “out of the ball park” – far beyond the little counting circle, out where nobody looks, artificially lowering body counts even more. Some critics accuse counters of simply burying some troublesome corpses – the old “slice, shovel and shut up” routine.
Rebutting Smallwood’s report, Wiegand told me, “In my opinion, there are at least 35 bird deaths per megawatt per year across the country. Some turbines kill several hundred birds per megawatt, depending on their location. In high bird use areas like the Kenedy Ranch turbine site in Texas, I believe proper studies on would easily show several hundred bird deaths per megawatt per year.”
The wind power industry must also share responsibility for bird deaths caused by super-long high-tension lines from distant turbines to cities. A 2007 report estimated the number of such mortality due to collisions on the wing to be at least 130 million, possibly as high a 1 billion, birds per year. 
And these numbers are just for birds. We don’t often think about bat benefits, but the U.S. Geological Survey estimates bats are worth $74 in pest control costs per acre – and windmills may have killed more than 3 million bats by last year. A small bat eats about 680,000 insects a year, so 3 million dead bats means 2 billion mosquitoes and other insects that shouldn’t be here are still flying around. 
Those numbers are likely way too low, as well. Windmill-caused bat mortality statistics, like bird death numbers, are hotly contested with estimates running into the multi-millions every year. 
Wind is usually touted as using no fuel, particularly no fossil fuel. That’s a clever deception. Windmills don’t work when it’s too hot or too cold, or when the wind blows too hard or not at all. So they need a backup, which is usually a coal- or oil- or gas-fired power plant.
Also, every windmill comes with a power line, which comes with a maintenance road, which comes with CO2-emitting traffic. Nobody’s counting that. Why not?
Then there’s SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, the most potent greenhouse gas evaluated by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with a global warming potential 22,800 times that of CO2. It’s used to insulate equipment inside wind turbines, their related infrastructure and transmission lines. It may leak during installation or maintenance. or from damaged, aging or destroyed equipment. 
Speaking of which, the average service life of a windmill is between 10 and 15 years – not the 20 to 25 years claimed by turbine operators, says a 2012 study by Britain’s Renewable Energy Foundation.
Falmouth, Massachusetts has the right idea. The town voted 110-91 to remove its two 400-foot industrial wind turbines for health and nuisance reasons. The only problem is paying the $15 million price tag for removal. They need to borrow $8 million to get the job done. 
Maybe some powerful Big Green group – think the Sierra Club or Natural Resources Defense Council – will step forward to save Falmouth? Fat chance. They’re in love with bird and bat butchering turbines.

There is overwhelming evidence that the political climate change agenda has dragged many scientists down into the world of political spin and deception. In fact, the CSIRO have been seen to be complicit in continually repackaging, recycling, supporting and perpetuating the politicised corrupted and exaggerated claims of the discredited IPCC. Further, the CSIRO has continued to support these corrupted politicised IPCC claims even after the IPCC has been discredited by scientists  from around the world, by the IAC review, and by the release of climategate emails. The CSIRO has shown no public concern about the unscientific practices of the IPCC or the implementation of reforms to strengthen the scientific procedures of the IPCC. The CSIRO has even been seen to be reinforcing the IPCC’s campaign to lower the standard of acceptable evidence by disguising AGW uncertainties to make them more acceptable.
The determination with which the CSIRO has endorsed the government’s call to “put a price on carbon” is also most disturbing since this advocacy is clearly not scientifically sustainable unless and until the science confirming human causation and reversibility is settled. But the CSIRO admit the science is not settled and natural climate variability cannot be reliably differentiated from human caused  climatic changes. Although there is no clear scientific evidence of an imminent human caused climatic catastrophe and no scientific evidence that current mitigation techniques have the ability to control climate and sea level, CSIRO have nevertheless proceeded to endorse  a “treatment” of unknown efficacy and cost for a problem which is yet to be proven real.

Chairman, The Carbon Sense Coalition.
Any quotes taken directly from this statement may be attributed to Mr Forbes
The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on the federal government to reduce the burden of the Climate Industry on all taxpayers and consumers.
The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the biggest national scandal today was how the whole government apparatus, including the nationalised research and media industries and parts of the opposition, was totally captive to a religious belief that a destructive war on carbon energy will somehow provide benefits to some future generation of Australians by cooling the climate and preventing extreme weather events.
“This is a delusion.”
Quote: 
It was the great Milton Friedman who said “There is only one tax on the people and that is government spending”.
Cutting expenditure, not re-arranging expenditure, must be the total focus of this budget.
And the first candidate for spending cuts must be the totally useless Climate Change Industry.
Every department, program, research grant, travel grant or salary with climate, warming, carbon, sustainability, renewable, sequestration, clean coal, ethanol or IPCC in its title or mission statement should be abolished forthwith together with its staffing. This list must include but not be restricted to:
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) and its dependants, saving about $3.2 billion.
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, saving about $10 billion.
The Emerging Renewables Program, saving about $126 million.
The Clean Technology Innovation Program, saving about $200 million.
Subsidies to Coal-fired electricity generators, saving about $5.5 billion. (This has to be the ultimate madness – the government levies a crippling carbon tax on coal-fired electricity generation to force them to close and then pays huge subsidies to the same generators to delay their closure).
All Climate Change “Research” focussed on carbon dioxide, saving about $300 million.
“Contracts for Closure” – payments to ensure closure of some electricity generators (unbelievable – surely the carbon tax will do this).
The Coal Sector Jobs Package – payments to coal mines to offset the cost of the carbon tax- just abolish the tax.
Coal Sector Assistance Package – Subsidies to some Coal Mines (another stupidity – repaying some of the carbon tax they took in the first place).
Everything funded under the Clean Energy Future Plan.
All renewable energy subsidies.
The Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund.
The Ethanol Production Grants Program – a subsidy per litre of ethanol produced.
All climate change officials, lawyers, inspectors and auditors everywhere, maybe 13,000 of them saving, say, $2 billion per year.
The offices of the Climate Commissioner and the Clean Energy Regulator – whatever they cost is wasted money.
The whole Carbon Capture and Storage empire – The National Low Emissions Coal Initiative, the CCS Flagships Program, the National Carbon Dioxide Infrastructure Plan, and the Carbon Capture and Storage Institute.
Support for all the International Climate Forums and Conferences via APEC, CEM, G20, IEA, IEF, IPEEC, IRENA, IPCC and all the travel costs associated with attendance.
All handouts under the Green Precincts Fund – $15M spent to date.
All government advertising, market research, media monitoring, media advisers and logo designers promoting the carbon tax, the Department of Climate Change, smart meters or other climate and green energy initiatives.
Donations to Green Friends such as the Climate Institute, the Australian Conservation Council, Climate Works Australia, Green Cross Australia, and the ACTU – $3 million spent already.
To “balance” all of these reduced expenditures the government must also abolish the carbon tax and all fuel taxes not related directly to public road usage and applied to road construction and maintenance.
Note: The above list probably includes errors, double counting and omissions, but such is the confusion and proliferation of the alphabet soup of what poses as “Climate Policy” that it is doubtful if anyone could prepare an accurate and comprehensive list. The only feasible solution is to start cutting, biggest first. None of them will be missed, except with relief by taxpayers and consumers.

The Carbon Sense Coalition has awarded its Inaugural Golden Fleece Award to Kevin Rudd and coal industry leaders for “flagrant fleecing of community savings in futile ‘research’ on Carbon Capture & Sequestration – a costly and complex process designed to capture and bury carbon dioxide gas produced by burning carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas”. 
It is obviously possible, in an engineering sense, to collect, separate, compress, pump and pipe gases, so new “research” is largely a waste of money. Engineers know how to do these things, and their likely costs. But only foolish green zealots would think of spending billions to bury a harmless, invisible, life-supporting gas in hopes of cooling the climate some time in the century ahead.
About 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide are produced for every tonne of coal burnt in a power station. To capture, compress and bury it could take at least 30% of the electricity produced, greatly increasing the cost of the limited amount of electricity left for sale – more coal used, increased electricity costs, for ZERO measurable benefits.
We have come to expect stupidity from politicians, but coal industry leaders who agreed to waste money on this should be sued by shareholders for negligence. Maybe they were just drooling at all the extra coal they would sell in order to produce the same electricity?
Kevin Rudd wins this award for “a Flagrant Fleece of $400 million taken from tax payers to fund the fatuous Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute.” There is little to show for the millions already spent except a lot of receipts for high class salaries, consultants, travel, entertainment and “operational expenses”.
Pumping gases underground is sensible if it brings real benefits such as using waste gases to drive oil recovery from declining oil fields.
Normally, however, CCS will just produce more expensive electricity.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/05/10/faulty-fdep-science-drives-unnecessary-florida-mercury-scare/,,Willie Soon commentary — Faulty FDEP science drives unnecessary Florida mercury scare,"Proposed rules would raise electricity costs, bring no environmental benefit, harm human health   By Willie Soon 
Regulatory actions being debated in Florida should raise bright red flags for Sunshine State residents, other US states, and even other countries.  
On May 24, the Environmental Assessment and Restoration Division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) issued a seriously flawed draft report, proposing much stricter limits for mercury in Florida’s river, stream, lake and coastal waters. The FDEP claims the rules are based on sound science and will improve environmental quality and public health.  
However, my studies of mercury (Hg) and its biologically toxic form, methylmercury (MeHg), over the past ten years make it clear that the new limits are not scientifically defensible.  
Not only would they raise electricity costs, while bringing no health or environmental benefits. The new standards, along with statements made by the DEP in public forums, would actually harm people’s health.  

First, the FDEP is wrong in claiming that mercury pollution is a new, manmade phenomenon.  
The Department cites a 2008 paper that reported average mercury levels of 0.25 parts per million (ppm) in the hair of Florida Panhandle women of childbearing age (16 to 49).  However, a 2002 study of 550-year-old Alaskan mummified bodies found hair mercury levels five to eighteen times higher: an average of 1.2 ppm for four adults and 1.44 ppm for four infants – and 4.6 ppm in one mummy!  
Equally troubling, the FDEP draft report cited a 1972 study, but failed to highlight the study’s conclusion that mercury levels in the past were at least as high as those in today’s tuna. In a related study, Princeton University scientists expecting to find a 9-26% increase in MeHg instead found no increase (and actually a slight decline) in mercury levels in tuna caught between 1971 and 1998. The Princeton researchers concluded that mercury in fish is not related to human emissions, which continue to decline in the USA.  
Even more important, the FDEP draft report failed to consider a 17-year-long Seychelles Islands study that found no harm, and no indications of harm, from mercury in children whose mothers ate five to twelve servings of fish per week – far more than most Floridians consume.  
In establishing MeHg exposure risks from fish consumption, the researchers concluded that no consistent patterns exist between prenatal MeHg exposures and detailed neurological and behavioral tests. They also concluded that, despite remote but potential MeHg risks, “ocean fish consumption during pregnancy is important for the health and development of children, and the benefits are long lasting.”  
Moreover, the latest Centers for Disease Control data show blood mercury levels for U.S. women and children are already below EPA’s “safe” levels for mercury – and EPA’s standards are the most restrictive in the world. In addition, selenium in nearly all fish is strongly attracted to mercury molecules and thus protects both fish and people against buildups of methylmercury.  
By scaring women and children into eating less fish, and thus getting fewer Omega 3 fatty acids, FDEP’s misleading literature on “dangerous mercury levels” in fish will actually impair their health.  
Second, the FDEP failed to note that natural sources dwarf human mercury emissions.  
Forest fires in Florida alone emitted an estimated 4,170 pounds of mercury annually between 2002 and 2006. This single source of local mercury emissions is significantly higher than mercury emitted in 2009 from all manmade mercury sources in Florida, including coal-fired power plants (which emit less than 1,500 pounds per year).  
The FDEP draft report did note that volcanoes are an important source of global mercury emissions, but failed to explain how enormous this natural source is. In fact, recent studies calculated that volcanoes, subsea vents, geysers and other natural sources emit up to 2 million pounds of mercury per year.  
These natural sources explain why it is unsurprising to find high levels of mercury in samples taken years ago in Florida fish, panthers and raccoons – long before coal-fired power plants were on the scene. Mercury has long been part of our environment, in ocean and terrestrial waters, and in Earth’s rocks and soils.  
Today, mercury from natural sources represents the vast bulk of all the mercury in our atmosphere. Even eliminating 86% of all mercury from Florida’s power plants (as the FDEP proposes) would bring trifling environmental and health benefits – while raising electricity rates for the state’s families, retirees, schools, hospitals and businesses, costing jobs, and adversely affecting human health and welfare.  
Third, the FDEP is wrong when it says mercury “pollution” in Florida’s watersheds and fishes is increasing.  
Since the 1970s, contaminants in fish have been monitored increasingly each year. More advisories are being issued simply because of increased sampling by state agencies, and “not necessarily due to increased levels or frequency of contamination,” as even the U.S. EPA acknowledges.  
Finally, FDEP’s proposed new mercury limit for Florida’s inland and coastal waters is an unjustifiably low 1.25 parts per trillion – which is equivalent to 0.00000125 ppm and 125 seconds in 32 million years!
The Department also assumes Hg levels in water are directly related to Hg levels in fish tissue. In fact, no such relationship exists. Indeed the FDEP draft report admits as much, when it says (page 58), “Using the data collected for the [Florida Mercury Project], no relationship is observed when comparing total mercury in the water column to total mercury in fish tissues.”  
It’s also worth noting that even a bottle of Hunt’s tomato ketchup or Jack Daniel’s barbecue sauce contains at least 50 times (!) more mercury than what Florida proposes to permit in its waters.  
One has to wonder why the FDEP is so intent on setting mercury levels below those that exist in nature – and why it is so reluctant to disclose, explain or discuss publicly available information from the scientific literature, so that all concerned Florida citizens can study it themselves.  
Scientific inquiry must be above political pressure and partisan advocacy. Good decisions can arise only if the scientific evidence and knowledge are examined fully, without selective bias.
The FDEP needs to reconsider its mercury rulemaking, and this time base it on actual science. So do other states, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other countries considering similar actions.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/04/29/clean-coal-by-wire/,,Clean Coal by Wire,"There is a persistent green myth that coal-fired power generation causes city smogs. It does not.
City air pollution is nothing new. King Edward I complained about London pollution in 1306, as did Queen Elizabeth I in 1578, long before the first steam engine operated.
Let’s look at the causes of some famous smogs – London/Pittsburgh, Los Angeles/Santiago, the Dust Bowls and the Asian Smogs.
The London smogs were caused by open-air combustion of newspapers, wood and cheap high-sulphur unwashed coal in domestic fires, stoves and boilers; by coal-burning blacksmiths, brewers and ironworkers in smoky forges, furnaces and coke plants; and by many smoky steam locomotives; all with inefficient combustion and no pollution controls. The smog was slowly eliminated by clean air regulations and by changing to “clean coal by pipe” (town gas) and “clean coal by wire” (electricity).
The Los Angeles smogs were caused mainly by backyard incinerators, vehicle exhausts and natural air inversions. They were reduced by using cleaner fuels, better engines and compulsory pollution-control equipment. Santiago has undergone a similar clean-up.
The Dust Bowl conditions of the Great Plains in USA were caused by drought and wind erosion of newly cultivated soils. Gobi Desert storms produced the Yellow River and the Yellow Sea and contribute to the Asian Brown Cloud today.
Today’s Asian smogs have many sources – forest fires in Indonesia; open air cremations in India; dust from volcanic eruptions and desert storms; soot, ash and other pollutants from millions of domestic rubbish fires, mosquito fires, cooking fires and heaters using anything combustible – cow dung, wood, paper, cardboard, plastic or cheap unwashed coal; and soot and unburnt hydro-carbons from millions of vehicles, many with engines needing maintenance and no pollution controls. Beijing today combines the 1950’s problems of both London and Los Angeles.
The Asian smog is NOT caused by producing electricity in modern power stations with closed boilers, pollution controls and using high-quality washed coal such as exported by Australia to Asia. The “power station pollution” pictured so eagerly in ABC and Green propaganda is actually steam from the cooling towers.
The main products released by modern coal-fired power stations are water vapour and carbon dioxide – both are essential life supporters. Neither one is dangerous. Both make our climate more liveable, but the contribution of carbon dioxide to climate is tiny. And the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal has done more to encourage the growth of plants and the greening of planet Earth than Greenpeace will ever do.
“Clean coal by wire” into every home is the one thing that could solve much of the Asian air pollution.

“Without coal, humans would have stripped every tree from every populated area to provide heating, cooking, building materials, steam power, and charcoal for smelting metals.
“Their silly opposition to coal in Britain means that now one large UK power station (Drax) is converting to burn wood, harvested in North American forests, and shipped to Britain to be burnt. Their selective blindness does not compute the net energy waste involved in this stupidity.
“Does Greenpeace support burning the forests?
“Green policies have also caused such high power prices that poor consumers in Europe’s bitter winter were stripping forests for firewood, even burning old books to keep warm.
“Does Greenpeace support high power prices, wood-poaching and book-burning?
“Green promotion of wind power is defacing the rural environment with networks of roads, power lines and whirling scythes that slaughter millions of bats and raptors all over the world. And causing duplication of generating equipment for the 70% of the time wind turbines do not deliver planned power.
“Does Greenpeace support this environmental destruction and waste of community resources?
“Greenpeace probably also believe that coal-fired power generation causes city smogs. It does not.

The wispy white vapour is steam, from the cooling towers, as harmless as what comes out of a boiling kettle. The tall stacks are the Exhaust Stacks, emitting mostly invisible harmless natural gases including nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and argon. They all came from the atmosphere in the first place. Where is the pollution?
“Today’s Asian smogs have many sources – forest fires in Indonesia; open air cremations in India; dust from volcanic eruptions and the Gobi desert; soot, ash and other pollutants from millions of domestic cooking fires and heaters using anything combustible – cow dung, wood, paper, cardboard, plastic or cheap unwashed coal; and soot and unburnt hydro-carbons from millions of vehicles, many with engines needing maintenance and no pollution controls.
“Clean, silent, non-polluting, low-cost electricity (“Clean coal by wire”) into every home is the one thing that could solve most of the Asian air pollution. Greenpeace will be believable when they can demonstrate that they use nothing made by coal energy and they can survive with their pleasant western lifestyle in world bereft of carbon energy from coal, oil and gas.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/04/18/curbing-the-global-warming-virus/,,Curbing the Global Warming Virus,"A virulent virus is being spread at international climate conferences.
Called the GW Virus (short for Manmade Global Warming Virus), the symptoms are a psychotic fear of the word “carbon”, a compulsion to blame man’s industry for every bad weather event, an urge to weave a warm bias into every weather report and forecast, and a morbid fascination with windmills. 
The GW virus was first identified in the British Parliament in 1988 and spread quickly to the vulnerable BBC. It is an airborne virus and was soon spread by junketing politicians to NASA and the UN, thence to an Earth Conference in Rio in 1992, and then to Kyoto in 1997. The infection peaked in Copenhagen in 2009, when thousands of politicians, academics, officials and reporters became feverish.
Because of its isolation, Australia had not developed immunity to this virus, and it quickly took root in the ABC, thoroughly infected many politicians especially the governing ALP/Greens coalition, and then spread via government grant meetings to the CSIRO and every University in the land.
In Australia, incurable cases are sent to an isolation ward called the Climate Commission, headed by chronic MGW sufferer, Tim Flannery. Like vultures perched on a dead tree, these dedicated doomsters see droughts and heat waves in every weather event, even when large areas of the country are suffering floods and unseasonal cold.
The only protection against the GW virus is immunisation with a shot of climate history vaccine. This helps “at risk” alarmists to accept that there is nothing new about fires, floods, droughts, cyclones, heat waves, snow storms or variations in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
To curb the further spread of this virulent and destructive virus, infected sufferers must be banned from climate conferences and all infected politicians must be quarantined in their offices.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/04/15/sun-climate-ollier/,,Sun is the Major Control of Climate; Look for Cooling – Australian Professor,"Professor Cliff Ollier of the School of Earth and Environmental Studies, the University of Western Australia, recently presented a paper in Poznan, Poland, in which he described the sun as the major control of climate, but not through greenhouse gases.
Abstract. The threat of dangerous climate change from anthropogenic global warming has decreased. Global temperature rose from 1975 to 1998, but since then has levelled off. Sea level is now rising at about 1.5mm per year based on tide gauges, and satellite data suggests it may even be falling. Coral islands once allegedly threatened by drowning have actually increased in area. Ice caps cannot possibly slide into the sea (the alarmist model) because they occupy kilometres-deep basins extending below sea level. Deep ice cores show a succession of annual layers of snow accumulation back to 760,000 years and in all that time never melted, despite times when the temperature was higher than it is today. Sea ice shows no change in 30 years in the Arctic. Emphasis on the greenhouse effect stresses radiation and usually leads to neglect of important factors like convection. Water is the main greenhouse gas. The CO2 in the ocean and the atmosphere are in equilibrium: if we could remove CO2 from the atmosphere the ocean would give out more to restore the balance. Increasing CO2 might make the ocean less alkaline but never acid. The sun is now seen as the major control of climate, but not through greenhouse gases. There is a very good correlation of sunspots and climate. Solar cycles provide a basis for prediction. Solar Cycle 24 has started and we can expect serious cooling. Many think that political decisions about climate are based on scientific predictions but what politicians get are projections based on computer models. The UN’s main adviser, the IPCC, uses adjusted data for the input, their models and codes remain secret, and they do not accept responsibility for their projections.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/04/11/creating-blackouts/,,"Warm and Well Fed, or Hungry in the Dark?","Politicians are continually increasing the risks of electricity blackouts with their dangerous climate policies. It is foolish in the extreme to believe that humans can change the future climate by collecting carbon taxes and covering the hills with wind turbines.
We should ask them: which is worse – gradual man-made global warming or sudden electricity blackout?
Alarmists try to scare us by claiming that man’s activities are causing global warming. Whether and when we may see new man-made warming is disputed and uncertain. If it does appear, the world will be slightly warmer, with more evaporation and rainfall; plants will grow better and colonise some areas currently too cold or too dry; fewer old people will die in winter and sea levels may continue the gradual rise we have seen since the end of the last ice age. There may even be a bit more “green” in Greenland. There is no evidence that man’s production of carbon dioxide is causing more extreme weather events. Any change caused by man will be gradual and there will be plenty of time to adapt, as humans have always done. Most people will hardly notice it.
What is certain, however, is that global warming policies are greatly increasing the chances of electricity blackouts, and here the effects can be predicted confidently – they will be sudden and severe.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/03/30/blackout-dangers-in-germany/,,Blackout Dangers in Germany,"What Happens during a Blackout – an assessment of the consequences of a prolonged and wide-ranging Power Outage in Germany
Infrastructures such as a reliable energy supply, functioning water-supply and wastewater-disposal systems, efficient modes of transport and transport routes and also information technology and telecommunications technology that can be accessed at all times represent the lifeblood of high-technology industrialised nations. The Committee on Education, Research and Technology Assessment therefore commissioned the Office of Technology Assessment at the German Bundestag (TAB) to investigate the possible effects of a prolonged and widespread power blackout on highly critical infrastructures such as drinking water, wastewater, information and communications systems, financial services and health services, especially against a backdrop where the blackout has a cascading effect spanning state and national boundaries.
In Germany, several recent natural disasters and technical malfunctions (Elbe and Oder floods in 2002/2005, power blackout in the Münsterland in 2005, the Kyrill storm in 2007) have highlighted the population’s dependence on such (critical) infrastructures. Supply bottlenecks, public safety problems and disruptions to road and rail transport have revealed the vulnerability of modern societies and made extreme demands on health, emergency and rescue services.
Since almost all critical infrastructures rely heavily on a power supply, a scenario of a widespread and prolonged power blackout involving massive disruption to supplies, economic damage and risks to public safety is a very serious matter. In 2004 the National Crisis Management Exercise (LÜKEX) highlighted the problematic consequences and chains of consequences and also the enormous difficulties faced by federal structures in managing such a crisis and threat situation that strikes without any advance warning.
As far as can be seen, however, the possible consequences of such an event have not yet been subject to an in-depth, systematic analysis in the literature or in official documents.
The analyses conducted by the TAB reveal that the consequences of such a power blackout could at least be akin to a national disaster. All internal and external civil protection forces would need to be mobilised in order to at least mitigate the effects.
The TAB report indicates how the resilience of critical infrastructures could be strengthened and how possible courses of action within the national system for disaster management could be improved. The report thus makes a valuable contribution towards heightening awareness of this issue within industry and society and offers the committees of the German Bundestag a sound basis for further consideration.

(The antithesis of Earth Hour)
A Reality Game for those Concerned about the Future for their Families

Acknowledgement: Josh at  www.cartoonsbyjosh.com
Media Statement by Viv Forbes
Chairman, The Carbon Sense Coalition.
Any quotes taken directly from this statement may be attributed to Mr Forbes.
The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on electricity consumers to boycott Earth Hour grandstanding by pampered people too silly to recognise the realities and benefits of reliable electricity.
The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, is supporting an alternative proposal that “Earth Hour” be replaced by “Energy Roulette Week”.
Quote:
The Earth Hour people turn off a few lights on a balmy night for a romantic hour in candle-light (incidentally generating twice as much CO2 as light bulbs for the same amount of light.) This is unrealistic green tokenism.

The tokenism of Earth Hour is further illustrated by holding it on the autumn equinox, a day half-way between the temperature extremes of mid-summer and mid-winter. This is the day least likely to be uncomfortable for the beautiful people who give up their electric lights, TV and air-conditioners for just one hour, while they have a pleasant hour sipping champagne (and releasing its carbon dioxide) on candle-lit balconies.
 “Energy Roulette Week” is a reality game designed to illustrate what the future holds if green governments continue to undermine 24/7 power (generated by coal, gas, hydro or nuclear), by increasing our dependence on fickle winds, the peek-a-boo-sun or smart-meter rationing.
“Energy Roulette Week” will give all players a real insight into what life without reliable electricity would be like. The lack of power can be due to insufficient generating capacity or merely the inability to pay the power bill. The result is the same.
Everyone will be encouraged to play this game. It is only a game, but because of its realism, most players will chicken out after the first “black day”.
To maximise the learning potential of the game, “Energy Roulette Week” is best started on the summer solstice (21st December) or the winter solstice (21st June). Or if you are too weak for a real test, join the greens on a balmy equinox.
To prepare for the game, take a well shuffled pack of cards and deal out 7 cards, face down, and place them in seven separate identical envelopes.
These are the rules for playing:
On the start day at 5:00 pm select one envelope and take out the card.
If it is a red card, just continue living as normal.
If it contains a black card (soon renamed by the kids as a “black-out card”), go out to your power box and turn off all power and continue living your life to the best of your ability.  At 8:00 am next morning turn your power back on.
If the card is the Joker, leave the power off until 12 noon the next day.
At 5:00 pm that evening take out another card, and continue this process until all seven envelopes have been opened.
Because black-outs are usually unexpected, the rules do not permit premature preparation of the evening meal, early showering or taping favourite TV shows. And because those trying to cripple carbon energy oppose the production of carbon dioxide, the rules also prohibit the use of kerosene, bottled gas, candles, petrol generators or motor cars.
Hopefully you won’t get seven black cards!
If you had a real-life “black-card” day, it would be due to local load shedding, or widespread problems with the generation network.
If you have real-life load-shedding, so does everybody else in the neighbourhood; so the rules prohibit slipping next door for a cuppa on your black-day!
And if in real life it was due to insufficient generating capacity across the whole city, the blackout would probably last for days, not hours, and your experience would be magnified 100 fold. (So no visits to shops, no food, no refrigeration, no petrol pumps or traffic lights, no public transport, schools or hospitals, no security, no TV, no recharging iPods and iPhones! Even worse would be to live at the bottom of a hill and there is no power to pump the sewerage away, it may come gushing up out of your toilet.)
You may appeal: “But I can’t play – I have a family member on a life-support device.” All the more reason for you to play, to ensure you always have a charged battery back-up to keep your loved one alive. If not, they could end up dead in the real energy roulette being imposed on us.
Of course this will never be a popular game because it is not pleasant being without reliable electricity.
But there are thousands of people who are already playing the game in real life, every day. They can no longer afford the cost of both green power and food so they turn the power off; or the power companies turn it off for them; or the wind drops or a cloud covers the sun, and green energy fails; or its rapid fluctuations cause a collapse in the electricity grid. For them it’s not just a few hours of inconvenience – it’s Perpetual Power Purgatory.
If this is what you want for your children and grand-children that’s OK. If you don’t, start waving placards that say “Stop the War on Carbon – 24/7 reliable, economical power forever”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/03/19/rescue-from-the-climate-saviours/,,Rescue from the Climate Saviours,"Does an increase in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere increase global temperature or not?
Most climate commentators immediately parrot the conventional wisdom of the climate alarmists  – “The atmosphere is a blanket retaining the heat from the sun. Increased carbon dioxide thickens the blanket and will cause dangerous warming, leading to a tipping point where runaway heating becomes irreversible.”
However an experiment conducted in 1909 shows this conclusion to be wrong – the atmosphere acts more like a radiator, quickly removing heat from land and water surfaces, transporting it aloft and radiating much of it back to space. The atmosphere is a great temperature moderator – it stops daytime temperatures from rising too high, and keeps night-time temperatures from falling as low as they would otherwise. The net result, averaged over the whole world, is not known, but the daytime shading probably has a greater effect on surface temperatures than the night-time insulation.

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the government and media focus on carbon dioxide emissions was totally misdirected and counter-productive. 
“All it will do is delay the spread of coal powered electricity to many areas now desperate for clean invisible power. It will also give an enormous boost to the demand for uranium fuel, whose mining and use is deterred by politicians in Australia.
“There is already a groundswell of opposition from well informed scientists and engineers to the whole basis of the Greenhouse Religion. Even the PM’s own backbench contains well informed sceptics, and the ranks of scientific sceptics are growing all over the world.
“This irrational and hysterical focus on carbon dioxide is diverting attention and resources from real pollution which is altering local climate and affecting many areas of the world. 
“For example, the “Asian Brown Cloud”, a haze of pollution about 3 km thick and sometimes covering an area as big as Australia, is causing real human health and safety problems. At times this cloud drifts right across the Pacific Ocean and is noticed in America.
“China now emits more sulphur dioxide (SO2) than anywhere else in the world. This chokes their people, causes acid rain and damages buildings. This brown haze is already affecting local climate and melting glaciers in China and the Himalayas. In Arctic areas, soot is covering snow and absorbing more heat from the sun. Soon the brown haze will obscure the sun in some polluted Asian cities.
“This pollution is caused by millions of cow-dung cooking fires and open-air cremations in India, cooking with wood, coal and cardboard all over Asia, forest fires in Indonesia and millions of small obsolete and dirty wood, charcoal and coal stoves and furnaces all over Asia and Africa. Similar problems are obvious in places in South America.
“The western world went through this pollution phase fifty years ago, and although improvements can still be made, we have banished the notorious smoke pollution of places like London, Manchester and Pittsburgh.  
“London smoke pollution was so bad that the city became known as “The Big Smoke”.  Children developed rickets from the lack of sunshine, plants and animals died and lung disease was widespread. During its last and worst ever pollution event, “The Black Fog” of 1952, caused by a temperature inversion over London, visibility was reduced to less than a foot and 4,000 Londoners died from SO2 poisoning (50 in one small London park alone). This shock brought action – cooking and heating with open fires of wood and coal was banned in big cities. Clean electric power saved the forests and cleared the air.
“The world’s worst pollution is caused by open air combustion of wood, dung and coal which produces not only the harmless greenhouse gases of water vapour and carbon dioxide, but also real pollutants such as soot, smoke, ash, dust and chemicals containing sulphur, chlorine, nitrogen, fluorine, and metals. In dilute quantities, these trace elements are not a problem, but when concentrated in city air, they can be toxic.
“Ignoring this real monster threatening human health and the environment, the media and politicians are chasing the CO2 mirage.
“Carbon dioxide puts the bubbles in your beer, the fizz in your soda water, the holes in your bread, the dry ice in your Esky and the gas in your fire extinguisher. It is colourless, odourless, and non-toxic and does not form polluting smog or acid rain.  It encourages the growth of all plant life on land and in the oceans. The whole plant world breathes in CO2 during the growing season and releases much of it again when the leaves fall. It is the key recycler of organic matter for the whole food chain, including the human race.
“Man’s emissions of CO2 are a miniscule factor in determining Earth’s temperature. But while are we are wasting time and money trying to catch and imprison this harmless Will o’ the Wisp,  an ominous brown smelly choking cloud of real pollution is growing in our northern skies.
“Removing most of the pollutants from combustion emissions is difficult but not impossible. Removing or burying all carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of carbon fuels is an impossible dream. “Zero emissions” and “carbon sequestration” for key carbon fuels like coal, oil, gas and wood are nonsense goals, and their pursuit is diverting attention and truck loads of money from a worthy goal such as “Zero Pollution”. 
“The western world has largely beaten its pollution with inventions such as the chimney, the stove, but most of all by a clean, silent, invisible energy called electricity, generated in clean, concentrated and remote power stations while delivering lighting, heating, cooling, cooking and motive power into the most humble home in the poorest suburb.  
“To fly over a clean modern coal-fired power station at say 10,000 m is to put it into perspective – a puny cooling tower or two emitting wisps of water vapour and a small amount of (invisible) carbon dioxide and which is dwarfed by any passing cloud, no matter how small.
“This third world problem presents a real opportunity for Australian energy companies to make profits and clean up the environment by promoting clean non-polluting modern power stations burning high quality Australian coals. This will allow cow dung to be used for soil improvement and allow re-afforestation of areas denuded by centuries of scavenging for fire wood.
“Invisible energy from coal has already banished most of the terrible pollution that affected cities such as London, Manchester and Pittsburgh, and allowed the regrowth of American forests.
“The public has been misled on this issue by an unholy alliance of environmental scaremongers, funds-seeking academics, sensation-seeking media, vote-seeking politicians and profit-seeking vested interests.
“Anyone with the real interests of ordinary Australians, Australian industry or the environment at heart would divert public attention and political action from the non-problem of carbon emissions and towards the world’s real pollution problems.
“History shows that people cannot and will not live without energy in their homes. Unless we allow coal to supply clean silent invisible energy, they will continue to burn dung, wood, cardboard, trees, oil, charcoal or reject coal to get their warmth or cook their food.
“Just one well designed, well-scrubbed, modern Australian designed coal power plant running on natural fossil sunshine from the Sunshine State could provide the light, heating, cooling and entertainment silently and invisibly to the front door for about 3 million Asian homes, housing maybe 10 million people.”
Mr Forbes called on government and opposition to cease political grandstanding on the Greenhouse issue, where carbon taxes and carbon emissions trading will adversely affect most Australians, and focus on goals that will really benefit all of Australia and the environment.

A recent report from friends who suffered terrible losses of buildings, fences, pasture and cattle in the Coonabarabran fire commenced with the ominous and oft-repeated message: “a raging fire came out of the National Park straight for us”.
There is only one way to limit fire damage – reduce the fuel available.
Fuel load can be reduced in three ways – by grazing animals, by planned small “cool” fires, or by mechanical reduction with slashers, mulchers or dozers.
Australia’s grassland landscape was created and managed by generations of Aborigines who were masters at using man’s most useful tool – fire. Every explorer from Abel Tasman (1642) and Captain Cook (1770) onwards noted the smoke in the sky and the burnt trees whenever they landed. This burning created the open grassland landscapes that dominated pre-European Australia. Aborigines lit fires continually, mainly to keep their fires sticks alight. Their small patchwork fires caused no permanent damage to the environment and fortuitously created and maintained the healthy grasslands and open forests on which many animals and Aborigines depended.
There have been two major changes to the tree/grass balance since European settlement. In the fertile well-watered coastal strip, large areas of thick scrub and open forest were logged and cleared for timber, farms, towns, roads, schools and the domesticated grasses of suburban lawns. Most of those trees have been displaced by those people who now, in ignorance, are also destroying the grasslands and remaining open forests by locking up land and preventing any form of regrowth control. Having destroyed much of the coastal forests and scrubs, they are now destroying the open forests and grasslands.
Misguided tree lovers and green politicians have locked the gates on ever-increasing areas of land for trees, parks, heritage, wilderness, habitat, weekend retreats, carbon sequestration etc. Never before on this ancient continent has anyone tried to ban land use or limit bushfires on certain land. The short-sighted policy of surrounding their massive land-banks with fences, locked gates, fire bans and exclusion of livestock has created a new alien environment in Australia. They have created tinder boxes where the growth of woody weeds and the accumulation of dead vegetation in eucalypt re-growth create the perfect environment for fierce fires.
Once ignited by lightning, carelessness, or arson, the inevitable fire-storms incinerate the park trees and wildlife, and then invade the unfortunate neighbouring properties. Many of today’s locked-up areas were created to sequester carbon to fulfil Kyoto obligations. Who pays the carbon tax on the carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by wild fires? The green bureaucracies and politicians are clearly mis-managing their huge land-bank. Aborigines and graziers did a far better job. There should be a moratorium on locking up any more land and a return to sustainable management for existing land holdings.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/02/12/hazard-reduction-burning/,,Changing the Landscape of Australia,"Australia, when Europeans arrived, consisted of a series of biota highly adapted to what we now call hazard reduction burning.  The reason is that this is what the aborigines had been practicing for 50,000 years or so.
They were greatly assisted in this by the existence in Australia of the “The Fire Tree”, the eucalypt.  The eucalypt promotes fire and is resistant to fire, so that in a regime of constant burning, eucalypts have a higher survival rate and you tend to get the type of monoculture remarked on by many early scientists, including Charles Darwin.
Since the advent of European man in Australia, we have, by preventing the Aboriginal practice of Fire-stick Farming, changed the landscape.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/01/15/warming-australia-fact-fiction/,,A Warming Australia: Fact or Fiction?,"The media has recently been reporting apparently unprecedented heat in Central Australia in the context of human-caused climate change. But is the current heat wave, with extended periods of days above 40oC at Alice Springs really unprecedented? To answer this question it is necessary to examine the data.
There are two sites at Alice Springs for which readily accessible temperature data are available. The first is the Alice Springs Post Office commencing in 1878 and ceasing in 1953; the other is the Alice Springs airport commencing in 1941 and currently the official observing site for Alice Springs. The sites are about 10 km apart; the difference in January monthly mean maximum temperatures between the sites during the period of common observations (1943-53) was 0.2oC with the airport being the warmer of the two.
For the airport site the January monthly mean maximum temperature for all years of record (1942-2012) is 36.2oC. The monthly mean January maximum temperature for all years (1879-1953) at the Post Office is 0.3oC cooler at 35.9oC. The impression is that, when combined, we have a relatively homogeneous maximum temperature record for Alice Springs that spans 134 years.
The airport site is the basis for conclusions being drawn that warming has occurred during the second half of the 20th century. The 95th percentile for the monthly mean maximum temperature data is 39.0oC; five years exceeded this value making the hottest Januarys 1994, 1999, 2004, 2006 and 2008, all in recent decades. The warmest year (2006 with a monthly mean of 40.0oC) started with 12 consecutive days above 40oC and with a subsequent 4 days above 40oC. To date, 2013 is up with these previously hot months having experienced the first 14 days with temperatures reaching 40oC or above. On these data alone one might conclude central Australia has been getting hotter.
The Post Office data, however, show a quite different picture. The 95th percentile value is 39.3oC, or 0.3oC warmer than for the airport. The hottest years from the Post Office record were 1879, 1881, 1887 and 1881, all in the late 19th century. The hottest year in the Post Office record was 1887 and had 11 days above 40oC, a brief respite then another 10 days above 40oC. Taken in isolation the Post Office record would suggest a very warm late 19th century with a cooling trend since.
When we plot the monthly mean data for both sites an extended pattern of cooling followed by warming emerges. Temperatures are now only recovering to the values of the late 19th century.

It is unfortunate that the Australian government has not considered it sufficiently important to digitise and make publicly accessible all of the meteorological records from earlier years. The Bureau of Meteorology website has a range of important statistics about changing climate but most are generated from data subsequent to 1910 and based on a digitised selection of those recorded. As a consequence, statements based on the post-1910 data that suggest an ongoing warming trend are incomplete and likely misleading.
There is fragmentary accessible data (such as the above for Alice Springs) and much anecdotal evidence to suggest that during the late 19th century over central Australia, western New South Wales and South West Queensland the temperatures were as warm as or warmer than for recent decades. Without ready access to the existing earlier meteorological data a faulty picture of a warming Australian climate is portrayed in official statements. However, based on the Alice Springs data, a coming period of cooling cannot be discounted.

The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that so many green policies that appear to have useful environmental goals fail to analyse properly the long-term unforeseen consequences.
Quote:
Green politicians need to learn Newton’s Law of Government Regulations: – “Whenever government legislates to force an economic outcome, the long term effect will be equal and opposite to that intended.”
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of green politics, where laws designed to help the environment are harming the environment. To publicise this stupidity, the Carbon Sense Coalition has created “The Gorbel Prize for Green Policies that have Inconvenient Outcomes”.
The winner of the Inaugural Gorbel Prize is the UK government whose green policies aim to make it uneconomic to burn coal. So the tax-payer funded Green Investment Bank has loaned £100 million to help convert the huge Drax coal-burning power station in Yorkshire to burning “sustainable biomass”. This is part of a huge finance package of one billion pounds to get the biomass green tick, earn renewable energy subsidies, and avoid the need to buy carbon credits.
Where do they plan to get the “sustainable biomass”? Each year 7.5 million tonnes of wood chips will be imported from North American forests to replace 4.5 Mt of coal.
The land required to produce wood at this rate is immense – about three million acres of forest per year.
Also, wood is less dense than coal with less energy per tonne and a greater volume per tonne. Thus a greater tonnage and a far greater volume of wood have to be handled to get the same energy. This huge volume of wood has to be harvested, hauled, chipped, dried, trucked, shipped and stored using more carbon fuels – all to produce more expensive electricity.
There is one real benefit from the scheme. When the whole process is considered, using wood will put more carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere than using coal. This will make the forests grow faster.
The same goofy green policies that have pushed Drax into burning forests also apply in Australia. Maybe wood chips from our carbon credit forests will soon fuel Yallourn or Hazelwood power stations?
Such green stupidity will take us back to the BC era (before coal) when forests and hillsides were stripped bare of trees to fuel stoves, heaters, boilers, charcoal makers and smelters.
We would all be better off if Drax burned coal, produced cheap electricity, saved those forests and, to satisfy green dogma, planted a token forest of new trees.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/01/15/tax-on-life/,,A Tax on Carbon is a Tax on Life,"Carbon is the essential building block for all living things.
But life cannot exist without energy.
The primary energy of the solar system is nuclear energy – it powers the sun which floods the Earth with solar radiation; other nuclear reactions release heat deep within the planet. But solar energy alone cannot create or sustain life.
Earth’s primeval atmosphere had three natural gases that contained the essential ingredients for the first plant life – carbon dioxide, the food for plants; water, the drink for plants; and ammonia, which probably supported the first primitive life forms. It also had methane, the first natural (non-fossil) hydro-carbon fuel.  Ancient atmospheres had far more methane and carbon dioxide than is present today (but no runaway global warming).
Life emerged in water when primitive plants using solar energy and the magic of photosynthesis took carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to create sugars, fats and proteins in their leaves, stems, roots, seeds and fruits. Their exhaust product was another natural gas – oxygen.
Millions of years passed, and slowly the plants consumed carbon dioxide and added oxygen to the atmosphere.
Primitive animals then evolved; they used oxygen to extract carbon energy stored in plants. They consumed these carbon fuels and exhausted carbon dioxide. Life is truly a carbon equation.
Carbon fuels such as wood, biomass, coal and oil are essentially preserved organic materials that store solar energy. When burnt in air they release stored energy and exhaust the same valuable by-product – carbon dioxide.
The human race depends totally on carbon based foods that are derived from the gas of life, carbon dioxide, plus nitrogen, minerals and water. And since the invention of engines, humans have come to depend on reliable, efficient, energy-dense, portable carbon fuels to grow, harvest, transport, refrigerate, process, distribute and cook food. The exhaust product from all of these engines is an important stimulant to the growth of all plants.
Without carbon dioxide, no life would exist. And without carbon fuels, modern cities would starve within weeks.
A tax on carbon is thus a tax on life.

https://carbon-sense.com/2013/01/13/2013-se-qld-heatwave/,,The 2013 Heatwave in SE Queensland,"By Mike  Williamson
12 January 2013
There has been much comment on our summer heatwave. This prompted a search for the history of temperatures in S.E. Queensland.
The longest continuous record of local temperatures was from Amberley: the data set was begun in late 1941 and is still active.
See: http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=36&p_display_type=dataFile&p_startYear=&p_c=&p_stn_num=040004
The record shows that the highest monthly mean maximum temperature for the month of January in each year was way back in 1942 and has not been surpassed since. (See Figure 1)

Figure 1 (click to enlarge)
The linear trend for the years 1942 to 2012, shows is a slight rise in the temperature trend. This is not surprising as the Earth’s temperatures have had several  rising phases ever since the last Ice Age ended over 10,000 years ago.
The Amberley data shows that the highest mean maximum January temperatures appear to be fairly similar when they periodically occur. However the lower mean maximums appear to be creating the very slight upward trend.
This does not then appear to support the man-made global warming hypothesis since if carbon dioxide is retaining heat in the atmosphere it should do so at all temperature levels, whether high or low. If carbon dioxide is causing the heating, why is carbon dioxide rising steadily whereas temperatures are not?
A Short Observation on Bushfires
Grass, peat, leaves and timber all ignite at temperatures well above 40oC. Even highly inflammable, easily ignitable, kerosene needs a spark exceeding 200oC for combustion to be initiated. Therefore heat wave temperatures cannot cause fires. Something else ignited them. Once ignited, hot temperatures and high winds make the fires more severe, but something else ignited them.

Our energy and environment deserve better – in South Africa and Qatar
Kelvin Kemm
A few weeks ago, perhaps as a prologue to the “global warming disaster” convention in Doha, Qatar, South Africa’s Department of Environment Affairs took out a full-page advertisement in our country’s newspapers, promoting National Marine Week.
The ad showed a map of the Antarctic continent, from above the pole, surrounded by the vast blue Southern Ocean. It also promoted South Africa’s new Antarctic research vessel, SA Agulhas II.
The advertisement’s text mentioned the massive Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which is responsible for distributing vital nutrients to the world’s oceans. It noted that the truly massive quantities of phytoplankton found in the ocean are vital marine building blocks in ocean processes. All that is true, and I certainly applaud efforts to protect the environment and promote National Marine Week and our country’s research efforts.
But then, sadly, the ad’s discussion of physics content went off the rails. Referring to phytoplankton, it said “these microscopic creatures also use carbon to create energy.” Wrong!

The most basic law of thermodynamics says energy is neither created nor destroyed, but merely converted from one form to another. The only way to “create” energy is via a nuclear process, whereby matter is converted to energy in a nuclear reaction, as Einstein famously postulated over a century ago. Nuclear processes operate outside the laws of thermodynamics, but there is certainly no nuclear process going on in phytoplankton.
I could have lived with that slip up in the physics. But it got worse – much worse. The ad went on to blame global warming for upsetting the phytoplankton. In a declaration straight out of Alice in Wonderland, it asserted: “The increase in surface temperature over Antarctica from climate change is having a catastrophic knock-on effect, depleting phytoplankton stocks, melting the Antarctic ice sheet and causing an alarming reduction in all marine life.”
First, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no “alarming reduction in all marine life.” None of my colleagues are aware of it. Second, the surface temperature over Antarctica is not increasing.
In fact, a new record has just been attained. Antarctic sea ice has just reached an all-time record for total acreage. Day 265 of the year 2012 set an all time record, and then on day 266 that record was broken. The days 265 to 270 were the six highest Antarctic sea ice extent days of all time.
The environment department then compounded these errors by committing the unforgivable scientific sin of claiming a supposed increase in surface air temperature over Antarctica “is having a catastrophic knock-on effect” – then providing no evidence to back up its assertion and not telling readers what the alleged knock-on effect is.
I cannot even begin to imagine how this knock-on is supposed to alter the Circumpolar Current, which in turn is somehow supposed to affect the “energy creation” capabilities of phytoplankton. Come off it, folks.
There is so much good Antarctic science to be proud of – and, for that matter, really fine South African scientific achievements in the Antarctic to brag about. That the DEA would feel compelled to celebrate National Maritime Week by resorting to phytoplankton scares supposedly related to nonexistent Antarctic heating is beyond mystifying.
Meanwhile, over the last few months, newspaper stories have told of reduced sea ice extent at our planet’s other pole, the Arctic. Terms like “alarming rate” of ice depletion were bandied about casually. Yes, there were reductions in Arctic sea ice cover.
However, on September 18, a video posted by NASA on its website showed that a large and long lasting Arctic cyclone “wreaked havoc on the Arctic sea ice cover,” by “breaking up sea ice.” The unusual reduction in Arctic sea ice cover was due to high winds – not to any warming of the Arctic or global warming in general. NASA’s belated analysis demonstrated that a large section of ice north of the Chukchi Sea was cut off by the churning storm, broken up and pushed south into warmer waters, where it melted.
The storm also broke up other ice, accelerating drifting and melting elsewhere. Reuters finally reported that “NASA says a powerful cyclone formed off the coast of Alaska in early August and moved toward the centre of the Arctic Ocean, weakening the already thin sea ice as it went.”
NASA noted that this was an “uncommon event” and that there have been only about eight storms of similar strength during August in 34 years of satellite records. However, a major storm every four years is not all that “uncommon.” Paul A. Newman, Chief Scientist for Atmospheric Sciences at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, added that such wind disturbances produce many effects and can also lift warmer water from the depths of the Arctic Ocean up to the surface to accelerate melting.
For some reason – probably having to do with its regular promotion of “dangerous manmade global warming” claims – the storm story was barely mentioned in the mainstream popular media. By contrast, the “alarming ice cover reduction” narrative was covered extensively.
Now jump back in time five years, to December 12, 2007. On that date Associated Press writer Seth Borenstein distributed an article that stated: “An already relentless melting of the Arctic greatly accelerated this summer – a sign that some scientists worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping point. One scientist even speculated that summer sea ice could be gone in five years.” 
Well, five years have come and gone. Borenstein was dead wrong. Does anyone suppose the AP will now publish an apology, admitting that its “science writer” was on thin ice when he made this outlandish statement, and saying he should not have tried to scare the public like that?
Perhaps the answer can be found in Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.
“There’s no use trying,” Alice said. “One can’t believe impossible things.” “I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”
Especially with the Doha climate change confab in full swing, taxpayers, newspaper readers – and anyone dreaming of a better life through reliable, affordable energy – deserves more honest reporting and more science-based energy and environmental policies than they have been getting.

“Evidence of widespread control of fire dates to approximately 125,000 years.”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_of_fire_by_early_humans
Many people assert that environmental extremists want to take civilization back to a pre-industrial state some 150-200 years ago, but the achievement of a “carbon free economy” would take humanity back at least 125,000 years before the discovery and control of fire, because that is the source of the carbon dioxide emissions that have now been declared “pollution.”  Even as the somewhat obscure term “cap-and-trade” is a little more clear when called a “carbon tax”, even more clarity would be achieved by calling it a tax on the use of fire, because that is what it is.  In their role as fuels, all hydrocarbons are useless until they are burned, which produces the energy that has fuelled human progress and provided the following benefits, which even the environmental extremists and various “rent takers” take for granted:
1) Light; even kerosene lanterns burn fossil fuel and produce carbon dioxide.
2) Heat; ask the victims of hurricane Sandy or anybody who experiences a power outage about the value of heat.  Even primitive people use fire for heat.
3) Communication; all modern forms of communication depend upon the power provided by the energy derived from fire.
4) Rapid travel; what form of travel today isn’t powered by the use of fire?  Trains, planes and automobiles are all powered with fire.
5) Escape from countless hours of physical labour.  Prior to the discovery and use of fire, especially that used to produce electricity, disparate groups of human being were stuck in separate small communities around the world forced to spend most of their time in physical labour.
6) Inventions such as the modern computer and the rapid, worldwide communication network, which includes cell phones, e-mail and the internet would not have been developed nor could they be sustained by the intermittent, low density energy derived from solar cells and wind mills.
7) Satellites, both communication and weather; how many satellites have been launched into space without the use of fire? Many, but not all, are sent to space by hydrocarbon fuels.  (Even those satellites that study outgoing long wave radiation and have futilely been attempting to prove that increasing levels of carbon dioxide are causing catastrophic climate change.)
8) One of the consequences of using fire as an energy source is that it has provided many people with enough time on their hands to debate whether or not fire is a good thing, i.e., the global warming AKA climate change AKA biodiversity AKA sustainable development debate.
(Remember also that environmental extremists not only want to ban the use of fire for energy production; they want to ban the use of nuclear energy and hydroelectric energy as well.)
The vast amount of energy that the use of fire has placed at the disposal of humanity has been used to revolutionize the nature of our existence.  The mere fact that fire was a source of light and heat independent of the sun meant that humans could roam beyond the tropics into the damp, cold regions of the north with seasons of snow and long freezing nights. It was fire and fire alone that enabled man to become a creature native to the entire world and not just the tropics.  In addition, the heat of the fire, i.e. cooking, brought about changes in our food supply that made otherwise inedible food palatable and nourishing.   Fire has not only increased the variety of food that humans can eat, it also powers the diesel tractors used in modern farming.  Our food supply has consequently multiplied beyond the wildest dreams of our ancient ancestors.  Current world hunger problems are primarily distribution problems not quantity problems.
Nor has the importance of fire diminished with time; rather the reverse.  Wood was no doubt the first fuel used in building and maintaining a fire, but coal took primacy over wood in the 17th century.  In the 20th century these two fuels were join by gasoline and oil.  In the 21st century shale oil and natural gas are gaining importance.
If the “powers that be” really thought that the continued use of fire was causing a climate catastrophe they would ban its use all together, but it would seem that they just want a piece of the action.  The cap-and-trade scheme is not unlike property tax in which the government just lays claim to your property and starts charging you rent, i.e. property tax.  (If you think that you own your home just stop paying your property tax and see what happens.)  The cap-and-trade scheme is the government just laying claim on all fossil fuel resource within its jurisdiction and charging people a fee to burn them as an energy source.
“The power to tax is the power to destroy.” (John Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland 17 U.S. 327)
It could be that humans will eventually run out of things to burn, but that day keeps getting pushed back by innovation.  For the present I can’t think of a more efficient way to destroy our society’s prosperity, which has brought us all of the above benefits, than to impose a tax on the use of fire.  It leaves me wondering; in what kind of society do we now live in which we have to buy a license to use fire as an energy source, something that has been free for 125,000 years?  And who exactly are we paying these fees to in order to obtain the privilege of burning that which nature provides?

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/11/12/carbon-fools-day/,,Carbon Fools Day,"Australian Senate passes Carbon Tax Bill – Nov 8 2011.
– a date that will be remembered as Carbon Fools Day.
Just a year ago, Australia joined the ranks of Carbon Fools by passing the Carbon Tax Bill (actually 18 separate bills called the “Clean Energy Bills”.) Now the same fools who introduced it are among the front rank of volunteers for carbon suicide by trumpeting their intention to sign Kyoto 2.
Barack Obama and Julia Gillard are founding members of the Carbon Fools Club, and have learned tricks from one another on how to betray the electorate without getting punished.
Before the election Gillard said “There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”. Her Treasurer confirmed the promise. After the election, she changed her mind and introduced it. Now she is proceeding to bribe enough of the electorate into acceptance of the betrayal.

In America, there was little if any mention of a carbon tax by Obama during the election campaign. But before the celebratory election victory hangovers were gone, the headlines read “Obama May Levy Carbon Tax to Cut U.S. Deficit”. No more green flummery about saving the planet – just the truth – “we need the money”.
We face troubling times, and the next year will be critical.
Obama cannot stand for re-election, and the Democrats will probably lose the next presidential election. So they have four years to introduce their green utopia in such a way that no future administration will dare to undo the mess. In Australia, the Green/Labor coalition may not survive the next election either, so they too have an urgent need to cement their anti-industry, anti-mining, anti-farming, anti-fishing, green energy and carbon-tax agenda in just 12 months.
The American election shows us there is no guarantee that Gillard will lose the next election. And the green-ants within the Coalition may undermine Tony Abbott’s promise to abolish the carbon tax. Naturally there will also be a claque of vested interests opposing the loss of their green feather beds, and they will be supported fully by the ABC in Australia (just as the BBC supports climatism and those who benefit from it in the UK). So there is a big battle ahead for Australia and the US.

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/10/27/wind-solar-coal/,,Wind and Solar are Worse than Coal and cause the Waste of Gas,"James Hansen, an outspoken world climate alarmist says: “Coal-fired power plants are factories of death”. The Australian Greens want a fast end to coal mining in Australia, and support a swift expansion of wind and solar power. As the Greens are part of the coalition which governs Australia, the electricity industry is now being coerced by carbon taxes and green subsidies and mandates to replace efficient and reliable coal-powered electricity with costly and unreliable wind and solar plants. All of this paranoia is driven by climatist claims that carbon dioxide causes environmental harm by triggering dangerous global warming. Let’s look at whether coal energy or green energy does more harm to the environment.
There is absolutely no proof that carbon dioxide causes any measurable changes to climate. In fact, the evidence indicates that changes in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are a result, not a cause, of variations in global temperatures.
Moreover, burning coal in clean modern power stations has definite benefits for the biosphere – it puts food and drink for all life back into the atmosphere. The major coal combustion products are – nitrogen plant food from the air (69%), carbon dioxide plant food from the coal (21%) and water vapour, the liquid for life, from the coal (7%). The other 3% comprises mainly inert atmospheric gases from the air and an ash residue of trace minerals from the coal. The green bogey-man, carbon dioxide, is the gas of life and a free gift from coal combustion to the biosphere. More carbon dioxide has proven benefits in making plants grow faster in good weather and helping them survive better in droughts or frosts. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is insurance for the biosphere no matter what climate change is in store for us.
Green energy, however, can affect local climate and does cause environmental damage…

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/10/08/feast-or-famine/,,Feast or Famine,"By Viv Forbes
Food depends on land access, farmers, fertilisers, tractors, carbon dioxide and carbon fuels.
Famine always follows global cooling, drought and silly politicians.
This article looks at the recent history of the things that have driven world food production since the days of horse drawn ploughs. It examines the large increase in food production caused when tractors replaced horses, and the way the introduction of modern fertilisers saved many farms from bankruptcy. Drawing on his own childhood experience of farming using  green (horse) power and other stories from this era, the author exposes the key factors supporting world food production today. And mentions the abuses of some modern farming aids.
Farmers depend on fertilisers to replace the soil minerals shipped off to cities in farm produce. They need machinery such as tractors and trucks, carbon fuel to power these machines, and freedom to find the best ways of producing healthy food while maintaining the productivity and value of their land.
But most of all, our food supply depends on the magic plant food of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide. It is a sad commentary on the state of science education and the strength of alarmist propaganda that carbon dioxide, the gas that supports all life, is now widely thought to be a pollutant in the atmosphere.
Finally it looks at the possible threats to our food supply.
The biggest threat is political – the plan to use taxation, rationing and legislation to force farmers back to the days of the horse and buggy when 40% of farm produce was used to fuel horses. Only now they want the farms to produce all the ethanol and biofuel to fuel our much larger vehicle fleet. The continual closure and restrictions on land use by carbon credit forestry, vegetation clearing bans, ethanol production and other land restrictions is already reducing food supply.
The weather is indeed a threat to farmers and food supplies. But the threat is not global warming – ice, snow and cold weather are the main climate threats to farmers everywhere. Every past warm era has been a time of prosperity and growing population. The current generation of politicians and their bureaucracy has not studied science or history.
And warmer climates must produce increased evaporation from seas and lakes. This aerial moisture must cool, condense into clouds and fall somewhere as rain or snow. No farms are ever threatened by a warm moist era – it is the cold periods and the drought eras we need to fear. The whole climate alarm industry is focussed in the wrong direction, for the wrong reason, and their wrong policy prescriptions can only worsen any food shortages we may encounter.

Their promotion of “sustainable farming” yearns for a bucolic nirvana of self-sufficiency with no room for modern farming that has produced the food surpluses that sustain the cities. Their worship of the ‘precautionary principle” would have us cease innovating and experimenting “in case something goes wrong”. They scare our kids with never ending forecasts of doom. And they hobble our enterprising spirit with taxes and green tape. Their goal is to force the human race to retreat to the past, abandoning our mines, farms, forests and fishing grounds.

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/09/07/sustainable-farming/,,Sustainable Farming,"By Viv Forbes September 2012
“To be truly ‘sustainable’, a farm must recycle everything – otherwise it is depleting its soil minerals. Therefore it cannot sell any of its produce. This means it cannot buy items from the outside world, such as machinery, to make labour less arduous, and to produce more food. It is thus an impossible dream.” – Bob Long
The man-made global warming crisis has gone cold, the “man-made extreme weather” scares are wearing thin, and people are waking up to the “tax war on carbon”, so a new theme is needed for handing control of our lives, businesses and property to the world bureaucracy. The theme for the next green alarm is “sustainability” and a favourite target is “sustainable farming”.
We need to recognise some realities. Modern cities are not sustainable without farms, and modern farms are not sustainable without modern machinery, mineral fertilisers and affordable energy. City people should thank the lord for the machinery and cheap energy that produce the surplus food and all the trucks, road trains, refrigerated vans and milk tankers that bring it to their supermarkets every day. The last thing they should advocate is “sustainable farming”.
Unlike most armchair experts on sustainable farming, my early life was spent on an almost-sustainable farm. The memorable lessons we learned are described below.
Cows were milked by hand, ploughing and planting was done with a team of draft horses. Here is how green power works:

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/08/12/burning-the-biosphere/,,Burning the Biosphere,"When I was a kid, Mum did the washing in a copper of boiling water over an open fire in the back yard. We collected the wood from the back paddock with a horse and dray. It was all very “green” (but we thought it was just hard yakka).
Greens want us to return to this primitive method for generating heat, and even electricity.
It is sensible for industrial plants such as sugar mills to burn readily available organic waste such as bagasse to generate power. But to deliberately build power stations to run on wood chips is a step back to the BC (before coal) era when forests were clear-felled to produce fuel and charcoal to feed boilers and furnaces.
Coal is an energy-dense fuel, and often has huge deposits in a concentrated area. Long-life power stations can be built close to the coal deposits, thus minimising transport costs and land disturbance.
Wood, however, has very low energy density and biomass energy is always spread over large areas of land. The fuel gathering operation must move every day, with enormous waste of transport energy and displacement of plants and animals.
Burning coal or burning biomass produces exactly the same harmless combustion gases, and a switch of fuels will have no measurable effect on climate.
Even more stupid than wood power are Green dreams to feed power stations with low grade fuels such as wheat stubble or fowl manure. The collection and transport costs for such inferior fuels will exceed the value of electricity produced. It also robs the bio-sphere of valuable mulch, fertiliser and humus.
Burning biomass to generate electricity is Green madness. Speculators should be free to fritter their own funds on such nonsense but public subsidies, carbon credits and market mandates should not be used to support them.
Here is a new slogan for true environmentalists: “Don’t Burn the Bio-sphere”.

But about half of the population still think that the carbon tax will do some good. Why? It is all about “cleaning up dirty coal energy”.
The seeds of public concern were sewn with Penny Wong’s Machiavellian linking of “carbon” and “pollution”. She was assisted by the gross stupidity of the coal industry leadership in promoting nonsense like carbon sequestration as a “clean coal” option. The public naturally assumed “if they need to spend billions to produce “clean coal”, obviously we are now using “dirty coal”. This generation of coal industry leaders is more culpable than the greens – they should have known better – they have betrayed their shareholders, their employees and the nation.
The whole “dirty coal” program was assisted by the continual portrayal by alarmist media and government propagandists of power station cooling towers belching “pollution”. As carbon dioxide is an invisible gas, this is clearly a lie. What is seen are clouds of water vapour with no more pollution potential than wispy white cumulus clouds or boiling dark nimbus thunderheads.
And of course coal is black, thus dirty and dangerous like “a black mark” which is a de-merit point, a “black act”, which is nasty behaviour, “black magic” which is evil sorcery and “the black death” which kills people. What a pity coal was not rare and pretty like that other form of carbon, diamond.
A local climax of this unrelenting black-guarding of coal was a letter published in the Queensland Times of Ipswich, a town founded on coal mining, describing carbon dioxide as “one of many lethal pollutants released by coal combustion”.

Letter to the Editor
Add more carbon dioxide to green the planet
In western Canada, a ‘BC Greenhouse Growers Association’ spokesperson said on a radio program to the effect, “most greenhouses consume the available CO2 within the first 1/2 hour of the daytime growing cycle, and thereafter the grower must add CO2 within the greenhouse”.
Therefor assuming a 12 hour daylight growing period, they would add 23 times the ambient (380 parts per million) amount of CO2 to make the plants grow stronger to the desired size, strength and health etc. These CO2 enhanced plants also use less water to grow. If we wanted to green the planet, we should be adding more CO2 to the atmosphere, not less.

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/06/22/war-on-carbon-2/,,The Long and Costly War on Carbon,"The Australian government claims that next month’s tax on carbon dioxide cannot be blamed for today’s soaring costs of living.
This tax, however, is just their latest assault in the decades-long war on carbon that is already inflating the cost of everything.
For at least a decade, power companies have been obliged to source 10-15% of their power at inflated prices from costly and unreliable sources like wind and solar. And for every wind or solar plant built, a duplicate backup gas facility is needed, increasing the demand and price for backup gas, hitting other gas consumers. Moreover, the threat of more carbon taxes has deterred the construction of efficient new coal-burning power plants. Rising electricity costs feed into the cost of everything from public transport to building materials.
The climatists are also responsible for numerous policies pushing up the price of food. These include the ethanol/biofuel madness, the restrictions on the fishing industry, the Kyoto scrub clearing bans, the spread of carbon-credit forests over farming and grazing land, the never ending war on irrigators, and the virtual ban on building new water-supply dams.
Then we have all the hidden costs of the climate industry. Thousands of our smartest graduates are lured into well-paid dead-end desk jobs in the overheads industry devoted to climate red tape, while real entrepreneurs are unable to find workers to develop our continent of under-utilised resources. There is an overpaid bureaucracy devoted to climate “research”, alternate energy, international junkets, Kyoto give-aways, and administration, auditing, enforcement, accounting, law and propaganda for their empire of climate taxes and subsidies.
Finally we have income tax implications from all the money being flung around to bribe people to accept their carbon tax? Every Australian will get these bills somewhere, sometime. And who pays for the hundreds of millions poured down subsidy rat-holes like carbon capture, solar panels, pink bats and the IPCC?
Australia’s crippling carbon tax is but the latest symptom of the costly Climate Madness infecting the well-fed elite of the western world.
When the consumers of Australia realise the extent to which they have been conned and needlessly pauperised, the electoral retribution will be swift.

I read in the Sydney Morning Herald that Tony Abbott is running into opposition from the Nationals over plans to reduce CO2 by planting trees. Their objection is that subsidised tree planting will consume arable farms and threaten food security for Australia.
Whilst I don’t actually think the globe has been warming since 1997, or that it would necessarily be a bad thing if it were, my objection to the planting plan is that forests lock up carbon only until the inevitable bush fire releases it again.
If carbon dioxide is deemed bad and we are told to reduce it, we can either reduce our output or lock more carbon away in carbon sinks, where it cannot easily get back into the atmosphere.
If I can describe to you a plan that will lock vast amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere for hundreds of years and will consume no arable land or threaten food production and will create new jobs and exports for Australia, do you think that would be a good idea?
Carbon Sinks
Forests are very efficient at converting CO2 into wood in the first fast growing 20-40 years, after which growth and carbon capture tails off. “Old growth” mature forests are almost useless for this purpose.

The Nationals are afraid Tony will fund continuously expanding plantations of new growth to keep forests locking carbon in place, but the same result in carbon capture can be achieved without putting any new land into forest, by better managing what we already have in bush. We also have a problem of increasingly dangerous forest fires caused by excessive fuel loadings in unmanaged forests. The answer is not to put more land into forest; it is to mill the “old growth” forests that are no longer pulling their weight in carbon capture. Whether the wood is used for house framing or exported as lumber, pulp or fibreboard, it is out of the carbon cycle, potentially for hundreds of years. Even if it is made into disposable products like paper, that remains in landfills for hundreds of years. Landfills should be recognised as carbon sinks.
Then the new planting that Tony wants will be on the newly felled land, replacing the lazy “old growth” trees with fast growing carbon-binding new trees. We could replant with specific species of eucalypts that koalas like to eat, thus expanding their habitat at the same time. The tree felling, if done in strips across the prevailing summer wind direction, can also be used as fire breaks. It is all win-win! This will actually make money for the country, and is much cheaper to introduce than the untried technology of coal fired carbon capture at power stations.
Sold properly, we’ll have Tasmanian greenies protesting for more pulp mills to convert their forests into carbon sinks! And we would bring back a golden age of forestry, strip felling vast swathes of bush with a clear conscience. I imagine the fanatical warmists would soon be demanding that we clear-fell 5% of our national parks each year to attain our carbon reduction targets, by sequestering massive amounts of carbon into lumber.
Smart people can probably add a bunch of improvements to these fairly basic concepts, but the objective is clear – scrub CO2 out of the air to off-set the production of CO2 from coal burning power stations with new wood. Carbon sequestration is most easily achieved by converting trees into lumber and building houses out of it, then growing more trees on the same ground.
Just think of the slogans:
The tree-fellers will be our new eco-warriors!
Save the world thanks to sawmills!
The chainsaw shall become a symbol of hope to the carbon-phobic!

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/05/27/soda-water-scare/,,The Soda Water Scare,"With the failure of “Global Warming” the climatists have concocted a new alarm – the soda water scare.
Their computer models are forecasting that the oceans, which weigh 300 times more than all the gases in the atmosphere, are being turned acidic by the 0.0012% (12 parts per million) of man-made additions to the carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth’s atmosphere.
CO2 is a natural gas that dissolves in water. The amount absorbed depends upon how much CO2 there is in the air, and the temperature of the water. CO2 dissolves best in cold water and is expelled as the water warms. And far more would be absorbed if there was 100% CO2 in the atmosphere above.
When concentrated CO2 gas is bubbled under high pressure into ice cold water much CO2 dissolves, producing acidic soda water whose pH (acidity) could be as low as 4. This is 1,000 times more acidic than pure water whose pH is a neutral 7.
But oceans are much warmer than that and atmospheric CO2 is at much lower pressure. Therefore in the open ocean, pH seldom gets below 8, ten times more alkaline than pure water.
This weak soda water could only be described as “acidic” by someone pushing an alarmist agenda. There are no measurements that show that the pH of the ocean is changing more now than in the past – only models. In historical terms, atmospheric CO2 levels are now close to record lows. Corals and other ocean life have flourished in atmospheric levels of CO2 far higher than today’s.
We are told that the tiny bit of natural soda water in still-alkaline sea water will dissolve corals and shells, kill fish and create oceanic mayhem?
If soda water is so dangerous, then how come people consume it in copious amounts in beer, scotch and fizzy drinks?

The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said solar energy was expensive, unreliable and unnecessary.
“Nowhere in the world has solar energy proved a sensible investment of tax payer funds. Green dreamers and speculators should be free to build the own monuments to the sun god, but ordinary mortals should not be forced to pay for their fetish.
“Examples of solar stupidity abound.
“Generating electricity from solar panels in cold, cloudy Northern Europe is like growing paw-paws in Iceland – it can be done, but who would be so silly as to try?
“Germany was silly enough to try. Germany gets about an hour of useful sunshine per day in winter – solar power is weakest just when they need it most. But they have installed about half of the world’s solar panels. Germany’s Q-Cells, once the world’s biggest manufacturer of solar panels, just went broke. So did four other German solar companies.
“Sunny California also tried, but despite a half billion dollar loan from US tax payers, solar panel manufacturer Solyndra went broke. Solar Trust of America, recently offered $2 billion in loan guarantees by US tax payers, has also filed for bankruptcy.
“All the European PIIGS have tried – and the waste of taxpayer funds on failing green energy schemes is a major reason for their parlous financial state.
“The only sensible participant in the solar industry is China – they make panels very cheaply using coal or nuclear power and sell them to green dreamers.
“The reason green energy creates so much red ink is pretty obvious – it just needs one day’s observation of the sun.
“Full strength solar energy is available around midday for maybe 8 hours each day, providing the skies are clear, and there is no dust on the panels, and you are in a tropical zone. For the other 16 hours of the day, most electricity must come from reliable energy sources like gas, hydro, coal or nuclear. This about doubles capital and operating costs for no increase in output.
“With all this compelling evidence of the failures of solar electricity, why is the Australian government frittering $1.5 billion on green toys like the Moree and Chinchilla Solar farms?
“Green gambling is for private speculators not for captive tax payers or electricity consumers.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/05/23/utter-desperation-of-global-warmists/,,The Utter Desperation of Global Warmists,"By Alan Caruba

In the “glory years” of the global warming hoax, you had Al Gore picking up Oscars and Nobel Prizes (shared with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and government employees like James Hansen of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies were picking up wads of cash as awards, speech fees, and grants.
The folks who conjured up the computer models featured in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports also did quite well for themselves, along with all the others who climbed on the gravy train of global warming grants.
And then in 1998 a cooling cycle set in. It was hard to hide because the weather satellite data was indisputable, but try to hide it they did. Even then, however, there was a handful of outspoken meteorologists and climatologists who were trying hard to get out the message that the perfectly natural warming cycle was over and had been replaced, thanks to—guess what?—a lower output of solar radiation by the SUN.
Still the warmists persisted, infiltrating school systems to frighten children, brainwashing students in colleges, and coercing the public through apocalyptic books, through magazine and newspaper articles, and on television and the Internet.
In 2009, the release of a huge cache of emails between the IPCC global warming perpetrators instantly became known as “Climategate” as the world learned that it was all a scam, a hoax, a fraud based on deliberately falsified computer models, and force fed to the public.
The desperation of the warmists was palpable.
In 2006, Grist, an eco-magazine, called for Nurenberg-style trials for skeptics. By 2007, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. had called any doubts about global warming treason. “This is treason. And we need to start treating them as traitors.” Two years later in 2009, Kennedy called coal companies “criminal enterprises”, declaring that their CEO’s “should be in jail…for all of eternity.” In 2008 NASA’s Hansen was calling for trials of climate skeptics for “high crimes against humanity.”
Didn’t like the warmist’s bogus science? A former member of the Clinton administration, Joe Romm, defended a comment on his Climate Progress website that warned that a generation of brain-washed youth would see to it that skeptics would “be strangled in their beds.”
Today, another Clinton appointee, Carol Browner, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator is one of Obama’s “czars” and the unseen specter whispering in the ear of Lisa Jackson, the current EPA administrator. She is joined by John Holden, an Obama science advisor, and Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu.

If threats of jail and murder couldn’t shut up the skeptics, then Professor Kari Marie Norgaard, speaking at a warmist confab, “Planet Under Pressure”, put forth the notion that any science-based skepticism—based on actual, not fictional data—should be “recognized and treated” as some sort of aberrant behavior.
Doubt global warming? Well, you must be nuts!
Norgaard is a professor of sociology and environmental studies at the University of Oregon. As she put it, “Climate change poses a massive threat to our present social, economic and political order. From a sociological perspective, resistance to change is to be expected. People are individually and collectively habituated to the ways we act and think. That habituation must be recognized and simultaneously addressed at the individual, cultural and societal level—how we think the world works and how we think it should work.”
“Should work”? The Earth—the oceans, the clouds, and its entire eco-system—doesn’t give a rat’s patoot about how warmists and other weather crazies think it “should work.” All that intellectual claptrap adds up to a totalitarian belief that people who disagree with global warming should be jailed or killed.
And in true totalitarian fashion reminiscent of the Stalin era when people simply disappeared from public records and reports, on April 2nd Norgaard’s bio for Whitman College could no longer to be found on the its website. True to the eco-fascist approach, she had become a liability, a non-person for having revealed their plans for humanity.
Regular people who actually do something useful with their lives know that intellectuals like Norgaard hold them in utter contempt, but it is those who profess belief in global warming that should be regarded with grave and serious suspicion.
Those who use global warming, i.e., the assertion that carbon dioxide emissions should be restricted and controlled, are the true enemies of progress, of freedom, and of humanity.
In the twentieth century intellectuals foisted Communism on the world, thus ensuring that millions of Russians, Chinese, Cambodians and others would be killed for their dissent. Intellectuals are always the first to embrace every dictator and to excuse their methods.
The warmists are increasingly desperate as their dreams of global domination are falling apart.
In Europe and here in America all their schemes to replace the real production of electricity with solar panels and wind turbines are being rejected. Their plans for herding populations into cities and onto mass transit meet with resistance. Parents are objecting to their eco-curricula in schools. Al Gore has become a joke.
Consider this, if they were in charge, anyone who voiced dissent from their global warming-climate change lies would be in concentration camps, undergoing “re-education”, being “treated” with mind-altering drugs, or dead.

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/05/13/acid-ocean-bogeyman/,,Ocean Acidification – the Castle Ghost,"Ocean acidification is like the Castle Ghost – everyone is scared of it but no one has seen it.
Dozens of learned articles and millions of media words tell us that ocean acidity has increased alarmingly since man started using carbon fuels. The worry is that the carbon dioxide being generated by man’s industry is dissolving in the ocean thus creating acidic water. And the computer models forecast that, by some future date, sea shells and corals will be dissolved or killed by the acidic ocean and/or the associated global warming.
However a close look at the chemistry of the oceans and the evidence provided by past records and present observations reveals that the open ocean is alkaline and never acidic, except locally near active submarine volcanic vents. It is deceptive to suggest that sea life is threatened by “the rising acidity of the oceans”. The oceans are still quite alkaline. Nothing unusual or abnormal has yet been detected. Other conclusions are:

The pH of the oceans varies naturally from place to place and time to time, depending on temperatures and the activities of plant and animal life. It is impossible to determine a meaningful figure for “average” ocean acidity (pH). It is also impossible to say with any certainty that average ocean pH has changed because of man’s use of carbon fuels. Such “measurements” are an exercise in guided guess-work. (“What would you like the answer to be?”)
It is a myth that acidic waters necessarily kill aquatic life. Rain water is slightly acidic and many fresh water lagoons, swamps and reed beds are also acidic. Nevertheless, aquatic life flourishes in these wetlands.
The oceans have a huge capacity resist being destabilised by changes in temperature or composition of the atmosphere. Whenever there is a change, the reactions of other chemicals or life in the sea act to moderate and even reverse those changes. Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth’s surface and the hydrosphere contains over 300 times the mass of gases in the atmosphere. The oceans thus have a huge capacity to buffer any variations in heat content or gas content emanating from the thin veil of atmospheric gases. The effect of man’s supposed 3% contribution to the tiny 0.039% of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s thin atmosphere would not register a long-term effect in the massive oceans.
Cold ocean currents from the deep ocean periodically up-well to the surface. These currents are rich in dissolved carbon dioxide and other chemicals and decayed organic matter. Where this cold nutrient-rich water surfaces, there is a staggering profusion of aquatic life.
Oceans have an unlimited ability to remove carbon dioxide from their waters and store it in thick beds of shells and corals, limestone, chalk, dolomite, magnesite, siderite, marls, methane hydrate and oil shales. Fresh water swamps and lakes on land have also laid down massive deposits of coal and lignite formed from carbon dioxide extracted from the atmosphere. Many of these deposits were laid down when the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere was far higher than it is today.
Carbon dioxide present in the oceans is essential to plant life and current very low levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the ocean are limiting plant growth. All animal life depends on these plants. Man’s mining and industrial activities are harmlessly recycling some of this valuable carbon dioxide from natural limestones and hydrocarbons buried in the dead lithosphere, back to the living biosphere.
Corals are hardy and adaptable and have survived for 500 million years. During that time they have had to cope with warm eras, ice ages, extinction events, eras of massive volcanic activity, dramatic rising and lowering in sea levels and eons of time when levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide were far higher than today.
A very recent extensive study of the Great Barrier Reef concluded that the changes forecast under the “business as usual greenhouse gas emissions” were unlikely to cause great harm to the reef.
Any change in global temperature or the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere will cause life on land and in the ocean to adjust and adapt. However, on balance, a warmer world with more plant food in the atmosphere and a more vigorous water cycle is very beneficial for the biosphere. The killer climates are associated with ice ages when the atmosphere is cold and dry, the sea levels are much lower and much of Earth’s fresh water is locked up in vast lifeless sheets of ice.
There is no justification to use the baseless fear of “acidification of the oceans” as an excuse for a massive dislocation of our transport, food and energy industries. We should instead be focussing on real pollution problems (such as man’s rubbish floating in the oceans) and/or on preparing to cope with real and likely natural disasters (such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, fires, cyclones and droughts).

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/04/26/co2-dot-con/,,Carbon Credit Forests – the CO2.con,"CO2Australia boasts of planting three million carbon credit trees. This is “just the beginning” of a new bubble industry, the CO2.con.
This bubble is set to inflate rapidly. To offset just one day of Qantas operations, CO2 promoters must plant more than 200,000 trees in permanent forests covering 130 hectares. How much land is required to offset all Australian power stations, industry and transport?
Yes these trees will consume carbon dioxide. However CO2 levels today are well below what is ideal for plant growth. While they are growing strongly, these trees will suck the gas of life from the atmosphere, competing strongly with nearby crops and plant life for the traces of carbon dioxide remaining.
Then as the trees mature, growth stops. The aging forest just sits there, some trees growing, some dying and net carbon sequestration ceases. It becomes a sterile shrine to the green religion whose main impact on the biosphere is providing a haven for feral animals and noxious weeds.
Green spruikers claim that they only use land not suitable for anything else. Wrong! Every bit of Australia not covered by road, cities, parks or deserts can support crops, timber-getting or grazing animals. Carbon-credit forests gnaw away at this national land asset every year.
Moreover, CO2.con investors, like all speculators, want quick returns. Their quick return demands rapidly growing trees in arable country – deserts and salt pans are uneconomical. Thus the wheat/sheep belt is shrinking.
No one can demonstrate any climate or environmental benefit from the CO2.con.
Forcing consumers and taxpayers to fund this large scale permanent land sterilisation is clearly unsustainable. All Australians fund this destruction via increased prices for electricity, cement, steel, air tickets and rail fares, and reduced land for food production. The carbon tax will increase their burden.
Like all bubble industries, the CO2.con industry must end in tears, and the sooner it ends the better.

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/04/01/greens-destroy-grasslands/,,Greens Destroy Grassland Heritage,"When Europeans settled Australia, much of the country was covered by grasslands and open forests. In 1770, that great botanist Sir Joseph Banks reported “very few tree species, but every place was covered with vast quantities of grass”. Many other explorers and settlers made similar observations.
The land had been kept in this state for centuries by aboriginal land managers using their main tool, fire. However, since 1788, the use of fire was progressively suppressed by settlers, foresters, city dwellers, bureaucrats and environmentalists.
Trees invade and then suffocate grasslands unless tree seedlings are kept in check by fire or by mechanical or chemical means.
The destruction of Australia’s ancestral grasslands has received a massive boost in recent years by green extremists aiming to remove human activities from rural Australia using national parks, reservations, crown land, heritage areas, Wild Rivers, vegetation orders, logging bans and now Kyoto bans on regrowth clearing.
Prevention of hazard reduction burning (the key tool used by generations of aborigines to maintain Australia’s landscape), lockout of grazing animals and the spread of carbon credit forests is completing the destruction of our savannah lands.
Once the grasslands become infested by woody scrubs, these quickly give protection to noxious weeds such as lantana, groundsel and boxthorn, and vermin such as foxes and wild dogs, cats, and pigs.
The amazing grasses of the world and their seeds feed most of the animal kingdom. The deliberate sacrifice of native grasslands to woody weeds is another suicidal green policy.

It was coal that produced clean electric power which cleared the smog produced by dirty combustion and open fires in big cities like London and Pittsburgh. Much of the third world still suffers choking fumes and smog because they do not have clean electric power and burn wood, cardboard, unwashed coal and cow dung for home heat.
It was coal that saved the forests being felled to fuel the first steam engines and produce charcoal for the first iron smelters.
It was coal that powered the light bulbs and saved the whales being slaughtered for whale oil lamps.
It was coal that produced the steel that replaced shingles on the roof, timber props in the mines, wooden fence posts on the farms and the bark on the old bark hut.
In Australia today, coal provides at least 75% of our lighting, cooking, heating, refrigeration, rail transport and steel. Without it, we would be back in the dark days of candles, wood stoves, chip heaters, open fires, smoky cities, hills bare of trees and streets knee deep in horse manure.
Coal is fossil sunshine as clean as the green plants it came from, and often less damaging to the environment than its green energy alternatives.
Earth Hour candles are green tokenism for rich status-seekers and nostalgic dreamers.
We should spend Earth Hour saluting the real people who produce the coal on which most people on earth depend.

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/03/05/average-earth-temperature/,,What is the Average Temperature of the Earth?,"By Dr. Robert Brown,
Physics Dept. Duke University
One of many, many problems with modern climate research is that the researchers seem to take their thermal reconstructions far too seriously and assign completely absurd measures of accuracy and precision, with a very few exceptions. In my opinion it is categorically impossible to “correct” for things like the UHI (Urban Heat Island) effect — it presupposes a knowledge of the uncorrected temperature that one simply cannot have or reliably infer from the data. The problem becomes greater and greater the further back in time one proceeds, with big jumps (in uncertainty) 250, 200, 100 and 40 odd years ago. The proxy-derived record from more than 250 years ago is uncertain in the extreme, with the thermal record of well over 70% of the Earth’s surface completely inaccessible and with an enormously sparse sampling of highly noisy and confounded proxies elsewhere. To claim accuracy greater than 2-3 K is almost certainly sheer piffle, given that we probably don’t know current “true” global average temperatures within 1 K, and 5K is more likely.

“It most certainly is not about whether climate is changing: it always is.
“It is not about whether CO2 is increasing: it clearly is.
“It is not about whether the increase in CO2, by itself, will lead to some warming: it should.
“The debate is simply over the matter of how much warming the increase in CO2 can lead to, and the connection of such warming to the innumerable claimed catastrophes. The evidence is that the increase in CO2 will lead to very little warming, and that the connection of this minimal warming (or even significant warming) to the purported catastrophes is also minimal. The arguments on which the catastrophic claims are made are extremely weak – and commonly acknowledged as such. They are sometimes overtly dishonest.

Many had long experience in science, engineering, economics, industry and government.
We were alarmed at the stupidity of anyone classing carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and annoyed at the misuse of government funds to promote the foolish notion that man controls the climate, and all that is needed to improve it is a carbon tax.
The founders are more senior now and a bit more relaxed because we have been joined by many concerned youngsters, and the alarmist tide has definitely turned. Once we were ignored by most of the media – now some friends report our message and the others are sufficiently concerned by our message that they try to dig up dirt on us and our motivations.

“They were greatly assisted in this by the existence in Australia of the “The Fire Tree”, the eucalypt. The eucalypt promotes fire and is resistant to fire, so that in a regime of constant burning, eucalypts have a higher survival rate and you tend to get the type of monoculture remarked on by many early scientists, including Charles Darwin.
“Early settlers repeatedly remarked on the constant burning carried out by the Aborigines and often described the Australian landscape as grasslands with widely spaced trees.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2012/01/02/legless-in-storms/,,Legless and Powerless in the Global Storms?,"Some at the big end of town are worried that Mr Abbott may keep his solemn promise to repeal the carbon tax. No doubt they and their smart lawyers fear losing the clever green schemes that rely on ripping off tax payers, consumers and other businesses.
Australia’s wealth and jobs have always rested on three legs – mining and farming, making and processing things, and rich foreigners; in short, resources, manufacturing, and money from tourists and investors.
The Gillard carbon tax will white-ant all three legs.
Mining and farming rely on draglines, dozers, scrapers, trains, trucks, bulk carriers, tractors, generators, pumps and machines of all kinds. All need cheap reliable energy. Their energy comes from diesel fuel or coal powered electricity. A tax on carbon will sap their energy and reduce their ability to generate jobs and national wealth.
Our processing and manufacturing industries rely on cheap electricity produced from our marvellous deposits of coal and natural gas. Greens have demonised these national assets and their carbon tax will undermine all Australian industries. Investors always look ahead. Already the threat of a carbon tax has reduced the asset value of every base load power station in Australia. Already one of the biggest, running on Victorian brown coal, is reporting financial stress and may close. We cannot run steel works, refineries or big cities on sunbeams and sea breezes.
See: http://www.theage.com.au/national/carbon-tax-puts-heat-on-loy-yang-20111219-1p2kf.html
Australia is remote from most of the world, and tourists must travel vast distances to get here. They need planes, trains, ships, buses and cars, all powered by carbon energy from petrol, diesel or gas. The carbon tax will strike at the heart of this industry. Harassed by the carbon footprint harpies, tourists may choose to stay home and go camping in their own backyards.
Finally, Australia is leading the world with the most onerous and widely applied carbon tax. This is already deterring the foreign investors who for generations have risked their savings to create businesses and jobs in Australia. Even now, the threat of a carbon tax is increasing capital shortage and debt stress in Australia.
There is no good news in the carbon tax story – no climate benefits, no real jobs and more costs for consumers. And it is white-anting the three legs supporting the Australian economy. Unlike the big end of town, thinking Australians are worried that Mr Abbott may renege on his solemn promise to repeal the carbon tax.
That would really leave Australia powerless and legless in the global storms.

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/12/05/bad-stuff-happens/,,Bad Stuff Happens,"The first climate scare was man-made “global warming”.
But the warming refused to appear as fast as the models predicted, so it became “climate change”.
But people were not stupid and soon were saying “but climate always changes”.
So now the climate scare industry is focussing on “extreme weather events”, and naturally they still claim these are caused by man-made carbon dioxide.
Timed beautifully for the meeting of the climatists in Durban, the UN IPCC has outdone themselves in forecasting extreme weather events – “weather on steroids”. Determined to scare up a consensus in Durban, this weather scare is sprinkled with warnings of “diluvian rains”, and droughts, cyclones, heat-waves of such magnitude or frequency that “settlement in some areas could be wiped out” and “some areas will become increasingly marginal as places to live” and “it is possible that many residents will have to relocate.”

Maybe “extreme weather events” are “normal” here on earth and man has very little to do with most of them. Someone needs to tell the pampered pontificators of the IPCC: “Bad Stuff Happens – get used to it, make appropriate preparations – you are not going to stop it.”

Chairman, Scottish Power 1982-92.
Letter to Alec Salmond
09 March 2011
The Right Hon Alec Salmond
First Minister
Scottish Government    
Dear Sir
It is I believe becoming clear to a rapidly increasing number of voters in Scotland that the Scottish Government’s  concentration on so called renewable energy sources to the exclusion of more reliable and economic sources , such as nuclear , is little short of disastrous. Let us look at the facts:-
1. No wind or marine energy sources can be relied on to provide power when it is needed- the only time when electricity is of any value.
2. Wind and marine need nearly 100% back up from conventional generators. Therefore any expenditure on these is additional to ‘normal’ capital required to secure our electricity supplies.
3. Output from wind turbines varies rapidly, not just locally but nationally, so that conventional back up generation is required to run inefficiently at part load, incurring further costs for the consumer.
4. Wind and wave are such extremely low density sources of energy that costs will always be high and no amount of development will alter this significantly.
5. The cost of onshore wind to the consumer is some £200/MWhr taking into account the ROC subsidy, back up generation and additional transmission costs. This is over four times the cost of energy from conventional or nuclear sources. The cost of off-shore wind is even higher at over £250/MWhr.
6. The claim that Scotland has vast resources of marine energy is based on a failure to appreciate the physics. The actual potential is readily assessed by normal engineering criteria (as in studies by Consulting Engineers Black and Veatch for The Carbon Trust and Robert Gordons University). These show that the total tidal current resource of UK waters from the Pentland Firth to the Channel Isles, neglecting costs and practical limitations such as interference with shipping and fishing and impossibility of servicing such a plethora of installations, would amount to no more than 2.5% to 5% of UK electricity requirements.
7. The costs of tidal energy to the consumer will be significantly higher than offshore wind, even after taking credit for possible developments. Wave energy will be even more costly.
8. Other low carbon technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage are unproven on the scale envisaged, requiring long term sequestration of some 200millions tons of CO2 per year from the UK alone. Taken together with the 25% loss in efficiency of generation, energy costs would more than double.
9. Ofgem has estimated that the UK Government’s energy policy will result in a doubling of electricity prices to consumers within 15 years. The much higher renewable targets of the Scottish Government would, on a stand alone basis, result in even higher prices.
10. The CEO of National Grid in a lecture to the Royal Academy of Engineering in March 2011 stated that the effect of present energy policies would be that the era of having electricity on demand in the UK was coming to an end. The UK Government estimates there is a high risk of power cuts within five years.
11. High energy prices based on subsidies are certain to have an extremely damaging effect on the Scottish Economy as recently quantified in the Verso Economics Report using the Scottish Governments’ own economic model for the Scottish economy. The loss of jobs will far outweigh the few gains, most of which will be of low to medium quality, from renewable installations.
12. Already there has been very significant damage to Scotland’s environment- the massive installation at Doune dominating the route North from Glasgow is a case in point- with consequent loss to one of its greatest assets, the tourist industry. The value of tourism to the Scottish economy is put at £4.2bn a year, far in excess of the value of all the energy produced from wind farms even with the Scottish 80% target for renewables.
13. Prior to privatisation Scotland, with six commercial reactors, produced over 60% of its electricity from nuclear and had a thriving and profitable export trade to England. As a result Scotland benefited from having one of the lowest electricity prices in Europe and this after proper allowances for all the costs involved including waste disposal and decommissioning. Unlike the present energy regime there was no element of subsidy. As distinct from other low carbon generation, nuclear is a tried and tested technology of which we have had excellent experience now for over 50 years. Supplies of nuclear fuel are secure and the cost of energy to consumers from a new generation of reactors would be less than a quarter of that from wind and marine sources.
14. The well being of a modern economy is based on a reliable and economic supply of electricity and will be even more so in future as transport becomes increasingly electrified. If one wanted to go down in history as the politician who did most to damage Scotland’s economy it would be difficult to think of a more effective route than the present energy policy.
15. It is not too late to have a rational and balanced energy policy- but it soon will be. We have only a small window of opportunity- let us grasp it before it is too late.

Just a few generations ago, humans lived in a “green” world. There was no coal, oil or gas providing light, heat, transport and traction power.
In this green utopia, wood provided heat for cooking fires and forests were felled for charcoal for primitive metallurgy; farmers used wooden ploughs and harvested grain with sickles and flails; the nights were lit using candles and whale oil; rich people used wind and water power to grind cereals; horses and bullocks moved coaches, wagons and troops; there was no refrigeration and salt was the only preservative for meat.
Towns were tiny as the whole family was needed to work the farm. For most people, the daylight hours were filled with heavy labour to produce, preserve and transport food. There was no surplus to support opera, bureaucracy or academia.
Humanity was relieved from this life of unrelenting toil by carbon energy – steam engines and electricity, machines, tractors, cars, ships and planes.
Today the pagan green religion celebrates the first step in their long campaign to destroy industrial society and reduce population.
They should be careful what they wish for.
For example, just a few more bitter winters in Britain will see their wind powered lights going out.
A British observer once said of the Whitlam government: “Any fool can bugger up Britain, but it takes real genius to bugger up Australia”.
The Gillard-Green Government is showing the sort of genius needed to dim the lights in the lucky country.

The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that this recent warming was swift and dramatic but no one in the climate change department has even noticed this looming warming crisis.
“Since July, temperatures in Australia have soared by over six degrees centigrade. If current trends continue, we can expect another three degrees of warming by Christmas.
“This rapid warming has caused massive environmental disruption – alpine snow has melted, birds are migrating, there is an epidemic of weeds and we can expect more storms, cyclones, floods, mosquitoes and solar radiation burns.
“This is far more serious than the UN’s forecast of a piddling 1-2 degrees of warming over the next hundred years or so.
“What caused this dangerous new global warming?
“The old people called it ‘summer’ and they knew it was caused by the sun.
“Summer heat is generated by a slight increase in the solar radiation received at the surface, caused by cyclic changes in the positions of the sun in the sky. It is obvious that longer term solar cycles also dominate the climate. Even The Farmer’s Almanac knew that cycles in moon, planets and sunspots could be used to forecast the weather.
“However, since people started to let computers do their thinking, knowledge of climate cycles has been lost. We now let computer nerds and taxaholics tell us that the climate is controlled by minute traces of a harmless invisible natural gas exhaled with every breath, generated in every bushfire and exhausted wherever coal, oil and gas are burned. Some even believe that a tax on carbon dioxide will cool the world.
“It’s time we abandoned climate Cassandras with costly computers. There was more sense in The Farmer’s Almanac.
“And a tax on sunlight to reduce global warming makes as much sense as the Carbon Tax.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/10/24/reaping-green-dividends/,,Reaping Green Dividends,"The carbon policies of the Australian government will destroy regional industry.
Most regional industry relies on adding value to the products of primary industries – smelters, refineries, processing plants, cement plants, sawmills, flour mills, abattoirs and rail and port infrastructure. These facilities require cheap reliable electricity, which will never be supplied by green energy toys.
Recently Xstrata announced plans to cease smelting and refining copper in Queensland. Then Blue Scope Steel decided to reduce production and shed workers. Now Rio has signalled the sale of its aluminium processing empire. Next we can expect that a large coal fired electricity generator will be unable to repay its debts. Cement plants will be squeezed and rail and port costs will increase.
All of these projects are denigrated in their own country because they have one thing in common – they rely heavily on carbon fuels such as coal and gas and thus are all threatened by the toxic carbon tax. None of these activities will cease because of our carbon tax. They will either pay foreign spivs for “carbon credits” or the business will transfer to other countries who will welcome our trashed industries.
Not one of these operations will survive if forced to use costly and unreliable wind or solar power.

Source: http://dailybayonet.com/?p=9131
Chris Huhne, the UK’s Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change gambled the future of Britain’s energy generation on a massive expansion of giant bird shredders:
February 2007 [before Huhne was in government]:
Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Chris Huhne said: “The doubling of our electricity generation from wind in a little more than a year shows what renewables can do and gives the lie to the need for a new generation of nuclear power. “However, the incentives for wind need to be maintained while the Government is still far short of doing what is necessary to encourage tidal and wave power. “On a windy island surrounded by waves and tides, we should never be short of environmentally-friendly energy sources.”
June 2010:
Huhne expressed his excitement over the findings of a recent report into the value of Britain’s offshore resources. He is quoted saying: “It is right to point out, as that report did, that in due course we may once again be a net energy exporter, as we were during the peak of oil and gas in the North Sea, and that’s a very exciting prospect.”
July 2010:
The Energy Secretary said enabling Britain to be totally self-sufficient thanks to renewable sources – which also included wave power and harnessing tidal streams – would be an extraordinary prize.
September 2010:
I’m pleased that we’ve reached the point where 5GW of our energy comes from onshore and offshore wind – that’s enough electricity to power all the homes in Scotland.

Cartoon by Josh
But wind power is a mirage.
If the promise of wind was real, the UK wouldn’t need to spend £5 billion on new undersea cables linking it to more reliable power from European nations like nuclear-powered France:
The Government plans to spend more than £5billion laying 11 undersea power cables to allow Britain to import electricity from neighbouring countries and prevent blackouts in the next decade. The giant cables would provide up to 10GW of electricity, enough to power 2.4 million homes a year. Ministers are said to be alarmed at Britain’s likely energy shortfall, made worse by the fact the country has less capacity to import power than any other in Europe.
Chris Huhne scattered the land and oceans with anti-avian monuments to stupidity, and all he has to show for it is millions of dead birds and people who can’t afford electricity. Turns out the green dream is more of a nightmare for Britons.

But the sceptics are now far more numerous, the public is far more aroused, and some politicians are getting nervous. They know that we will never forget who votes for the Carbon Tax Bills. We will remember them in the next election.

The Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that just three steps would make Australia’s ramshackle system of rules, exemptions, loopholes and penalties so simple that even politicians could understand it and so efficient that compliance costs would be almost eliminated.
“The reform is mainly repealing things and affects only three taxes – the proposed carbon tax, the GST and the income tax.
“The aim of the carbon tax is to deter the use of carbon fuels by making them more expensive.
“All goods and services have a carbon fuel component in their cost and price, and will bear a share of the carbon tax.
“This carbon tax is thus a broad-based goods and services tax. 
“We do not need two GST’s.
“Therefore the simplest tax reform of all is to abandon all nineteen carbon-GST bills and also abolish all exemptions applying to the current GST.
“To make this GST change palatable to the people, let’s abolish all income taxes. We do not need that complex regulatory mess either.
“Overnight people will have an incentive to produce things, create jobs and consume less – this has always been the path to real community prosperity. 
“Just three changes – simple, predictable, no loopholes.

There are only two ways to achieve their unrealistic emission reduction targets.
The destructive but honest way is to allow the shrinking targets and rising taxes to force closures or relocation for our backbone industries.
The dishonest way is to pay billions of dollars to overseas carbon shysters who, in return for our bribes, “promise” to make the reductions on our behalf. This will achieve nothing except pauperisation of Australians.
The tax apologists will claim – ‘but the tax only applies to the top 500 polluters’. Every company hit with the carbon tax must pass it on to all those who use their products. Soon every industry and consumer will feel the costs, even if they do not understand the sneaky mechanism.
People who think the cuts can occur painlessly have not looked at the hard facts of our industries.
It’s not possible to make steel without generating carbon dioxide. No carbon tax can change that.
It’s not possible to make cement or brew beer without generating carbon dioxide.
It’s not possible to generate electricity using brown coal, black coal, diesel or gas without generating carbon dioxide.
It’s is not possible to run a car, truck, train, tractor, ship or plane on oil, gas, diesel or petrol without generating carbon dioxide. Even electric cars, trains and elevators get their energy mainly from coal or gas. As for wind power, 70% of its “capacity” will be delivered by the backup gas facilities, all producing carbon dioxide.
Cattle, sheep, goats and pigs cannot live without generating carbon dioxide. (Even humans must exhale occasionally.)
The Australian government plans to reduce the production of harmless carbon dioxide by 5% (or maybe 25%) by 2050, despite increasing population.
Which industry will be first to cop the carbon chop? They should start by blocking all emissions from Parliament House.

“Developing economies in Africa, India and China are never going to agree to carbon taxes and rationing that damage the aspirations of their millions many who still lack electricity.

A Convoy of more than 100 vehicles – including road trains, campervans and utes – rolled into Katherine last night to show their support for the Convoy of no Confidence, a convoy heading to Canberra to raise a voice against recent government decisions.
Rashida Khan, who led a trail of vehicles from Darwin to Katherine yesterday, said she was on her way to Canberra to speak up for “some of the toughest people” she knows, who “have been pushed to the edge by the decision to ban live export”.
The 23-year-old animal nutritionist, who comes from a background of cattle and land management, said she was “stunned” by the support the Convoy of no Confidence had received along the way from Darwin to Katherine.”Eight road trains followed us out of Noonamah, we had a chopper in the air, freightliners on the road and lots of cars.
“We had grey nomads and people in cars and vans join us along the way, giving us the thumbs up, honk their horns, wave and cheer.
“And we were absolutely overwhelmed to see so many cars and followers turn out in Katherine, with their utes decorated.”

Poor Al Gore.   Global warming is fast turning into a joke.  From the jolly Hockey Stick (remember that one) to the topsy-turvy ice core data (what a howler), from the laughable computer models, to the dodgy temperature records … not a single scrap of global warming garbage has escaped the blistering, excoriating scrutiny of McIntyre, Lindzen, Christy, Spencer, Singer, Carter & Co.  The awkward-squad army of sceptics have kicked and trampled this theory to death, not once, but a hundred times over.  
And yet, for all the onslaught of reasoned, scientific argument, the global warming beast refuses to lie down.  Like some beleagured, maniac cyborg from the future, it just goes on and on.  We all know the reason.  The edifice of global warming is built not on science, but politics.
But what kind of politics?  This is the first in a series of blog pieces to explore the green politics behind global warming …..
A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO POSH ANTI-CAPITALISM
The next time you’re forced to attend a dinner party, keep an eye out for the global warmer.  Then ask him what he thinks about supermarkets (wicked), ‘consumer society’ (soulless), world trade (cruel) and government regulation (more needed).  Global warmers are, in short, anti-capitalist.  But – and here’s the really important thing to understand – it’s a very specific form of anti-capitalism.  We might call it posh anti-capitalism.
In the old days, when there was less swearing on TV and kids were scared of policemen, anti-capitalism was coloured Red.   The Reds complained that capitalism would cause the ‘immiseration’ of the workers, and they dreamed of giant socialist factories, out-producing the West.  
The tragedy (for the Reds) was that capitalism didn’t play ball.  Instead of getting poorer, ordinary folk got richer – much, much richer.  For the simple reason that capitalist mass production must necessarily go hand in hand with mass consumption.  What the new-leftists call ‘consumer society’. 
But these days, anti-capitalists are coloured Green.  They campaign not in the name of the working class, but of ‘Earth’.  Instead of giant factories, they dream of little handicraft workshops and organic peasant farms.  They complain not that capitalism will impoverish the workers, but, on the contrary, that capitalism has made them too rich.  It is the very success of capitalism that seems to upset them.

Bob Brown wants to close all Australian coal mines and coal fired power stations and other greens want to stop all live cattle exports. That infamous economist, Ross Garnaut, seems to think we should eliminate our cattle and sheep and farm kangaroos instead. (Naturally the surplus cattle and sheep will all be euthanized humanely.)
Every war is triggered by one dramatic event and the overnight banning of live cattle exports from Australia to its near neighbour Indonesia was the trigger for action across Northern Australia. The bush is now like an agitated meat-ants’ nest.

“If a referendum was held, the “No Carbon Tax” case would soon expose the lies in the current deceptive document.”
“The first lie is to claim that a tax on carbon dioxide will “cut pollution”. It is blatant false advertising to use “pollution” to describe a rare colourless non-toxic natural gas which is generated in the lungs of all animals and feeds all plants by fertilising the oceans and the atmosphere.
“It is another lie to claim that a carbon tax “will protect the economy”. The reverse is true. It will reduce the asset values, share prices, profits, dividends and growth of our biggest companies, destroy jobs and waste community savings on piddling power schemes like wind and solar energy.
“It is another lie to insinuate that a carbon tax will reduce “droughts, heat waves and bushfires”. Where is the evidence?
“Finally, it is electoral bribery to use carbon tax receipts to buy votes from pensioners, retirees, families, tax payers, carers, students and tenants. These bribes can never compensate for the job losses, reduction in retirement nest eggs, and increased living costs for everyone.

GOVERNMENTS across the world have paid billions to find links between carbon dioxide and the climate, but very little to find the opposite. Teams of professionals have searched high and low for any possible hint that CO2 poses a threat, but no one has been paid to find otherwise. CO2 has been convicted without a defence lawyer. It is self-evident that any expert in a field will reap more rewards, fame and fortune if their field is critically important. Why would anyone expect such experts to go out of their way to hunt down evidence that might suggest their field ought not be the centre of a global economic transformation?
In law, if there is no defence, it’s a sham. In business, if there is no competition, it’s a monopoly. In science, if there is no debate, it’s propaganda…
Between 1989 and 2009, the US government paid over $30 billion towards “climate change”.
We’ve paid to find a crisis, and what-do-you-know, we “found” one. (Yes. It’s true, we got what we paid for.) Hundreds of scientists have been doing their jobs, most diligently, turning over every stone labelled “CO2”. But no one has been paid to turn over the other stones. When politicians and journalists say they can’t find a credible voice of dissent, it’s only because they define “credible” as someone holding a government-funded position — and by definition, there are no government-funded sceptics.
As with all unbalanced systems, people are rushing to fill the vacuum. The volunteers are coming. Never before in science have so many unpaid people used their expertise to become whistleblowers.

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that when natural climate change makes fools of the global warming alarmists, Australia should not be saddled forever with the world’s biggest carbon dioxide tax.
“This whole tax extravaganza is based on the foolish theory that man’s production of life-sustaining carbon dioxide will cause dangerous global warming and we need a C-Tax to stop it.
“However no one has produced evidence that carbon dioxide has caused any significant warming. What’s more, carbon dioxide production is rising strongly but world temperature has been stable for the last 13 years. Right now sea surface temperatures are falling sharply.
“Climate” is generally defined as an average of 30 years of weather. Therefore the C-Tax should be scrapped immediately the global temperature falls below the 30 year average temperature, indicating the start of global cooling.

Even photographic images are manipulated to hide the truth and promote the lie.
Every time the new carbon tax is mentioned on ABC and SBS television, the word dioxide is as invisible as the gas itself.
But what is visible, and which looms large in the background to every story, are billowing white clouds coming from the towers.
But carbon dioxide is invisible. So all we can see must be smoke or water vapour, neither of which comprise the dreaded carbon dioxide.
In the news following the PM’s courageous attempt to maintain her steady-as-she-sinks course, a brief glimpse of Australia’s dirtiest power station, Loy Yang, showed the station’s magnificent smoke stacks in all their glory, but not a sign of any smoke. So the next close-up was carefully framed to show only the chimneys to the top of the structures – can’t have people asking why there were no visible emissions.
The only people supporting a carbon (dioxide) tax must be the lounge lizards glued to the deceptive images on their screens. They should walk out into the fresh air and hop on their bikes to visit these unfairly maligned energy supply installations and take note of the clear skies above and the verdant foliage flourishing and feeding from the abundant carbon dioxide plant food which is emitted from these wonderful structures.

First, pay millions in compensation to force closure of reliable coal fired power stations producing cheap electricity.
Second, spend millions more in subsidies to bribe promoters to erect forests of imported wind turbines that produce no electricity for 75% of the time. Then pay again to have them switched off when the wind is too strong or if they produce more power than the network needs at that time.
Third, spend more millions to build a spider web of roads and transmission lines to connect every single turbine to the national grid. These costly facilities are only used for 25% of the time.
Fourth, spend yet more millions to build new gas fired backup generators to keep the lights on when the wind stops. Then pay again to switch off the gas any time the wind happens to blow at the right speed for the turbines.
Finally, force any remaining coal or gas power stations to buy carbon ration permits from merchant banks.
Climate will still change no matter how many wind temples we build to the Global Warming god.
When we have pauperised ourselves by wasting our savings to inflict unreliable high cost electricity on our industries and our people, we will have no resources left to cope with the inevitable natural disasters that will still occur.
This five point plan is what passes for rational energy policy from the Green/Labor Coalition now in control of the Australian Parliament.

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/06/29/how-green-is-my-energy/,,How Green is my Energy,"by Geoffrey Luck
June 24, 2011
Take a big deep breath, Bob Brown – savour the 78 parts of nitrogen, 21 of oxygen, and the smidgen of carbon dioxide – and contemplate the folly of your alternative energy ideas. Renewables are not green. That’s the view of one of the pioneers of climate science politics. Jesse Ausubel, Senior Research Associate in The Rockefeller University’s Program for the Human Environment, helped organise the first UN World Climate Conference in Geneva in 1979. He is an avowed ‘deep green’ scientist who believes the essence of being green, and therefore his mantra, is no-new-structures. For years he has been arguing heretical views on energy. In the wake of the Productivity Commission’s scathing comments on renewables, now is the time to listen to him.
Ausubel has a list of heresies that might horrify the true believers in wind and solar power, electric cars and distorting government subsidies:

Renewables are not green.
The idea of resource exhaustion is irrelevant.
Hydrocarbons are not the stored energy of the sun.
Little more than 50% of energy will ever be electrified.
Nuclear is green, but nuclear plants must make hydrogen as well as electricity.
Most surprising of all – decarbonisation has been going on for almost two centuries – without a policy for it.


Since 1800 when British colliers first mined thousands of tons of coal, the world has been steadily moving towards fuels which produce more hydrogen, less carbon, and therefore deliver more energy. Mankind’s original fuel, wood, has a carbon to hydrogen ratio of 10:1. With the move to fossil fuels, the proportions changed – first to coal at 2:1, then to petrol and jet fuel at 1:2 or ethanol at 1:3 and now increasingly to methane (CH4 and 75% of natural gas) is obviously at 1:4, forty times the energy output of wood. All this happened, he notes mischievously, without decrees by Queen Victoria or Abraham Lincoln, but because the energy system pursued it. By 2100 the world will feel the same nostalgia for carbon as some now do for steam locomotives.
Ausubel’s thesis is that the evolution of the energy system is driven by the increasing spatial density of energy consumption at the level of the end user. Simply put, that is the energy consumed per square metre. Rich, dense cities will happily accept only electricity and gas, which reach the home through efficient infrastructure, right up to the light switch and cooktop burner. Over time, the juggernaut of economies of scale will change the mix; just as people flock to Bunnings for hardware instead of the local ironmonger, they will demand hydrogen. The fundamental question people should be asking is where large quantities of cheap hydrogen will come from.
Meanwhile, the world is flirting with hydro, biomass, wind and solar as replacements for coal-fired energy production. Not only can none of these replace hydrocarbons as a prime energy source, they promise destruction of the environment, sometimes on a massive scale.
Renewables must be understood in terms of the watts of energy per square metre that each source can produce. Hydro? In a well-watered area like North Queensland a dammed lake of 1 km2 would produce enough hydro-electricity for a dozen homes, while severely damaging life in its rivers.
A biomass power plant requires about 2,500 km2 of prime farmland to equal the output of a single 1,000 mW nuclear power plant that would occupy a few hectares. To equal the same nuclear plant, windmills would need to cover 800 km2 in very favourable situations. Photovoltaic farms would need less space, but still carpet 150 km2 of countryside to equal the nuclear plant. This puts in some perspective the extraordinary inefficiency of rooftop PV systems and the waste of subsidies and high feed-in tariffs.
Not surprisingly, Ausubel sees methane (natural gas) as the obvious intermediate step towards a hydrogen future. Compared with wind, it’s a no-brainer. To build a natural gas combined cycle plant would need 3.3 tonnes of steel and 27 m3 of concrete; a typical wind energy system requires 130 times as much steel and 30 times the concrete. Natural gas already provides a quarter of U.S. electricity generation. From a peak of 56% in 1988, coal now accounts for less than 45%.
An abundance of methane would put the world over the crest of the hill on the road to decarbonisation. With billions already invested in coal seam methane projects, the eggs have been laid, but have the chickens been counted too early? BHP Billiton’s proposed shale gas project in the American state of Arkansas has been challenged in a class action. Protests are starting to arise about the process of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the Surat and Bowen basins in Queensland which could delay the LNG projects planned for Gladstone’s Curtis Island. Concerns that the artesian basin could be contaminated might be assuaged by the British House of Commons committee which found that hydraulic fracturing did not pose a direct risk to aquifers. However strict monitoring of chemicals would be required and supervision of well integrity was essential. With tens of thousands of wells required for the Queensland projects, that would be a big job.
Ausubel believes the world should be fully converted to a hydrogen economy by 2100. The first interim measure – replacing coal with gas – will halve greenhouse gas emissions, making the capture and storage of the reduced amounts of carbon less daunting. The first U.S. zero-emission power plant (ZEPP) will begin generating electricity in California later this year. One million tons of CO2 produced over four years will be sequestered in geological formations in the Bakersfield area. For the remaining 16 years life of the plant, the CO2 will be injected into depleted oil reservoirs to enhance recovery.
The next step should be to produce hydrogen from the methane using nuclear-generated electricity in the established steam-reforming process. Ultimately, reactors will split water to produce hydrogen thermo-chemically on a commercial scale, eliminating carbon dioxide altogether. Decarbonisation will be complete.
Hydrogen already powers forklift trucks; hydrogen fuel cells provide instant stand-by power for telecommunications companies that require security for phones and computers. Cars will operate on fuel cells driving electric motors, with a battery for quick starting and recovering braking energy. The U.S. Electric Power Research Institute has already published a technical plan for a hydrogen-electric SuperGrid across America, delivering the two energy sources in a single cable.
Much of this still lies in the future. The technology is available today, only the economics of developing the infrastructure required for the evolution from today’s energy sources is holding it back. But the message for Australia from Ausubel’s forward-looking analysis is clear: stop wasting money on wind farms and PV systems – they can only be supernumeraries. “We live in an era of mass delusion about solar and other renewables,” he says, “which will become an embarrassing collection of stranded assets.” And adds, again mischievously: “A deluded crowd believes in wind, as earlier crowds believed in witches and sub-prime mortgages.”

We will sorely miss people like this stalwart senator. It struck me that this one sad event was like the bell tolling for the new Dark Age to come. In the next few weeks, unless a miracle occurs, and for the first time ever, dark greens and their fellow travellers will gain control of the both houses of parliament in Australia.
No doubt we have won the battle for the minds of the Australian people – every poll shows a strong majority is opposed to the tax on carbon dioxide. And there is growing scepticism for the claim that man causes climate change. But the green elite, who have never won majority support in their own right, are determined to pursue their destructive goals.
Their long-term agenda is to destroy human industry and reduce human population. Thus they are opposed to farming, mining, fishing, forestry, exploration and cheap power.
Their preferred strategy is to divide and conquer. Their tactics are to grab any real concern and magnify and divert it into another reason to destroy or hobble the industries they hate – cattle, sheep, mining, oil and gas, uranium, farming, forestry, fishing and land developers. Their greatest success is achieved when they harness and inflame one industry and use it to ram another – use farmers to destroy the gas industry, use animal lovers and meat workers to destroy live exports, use small business to attack big business, make all industries compete against one another for a dwindling supply of emission permits, get farmers to fight food retailers, cry crocodile tears about the loss of fertile land, and then lock up grazing land in trees, heritage areas and other sterilised ground. And all the time they use their domination of the government media and education empires to spread their half-truths.

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/06/15/volcanic-carbon-dioxide/,,Volcanic Carbon Dioxide,"Volcanoes emit enormous volumes of the two main “greenhouse gases” – water vapour and carbon dioxide.
Erupting volcanoes are big news these days. There are over 1500 active volcanoes which are above sea level and many of these show signs of current activity including explosions, lava flows, gaseous emissions and tremors. On average, there are about five eruptions per year that are above sea level. 
However, few people realise that there are more than 200,000 known submarine volcanoes, many of which are active. It is reasonable to estimate that there could be a total of 3 million submarine volcanoes.
Carbon dioxide and methane are abundant gases in the earth’s mantle and they are being continually released to the atmosphere. Volcanic carbon dioxide cannot be distinguished from the carbon dioxide produced by burning carbon fuels like coal.
There are very large deposits of methane calthrate on the continental shelf and lakes of frozen carbon dioxide in the deep ocean. Just one new eruption or earthquake can mobilise these into the atmosphere.
We are continually told about the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but almost all of the world’s carbon dioxide recording stations are beside active volcanoes such as Mauna Loa, Kilauea and Raoul Island. Is the rise merely nature’s breath?
All of this says, we have no idea how much carbon dioxide nature is adding to the atmosphere. The models used to justify the war on carbon start with dream-time forecasts of world economic activity. These figures drive forecasts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which are linked to assumptions and complex formula in a big black box that spits out forecasts of global temperature for a century ahead. No one but an Australian Climate Commissioner could take any notice of these forecasts.

By William Happer
Will Happer is a physicist at Princeton University. This article appeared in the internet magazine First Things under the title The Truth About Greenhouse Gases.

“The object of the Author in the following pages has been to collect the most remarkable instances of those moral epidemics which have been excited, sometimes by one cause and sometimes by another, and to show how easily the masses have been led astray, and how imitative and gregarious men are, even in their infatuations and crimes,” wrote Charles Mackay in the preface to the first edition of his Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. I want to discuss a contemporary moral epidemic: the notion that increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, will have disastrous consequences for mankind and for the planet. The “climate crusade” is one characterized by true believers, opportunists, cynics, money-hungry governments, manipulators of various types—even children’s crusades—all based on contested science and dubious claims.
I am a strong supporter of a clean environment. We need to be vigilant to keep our land, air, and waters free of real pollution, particulates, heavy metals, and pathogens, but carbon dioxide (CO2 ) is not one of these pollutants. Carbon is the stuff of life. Our bodies are made of carbon. A normal human exhales around 1 kg of CO2 (the simplest chemically stable molecule of carbon in the earth’s atmosphere) per day. Before the industrial period, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was 270 ppm. At the present time, the concentration is about 390 ppm, 0.039 percent of all atmospheric molecules and less than 1 percent of that in our breath. About fifty million years ago, a brief moment in the long history of life on earth, geological evidence indicates, CO2 levels were several thousand ppm, much higher than now. And life flourished abundantly.

John: Absolutely.
Bryan: No chance that the upward cycles aren’t natural variation as well?
John: Of course not! They wouldn’t be man-made then, would they? And anyway, the trend for the last 150 years clearly shows a long term warming trend, interspersed by some decades of cooling.
Bryan: Sort of expected, really.
John: Che?
Bryan: Sort of expected. If you’re coming out of a little ice age, then you expect things to be warming up. Otherwise you’d still be in the little ice age, wouldn’t you?
John: I think you’ll find that the little ice age (LIA) did not, in fact, occur. Plus, it was only a localised event of a strictly transient nature. The peer-reviewed literature clearly demonstrates a stable global climate up to the time of the Industrial Revolution.
Bryan: You mean the hockey stick? Don’t make me laugh!
John: This is no laughing matter, my good man. The peer-reviewed literature clearly shows that temperature was benign and stable until the intervention of mankind.
Bryan: You mean YOUR peer review literature? As reviewed by people who are paid to agree with it? As discussed in the Climategate© emails? As distinct from the geological, sociological, archeological, oceanographic and historical evidence to the contrary?
John: That comment was not very helpful.
Bryan: Suit yourself, but I still don’t believe you.
John: What about the rising sea levels? You can’t deny the rising sea levels. Scientists believe that sea levels around the globe are rising due to the effect of the melting ice caps.
Bryan: Of course. And they’ve been rising for about 8000 years – just after the end of the last major ice age. Haven’t noticed anyone taking a walk from Russia to Alaska lately, have you?
John: The Barents Sea would be a bit of a problem, no.
Bryan: That’s because rising sea levels covered the land bridge a few thousand years ago. Well before SUV’s became fashionable, you’d agree? Looks like natural variation to me.
John: I reject your reality and substitute my own.
Bryan: You’re a loony!

Bryan: So global warming causes droughts? AND floods? Heatwaves AND snowstorms?
John: The floods and snowstorms were only weather events, of course.
Bryan: Just like the decline or plateauing of the global temperatures these last 10-15 years, I suppose?

21 May 2011
This paper presents a simple analysis to estimate the amount of CO2 emissions avoided by wind generation and the cost per tonne avoided as wind penetration increases from 0% to 20%.  The carbon price implications are discussed.
For wind power to be viable in Australia the price for electricity would need to be about $120/MWh.  The current average wholesale price of electricity is about $30/MWhi.  So wind energy must be subsidised by about $90/MWh.  If we have a carbon price of $25/MWh then the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) need to reach $65/MWh to make wind viable.  (That means the consumer must subsidise wind by $90/MWh, or three times the current wholesale price of electricity.)
The paper concludes that as wind energy penetration increases from 1% to 20% the CO2 avoidance cost increases from $100 to $2,500 per tonne of CO2 production avoided.
Wind energy is a high cost way to avoid CO2 emissions.

The report , written by Matt Ridley and with a foreword by Professor Freeman Dyson, finds that shale gas:

And just as naturally they are being supported by competitive energy sources threatened by this gas bonanza – French nuclear, Russian gas, the coal geo-sequestration crowd and the whole wind/solar lobby.

The public therefore surely needs health warnings on products contaminated by this dangerous “pollutant”?
The bubbles from beer, champagne and soda water are carbon dioxide which contains 27% carbon. If carbon pollution is as bad as we are told, maybe there should be a law banning consumption of such polluting drinks in enclosed areas or public places?
Cane sugar contains a dangerously high 40% carbon, barbeque steak contains 53% carbon and fats and oils contain over 70% carbon. These products should display health warnings:
“This product contains carbon, a declared dangerous pollutant. Use of this product will cause floods and droughts, frosts and heatwaves. Exercise caution when using.”
In fact, as every food product contains carbon, there should be a health warning at the entrance of every grocery store and restaurant:
“Polluted Products Warning: All foods sold in this outlet contain carbon.”
To emphasise the danger, the health warning should be printed in green and all food products should be sold in plain wrappers.
There could also be a “Green Tick” system for safe products free of carbon pollution. The only grocery item that has earned a green tick so far is pure water.
Diligent public protectors have also discovered that exhaled human breath contains 40,000 parts per million of carbon dioxide or about 1% carbon, one hundred times higher than fresh air. This could explain the hysterical legislative proposals coming from carbon polluted debating chambers in Canberra. Therefore, in the interests of good government, all future debates on the carbon tax should be held outdoors and no carbon polluted food or drinks should be served in government cafeterias.

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/05/02/carbon-dioxide-confusion/,,Carbon & Carbon Dioxide – Clearing up the Confusion,"By Paul Driessen 30 Apr 2011
We are constantly bombarded with information – much of it inaccurate, misleading, even deliberately so.
We are frequently told we must reduce carbon emissions, support “carbon disclosure” and invest in “carbon trusts” – to prevent catastrophic global warming, global climate change or global climate “disruption.” News stories, advocacy and lobbying activities, and corporate “ethics” promotions frequently use “carbon” and “carbon dioxide” almost interchangeably; some occasionally talk about “dangerous carbon monoxide emissions.”
Torn by misplaced hydrocarbon guilt, wanting to do right ecologically, and often scientifically challenged, people are naturally confused. Because so much is at stake – for our energy supplies and prices, jobs, economies, living standards, budget deficits and environment – clearing up that confusion is a high priority.

“Carbon” (chemical symbol C) is what we burn to get energy to power modern society. Carbon is the molecular building block for wood, charcoal and coal, and hydrocarbons (HC) like oil and natural gas. Cars and power plants do not emit carbon, except in the form of soot. Thus, talk of “carbon disclosure” or “reducing our carbon emissions” is misleading, unless one is confessing how much charcoal was used at a picnic, or apologizing for not having pollution controls on a wood-burning stove.
“Carbon monoxide” (CO) is an odorless, deadly gas. A natural product of combustion, it increases when ventilation is poor, oxygen levels are low and burning is inefficient. It’s why we shouldn’t use charcoal grills indoors or operate cars in garages, unless we’re suicidal.
“Carbon dioxide” (CO2) is another natural byproduct of combustion, from power plants, factories, vehicles, homes, hospitals and other users of wood, coal, petroleum and biofuels. This is what many environmental activists, politicians and scientists blame for recent and future climate change.
(The other major byproduct is water vapor or steam – plus pollutants that reflect impurities in the fuel and are removed via scrubbers and other technologies, or reduced by controlling the temperature, airflow and efficiency of combustion processes: sulfur and nitrogen oxides, particulates, mercury and so on.)
Literally thousands of scientists vigorously disagree with the hypothesis that CO2 is responsible for (dangerous) climate change. It plays only a minor role, they argue, in a complex, chaotic climate system that is driven by numerous natural forces, cycles, and positive and negative feedback loops. They also note that CO2 increases have followed, not preceded, temperature rises, throughout Earth’s history.
CO2 constitutes a mere 0.0380% of our atmosphere. That’s 380 parts per million (380 ppm), which sounds much more threatening, especially when used in juxtaposition with the pre-Industrial Revolution figure of 280 ppm. But even that 100 ppm increase represents only 0.0100% of Earth’s atmosphere – equivalent to one penny out of $100.
380 is far below historical CO2 levels. During the Jurassic and Early Carboniferous periods, geologists calculate, our atmosphere contained 1,500-2,500 ppm carbon dioxide. However, even at today’s comparatively CO2-impoverished levels, this trace gas is vital to the health of our planet.
As every grade schooler learns, CO2 enables photosynthesis and plant growth: carbon dioxide in, oxygen out, through complex chemical reactions. Without CO2, there would be no plants and no oxygen; life as we know it would cease. Carbon dioxide is truly the “gas of life” – and no attempt by Al Gore, James Hansen or EPA to brand it as a dangerous pollutant can change that.
The 100 ppm rise in CO2 levels came courtesy of two things. As oceans warmed after the Little Ice Age ended 160 years ago, they released some of their carbon dioxide storehouses. (As with beer and soda water, seawater is able to retain less CO2 as it warms.) The rest came from hydrocarbon fuels burned during the Industrial Revolution and modern era, and from billions more impoverished people still burning wood and animal dung in open fires.
Though vilified by radical greens and climate alarmists, hydrocarbon energy and the Industrial Revolution have hugely benefitted mankind. They doubled average life expectances in industrialized nations and increased prosperity, overall health and living standards, in proportion to the ability of poor communities to acquire electricity and modern technologies. Thus, telling poor countries to limit hydrocarbon use, and focus instead on wind and solar power, sharply limits their ability to modernize, create jobs, and improve health, living conditions and life spans.
And all that extra CO2 from electrical generation and other economic activities? As Drs. Craig and Sherwood Idso explain on their CO2science.org website and in their fascinating book, The Many Benefits of Atmospheric CO2 Enrichment, the extra carbon dioxide has blessed people and planet in at least 55 ways.
For example, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide increases the photosynthesis rates for plants. It enables plants to extract more moisture from the air and soil, thereby expanding root systems that stabilize soil, reduce erosion and help plants survive better during droughts.
Higher CO2 levels also reduce the need for plants to keep their stomata (pores in leaves) open to absorb carbon dioxide – and in the process release moisture from the plant – further increasing drought resistance. Because stomata don’t need to be open as much, plants also reduce their absorption of harmful pollutants that can damage their tissue. As with the air in greenhouses, rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations improves nitrogen fixation by soil bacteria, increasing the availability of this important chemical.
CO2-enriched air also increases plants’ ability to manufacture Vitamin C, antioxidants, and health-promoting substances in medicinal plants – while likewise improving plants’ immune systems and ability to withstand a wide variety of common plant diseases.
Many climatologists and astrophysicists believe recent sun spot, Pacific Ocean and global temperature trends suggest that our planet may have entered a cool phase that could last for 25 years. If that is the case, the additional carbon dioxide being emitted by China, India and other developing countries could bring a major additional benefit: helping to protect wildlife habitats, enhance oceanic biota and preserve crop yields under sub-optimal climatic conditions.
Attempts to coerce expanded wind and solar installations will require that we devote still more land, raw materials and taxpayer subsidies to these expensive, unreliable energy supplies. And trying to capture and store carbon dioxide from power plants and factories will require trillions of dollars and vast supplies of energy, to take this plant-fertilizing gas out of the atmosphere and inject it under high pressure deep into the earth – and keep it from escaping, to kill animals and people.
To get 1000 megawatts of net electricity from a power plant designed for CO2-capture-and-storage would require building (at minimum) a 1300-MW plant, burning at least one-third more fuel than a conventional plant does, using over one-third of the 1300 MW to power the CCS equipment – and paying much higher electricity prices. The impact on factories, shops, jobs, household budgets and fuel supplies would be significant.
Legislators and regulators need to focus on controlling unhealthy amounts of real pollutants (based on valid medical and environmental science) – and keep their pesky hands off our CO2!

It’s a Scam
“I am a scientist who was on the carbon gravy train, understands the evidence,  was once an alarmist, but am now a sceptic.”

Dr David Evans’ address to the Anti-Carbon-Tax rally, Perth Australia, 23 March 2011
Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen.
The debate about global warming has reached ridiculous proportions and is full of micro thin half-truths and misunderstandings.
I am a scientist who was on the carbon gravy train, I understand the evidence, I was once an alarmist, but I am now a sceptic.
Watching this issue unfold has been amusing but, lately, worrying.
This issue is tearing society apart, making fools and liars out of our politicians.
Let’s set a few things straight.

The whole idea that carbon dioxide is the main cause of the recent global warming is based on a guess which was proved false by empirical evidence during the 1990s. But the gravy train was too big, with too many jobs, industries, trading profits, political careers, and the possibility of world government and total control riding on the outcome. So rather than admit they were wrong, the governments, and their tame climate scientists, now cheat and lie outrageously to maintain the fiction about carbon dioxide being a dangerous pollutant.
Let’s be perfectly clear. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and other things being equal, the more carbon dioxide in the air, the warmer the planet. Every bit of carbon dioxide that we emit warms the planet. But the issue is not whether carbon dioxide warms the planet, but how much.
Most scientists, on both sides, also agree on how much a given increase in the level of carbon dioxide raises the planet’s temperature, if just the extra carbon dioxide is considered. These calculations come from laboratory experiments; the basic physics have been well known for a century.
The disagreement comes about what happens next.
The planet reacts to the extra carbon dioxide, which changes everything. Most critically, the extra warmth causes more water to evaporate from the oceans. But does the water hang around and increase the height of moist air in the atmosphere, or does it simply create more clouds and rain? Back in 1980, when the carbon dioxide theory started, no one knew. The alarmists guessed that it would increase the height of moist air around the planet, which would warm the planet even further, because the moist air is also a greenhouse gas.
This is the core idea of every official climate model: for each bit of warming due to carbon dioxide, they claim it ends up causing three bits of warming due to the extra moist air. The climate models amplify the carbon dioxide warming by a factor of three – so two thirds of their projected warming is due to extra moist air (and other factors), only one third is due to extra carbon dioxide.
I’ll bet you didn’t know that. Hardly anyone in the public does, but it’s the core of the issue. All the disagreements, lies, and misunderstanding spring from this. The alarmist case is based on this guess about moisture in the atmosphere, and there is simply no evidence for the amplification that is at the core of their alarmism. Which is why the alarmists keep so quiet about it and you’ve never heard of it before. And it tells you what a poor job the media have done in covering this issue.
Weather balloons had been measuring the atmosphere since the 1960s, many thousands of them every year. The climate models all predict that as the planet warms, a hot-spot of moist air will develop over the tropics about 10km up, as the layer of moist air expands upwards into the cool dry air above. During the warming of the late 1970s, 80s, and 90s, the weather balloons found no hot-spot. None at all. Not even a small one. This evidence proves the climate models are fundamentally flawed and they greatly overestimate the temperature increases due to carbon dioxide.
This evidence first became clear around the mid 1990s.
At this point official “climate science” stopped being a science. You see, in science empirical evidence always trumps theory, no matter how much you are in love with the theory. If theory and evidence disagree, real scientists scrap the theory. But official climate science ignored the crucial weather balloon evidence, and other subsequent evidence that backs it up, and instead clung to their carbon dioxide theory — this just happens to keep them in high-paying jobs with lavish research grants, and gives great political power to their government masters.
There are now several independent pieces of evidence showing that the earth responds to the warming due to extra carbon dioxide by dampening the warming. Every long-lived natural system behaves this way, counteracting any disturbances, otherwise the system would be unstable. The climate system is no exception, and now we can prove it.
But the alarmists say the exact opposite, that the climate system amplifies any warming due to extra carbon dioxide, and is potentially unstable. Surprise – surprise, their predictions of planetary temperature made in 1988 to the US Congress, and again in 1990, 1995, and 2001, have all proved much higher than reality.
They keep lowering the temperature increases they expect, from 0.30C per decade in 1990, to 0.20C per decade in 2001, and now 0.15C per decade – yet they have the gall to tell us “it’s worse than expected”. These people are not scientists. They over-estimate the temperature increases due to carbon dioxide, selectively deny evidence, and now they cheat and lie to conceal the truth.
One way they cheat is in the way they measure temperature.
The official thermometers are often located in the warm exhaust of air conditioning outlets, over hot tarmac at airports where they get blasts of hot air from jet engines, at wastewater plants where they get warmth from decomposing sewerage, or in hot cities choked with cars and buildings. Global warming is measured in tenths of a degree, so any extra heating nudge is important. In the US, nearly 90% of official thermometers surveyed by volunteers violate official siting requirements that they not be too close to an artificial heating source. Nearly 90%! The photos of these thermometers are on the Internet; you can get to them via the corruption paper at my site, sciencespeak.com. Look at the photos, and you’ll never trust a government climate scientist again.
They place their thermometers in warm localities, and call the results “global” warming. Anyone can understand that this is cheating. They say that 2010 is the warmest recent year, but it was only the warmest at various airports, selected air conditioners, and certain car parks.
Global temperature is also measured by satellites, which measure nearly the whole planet 24/7 without bias. The satellites say the hottest recent year was 1998, and that since 2001 the global temperature has levelled off.
So it’s a question of trust.
If it really is warming up as the government climate scientists say, why do they present only the surface thermometer results and not mention the satellite results? And why do they put their thermometers near artificial heating sources? This is so obviously a scam now.
So what is really going on with the climate?
The earth has been in a warming trend since the depth of the Little Ice Age around 1680. Human emissions of carbon dioxide were negligible before 1850 and have nearly all come after WWII, so human carbon dioxide cannot possibly have caused the trend. Within the trend, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation causes alternating global warming and cooling for 25 – 30 years at a go in each direction. We have just finished a warming phase, so expect mild global cooling for the next two decades.
We are now at an extraordinary juncture.
Official climate science, which is funded and directed entirely by government, promotes a theory which is based on a guess about moist air and is now a known falsehood. Governments gleefully accept their advice, because the only way to curb emissions is to impose taxes and extend government control over all energy use. And to curb emissions on a world scale might even lead to world government — how exciting for the political class!
A carbon tax?
Even if Australia stopped emitting all carbon dioxide tomorrow, completely shut up shop and went back to the stone age, according to the official government climate models it would be cooler in 2050 by about 0.015 degrees. But their models exaggerate tenfold – in fact our sacrifices would make the planet in 2050 a mere 0.0015 degrees cooler!
Sorry, but you’ve been had.
Finally, to those of you who still believe the planet is in danger from our carbon dioxide emissions: sorry, but you’ve been had. Yes carbon dioxide is a cause of global warming, but it’s so minor it’s not worth doing much about.

Dr David Evans consulted full-time for the Australian Greenhouse Office (now the Department of Climate Change) from 1999 to 2005, and part-time 2008 to 2010, modelling Australia’s carbon in plants, debris, mulch, soils, and forestry and agricultural products. Evans is a mathematician and engineer, with six university degrees including a PhD from Stanford University in electrical engineering. The area of human endeavour with the most experience and sophistication in dealing with feedbacks and analysing complex systems is electrical engineering, and the most crucial and disputed aspects of understanding the climate system are the feedbacks. The evidence supporting the idea that CO2 emissions were the main cause of global warming reversed itself from 1998 to 2006, causing Evans to move from being a warmist to a sceptic.

What is the point of taking money off people, spinning it around a bureaucracy and giving people back a bit of their own money and expecting be thanked for it? Why don’t you just let people keep their own money and go away?
In the meantime you put up the price of the fundamental mechanism of commerce, power, so what is now our competitive advantage? Obviously we don’t want lower wages so ultimately there will be fewer jobs.
Is Australia going to be reduced to a country that digs up red rocks and black rocks, iron and coal and sends them over to where they don’t have a carbon tax so they can produce the things we used to produce?
 Doesn’t the government get it? The people don’t want this tax and surely the have some right in being respected on this decision.
Even on the CFMEU website, the majority of the workers don’t want a carbon tax.  I’m sure that this is not a National Party stronghold, so my advice to the Labor party is, listen to your own people otherwise it will end up in tears, like the NSW election.

Carbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere without which all plants would suffocate. It is odorless and invisible, and plant life flourishes around coal-fired power stations which use scrubbers to remove particulate matter and other nasties from the chimneys to allow sunlight and carbon dioxide to work the miracle of photosynthesis. By no stretch of the imagination can it be deemed a pollutant.
CO2 in the atmosphere is at historically low levels. It is driven by ocean temperatures – warm water expels CO2; cold water takes up CO2.
“The fundamental reason why carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is critically important to biology is that there is so little of it. A field of corn growing in full sunlight in the middle of the day uses up all of the carbon dioxide within a metre of the ground in about five minutes.”

Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen.
The debate about global warming has reached ridiculous proportions and is full of micro thin half-truths  and misunderstandings. I am a scientist who was on the carbon gravy train, understands the evidence,  was once an alarmist, but am now a skeptic. Watching this issue unfold has been amusing but, lately, worrying. This issue is tearing society apart, making fools and liars out of our politicians.
Let’s set a few things straight.
The whole idea that carbon dioxide is the main cause of the recent global warming is based on a guess that was proved false by empirical evidence during the 1990s. But the gravy train was too big, with too many jobs, industries, trading profits, political careers, and the possibility of world government and total control riding on the outcome. So rather than admit they were wrong, the governments, and their tame climate scientists, now cheat and lie outrageously to maintain the fiction that carbon dioxide is a dangerous pollutant.
Let’s be perfectly clear. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and other things being equal, the more carbon dioxide in the air, the warmer the planet. Every bit of carbon dioxide that we emit warms the planet. But the issue is not whether carbon dioxide warms the planet, but how much.
Most scientists, on both sides, also agree on how much a given increase in the level of carbon dioxide raises the planet’s temperature, if just the extra carbon dioxide is considered. These calculations come from laboratory experiments; the basic physics have been well known for a century.

The disagreement comes about what happens next.
The planet reacts to that extra carbon dioxide, which changes everything. Most critically, the extra warmth causes more water to evaporate from the oceans. But does the water hang around and increase the height of moist air in the atmosphere, or does it simply create more clouds and rain? Back in 1980, when the carbon dioxide theory started, no one knew. The alarmists guessed that it would increase the height of moist air around the planet, which would warm the planet even further, because the moist air is also a greenhouse gas.
This is the core idea of every official climate model: for each bit of warming due to carbon dioxide, they claim it ends up causing three bits of warming due to the extra moist air. The climate models amplify the carbon dioxide warming by a factor of three – so two thirds of their projected warming is due to extra moist air (and other factors), only one third is due to extra carbon dioxide.
I’ll bet you didn’t know that. Hardly anyone in the public does, but it’s the core of the issue. All the disagreements, lies, and misunderstanding spring from this. The alarmist case is based on this guess about moisture in the atmosphere, and there is simply no evidence for the amplification that is at the core of their alarmism. Which is why the alarmists keep so quiet about it and you’ve never heard of it before. And it tells you what a poor job the media have done in covering this issue.
Weather balloons had been measuring the atmosphere since the 1960s, many thousands of them every year. The climate models all predict that as the planet warms, a hot-spot of moist air will develop over the tropics about 10km up, as the layer of moist air expands upwards into the cool dry air above.  During the warming of the late 1970s, 80s, and 90s, the weather balloons found no hot-spot. None at all. Not even a small one. This evidence proves that the climate models are fundamentally flawed, that they greatly overestimate the temperature increases due to carbon dioxide.
This evidence first became clear around the mid 1990s.
At this point official “climate science” stopped being a science. You see, in science empirical evidence always trumps theory, no matter how much you are in love with the theory. If theory and evidence disagree, real scientists scrap the theory. But official climate science ignored the crucial weather balloon evidence, and other subsequent evidence that backs it up, and instead clung to their carbon dioxide theory — that just happens to keep them in well-paying jobs with lavish research grants, and gives great political power to their government masters.
There are now several independent pieces of evidence showing that the earth responds to the warming due to extra carbon dioxide by dampening the warming. Every long-lived natural system behaves this way, counteracting any disturbance, otherwise the system would be unstable. The climate system is no exception, and now we can prove it.
But the  alarmists say the exact opposite, that the climate system amplifies any warming due to extra carbon dioxide, and is potentially unstable. Surprise surprise, their predictions of planetary temperature made in 1988 to the US Congress, and again in 1990, 1995, and 2001, have all proved much higher than reality.
They keep lowering the temperature increases they expect, from 0.30C per decade in 1990, to 0.20C per decade in 2001, and now 0.15C per decade – yet they have the gall to tell us “it’s worse than expected”. These people are not scientists. They over-estimate the temperature increases due to carbon dioxide, selectively deny evidence, and now they cheat and lie to conceal the truth.
One way they cheat is in the way they measure temperature.
The official  thermometers are often located in the warm exhaust of air conditioning outlets, over hot tarmac at airports where they get blasts of hot air from jet engines, at wastewater  plants where they get warmth from decomposing sewage, or in hot cities choked with cars and buildings. Global warming is measured in tenths of a degree, so any extra heating nudge is important. In the US, nearly 90% of official thermometers surveyed by volunteers violate official siting requirements that they not be too close to an artificial heating source. Nearly 90%! The photos of these thermometers are on the Internet; you can get to them via the corruption paper at my site, sciencespeak.com.  Look at the photos, and you’ll never trust a government climate scientist again.
They place their thermometers in warm localities, and call the results “global” warming. Anyone can understand that this is cheating. They say that 2010 is the warmest recent year, but it was only the warmest at various airports, selected air conditioners, and certain car parks.
Global temperature is also measured by satellites, which measure nearly the whole planet 24/7without bias. The satellites say the hottest recent year was 1998, and that since 2001 the global temperature has leveled off.
So it’s a question of trust.
If it really is warming up as the government climate scientists say, why do they present only the surface thermometer results and not mention the satellite results? And why do they put their thermometers near artificial heating sources? This is so obviously a scam now.
So what is really going on with the climate?
The earth has been in a warming trend since the depth of the Little Ice Age around 1680. Human emissions of carbon dioxide were negligible before 1850 and have nearly all come after WWII, so human carbon dioxide cannot possibly have caused the trend. Within the trend, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation causes alternating global warming and cooling for 25 – 30 years at a go in each direction. We have just finished a warming phase, so expect mild global cooling for the next two decades.
We are now at an extraordinary juncture.
Official climate science, which is funded and directed entirely by government, promotes a theory that is based on a guess about moist air that is now a known falsehood. Governments gleefully accept their advice, because the only way to curb emissions are to impose taxes and extend government control over all energy use. And to curb emissions on a world scale might even lead to world government — how exciting for the political class!
A carbon tax?
Even if Australia stopped emitting all carbon dioxide tomorrow, completely shut up shop and went back to the stone age, according to the official government climate models it would be cooler in 2050 by about 0.015 degrees. But their models exaggerate tenfold – in fact our sacrifices would make the planet in 2050 a mere 0.0015 degrees cooler!
Sorry, but you’ve been had.
Finally, to those of you who still believe the planet is in danger from our carbon dioxide emissions: sorry, but you’ve been had. Yes carbon dioxide a cause of global warming, but it’s so minor it’s not worth doing much about.

Dr David Evans consulted full-time for the Australian Greenhouse Office (now the Department of Climate Change) from 1999 to 2005, and part-time 2008 to 2010, modeling Australia’s carbon in plants, debris, mulch, soils, and forestry and agricultural products. Evans is a mathematician and engineer, with six university degrees including a PhD from Stanford University in electrical engineering. The area of human endeavor with the most experience and sophistication in dealing with feedbacks and analyzing complex systems is electrical engineering, and the most crucial and disputed aspects of understanding the climate system are the feedbacks. The evidence supporting the idea that CO2 emissions were the main cause of global warming reversed itself from 1998 to 2006, causing Evans to move from being a warmist to a skeptic.

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/03/25/mckitrick-earth-hour/,,Earth Hour – a dissent,"By Ross McKitrick.
In 2009 I was asked by a journalist for my thoughts on the importance of Earth Hour. Here is my response.
I abhor Earth Hour. Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century. Every material social advance in the 20th century depended on the proliferation of inexpensive and reliable electricity.
Giving women the freedom to work outside the home depended on the availability of electrical appliances that free up time from domestic chores. Getting children out of menial labour and into schools depended on the same thing, as well as the ability to provide safe indoor lighting for reading.

Development and provision of modern health care without electricity is absolutely impossible. The expansion of our food supply, and the promotion of hygiene and nutrition, depended on being able to irrigate fields, cook and refrigerate foods, and have a steady indoor supply of hot water. Many of the world’s poor suffer brutal environmental conditions in their own homes because of the necessity of cooking over indoor fires that burn twigs and dung. This causes local deforestation and the proliferation of smoke- and parasite-related lung diseases.
Anyone who wants to see local conditions improve in the third world should realize the importance of access to cheap electricity from fossil-fuel based power generating stations. After all, that’s how the west developed.
The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity. I cannot do that, instead I celebrate it and all that it has provided for humanity.
Earth Hour celebrates ignorance, poverty and backwardness. By repudiating the greatest engine of liberation it becomes an hour devoted to anti-humanism. It encourages the sanctimonious gesture of turning off trivial appliances for a trivial amount of time, in deference to some ill-defined abstraction called “the Earth,” all the while hypocritically retaining the real benefits of continuous, reliable electricity.
People who see virtue in doing without electricity should shut off their fridge, stove, microwave, computer, water heater, lights, TV and all other appliances for a month, not an hour. And pop down to the cardiac unit at the hospital and shut the power off there too.
I don’t want to go back to nature. Travel to a zone hit by earthquakes, floods and hurricanes to see what it’s like to go back to nature. For humans, living in “nature” meant a short life span marked by violence, disease and ignorance. People who work for the end of poverty and relief from disease are fighting against nature. I hope they leave their lights on.
Here in Ontario, through the use of pollution control technology and advanced engineering, our air quality has dramatically improved since the 1960s, despite the expansion of industry and the power supply.
If, after all this, we are going to take the view that the remaining air emissions outweigh all the benefits of electricity, and that we ought to be shamed into sitting in darkness for an hour, like naughty children who have been caught doing something bad, then we are setting up unspoiled nature as an absolute, transcendent ideal that obliterates all other ethical and humane obligations.
No thanks.
I like visiting nature but I don’t want to live there, and I refuse to accept the idea that civilization with all its tradeoffs is something to be ashamed of.

Wind energy needs a wide network of roads, transmission lines and turbines which degrades any area containing wind farms. It has a huge land footprint.
The operating characteristics of turbine and generator mean that only a small part of wind energy can be captured.
Wind power is also intermittent, unreliable and hard to predict. Therefore large backup or storage systems are required. This adds to the capital and operating costs and increases the instability of the network.
Wind farms are uniformly hated by neighbours and will not be willingly accepted without heavy compensation payments. Their noise, flicker, fire risk and disturbing effect on domestic and wild animals are well documented.
The wind is free but wind power is far from it. Its cost is far above all conventional methods of generating electricity. Either taxpayers or consumers will pay this bill.
Wind farms are promoted as a way to decarbonise energy generation. This is supposed to reduce global warming. There is no evidence that there is any need or benefit in chasing this rainbow.
There is no justification for continuing the complex network of subsidies, mandates and tax breaks that currently underpin construction of wind farms in Australia. If wind power is sustainable it will be developed without these financial crutches.

Similar losses have been experienced in eastern Australia, and although the science is less certain it is probable that global warming is behind these losses too. But by far the most dangerous trend is the decline in the flow of Australian rivers: it has fallen by around 70 per cent in recent decades, so dams no longer fill even when it does rain. Growing evidence suggests that hotter soils, caused directly by global warming, have increased evaporation and transpiration and that the change is permanent.

However, unless Garnaut was misquoted, his recent pronouncement in relation to Cyclone Yasi was so absurdly outrageous that it falls under Clark’s Law: “Sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice”.
Under a headline “You ain’t seen nothing yet”, Garnaut was quoted as saying:
“With strong mitigation, we at least rule out, or reduce to low probabilities, the potential for catastrophe”.
Fair enough, if he was encouraging better building standards or discouraging people from living in cyclone or flood prone areas, but he is advising the government on a carbon price mechanism, and the implication of the article was that putting a price (tax) on carbon will rule out the potential for catastrophes of the sort that have beset mankind since the Great Flood – a big call indeed!
Even were Australia to reduce its CO2 emissions to zero, it would have a negligible effect on global emissions, but according to Garnaut it’s not even necessary to reduce our emissions! To accomplish that, a “carbon price” would have to be so high as to drastically discourage use of fossil energy, but Garnaut claimed that the impact on electricity prices of his “carbon price” would be “not very big”; hence, the reduction in CO2 emissions would also be not very big.

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/02/02/wind-power-hayden/,,Wind Power – Facts and Fallacies,"Wind Power – it’s all about trying to extract energy from Free Air.
Wind turbines try to catch the kinetic energy in the moving cylinder of air that is sliced by the turbine blade. Because air is so light, and wind has a generally low speed (compared to a jet engine thrust, say) there is a limited amount of energy to be collected.
And turbines can only catch a limited amount of this energy – to collect it all would require the turbine to catch all of that air and bring it to a dead stop. Naturally this never occurs and wind leaves the turbine will significant speed and energy. For an ideal turbine in an ideal wind speed the power co-efficient may only be in the 30-40% range.
Conversion of the energy collected by the blade to electrical energy is achieved in an electric generator, where more energy is lost. The generator is designed for the optimal blade speed. If the wind blows harder than expected, the excess energy cannot be caught by the generator and electricity generation levels out, until at about 25 m/s wind speed, the turbine cuts out to prevent damage in high winds. A standard power factor is about 35%.
Unfortunately generators are designed to run at high speed but turbines turn at low speeds. Therefore they need huge gearboxes which develop massive forces for which no effective lubricant is available. At high winds, gearboxes may overheat and catch fire.

CO2 is not a pollutant and it is not a poison and we should not corrupt the English language by depriving “pollutant” and “poison” of their original meaning.
Our exhaled breath contains about 4% CO2. That is 40,000 parts per million, or about 100 times the current atmospheric concentration. CO2 is absolutely essential for life on earth. Commercial greenhouse operators often use CO2 as a fertilizer to improve the health and growth rate of their plants. Plants, and our own primate ancestors evolved when the levels of atmospheric CO2 were about 1000 ppm, a level that we will probably not reach by burning fossil fuels, and far above our current level of about 380 ppm. We try to keep CO2 levels in our US Navy submarines no higher than 8,000 parts per million, about 20 times current atmospheric levels. Few adverse effects are observed at even higher levels.

https://carbon-sense.com/2011/01/16/john-oxley-brisbane-floods/,,John Oxley on the Brisbane floods,"A bit of Brisbane’s flood history:


1824
John Oxley, early explorer, mentioned evidence of an inundation which he discovered on 19 September 1824 in an area north of the junction of the Bremer with the Brisbane: “the starboard bank an elevated flat of rich land, declining to a point where had evidently by its sandy shore and pebbly surface, been at some time washed by an inundation; a flood would be too weak an expression to use for a collection of water rising to the full height (full fifty feet) which the appearance of the shore here renders
possible.” (Ref 2)


1825
Major Edmund Lockyer mentioned the evidence of a large flood while in the area of today’s Mount Crosby pumping station – “marks of drift grass and pieces of wood washed up on the sides of the banks and up into the branches of the trees, marked the flood to rise here of one hundred feet”. Lockyer’s descendant, Nicholas Lockyer, in 1919 made the following remarks: “the official record of the flood level of the river on the 4th February 1893 at the Pumping Station, the site of which is within a mile of Lockyer’s camp, was 94 feet 10.5 inches. His remarks would seem to suggest that between Oxley’s visit in September 1824 and his [Major
Edmund Lockyer] own in September 1825, the river had experienced a flood as great as that subsequently experienced in February 1893.” (Ref 2)

Our world is certainly changing; Antarctica, once a thriving forest is now a desolate ice land; the Adelaide hills, once a glacial wilderness is now a verdant scrub land; the Simpson Desert, once a forest of Acacia Peuce is now a glorious Aussie desert.
It is indisputable that the climate has changed endlessly through the millennia. The percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere needed to support life as we know it did not exist until the development of cyanobacteria and stromatolites between 2,300 million and 500 million years. Remnant living stromatolites in fact still exist in Shark Bay, Western Australia.
Only a religiously carbon-obsessed fanatic could seriously attribute those cyclic ice age-temperate climate changes to carbon dioxide. (Carbon dioxide is a colourless gas consisting of one atom of carbon with two atoms of oxygen).
Oxygen didn’t exist in a life supporting percentage of the earth’s atmosphere until the Earth’s developmental cycle referred to above.

By Paul Driessen 21 Sep 2010
From http://townhall.com/columnists/PaulDriessen/2010/09/21/unsustainable_cow_manure/page/full/
Seek a sustainable future! Wind, solar and biofuels will ensure an eco-friendly, climate-protecting, planet-saving, sustainable inheritance for our children. Or so we are told by activists and politicians intent on enacting new renewable energy standards, mandates and subsidies during a lame duck session.
It may be useful to address some basic issues, before going further down the road to Renewable Utopia.

First, when exactly is something not sustainable? When known deposits (proven reserves) may be depleted in ten years? 50? 100? What if looming depletion results from government policies that forbid access to lands that might contain new deposits – as with US onshore and offshore prospects for oil, gas, coal, uranium, rare earth minerals and other vital resources?
Rising prices and improved discovery and extraction technologies and techniques typically expand energy and mineral reserves – postponing depletion by years or decades, as in the case of oil and natural gas. But legislation, regulation, taxation and litigation prevent these processes from working properly, hasten depletion, and make “sustainability” an even more politicized, manipulated and meaningless concept.
Second, should the quest for mandated “sustainable” technologies be based on real, immediate threats – or will imaginary or exaggerated crises suffice? Dangerous manmade global cooling morphed into dangerous manmade global warming, then into “global climate disruption” – driven by computer models and disaster scenarios, doctored temperature data, manipulated peer reviews, and bogus claims about melting glaciers and rising sea levels. Shouldn’t policies that replace reliable, affordable energy with expensive, intermittent, land-intensive, subsidized sources be based on real science?
Third, shouldn’t inconvenient sustainability issues be resolved before we proceed any further, by applying the same guidelines to renewable energy as courts, regulators and eco-activists apply to fossil fuels?
Most oil, gas, coal and uranium operations impact limited acreage for limited times – and affected areas must be restored to natural conditions when production ends. Effects on air and water quality, habitats and protected species are addressed through regulations, lease restrictions and fines. The operations generate vast amounts of affordable, reliable energy from relatively small tracts of land, and substantial revenues.
Wind turbines generate small amounts of expensive, unreliable electricity from gargantuan installations on thousands of acres. Turbines and their associated transmission lines dominate scenic vistas, disrupt habitats and migratory routes, affect water drainage patterns, impede crop dusting and other activities, and kill bats, raptors and other birds, including endangered species that would bring major fines if the corporate killers were oil or mining companies. And yet, wind operators receive exemptions from environmental review, biodiversity and endangered species laws that traditional energy companies must follow – on the ground that such rules would raise costs and delay construction of “eco-friendly” projects.
Kentucky’s Cardinal coal mine alone produces 75% of the Btu energy generated by all the wind turbines and solar panels in the USA, Power Hungry author Robert Bryce calculates. Unspoiled vistas, rural and maritime tranquility, and bald eagles will all be endangered if 20% wind power mandates are enacted.
The Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station near Phoenix generates nearly 900 times more electricity than Nevada’s Nellis Air Force Base photovoltaic panels, on less land, for 1/15 the cost per kWh – and does it 90% of the time, versus 30% of the time for the Nellis array. Generating Palo Verde’s electrical output via Nellis technology would require solar arrays across an area ten times larger than Washington, DC.
Building enough photovoltaic arrays to power Los Angeles would mean blanketing thousands of square miles of desert habitat. And once built, solar and wind systems will be there just this side of forever, especially if we persist in phasing out all carbon energy generators except those needed for the backup power that keeps wind and solar facilities operational.
Wind and solar power also mean there is a sudden demand for tons of rare earth elements that weren’t terribly important a decade ago. They exist in very low concentrations, require mining and milling massive amounts of rock and ore to get the needed minerals, and thus impose huge ecological impacts.
If mountaintop removal to extract high quality coal at reduced risk to miners is unacceptable and unsustainable – how is it eco-friendly and sustainable to clear-cut mountain vistas for wind turbines? Blanket thousands of square miles with habitat-suffocating solar panels? Or remove mountains of rock to mine low-grade rare earth mineral deposits for solar panel films, hybrid batteries and turbine magnets?
Since any undiscovered US rare earth deposits are likely locked up in wilderness and other restricted land use areas, virtually no exploration or development will take place here. We will thus be dependent on foreign suppliers, like China, which are using them in their own manufacturing operations – and selling us finished wind turbines, solar panels and hybrid car batteries. The United States will thus be dependent on foreign suppliers for renewable energy, just as we rely on foreign countries for oil and uranium.
To claim any of this is ecologically or economically sustainable strains credulity.
Green jobs will mostly be overseas, subsidized by US tax and energy dollars – other people’s money (OPM). Indeed, Americans have already spent over $20 billion in stimulus money on “green” energy projects. However, 80% of the funding for some of them went to China, India, South Korea and Spain, and three-fourth of the turbines for eleven US wind projects were made overseas. This is intolerable, indefensible and unsustainable. But it gets worse.
Denver’s Nature and Science Museum used $720,000 in stimulus money to install photovoltaic panels and reduce its electricity bills by 20 percent. The panels may last 25 years, whereas it will take 110 years to save enough on those bills to pay for the panels – and by then four more sets of panels will be needed.
As to biofuels, the US Navy recently waxed ecstatic over its success with camellia-based eco-fuel in fighter jets. But the PC biofuel costs $67.50 per gallon, versus $5.00 per gallon for commercial jet fuel.
To meet the 36-billion-gallons-a-year-by-2022 federal ethanol diktat, we would have to grow corn on cropland and wildlife habitat the size of Georgia, to get 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol – plus switchgrass on farmlands and habitats the size of South Carolina, to produce 21 billion gallons of “advanced biofuel.” By contrast, we could produce 670 billion gallons of oil from frozen tundra equal to 1/20 of Washington, DC, if the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge weren’t off limits.
OPM-subsidized ethanol also means a few corn growers and ethanol refiners make hefty profits. But chicken and beef producers, manufacturers that need corn syrup, and families of all stripes get pounded by soaring costs, to generate a fuel that gets one-third less mileage per tank than gasoline.
Hydrocarbons fueled the most amazing and sustained progress in human history. Rejecting further progress – in the name of sustainability or climate protection – requires solid evidence that we face catastrophes if we don’t switch to “sustainable” alternatives. Computer-generated disaster scenarios and bald assertions by Al Gore, Harry Reid, John Holdren and President Obama just don’t make the grade.
We need to improve energy efficiency and conserve resources. Science and technology will continue the great strides we have made in that regard. Politically motivated mandates will impose huge costs for few benefits. Sustainability claims will simply redistribute smaller shares of a shrinking economic pie.
“Renewable” energy subsidies may sustain the jobs of lobbyists, activists, politicians, bureaucrats and politically connected companies. But they will kill millions of other people’s jobs.
Let’s be sure to remind our elected officials of this along their campaign trails – and on November 2.

Quoting data from the UN World Meteorological Organisation is suspect because the WMO jointly created the IPCC, which is dedicated to proving that anthropogenic warming is happening regardless of evidence.
The British Met Office is in disarray for its conflicting and error-prone forecasts provided to the UK, while in New Zealand the national weather body abandoned their official temperature records because of manipulation of past data by the government agency. In Australia, the BOM is no different to many other data collection agencies around the world in selective manipulation of older raw data records downwards (i.e. cooler), thus making the overall trend appear warmer to the present.  This effect is also achieved by closing of thousands of data stations around the world, most in the cooler regions, thus leading to a warming bias.
Recent high-quality ice core data from Greenland shows that of the past 10,500 years, 9,100 were warmer than 2010, with no relation to CO2, while the longest instrumental record in the world in central England shows that December 2010 was the second coldest December dating back to 1659.  Australian raw data shows that we have warmed only 0.6oC since 1910, and Mr Steketee needs to look at the less alarmist bigger picture and to be better informed about the work of experts such as Professor Bob Carter.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/12/29/forbes-co2-and-oceans/,,"Carbon Dioxide and the Oceans – temperature controls carbon dioxide, not the reverse.","71% of the earth’s surface is covered by water and large areas of the land are covered by frozen water. Water and water vapour are also significant components of the atmosphere.
The atmosphere and its trace component of carbon dioxide is a very thin skin in close contact with the surface of all of this water. Carbon dioxide is very soluble in water and Henry’s Law says that as the temperature of water changes the quantity of carbon dioxide dissolved in that water will change.
Thus if the sea surface temperature increases, carbon dioxide will be expelled to the atmosphere just like carbon dioxide bubbles are expelled from a warming beer. And as sea surface temperature falls, carbon dioxide will dissolve in the cooling water and this reduces the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
This effect can be seen in seasonal, medium term and long term trends.
The seasonal variation in atmospheric content of carbon dioxide is well known, and the huge southern oceans are key players. See the short paper by Bob Beatty on the carbon dioxide cycle at :   http://www.bosmin.com/HenrysLaw.pdf [PDF, 689 KB]
When it is winter in the southern hemisphere, the cold surface water of the oceans absorb carbon dioxide and the content of carbon dioxide in the air falls suddenly by about 4 ppm. This is reversed when the southern oceans warm in summer, and the carbon dioxide is expelled from the oceans. (The seasonal summer growth and winter fall of northern hemisphere vegetation adds to this seasonal fluctuation caused mainly by the southern oceans.)
On a medium time scale (21 year moving average) Professor Lance Endersbee published a short paper in August 2008 and he concluded that the oceans regulate the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the influence of human-generated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is negligible. His paper included the following diagram:

See full article at: endersbee-co2-and-oceans.pdf [PDF, 490 KB;   Source: ATSE No 151, August 2008.]
See also this paper by Alan MacRae: http://icecap.us/images/uploads/CO2vsTMacRae.pdf [PDF, 286 KB]
On longer time scales, ocean mixing caused by deep ocean currents causes long term changes in ocean temperatures.  These changes also affect long term carbon dioxide trends. Carbon dioxide held in large quantities in cold deep ocean water is slowly released as ocean currents mix this cold water with warmer surface water. The reverse occurs as the sea surface cools, absorbs carbon dioxide and the cold dense water sinks to the ocean floor.
The most dramatic evidence of this lagged response comes from ice core data. These show that significant turning points in temperature precede the corresponding turning points in carbon dioxide content in air by between 650 and 1600 years.
See:  http://carbon-sense.com/2009/10/03/taxing-ambulances/
Henry’s Law can and has been tested in laboratory experiments. The other data provides additional evidence for the conclusion that the major factor regulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, on all time scales, is the temperature of the oceans. Ocean temperature is controlled by solar cycles, cloud cover, ocean currents and undersea volcanism.

The story of how a combination of green missionaries and vested interests have distorted and crippled the Australian electricity industry.
Evans and Quirk conclude:
“By 2020 annual electricity consumption in eastern Australia is estimated from NEMMCO data to be 347 Twh. If renewables are to provide 20 per cent, and no new hydro is to be permitted, electricity production from wind farms (or other renewable sources) must provide 53 TWh. Ignoring for the moment the insuperable problem of unpredictability, and assuming a Load Factor of 25 per cent, this will require a total of 27,000 MW of windmill capacity. Every bit of coastline, every mountain ridge, and much else that can be secured for windmills will have to be pressed into service to meet this target.
“The capital cost of wind power is considered to be $2000 per kW, and so an extra 26,000 MW will cost $52 billion. And back-up will be required. So in addition to new coal plant required to provide an additional 60 TWh, back-up generation of at least 23,400 MW will be required. All of this will have to be paid for by the electricity consumer. These numbers could not appear in any Commonwealth budget; no government could justify that sort of expenditure.
“On top of all this we have system stability problems created by widely dispersed power sources, spread over tens of thousands of square kilometres; whose output can vary dramatically as the wind gusts and dies down; that are connected to the main grid by long, weak transmission lines—a system operator’s nightmare. Such a transmission network, weak and unreliable as it will be, will cost at least $30 billion.”

Both petrol and ethanol produce carbon dioxide when burnt. But to produce the same energy requires more ethanol than petrol, and it produces more carbon dioxide.
Moreover producing ethanol from corn by fermentation also produces more carbon dioxide during the fermentation process. And then the dilute ethanol produced by fermentation (about 12%) has to be concentrated using a distillation process which requires more energy and more emissions. Burning ethanol rather than petrol thus probably increases the production of carbon dioxide.

In the U.S., last year’s harvest was 10.5 billion bushels, the third-largest crop ever. But instead of going into the maws of pigs or cattle or people, an increasing slice of that supply is being transformed into fuel for cars. The roughly 5 billion gallons of ethanol made in 2006 by 112 U.S. plants consumed nearly one-fifth of the corn crop. If all the scores of factories under construction or planned go into operation, fuel will gobble up no less than half of the entire corn harvest by 2008.

This will add tremendous stress to an already struggling economy. With more money being spent to pay for basic necessities, less money is available to spend on discretionary items. This will hurt small businesses that will also be paying higher energy bills. Prices will have to be increased to cover the higher overhead costs. The loss of money in the economy combined with the rising cost of operating a business will result in many businesses having to close their doors. There is no better prescription for job killing legislation than this.
Alternative sources of energy are dramatically more expensive than conventional coal power. An article in The Morning Bell from The Heritage Foundation on October 21, 2010 reveals the prices of energy that President Barack Obama’s very own Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects for various sources of electricity per megawatt hour in 2016 (based on 2008 dollars) as follows:
• Conventional Coal Power $ 78.10
• Onshore Wind Power $149.30
• Offshore Wind Power $191.10

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/11/19/duck-conservation/,,Duck Conservation and Recycling,"To reduce the number of dead ducks found in oils sands tailings ponds, I propose Syncrude construct an array of wind turbines around the margins of the tailings ponds.
Ducks would be humanely shredded by green-friendly blades and fall to the Earth where they would form neat piles that could be retrieved using carbon neutral electric vehicles. The carcasses would have less contamination and could be served in the Syncrude cafeteria in building 41-B, thus reusing the carbon that would have been released into the atmosphere had the ducks been left to decay in the wild. Electricity from the wind turbines could be used to cook the birds.
Boats for duck recovery would become unnecessary, the ducks would not be coated in oil and Greenpeace could feel happy that the collection vehicles are recharged by power supplied by the bird shredders.
For the entertainment of “greens” all over the world, web cameras could watch in awe as the ducks fly into the collection area. This would reduce the need for smug, self-satisfied hypocrites to burn oil sand-derived fuel up to Fort McMurray to protest for the benefit of jet-set fuel-wasters such as David Suzuki, Al Gore and James Cameron.
I am all for alternative energy, but to rely on the wind, for cities, is just plain stupid. Not a single fossil fuel plant has been made obsolete by the present subsidized wind power. As long as hospitals expect 24-hour power, we will need proper power plants.

It’s understandable that he would support a new tax on carbon or an ETS.
However, it’s a shame that Mr. Kloppers has not properly thought through his support of the Greens/Labor Carbon Tax.
If he properly considered the consequences of his proposal he would have realized that forcing Australian pensioners and families to pay more money in tax to the Federal and State governments will not stop the world’s climate from changing.
Even if you accepted the lie that man made carbon is changing the world’s climate for the worst, and even if all Australians shed themselves of every carbon producing material or activity, (we could go back to living in caves, wearing animal skins and burning candles) it would not change the climate one degree.
Even the Green zealots and Labor loonies who refuse to acknowledge the natural cycles of the earth’s orbital patterns (Milankovich Cycles) and the significant climatic variations (Ice ages and countless Earth Warming events) which follow, would have to acknowledge that Australia only produces 1% of the world’s man made carbon.
Mr. Kloppers must realize that the rest of the world has abandoned the idea of a Carbon Tax. If you look at the 6 August edition of The Economist, the world’s most respected magazine, you will find that an ETS style of scheme in America is dead.
Under the sub-headline “The Democrats abandon their efforts to limit emissions through legislation”, the writer of the article said:
“Harry Reid, the majority leader, having earlier abandoned as hopeless an effort to limit America’s emissions of greenhouse gases through a cap-and trade scheme, is proposing nothing more substantial than subsidies for home insulation.”
Obviously Mr. Kloppers isn’t aware of the political situation in America when he made the statement; “We do believe that such a global initiative will eventually come..”
If we follow Mr. Kloppers, the Greens/Labor plans for a carbon tax, then we will be embracing a job-killing stealth tax and abandoning our only advantage over the rest of the world – cheap reliable power (unless we become a nuclear nation).
Is this the real agenda for those who want to put a price on carbon, and who urge us to explore “other” sources of base load energy?
Kloppers, Turnbull, Greens and Labor need to be upfront about their agenda and plans for Australia and not intellectually hide behind the crazy cult of carbon.

   1. Official thermometers are overwhelmingly in warm localities such as near air conditioner exhaust vents, buildings, concrete, tarmac, or asphalt.
   2. Officials hide the Argo data, which shows the world’s oceans are cooling.
   3. They ignore hundreds of thousands of weather balloon results that show the climate models overestimate future warming by at least 300%.
   4. Climate scientists frequently point to the last 130 years of global warming, but don’t mention the full story: the planet started warming before 1700, over a century before humans started pumping out meaningful amounts of CO2.
   5. Leading authors publish a crucial graph with a deceptive colour scheme that imitates the results they wish they’d got. Why did a leading peer-reviewed climate journal publish such a naked and childish attempt at cheating?
   6. The Russian, Chinese and Indian climate establishments, which are financially independent of the western climate establishment, are all skeptical. As are many scientists from other branches of science, and many retired climate scientists (who no longer have anything to lose by speaking their minds).
Only a fool would ignore the message in the pattern
Once one or two major news outlets start printing these photos of official thermometers near artificial heating sources, and point out the deception, the rush will be on for our elected representatives to abandon the Global Warming Crusade. No one wants to be seen to be taken in by half-truths and shameless deception. Who wants to look gullible because they didn’t ask the obvious burning questions?
Those who support conclusions based on corrupt behaviour will be seen as negligent for not having considered the serious evidence here.
Dr Evans is a scientist who was on the climate gravy train, and was horrified by what he saw. He first blew the whistle in a polite way in 2008. Too many of the world’s politicians have not yet woken up, so here he collects the worst examples of climate shenanigans and explains them powerfully in terms that any politician can understand.
These photos speak for themselves. The corruption of climate science has become so blatant, so obvious, that even non-scientists can no longer throw their hands in the air and say “I didn’t know”. You don’t need a PhD to know it is cheating to place thermometers near artificial heat sources and call it “global warming”.

For the last 20 years politicians, jet-setting bureaucrats and vested interests have been plotting how to make Climate Fools of the western world, taxing industry and consumers to fund green schemes, carbon speculators and international wealth redistribution.
The fightback by sceptical scientists and public was greatly boosted on the first Climate Fools Day when, in October 2008, British politicians passed with little dissent “The Climate Change Bill” a piece of legislation that future generations will come to accept was “the most absurd Bill that this Parliament has ever had to examine”.
Since then, sceptics all over the world have exposed the lack of evidence, the manipulation of data, the misuse of scientific process, the corruption of vested interests and the powerful influence of natural factors in climate cycles.
Despite the now discredited projections of dangerous global warming, the globe itself has continued its normal weather defining cycles such as El Nino, La Nina, the Pacific Oscillations, the powerful solar cycles and the massive ebb and flow of oceans and atmosphere. On a longer time scale there is no evidence that the globe’s long history of recurrent ice ages and violent episodes of volcanic and earthquake activity have suddenly ceased.
Unfortunately, a whole generation of Climate Fools will have to be rooted out of our parliaments before Climate Sense reigns again. We will then see the massive flood of community resources currently being wasted on windmills, solar toys, alarmist junkets, silly subsidies and climate bureaucracy more sensibly directed towards preparation for coping with the real natural cycles of heat and cold, floods and droughts, cyclones and earthquakes, vulcanism and ice ages. We will then regret the destruction of industry and wastage of real energy opportunities now taking place.

It is impossible to position temperature sensors randomly over the earth’s surface (including the 71% of ocean, and all the deserts, forests, and icecaps) and maintain it in constant condition long enough to tell if any average is increasing. Even if this were done the difference between the temperature during day and night is so great that no rational average can be derived.
Measurements at weather stations are quite unsuitable since they are not positioned representatively and they only measure maximum and minimum once a day, from which no average can be derived. They also constantly change in number, location and surroundings. Recent studies show that most of the current stations are unable to measure temperature to better than a degree or two
The assumptions of climate models are absurd. They assume the earth is flat, that the sun shines with equal intensity day and night, and the earth is in equilibrium, with the energy received equal to that emitted.
Half of the time there is no sun, where the temperature regime is quite different from the day.
No part of the earth ever is in energy equilibrium, neither is there any evidence of an overall “balance”.
It is unsurprising that such models are incapable of predicting future climate behaviour, even if this could be measured satisfactorily.
There are no representative measurements of the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide over any land surface, where “greenhouse warming” is supposed to happen.
After twenty years of study, and as expert reviewer to the IPCC from the very beginning, I can only conclude that the whole affair is a gigantic fraud.

Termites produce more carbon dioxide each year than all living things combined.
Termites alone produce ten times as much carbon dioxide as all the fossil fuels burned in the whole world in a year.
Pound for pound, the weight of all the termites in the world is greater than the total weight of humans.
Worldwide, termites may release over 150 million tons of methane gas into the atmosphere annually. In our lower atmosphere this methane then reacts to form carbon dioxide and ozone.
For every human on Earth there may be 1,000 pounds of termites.
On the average termites expel gas composed of about 59% nitrogen, 21% hydrogen, 9% carbon dioxide, 7% methane, and 4% oxygen.
There are 2,600 different species of termites, and it is estimated that there are at least a million billion individual termites on Earth, that they emit two and four percent of the global carbon dioxide and methane budget, respectively-both mediated directly or indirectly by their microbes.
The Science magazine reports that termites annually generate more than twice as much carbon dioxide as mankind does burning fossil fuels. One termite species annually emits 600,000 metric tons of formic acid into the atmosphere, an amount equal to the combined contributions of automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation.

In June 1982, Tasmania’s Parliament passed legislation approving the development of the Gordon-below-Franklin (GBF) scheme for a dam and 300 MW power station which would have generated annually well over 10 million MW hours of electricity, costing then only about 2 cents per KW hour.
The scheme was supported by Tasmanians and passed by both Houses of their Parliament. Construction commenced.
Tasmania’s Dr Bob Brown opposed the scheme based on the false assumption that the scenic Rock Island Bend would be flooded and therefore unseen by canoeists down the river. But this site would have been above the dam water level.
Then Dr Brown circulated a picture of Rock Island Bend, taken by Peter Dombrovski, and a false statement by the Tasmanian Wilderness Society which deluded the public into believing that the scheme should be abandoned. This caused the Federal Government Labor Party to refer the matter to the High Court, where three judges supported and three judges opposed the scheme. However, the seventh judge, Senator Lionel Murphy, opposed it. This enabled the Federal Government to use its External Powers to stop the scheme with the result that all this valuable water flows out to the sea.
The scheme would have obtained most of its water discharged from the Gordon Power Station, powered by water from the Lake Pedder and Gordon Dams which have a capacity of 16 million cubic meters (over three times the capacity of Snowy Hydro’s Lake Eucumbene). There is usually little flow from the Franklin River.
The GBF scheme is very economical and environmentally sound and is well worth supporting. It should be built regardless of the High Court decision and the possibility that it might lie within a World Heritage listed area.
I am deeply concerned by the damage, deliberately inflicted by Dr Bob Brown. To me, Dr Brown should be made to pay for the damage he has caused.

PS This ‘blockage’ resulted in the Federal Government having to provide about $500 million for other more costly hydro-electric schemes.

From: Hal Lewis, University of California, Santa Barbara
To: Curtis G. Callan, Jr., Princeton University, President of the American Physical Society
6 October 2010
Dear Curt:
When I first joined the American Physical Society sixty-seven years ago it was much smaller, much gentler, and as yet uncorrupted by the money flood (a threat against which Dwight Eisenhower warned a half-century ago).
Indeed, the choice of physics as a profession was then a guarantor of a life of poverty and abstinence—it was World War II that changed all that. The prospect of worldly gain drove few physicists. As recently as thirty-five years ago, when I chaired the first APS study of a contentious social/scientific issue, The Reactor Safety Study, though there were zealots aplenty on the outside there was no hint of inordinate pressure on us as physicists. We were therefore able to produce what I believe was and is an honest appraisal of the situation at that time. We were further enabled by the presence of an oversight committee consisting of Pief Panofsky, Vicki Weisskopf, and Hans Bethe, all towering physicists beyond reproach. I was proud of what we did in a charged atmosphere. In the end the oversight committee, in its report to the APS President, noted the complete independence in which we did the job, and predicted that the report would be attacked from both sides. What greater tribute could there be?

How different it is now. The giants no longer walk the earth, and the money flood has become the raison d’être of much physics research, the vital sustenance of much more, and it provides the support for untold numbers of professional jobs. For reasons that will soon become clear my former pride at being an APS Fellow all these years has been turned into shame, and I am forced, with no pleasure at all, to offer you my resignation from the Society.
It is of course, the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, and has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist. Anyone who has the faintest doubt that this is so should force himself to read the ClimateGate documents, which lay it bare. (Montford’s book organizes the facts very well.) I don’t believe that any real physicist, nay scientist, can read that stuff without revulsion. I would almost make that revulsion a definition of the word scientist.
So what has the APS, as an organization, done in the face of this challenge? It has accepted the corruption as the norm, and gone along with it. For example:
1. About a year ago a few of us sent an e-mail on the subject to a fraction of the membership. APS ignored the issues, but the then President immediately launched a hostile investigation of where we got the e-mail addresses. In its better days, APS used to encourage discussion of important issues, and indeed the Constitution cites that as its principal purpose. No more. Everything that has been done in the last year has been designed to silence debate
2. The appallingly tendentious APS statement on Climate Change was apparently written in a hurry by a few people over lunch, and is certainly not representative of the talents of APS members as I have long known them. So a few of us petitioned the Council to reconsider it. One of the outstanding marks of (in)distinction in the Statement was the poison word incontrovertible, which describes few items in physics, certainly not this one. In response APS appointed a secret committee that never met, never troubled to speak to any skeptics, yet endorsed the Statement in its entirety. (They did admit that the tone was a bit strong, but amazingly kept the poison word incontrovertible to describe the evidence, a position supported by no one.) In the end, the Council kept the original statement, word for word, but approved a far longer “explanatory” screed, admitting that there were uncertainties, but brushing them aside to give blanket approval to the original. The original Statement, which still stands as the APS position, also contains what I consider pompous and asinine advice to all world governments, as if the APS were master of the universe. It is not, and I am embarrassed that our leaders seem to think it is. This is not fun and games, these are serious matters involving vast fractions of our national substance, and the reputation of the Society as a scientific society is at stake.
3. In the interim the ClimateGate scandal broke into the news, and the machinations of the principal alarmists were revealed to the world. It was a fraud on a scale I have never seen, and I lack the words to describe its enormity. Effect on the APS position: none. None at all. This is not science; other forces are at work.
4. So a few of us tried to bring science into the act (that is, after all, the alleged and historic purpose of APS), and collected the necessary 200+ signatures to bring to the Council a proposal for a Topical Group on Climate Science, thinking that open discussion of the scientific issues, in the best tradition of physics, would be beneficial to all, and also a contribution to the nation. I might note that it was not easy to collect the signatures, since you denied us the use of the APS membership list. We conformed in every way with the requirements of the APS Constitution, and described in great detail what we had in mind—simply to bring the subject into the open.
5. To our amazement, Constitution be damned, you declined to accept our petition, but instead used your own control of the mailing list to run a poll on the members’ interest in a TG on Climate and the Environment. You did ask the members if they would sign a petition to form a TG on your yet-to-be-defined subject, but provided no petition, and got lots of affirmative responses. (If you had asked about sex you would have gotten more expressions of interest.) There was of course no such petition or proposal, and you have now dropped the Environment part, so the whole matter is moot. (Any lawyer will tell you that you cannot collect signatures on a vague petition, and then fill in whatever you like.) The entire purpose of this exercise was to avoid your constitutional responsibility to take our petition to the Council.
6. As of now you have formed still another secret and stacked committee to organize your own TG, simply ignoring our lawful petition.
APS management has gamed the problem from the beginning, to suppress serious conversation about the merits of the climate change claims. Do you wonder that I have lost confidence in the organization?
I do feel the need to add one note, and this is conjecture, since it is always risky to discuss other people’s motives. This scheming at APS HQ is so bizarre that there cannot be a simple explanation for it. Some have held that the physicists of today are not as smart as they used to be, but I don’t think that is an issue. I think it is the money, exactly what Eisenhower warned about a half-century ago. There are indeed trillions of dollars involved, to say nothing of the fame and glory (and frequent trips to exotic islands) that go with being a member of the club. Your own Physics Department (of which you are chairman) would lose millions a year if the global warming bubble burst. When Penn State absolved Mike Mann of wrongdoing, and the University of East Anglia did the same for Phil Jones, they cannot have been unaware of the financial penalty for doing otherwise. As the old saying goes, you don’t have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing. Since I am no philosopher, I’m not going to explore at just which point enlightened self-interest crosses the line into corruption, but a careful reading of the ClimateGate releases makes it clear that this is not an academic question.
I want no part of it, so please accept my resignation. APS no longer represents me, but I hope we are still friends.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/09/30/coal-or-crops/,,Coal or Crops,"The Queensland Government is proposing to create a new category of restricted land use called “Strategic Cropping Land”, which is reserved for “cropping” and closed to almost every other type of land development. This would create No-Go zones covering as much as 4% of Queensland, representing an area more than twice the size of Holland and including many areas likely to contain the mineral and energy resources for tomorrow.
This proposal will affect every landowner and every rural industry in some way, almost all negatively, but its most immediate effect will be on landowners and coal explorers.

It was a blatant example of the ABC’s push to establish a carbon tax. But Flannery himself revealed what it is all about  – controlling human populations everywhere.
It is about “changing human nature”.
For instance Dim Tim assured the audience that free markets are the most dangerous spin off from Darwinism. He assured us that markets have to regulated. Free markets allowed some people to become very very rich, but this was at the expense of the rest of the population. He is not in favour of abolishing markets, but, he insists they must be intelligently regulated.
On the subject of climate change he assured the audience that “Yes, there will be a cost to suppressing Carbon, but it is absolutely necessary.”
One of Tim’s heroes is James Lovelock, the creator of the Gaia hypothesis. Lovelock told the Guardian earlier this year that “democracy must be  put on hold” to combat global warming and that “a few people with  authority” should be allowed to run the planet.
Tim’s manner very positively indicates to us that he will be one of the chosen few to organise and run society.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/09/04/cropping-land/,,Strategic Cropping Land Bans,"The Queensland State Government has announced a plan to create a new category of restricted land called “Strategic Cropping Land” which bans mining or development. This could blight 4% of Queensland, representing an area more than twice the size of Holland and including many areas likely to contain the mineral and energy resources for tomorrow.
Farmers should not celebrate this cynical move by an anti-farming state government to pepper Queensland with more restrictions on their land titles.

The justification is “to secure food security for future generations”. It is just another phase in the war on carbon fuels aimed at preventing development of new coal mines and power stations in Australia. It is more about Green ideology than about concern about farmers or food.
If Queensland’s politicians were really concerned about food security they would not have sterilised millions of acres of grazing land under scrub clearing bans, conservation zones, heritage areas, national parks and other anti-farming bans.
Nor would they have encouraged the diversion of cropping land from producing food for humans to producing ethanol for cars; or used false global warming dogma to justify covering food producing land with feral forests of carbon credit trees.
The policy that allows tenures for exploration, mining, gas, geothermal, carbon sequestration, vegetation preservation and heritage protection to be imposed without agreement on freehold land (and on one another) is a bad policy guaranteed to create friction between overlapping tenure holders. Cropping land bans just add to the complexity and the problems.
Farmers will soon realise the liability generated by these new blots on their land title. No longer can farmers look forward to the possibility of selling their land for far more than its cropping value to a coal developer. Nor can they retire and subdivide the land which represents their life savings. And any other developments on their blighted land will be banned or difficult. Imagine the obstacles should they want to develop a race horse stud, a feed lot, a new house or a private forest? Farmers will be condemned to be pastoral peasants on cropping land controlled forever, paddock by paddock, by an anti-farming, anti-mining bureaucracy. Landowners, not bureaucrats, should decide what happens on freehold land.
And their children will be forced to move away to get jobs. Exploration and mining are the keys to unsubsidised decentralisation and regional development. Roads, railways, ports, regional towns and local jobs always follow mine developments. Future job growth will be confined to the bureaucracy in Brisbane.
Imagine if politicians of the pioneering era had banned prospectors from “strategic wool, wheat or cattle country” – there would be no towns at Mount Isa, Charters Towers, Weipa, Ravenshoe, Herberton, Stanthorpe, Mt Morgan, Gympie, Chillagoe, Ipswich, Blair Athol, Collinsville, Moura, Moranbah, Glenden, Dysart, Middlemount or Blackwater; far poorer roads, railways, ports and regional cities; and fewer taxfunded hospitals, roads, schools, stadiums and politicians’ palaces in Brisbane.
These foolish bans will not last. As soon as current coal mines start to close and the flow of coal taxes and royalties to governments diminishes, “Strategic cropping land” will suddenly be reclassified as “Projects of State Significance”. But other generations will be the beneficiaries.
Mineral explorers have also been robbed. They were granted exploration licences by the same State Government, have spent money exploring them, and the value of their permits has now been destroyed or devalued. Who is going to pay compensation for the destruction of both farming and exploration assets? The hidden tragedy is that we will never know which wheat paddock is underlain by a treasure house of coal or minerals.
One group, Big Coal, will be quietly pleased by the new restrictions.
Producing coal mines with many years of reserves in established mining leases will benefit as small coal explorers are denied access to prospective exploration land in new areas. Well developed mines in the Bowen Basin will survive until current resources are exhausted, but new mines in the Surat and Galilee Basins will struggle to become established. Australia’s international competitors in the coal business (Indonesia, Mongolia, Canada, South Africa and USA) will also be delighted with our green puppets in Parliament.
Deep Green and Big Coal have had a Big Win.
Farmers, coal explorers, energy consumers and regional jobs will be Big Losers.

Allan Duffy (Press and Journal, August 26), makes a number of assertions and claims which invite challenge.
First, there are far more than a “small number of people” opposing “windfarm sites”.
Second, the cause of this opposition is about more than the potential impact on tourism.
And, finally, they will never generate “excess power” that can be sold to the national grid to enhance Scotland’s economy.
Much of the opposition to windmills relates to their inability to produce electricity when required, combined with their negligible impact on CO emissions because of the expensive associated need for “spinning” back-up from conventional CO-emitting generators.
In his time in Germany, Mr Duffy may have noted that, for all their thousands of windmills, the Germans have not shut down one conventional power station and, in fact, are having to build new coal-fired power stations to meet demand.
If he were to look at the NETA (New Electricity Trading Arrangements) website, he would see that, with all the windmills at present operating in the UK, wind contributes only about 0.1-2% of daily national demand.
Yes, renewable energy must be a component of our future energy mix, but unreliable and expensive windmills are not the answer.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/08/23/oil-spills/,,OIL SPILLS – Myth & Reality,"This paper provides a factual and objective view of the reality of the effects of some of the world’s greatest oil spills.  It particularly deals with the geography of the region in which the spill occurred, the climatic effects on the spill, the probable volume oil spilled, the cleanup actions that followed and the long-term environmental effects.
As an introduction, Part 1 of the paper deals with some of the commonly held beliefs that the world is about to run out of fossil fuels, that oil spills and leaks are universally ‘environmental catastrophes’ and challenges the long term view that the effects are persistent and adverse to the environment.  The seemingly endless alarmism that follows each spill is highlighted and the reader is asked to read the remainder of the paper with an open mind, comparing the predictions of doom with the evidence revealed by the reality of hindsight.
It is concluded that the effects of the relatively few spills that have occurred have been exceptionally exaggerated for political purposes by both politicians and environmental activists.  Both these alarmist cliques loudly report claims in every case that go far beyond the actual effect of the spill itself.  Some of the unfortunate claims by scientists are also exposed as political activism unrelated to scientific method.
Finally the paper provides a ‘prophesy’ (based on the history of previous spills) as to the long-term results and effects of the recent BP Macondo Well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico that commenced on 20th April 2010 and was capped on 29th July 2010, 100 days later.

In fact the fisheries recovered quickly because they were relieved of fishing pressure, and locals swapped low paying fishing jobs for high paying cleanup or oil industry jobs. As in all spills, the biggest loser was the well owner.

Part 5: The BP Macondo Well Blowout, Gulf of Mexico, 2010.  This may be the second largest man made oil spill in history, and at times the slick covered 6,500 sq km. However about 74% of the oil lost evaporated, dissolved, bio-degraded, or was burned, skimmed or captured. Just 5 days after the leak was plugged, the US government agreed that the oil was no longer a problem. Once more the damage was forecast to be catastrophic, once more it was not. The Gulf of Mexico copes with natural leaks of this size every year. The real costs were political and losses by BP shareholders.

In 2009, President Obama’s Chief of Staff, Rohm Emanuel said: “Never let a serious crisis go to waste… it’s an opportunity to do things you couldn’t do before.” The recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was a marvellous crisis used by the Obama administration and extreme environmentalists to weaken Big Oil, demonise carbon fuels, and drive the so-called “clean fuel” agenda. Foreign oil producers and the green energy promoters are the beneficiaries. Innocent local businesses and BP were the victims, both of the oil spill but more so of the government actions designed to benefit from the crisis.

More recently, Hitler invaded Eastern Europe and Russia in the search for “living space” and access to Black Sea oil and Japan went to war attracted by the resources of South East Asia and Australia.

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that to waste taxpayer funds helping foreign car manufacturers to produce cars that consumers don’t want is bad policy.
“Worse still is a policy that encourages people to trash a roadworthy car and buy a trendy new one they do not need.”
Forbes explained:
“To collect, transport and scrap one car and build and deliver another one costs a lot in money, metals, and energy.
 “These misguided policies benefit car manufacturers, car dealers, car financiers and some consumers. Everyone else, including the environment, is a loser.
“None of the so called green cars are really green.
“Electric motors, compressed air motors and hydrogen “fuel” are promoted as clean and green, but none of them are sources of energy. All of them need conventional electric power to provide their stored energy.
“Electric cars must fill their batteries from a power point. Compressed air cars must fill their tanks from a compressor which probably uses electricity. And a hydrogen car, if one ever appears, must fill its tank from a refinery using heaps of electricity to produce hydrogen from water or hydrocarbons.
“And where will the electricity come from? In Australia right now 93% of electricity comes from combustion of hydrocarbons such as coal, gas and oil. That will not change dramatically or quickly without putting the lights out. And a dramatic switch to “green” cars plus bans and taxes on hydrocarbon energy increases the chance of that.
“Electric cars are nifty and quiet, and may reduce harmful concentrations of hot exhaust gases in city air, but in Australia they will run mainly on carbon fuel. There will be zero reduction in the production of carbon dioxide (as if that matters anyway).
“The market is the best judge whether diesel, hybrid, electric, petrol or compressed air cars are used. The answer will vary from family to family and from city to country.
“For too long governments have been throwing subsidies at foreign car companies and “green” car buyers. Now they are pushing low cost cars out of the market with their “big bucks for old bombs” giveaway.
“Subsidies always encourage waste of the subsidised product – it is not a sustainable policy. The marginal savings in fuel consumption will never compensate for this extravagance.
“Green car subsidies are dud policies and should be subject to an immediate recall notice.”

The Federal Government may have dumped (technically deferred) one nutty green scheme (emissions trading) but an equally nutty scheme remains in place – requiring electricity distributors to buy green electricity.
This scheme is nutty because no one has shown that green electricity supplied to an operating power network actually reduces emissions. The government, various green lobby groups and the mass of voters have simply assumed that it does. There are doubts about efficiency losses due to the whole network having to be retailored to accommodate renewables. And more doubts over just how much additional backup generator capacity will be required for intermittent power sources. These doubts are either ignored or dismissed as “myths”.
…
The Australian government has dived head-first into renewables with both eyes shut, and with the general approval of the voters, who mostly have no idea of what they have approved or how much it will cost. The government should drop the whole renewable energy scheme as too complicated and expensive and unlikely to save much carbon.

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that those calling for a “Price on Carbon” should speak the truth and call it a “Tax on the Production of Carbon Dioxide”.
“Similarly the CPRS (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) had nothing to do with pollution but everything to do with imposing taxes and rationing on economic activity.”
Forbes explained:
“The new green mantra chants: “We need a price on carbon”.
“Carbon is the most useful substance on earth and there is already a price on every product containing carbon – coal and oil, bread and butter, beef and bacon, oil and ethanol, beer and whisky, coffee and tea, cotton and wool, diesel and fire wood, methane and carbon dioxide, petrol and rubber – all are carbon products with an established market price.
“Those who chatter about “a price on carbon” are hiding their real aim which is to reduce human activity by taxing the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Office of Fair Trading should be investigating this deceptive election advertising.
“If this tax attempted to cover all releases of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere it would indeed be “A Monster New Tax”.
“Every man and beast, every car and train, every ship and plane, every cement plant and blast furnace, every power station using coal, oil or gas, every wood stove and gas barbeque, every swamp and termite nest – all emit carbon dioxide and thus recycle carbon. Carbon feeds, powers and clothes our world. Any attempt to stop that is suicidal.
“Every producer of carbon products is already taxed – income tax and payroll tax, royalties and resource rent tax, excise and levies, permits and quotas.
“Another carbon tax would just add to the costs of everything, increase poverty, bloat the bureaucracy and send more jobs to China. The only people promoting more taxes on carbon are the anti-growth crowd and the vested interests in the alternate energy promoters. 
“We didn’t want the deceitfully labelled Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and we don’t want a new tax labelled “A Price on Carbon”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/07/18/sunset-for-subsidies/,,Sunset for Subsidies,"While Australia is increasing expenditure of consumer and taxpayer money to the renewables industry, governments around the world have decided that “enough is enough”.
Other countries are realising that renewable energy is a massive waste of tax payer funds and has zero or negligible effect on CO2 emissions. They are thus cutting or eliminating subsidies to the grossly inefficient green power generators.
Here are some recently reported examples:
Spain cuts subsidies to wind and solar:

Here are a few examples of the ways in which Australian state and federal Governments subsidise or give unfair advantage to renewables:

Bans on nuclear power
Renewable Energy Targets
Renewable Energy Certificates
Feed in Tariffs
Direct government subsidies for renewable energy
Tax and other incentives
Cost of the electricity grid enhancements that are needed to accommodate the disruptive, erratic renewable energy generators is shared by everyone instead of being attributed to the renewable energy generators.
Super Profits Tax on coal mining.
Threats to shut down or in other ways disadvantage coal fired power plants without fair compensation for the investors.

Either this tax, or the government, will go. This was a desperate grab for money to fund all the silly stimulus packages and the continuing handouts to the Climate Change Industry. It is also a grab to centralise more control of resources in Canberra.
While the Super Tax would slash mining jobs and the value of super funds, it is minor compared to the large, insidious and long term damage that is already being done, and could still become far worse in the misguided war on carbon.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/06/03/tree-growth-near-power-stations/,,Tree Growth Near Power Stations,"I am a director of an innovative company, Aust Pacific Forest Management (APFM) which has developed and patented the world’s first mechanical pruner for plantation trees. To grow knot free timber which has significantly greater value than knotty planks, the lower storey must be pruned to maintain the knotty core at around 100 mm diameter. To date this has to be done with hand tools, a hazardous and tedious operation in which it takes a day for 1 man to prune 100 trees. Our pruning head can trim 2,000 trees in one 8 hour shift, with surgical precision such that the bark of the tree is undamaged. The testing on the pruning head was done some 5 years ago using 100 trees given to us by Queensland Forestry as thinnings from their pine plantations near the Tarong Power Station in south-east Queensland. Fortunately 50 of these trees were taken from an area within a few kilometres from the power station, and the other from near the township of Blackbutt 15 to 20 km distant from the power station.
An interesting observation in revisiting these forestry sites was finding proof that trees in the vicinity of the coal-fired power station are growing more vigorously than similar trees 15 km away. The plantations in both locations had been established for 10 years, would have experienced a similar climate history, and the soil at the 15 km distant location looked quite rich compared to the soil near the power station. We measured the breast height circumference of a number of typical trees at both locations, and found that on average, over 200% more timber growth had occurred in the trees close to the power station as compared to those furthest from this significant source of carbon dioxide. APFM has a record of the measurements taken and photographs of the trees in both areas, and although this is far from a controlled scientific experiment, the huge difference in timber volume between the two locations is quite remarkable and consistent with other scientific reports where plants are grown in controlled greenhouse conditions.
All of our library research and investigations into greenhouse conditions using carbon dioxide enriched air, together with various reports, lead us to conclude carbon dioxide, a gas which is heavier than air, is best left to flow into the forests to encourage plant growth. All of your excellent research and conclusions from many other reputable groups also leads to the conclusion that man-made carbon dioxide is only beneficial to life on earth, and that efforts to trap and store this gas are a colossal waste of time and money.
We are therefore examining ways to introduce carbon dioxide from coal-fired power stations not only into the forests, but into croplands to enhance food productivity.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/06/03/coal-combustion/,,"Coal, Combustion and the Grand Carbon Cycle","Carbon is the most valuable and amazing element on our living planet.
It is the building block of all life on earth, and has provided the food, clothing and most of the energy for every human for all of our history.
Yet carbon is being subjected to an unprecedented campaign of demonization focussed on man’s production of carbon dioxide. The main aim of this campaign is to cripple or eliminate the coal industry because combustion of coal produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide the key link in the cycle of life on earth.
Most people understand the biological carbon cycle – plants using solar energy extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, converting it to sugars and proteins, and returning oxygen to the atmosphere. Plant material, directly or indirectly, provides food for all animals. In the process of digesting carbon food, animals extract oxygen from the atmosphere to digest their carbon foods, producing carbon dioxide which is then returned to the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide means more plant growth. This is a sustainable self regulating process.
But there is an even bigger, Grand Carbon Cycle, also involving carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere by volcanoes, natural and man-made combustion of carbon fuels such as wood, coal and oil, and out-gassing from oceans during warm climatic eras. This carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by biological and chemical extractions into the oceans to form corals, shell fish and massive deposits of limestone, dolomite and magnesite on the ocean floor. In some eras, large quantities of plant material are also locked away in enormous deposits of lignite and coal. During cool climate eras, oceans also take up huge quantities of carbon dioxide into solution.
Vulcanism and combustion are helpful processes returning valuable carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Without them, earth’s precious carbon supplies would slowly become interred and locked away in massive buried deposits of carbon bearing materials such as limestone and coal.
The products of combustion of all carbon fuels are normal and natural components of the atmosphere, and essential nutrients for all life.
This paper looks at the compositions of solid carbon fuels, the process of coal combustion, the exhaust products produced, and the benefits and pollution potential of those exhaust products.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/05/31/green-shoes-and-carbon/,,New Green Shoes from Nike – Thank God for Carbon,"So Nike is now making green shoes to be a fashion statement about our carbon footprint.
I bet that the shoes are made of carbon like nearly every product man has ever produced including all clothing, whether natural or synthetic. Even when the good Lord (whether you think that is God, Gaia or Lady Chance) made life, carbon was used to do it, whether to make plants or animals. Even our DNA is made of carbon compounds, as is every part of every living thing.
If any element is to be declared sacred, it has to be carbon, considering the variety of its forms (allotropes), its great versatility and its adaptability. Carbon is used to make more compounds (especially organic compounds) than all other elements combined. We are not just made of carbon, but we actually eat it (carbo-hydrate) for energy. We depend on it to cook our food, to build our houses, to make our cars and other machinery (steel is made of iron and carbon) and to power them. If we need  electrical insulation, we use a carbon product, and if we need a good conductor we also find it in a carbon product. We use carbon products to conduct heat or to insulate against heat. Not just life, but civilization, industrialization and modern communication networks could not exist without carbon just as our lives could not exist without the fourth most common element in the universe. 
To demonize and make war on carbon is to demonize and make war on life itself.  Since our very brains are not only made of carbon, but fuelled by carbon (mostly in the form of glucose), it is strange that thinking, conscious carbon should now turn around to make war on itself.
Our citizens as well as our school children have been so brainwashed by this anti-carbon/anti-human propaganda that many of them really think of carbon in terms of some ugly, black, toxic pollutant that now requires a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Neither carbon or carbon-dioxide is a pollutant, but they are absolutely as natural and as fundamental to life as oxygen and hydrogen. Carbon is not just a girl’s best friend (diamonds are pure carbon) but carbon is life’s best friend.
Thank God for carbon!

These modern fools of Mother Earth and modern Environmentalism want to return to the yesteryears of cave dwelling pre-human existence. All I’ve ever read about pre-modern living, and that’s not all too long ago, just 100 years ago. Most men died before the age of 50 years. Children died by the thousands because of infections, and poor health quality. You were considered old when you were over 40!

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/05/03/taxing-the-outback/,,Taxing the Outback,"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that the Rudd Resource tax was just another in a long line of taxes helping to depopulate rural Australia.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that depopulation of the outback started with the fringe benefits tax and the removal of accelerated depreciation, both of which penalise companies who provide housing for employees.
“Every government since then has accelerated the drift to the coastal and capital cities.
“The heavy burdens of excessive fuel taxes, coal royalties, rail freights and infrastructure bottlenecks have for years restricted the development of the outback resource industry. Only deposits that are rich or close to the coast can pay their way, which is why the Galilee Basin has been undeveloped for so long.
“The vegetation control bans, water mismanagement and growth of carbon credit forests are depressing agriculture and will depopulate rural towns.
“Humans and their industries are also prohibited from vast areas of our land and sea sterilised by a confusing mixture of exclusion zones. And the lack and high cost of outback infrastructure has fed the fly-in mentality of industry and governments.
“Had the money wasted just on roof insulation been spent on new infrastructure, Australia would be a more decentralised and productive place.
“The climate alarmists urge still more carbon taxes and force the usage of expensive alternative energy. All outback industry relies almost totally on carbon fuels for motive power. None of our quad bikes, cars, trucks, road trains, tractors, dozers, trains, planes or ships are powered by solar panels or wind turbines – they need diesel, petrol, gas and electricity (from coal). And our biggest outback industries are focussed on exploring, developing, supplying or transporting carbon products. Coal, gas, oil, beef, sheep, dairy and timber are all threatened by more carbon taxes.
“The Rudd Resource tax is yet another centralising force, depressing outback industry and stimulating the population of drones around the government honey pots in Canberra. It increases the risk that the belated rush to build infrastructure will leave new trains without freight and new ports without ships.

by Mark Lawson
There is some evidence from power grids overseas about the use of wind and alternative power on a large scale and, as far as alternative energy advocates are concerned, none of it is good.
Wind advocates can point to a number of studies saying that 20 per cent penetration of wind energy will increase wholesale electricity costs by 10 per cent. This implies that wind energy is 50 per cent more expensive than conventional, but a closer look shows that the studies are theoretical and don’t say anything about how much carbon would be saved. It is a safe bet that 20 per cent penetration will not result in 20 per cent savings, and some reason for thinking that it might not result in any saving at all.

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that even though the Ration-N-Tax Scheme is on ice, Governments are still wasting billions of dollars to create an artificial global warming industry.
“As an example, the Australian government is spending $800 million per year on climate change research and probably more on carbon geo-sequestration. And every state has its own bloated climate change and energy bureaucracies.
“Next we are promised the “Mother of all Renewable Energy Schemes” to cost untold billions.
“There is no doubt that some enlightened or distressed future government will have the distasteful job of taking the well chewed subsidy bones off these greedy and unstainable industry dogs.
“There is no evidence that man is causing global warming, no evidence that the natural warming we have experienced is dangerous or even unusual, and no chance that politicians can control the climate.
“It is thus essential that every piece of global warming legislation is subjected to an annual cost-benefit analysis and a sunset clause which triggers repeal within five years, or sooner once it becomes obvious to all that man-made global warming is not a problem.
“Such a cautionary clause is needed to warn investors and promoters relying on subsidies, market mandates, tax benefits, ethanol subsidies, carbon credits, renewable energy targets or research grants that unsustainable industries are high risk and can only create sub-prime assets.

But never has the government conducted an open public enquiry to test the truth of this statement. Instead they have relied on an increasingly discredited political body, the UN’s IPCC, or on their own paid employees (who have learned the dangers of contradicting the message of powerful politicians.)”

The current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about 386 ppm. In this experiment, one plant-growing chamber had 450 ppm carbon dioxide, the level at which we are told will cause the world to tip into runaway global warming. The other chamber had carbon dioxide at 1270 ppm, a level most nurseries would prefer to have, and the level at which much life on earth evolved it.
See for yourself the dramatic increase in plant growth we could expect from a carbon-rich atmosphere. The well fed plant weighed 44% more than the starved one, with greater height, more leaves and far more roots. This plant not only grew faster and better, its better root system would make it more drought and heat tolerant.
Yet Penny Wong and the alarmists want us to believe carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and more of it would be a disaster!  
Why are CSIRO and our many Departments of Agriculture so silent on this fundamental issue?
Are they all cowed, or are their well paid jobs more important than revealing the truth?

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/03/26/earth-hour-2010/,,Earth Hour or Blackout Night?,"A statement by Viv Forbes, Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition.
27 March 2010
The Carbon Sense Coalition today said that Earth Hour should be renamed “Blackout Night” and be held outdoors, for the whole night, in mid-winter, on the shortest and coldest day of the year – 22 June in the Southern Hemisphere.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that all supporters of alternative energy should spend just one night in the cold and the dark, emitting no carbon dioxide from coal, oil, gas, petrol or diesel for lights, TV, hot coffee, barbecues or cars. This will be good practice for the blackouts and shortages to come if Penny Wong’s rationing of carbon products and carbon energy is attempted.
“Winter nights are usually still and cold, so the candles crew can experience what it was like depending on alternate energy in the recent snowstorms in the Northern Hemisphere when wind turbines froze and solar panels were covered in snow. The back-to-nature brigade can also try living without iron roofs and concrete walls, both of which require coal and emit carbon dioxide during their production.
“To hold a candles-and-champagne party indoors, on the mildest night of the year, for just one hour, shows that the whole thing is green tokenism. Moreover both candles and champagne emit carbon dioxide. Let the true believers try the real thing in one of the extreme seasons so they can appreciate the great benefits we take for granted when using all of our carbon fuels and foods.
“Instead of sneering at human achievements they should salute the people who keep the lights on for the other 364 days of the year.
“Our salute will be to turn on every light on our property, and we urge all supporters to do the same.
“Australia gets almost 90% of its electricity from hydrocarbon fuels – black coal, brown coal, gas and oil. If the German Greens close their coal and nuclear power they can fall back on gas from Russia, nuclear power from France or hydro from Scandinavia when the lights go out.
“Australia has no prudent neighbours to bludge on if we gamble our future electricity needs on sunbeams, sea breezes and ceiling insulation. If we attempt the massive cuts in carbon dioxide emissions demanded by the deep greens we will see Australia headed for the Romanian power rationing experience – during the Ceaucescu regime in Romania, each house was limited to ONE 25 watt bulb for all of their light.
“All over the world we have aging power stations and an orchestrated campaign by a few warm and well-fed agitators to harass, delay and deter construction of new power facilities.
“Such a campaign can only have one result – many ‘Earth Night’ blackouts are assured.
“So we support ‘Blackout Night’ to prepare our population for the dark days ahead.

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/03/23/grass-is-green/,,Carbon Sense Newsletter: Grass is also Green,"You may have heard of Peter Spencer, the desperate Australian farmer who went on a hunger strike to draw attention to the fact that government bans on clearing vegetation had stolen his assets and destroyed his business. Peter is just one of many Australian farm families reduced to desperation and even suicide by seizure or sterilisation of their land to satisfy the voracious green god.
The most massive injustice occurred a couple of years ago, when, as a sacrifice to the Kyoto god, the federal government conspired with state governments to ban vegetation clearing on all property, even freehold.  This was done in an underhand way to allow the government to seize carbon credits from landowners without paying compensation.
Many well meaning people, while not happy with the tactics and the refusal to pay compensation for property seized or devalued, think that there will be some environmental or climate benefits to come from all this.
Generally there are none.
Even if extraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was a good idea (and it isn’t), no tree can keep extracting it on a long term basis. Every living thing (including trees, grass, cows and humans) borrows carbon from the environment as it grow, stops extracting it at maturity, and hands the valuable carbon back to the environment when it dies and the body rots. Net life time extraction equals ZERO. It is absolute scientific nonsense to believe that trees can have a long term effect on so called greenhouse gases. Like everything politicians touch, short term appearances and secret agendas are preferred to long term reality.
Banning the clearing of scrub regrowth in our grasslands is also a backward step environmentally. Everyone can see and understand tree forests, but no one appreciates the grass forests beneath their feet. Natural fires created our grasslands long before humans occupied Australia. They are valuable environmental landscapes far more important to humans than the stupid carbon credit forests and eucalypt weeds now invading them.  With closer settlement and excessive areas locked up by governments, fires no longer protect our grasslands and landowners must use machinery to maintain their grass. Preventing this is like telling a market gardener he is not allowed to chip weeds invading his vegetable patch. Every landowner tries to guard the long term value of his land. No one has a monopoly on knowledge on how to do it. Some properties may need more trees, some less – if more trees are a benefit, landowners will grow them without coercion.
Does anyone seriously believe that a few green politicians and activists can devise one dictatorial land plan for every property from Longreach to Wagga and then use legal bludgeons, land confiscation and a desk bound bureaucracy to enforce the co-operation of landowners?
The Senate is currently carrying out an enquiry into some aspects of this massive land mismanagement. It is a bigger scandal than the home insulation scheme, and few politicians are free of blame. The Senate will be surprised at the injustices that will be revealed by this enquiry.
The Carbon Sense Coalition has (in some haste) made a Submission to this enquiry. We urge you to read it and print it out for friends.  See it at:

Even if you don’t read it, open it and look at the pictures.
We must not let them sweep all this under the table again. We need your help to get this short note to every landowner, every media outlet and every politician. Please help us spread it around.

Media Release
21st March 2010
Can’t see the Grass for the Trees?
The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on the Australian Parliament to repeal the vegetation clearing bans before Australia’s productive grasslands are lost to woody weeds.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the Kyoto bans were introduced deviously by state governments acting as stooges for the federal government to deprive landowners of potential carbon credits without paying compensation.
“Now they are creating a growing public liability as trees invade ancestral grasslands.
“Every continent in the world had vast native grasslands, often treeless, kept free of trees by lightning fires, and supporting huge populations of herbivores and their dependent predators. The treeless Prairies supported bison and antelope; the Pampas supported deer and camelids; the Veldts supported wildebeest, zebra and antelopes; and Australia’s grasslands supported kangaroos and emus.
“Trees and grasses are in continual competition for soil space and access to solar energy. Old journals, diaries, sketches and photos can attest the fact that there are now more trees in Australian grasslands than there were 100 years ago. Some properties can document the substantial tree invasion even since the first aerial photos were taken in the 1950’s. This invasion has accelerated since governments started meddling in vegetation control.
“Human settlers, both black and white, have learned that fires were essential to re-invigorate the grasslands and control their invasion by trees. But with closer settlement, there are reduced opportunities to use fires to control trees and landowners must use machinery to protect their grass.
“White settlement in Australia has brought two major changes to vegetation. Firstly, in the forests and scrubs along the coast, timber getters and small selectors cleared the fertile soil for crops and farms. Human development and infrastructure ensure that these forests seldom recovered. Secondly, scrubby regrowth and trees have invaded much of the grassland and open forest.
“If governments want to turn back the vegetation clock, they should be removing towns, roads, railways, schools, orchards, housing developments, cultivation and market gardens from the once forested coastal areas to allow coastal forests to re-establish. But this would lose too many votes, so they advocate accelerated destruction of our ancient grasslands. Their hope is that this will gain more votes from tree huggers than will be lost from grass farmers, where there are few votes to lose.
“Today the grasslands support domesticated grazing animals and farms of cultivated grasses and legumes that are essential food sources for humans. Invasion of Australia’s grasslands by eucalypt weeds is destroying our ability to produce food, which will show up in the cities as rising food prices and declining jobs.
“These bans can have no long term effect on greenhouse gases. They will reduce food production and slash property values. They are cynical exercises in vote buying and international grandstanding which should be immediately abandoned.”
“If action is not taken we will soon reach a state where we can’t see the grass for the trees.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2010/02/16/green-jobs-galore/,,Green Jobs Galore – Climate Change Research Spending in Australia,"The Australian Government is spending at least $800 million per year on research related to Climate Change. The cash is being sprayed across the country so that no university or research centre is missing out. More than 5,000 researchers are beneficiaries of government climate largess, but still they cannot forecast the weather more than a few days ahead.
Where does the money go? No one appears to know, so Carbon Sense asked Bob Greenelsh to see what he could dig up, and Bob has presented his preliminary findings.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the big winner with government expenditure running at the rate of $400 million a year. After adding funds from the Coal Industry, the total for CCS is probably closer to $800 million a year. Other researchers are getting cash for projects on alternative energy, climate modelling, disaster predicting and research into the impact of climate change on subjects of interest to the researchers. For example, there is an intriguing $760,000 grant for research into the impact of climate change on native orchids.
With so much money being spent by so many, involving so many different organisations and on a vast variety of projects the obvious question is, does anyone really know what is going on? Is the cash being properly spent and will there be a proper reckoning of results and benefits? A second question is, do all the researchers believe that man-made CO2 is causing global warming and that such warming is going to cause other disasters? It is a good bet that their main focus is on getting cash for their project and knowing that there is global warming stimulus package they include “global warming” in the project application.
With those magic words the money will soon be on its way and they can do their stuff and forget about global warming.

Kevin Rudd’s mob, cowed in silence imposed by party control and paralysed by fear of voter backlash, pretend the rotting corpses are not there. They aim to suffocate Australia through an Emissions Trading Scheme imposing a huge tax payable by every consumer.
Tony Abbott’s mob is paralysed by fear of sensational headlines labelling them anti-green. They too tiptoe warily around the putrid corpses. They think that to be seen as environmentally caring they need a plan for tackling global warming alarm. They’re trying to prove their plan is better. So they push a far less costly, far less risky and far less damaging alternative to suffocating Australia—they want to choke Australia through yet more unneeded regulation.
The growing majority of Aussies watch and laugh. Woken to reality, they look on and shake their heads with derision and disbelief. While politicians tiptoe around dead elephants, Aussies have figured out what really matters—global warming alarm has been fabricated.
Most Australians genuinely care for the environment. They’ve concluded climate alarm is a wasteful, costly derailment— a derailment that prevents addressing real environmental challenges.

The number of spotless days is clamping down quickly.  There were only 3 spotless days in January, 2010.
Solar minimums end rather abruptly.  It appears very likely that the final number for this solar minimum will come close to 800. The transitions into the recent Solar Cycles (SC16-23) covering the past 7 decades averaged 362 cumulative spotless days.  Therefore it is becoming obvious that the sun has undergone a state change.
The Average Magnetic Planetary Index (Ap index) is a proxy measurement for the intensity of solar magnetic activity as it alters the geomagnetic field on Earth.  It has been referred to as the common yardstick for solar magnetic activity.  An Ap index of “4” was the lowest recorded monthly value since measurements began in January 1932.  In October and November 2009, this index record was broken with values of “3”.  Then in December the index sunk even lower establishing a new record with a reading of “2”.  Now in January of this year the Ap index is back up to “3”.
This solar minimum is rather unusual.  If we define a period of quiet sun as those months that produced an Ap index of 6 or less and compare the total number of quiet months within each solar minimum, then the results would be:


Minimum Preceding Solar Cycle
Number of Months with Ap Index of 6 or less

Isn’t it interesting that the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing some of the coldest, snowiest weather in decades at the same time the sun’s magnetic field produced 25 quiet months?  But history has shown that when the sun gets extremely quiet such as during the Maunder and Sporer Minimums, the world experiences great cold periods referred to as the Little Ice Ages.

I don’t know the cause of that warming, but I’d wager everything I own that it was not caused by coal-fired electric generation plants, incandescent light bulbs and SUVs tooling up and down the highways.”

Professor Ian Plimer will accompany Christopher Monckton on a whirlwind tour of the mainland capital cities starting in Sydney on January 25th and finishing in Perth on February 9th.  Unfortunately we cannot fit in Tasmania and the Northern Territory.  Lady Juliet Monckton will come as well, in part to monitor Lord Monckton’s health.
Prof. Plimer says the following of Lord Monckton: “although I modestly state that I am a good performer, he is superb and I have seen him fielding a very hostile BBC and other networks.  He has the ability to change thinking…”.
Given the now generally-acknowledged lack of understanding among the Australian general public of the underlying reasons for a “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme” and the likely effects thereof, it is critical that the public gets a chance to hear a globally-recognised presenter to explain the rational understanding of the whole issue.  Lord Monckton is the ideal person to carry out this task and to also put it to the mass media.
There are still details to be finalised for the tour, but basically the program for Lord Monckton’s public lectures is:
Note: Additional meetings Perth (9th Feb), Sydney (12th Feb); see http://carbon-sense.com/2010/02/06/monckton-extra-lectures/

Sydney January 27th, Sheraton on the Park, 5:30 pm

Peter Lang is a professional with more than 40 years experience in the energy industry.  His experience includes coal, oil, gas, hydro, geothermal, nuclear power plants, nuclear waste disposal and energy end use management.
Peter has previously written on:

Wind Power Realities at: http://carbon-sense.com/2009/02/17/wind-power-costs/

And more Solar Power at: http://carbon-sense.com/2009/09/04/solar-realities-addendum/

Now he looks at some inconvenient realities concerning the consequences for electricity generation if the government tries to achieve their unrealistic and pointless cuts in carbon dioxide emissions.
The paper compares five “energy mix” options with a “business as usual” case for electricity generation in Australia from 2010 to 2050.  The options involve mixes of coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar thermal technologies.  The analysis indicates that continuing with the current mix of electricity sources (mainly coal) will provide the cheapest electricity. Gas, the other carbon fuel, has the next higher cost. All of the non-coal options (nuclear, solar and wind) will substantially increase electricity costs with solar being the most expensive.
Nuclear power is the only feasible option that could achieve the promised cuts in emissions. Wind and solar are very high cost options with little hope of achieving the emissions cuts promised, either alone or in combination.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/12/29/co2-good-green/,,Carbon Dioxide is GOOD and GREEN,"Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, Earth and its inhabitants have benefited from the rise in airborne CO2 by an average growth increase of about 12% for plants and 18% for trees. This has improved Earth’s habitats and ecosystems, including increasing food production for an undernourished population. These benefits have helped offset the many negative impacts upon nature caused by other human activities.
These are some of the many benefits of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere:

Additional CO2 causes an astonishing increase in plant growth.
More CO2 causes plants to need less water to produce the same amount of growth.
Certain health-promoting substances such as vitamin C and antioxidants, are increased with additional airborne CO2.
With much more food production per acre, Earth should be able to feed an expanding population and save habitats and ecosystems.
Existing habitats and ecosystems will have higher plant and wildlife capacity.
The greening of Earth will continue and extend into the deserts as plants become drought tolerant.
Plants can better resist various stresses when grown in a CO2 enriched atmosphere.
Dramatic increases in the growth of Earth’s forests will help them recover from recurring natural disasters and aid a renewable resource industry.
CO2 is Earth’s greatest airborne fertilizer.
CO2 is the staff of life for Earth’s plant kingdom which is the beginning of the food chain; without it there would be no life on Earth.

I would suggest that the public be given an opportunity to see what it is like to be without those power stations, say for one day a week, every week, for say, a year.
As power stations cannot be switched on and off like lights in a home, it will be cheaper and better for the operators to simply cut off the power for 24 hours once a week.
Power stations will be compensated for their financial losses by the Greens, the Labor party and those true believers in the Liberal party.
This will give the public some basis on which to make judgments.
When the power goes off, there will be:
* No trains.
* No airline operations.
* No shops open.
* No food available.
* No coffee shops.
* No paper shop.
* No radio and or television transmission.
* No air conditioning.
* No electric blankets in winter.
* No refrigeration.
* No washing machines.
* No electrical appliance systems at all.
* No  electronic communications systems.
* No sporting events.
* No 000 calls.
* No ambulance.
* No Fire Brigade.
* No medical operations.
*  No X-rays.
I have been wondering whether the public would stand this for a year; especially over a non-existent problem. If Senator Brown gets his way they will have to endure it for ever.
Apart from hydro power, coal driven power is still the cheapest source of reliable power on earth.

Source: http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/religion.htm
It was Michael Crichton who first prominently identified environmentalism as a religion. That was in a speech in 2003, but the world has moved on apace since then and adherents of the creed now have a firm grip on the world at large.
Global Warming has become the core belief in a new eco-theology. The term is used as shorthand for anthropogenic (or man made) global warming. It is closely related to other modern belief systems, such as political correctness, chemophobia and various other forms of scaremongering, but it represents the vanguard in the assault on scientific man.
The activists now prefer to call it “climate change”. This gives them two advantages:
   1. It allows them to seize as “evidence” the inevitable occurrences of unusually cold weather as well as warm ones.
   2. The climate is always changing, so they must be right.

I heard even Mugabe was there, after reducing his nation from rich Rhodesia to poor Zimbabwe, looking for a handout under the latest fable, ‘the Carbon Debt’ supposedly owed to the poor countries by the rich countries.
There is only one carbon debt, and that is the debt every inhabitant of this planet owes to carbon dioxide. Without adequate amounts of this in the atmosphere, plant life suffocates, and we could not grow enough crops to feed the population. To quote Freeman Dyson ‘The fundamental reason why carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is critically important to biology is that there is so little of it. A field of corn growing in full sunlight in the middle of the day uses up all of the carbon dioxide within a metre of the ground in about five minutes’.
Surely it’s time to confront the immorality of scaring children witless with images of ‘threatened bears’ (polar and koala) and ‘dying’ reefs and then exploiting their fears with cheap political stunts.
Please, no more scares and no more talkfests, whether in Mexico in 2010, or Cairns in 2011 (neither city has reported snow yet).

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/12/22/the-other-copenhagen-conference/,,The Other Copenhagen Climate Conference,"By Cliff Ollier, 2009.
I was lucky enough to be invited to the “Climate Challenge” conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. The aim of this small two-day conference was to throw a challenge to the science of the main Copenhagen conference.  We had a few experts who presented their views and evidence.
Niklas Morner, world expert on sea level, showed that sea levels are not rising at an alarming rate anywhere, including the Maldives and Tuvalu.

I talked about the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The alarmist model of glaciers sliding down to the sea on a base of bedrock lubricated by meltwater is false. They occupy basins and the ice has to flow uphill. The ice-cores, used to determine former temperature and carbon dioxide content, sometimes extend to a depth of 3 km, with stratified ice almost to the base.  They show no melting in Greenland for 105,000 years and Antarctica for 760,000 years. The ice in the accumulation area did not melt for three-quarters of a million years, and is not melting at the surface today.  The ice flows at the base where it is warmed by heat from the Earth, and is unaffected by surface temperatures or carbon dioxide.  Mountain glaciers have been in general retreat since 1895, but some are advancing and there is no simple relationship to temperature or carbon dioxide.
Fred Singer gave an account of global temperatures, which show no cause for alarm. The sun is the dominant control, not carbon dioxide.
Ian Plimer, author of the best-selling sceptic book Heaven + Earth, recounted the history of Earth climate showing there were many times that were hotter and colder that today, and that carbon dioxide was far more abundant at times in the past.
Leighton Steward made the case that CO2 is plant food, and entirely good for the ecosystem.  The natural increase in CO2 over the past century has caused increasing vegetation growth, especially of trees. There are hundreds of actual studies of plant growth in greenhouses where high CO2 levels are maintained, and growth is often increased by about 50%.  If we want to sequester CO2 from other producers we should do it to grow food.
Henrik Svensmark described how the sun controls the Earth’s climate through its effect on cloud formation via cosmic rays. His research took years, was rejected by the orthodox, and proved difficult to get published. It now seems to be the most important climatic discovery for years.
Others spoke on aspects of economics, the history of environmental crusades, and a Danish politician gave us an account of some of the problems of Denmark. Despite building a huge array of windmills, which many feel are ugly and objectionable, wind power only provides 3% of Denmark’s energy, and most has to be bought from neighbours with base power based on nuclear, hydro, or coal energy.
The conference was closed by Lord Monckton, a commanding figure who appears to be fully abreast not only of the science, but also the economics, politics and dirty tricks.  It really was a grand finale.
Plenty reporters covered the conference, but little of it was published. I had about 8 TV interviews, but so far as I know only the BBC one was broadcast, and this is also on Youtube.
The mainstream conference did not refer to our conference at all, and generally ignored science, except for assertions that the last ten years was the hottest ever (which it wasn’t), and that sea levels are rising dangerously (which they are not).
Science has dropped to the slogan level.  The propaganda is shameless and crude, worthy of a Goebbels. For example they repeatedly show steam coming from chimneys with the implication that it is carbon dioxide, when we know that CO2 is an invisible gas. A video made to scare children is utterly disgraceful.
The arguments about climate keep changing. It started with Global Warming, but (despite recent assertions) the Earth has been cooling since 1998. Then it becomes Climate Change.  We all agree that the climate changes, but we disagree on the cause and our ability to control it.  If we are really entering a twenty year cooling associated with Solar Cycle 24 then it is pointless to try to reduce CO2, even if it would do anything.  And finally we have the notion that CO2 is a pollutant, so we need to have carbon trading anyway, regardless of climate.
On top of all this we had (after our conference was over) the demonstrations, smashing windows and burning cars, showing perhaps that scientific arguments can be solved by violence.
In brief science is not involved in the present arguments. The current madness of crowds is more like Nazism, Lysenkoism or the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and scientific arguments have no effect.

Kevin Rudd at the Lowy Institute on November 6:
“The overwhelming need for Australia to tackle the great challenge of our generation is being frustrated by the do-nothing climate change sceptics. My message to the climate change sceptics, to the big betters and the big risk-takers, is this: You are betting our children’s future and the future of our grandchildren.”
Malcolm Turnbull on ABC radio’s AM, 27 Nov 09:
“This is not a game. We are talking about the future of our children and their children, we’re talking about the future of our planet. The vast majority of Australians want to see action on climate change. The issue boils down in the mind of the Australian people, which party can we trust to take effective action on climate change?”
Turnbull has already used trickery to frustrate the majority in the party room who wanted to at least delay the Ration-N-Tax Scheme.
Now Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull have devised a another tricky plan to get the CPRS Bill through the Senate on Monday 30th November, the day before the Liberal party meeting he has called for Tuesday, where he is expected to be blasted out of office.
The plan is to move the guillotine in the Senate on Monday where the ALP’s 32 senators will be supported by Turnbullite Liberal senators in sufficient numbers to pass the guillotine. Once that has been done the CPRS Bill will be immediately put to the vote, and the same coalition of ALP and Turnbullite senators will pass the Bill.
This is indeed a cunning plan and demonstrates the length of trickery to which Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull are prepared to go together to impose this monstrous regime of command and control on Australia.

This database, available online, holds all New Zealand’s climate data, including temperature readings, since the 1850s. Anybody can go and get the data for free. That was done by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition (http://nzclimatescience.net/) and reported in a recent paper edited by Richard Treadgold.
They found that the raw data, when plotted, showed that New Zealand average temperatures have been remarkably constant, way back to the 1850’s. But the official graph produced by NIWA and provided to the IPCC showed significant “global warming” because the original data has been adjusted and strangely most of the adjustments create the warming trend. The NZCSC paper comments:
“We have discovered that the warming in New Zealand over the past 156 years was indeed man-made, but it had nothing to do with emissions of CO2-it was created by man-made adjustments of the temperature. It’s a disgrace.”
In an interesting coincidence, the original graph was prepared by Dr Jim Salinger when he worked at the Climate Research Institute at the University of East Anglia, which is now the centre of much attention because of what appears to be “adjustments” to CRU data and reports.

Natural Climate Change continues despite Al Gore and the IPCC. The sun exhibits great variability in the strength of each solar cycle. This variability ranges from extremely quiet “Grand Minima” such as the Maunder Minimum, to very active “Grand Maxima” such as the enhanced activity observed during most of the 20th century.
But the solar Grand Maxima that has persisted during most of the 20th century has come to an abrupt end.
Solar Grand Minima events correspond to periods of dramatic natural global cooling. The Maunder Minimum (about 1645-1715 A.D.) and Spörer Minimum (about 1420-1570 A.D.) are two examples of recent “Grand Minima” events and each period has been referred to as an element of the Little Ice Age.

This question was never addressed by Svante Arrhenius in his seminal 1896 paper because that paper predates quantum physics and he was not aware that the process by which thermal energy is affected by CO2 is limited to a single vibrational mode with a resonant wavelength of 14.77microns.

Someone should tell your gloating Prime Minister that just because some part of Oz is experiencing record high temperatures it does NOT mean that the ‘planet’ (as we now call it because it sounds profound) is warming.  For example, NZ has had two of the coldest months on record.  Places all around the world are often colder or warmer than ‘normal’.  But the averages have not changed since the days of Ned Kelly’s grandfather – and before.  It would be remarkable, indeed, if that were not the case.
Obviously  Mr Rudd paid more attention to Mandarin than meteorology.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/11/20/future-winters/,,Our Future Winters May be Colder,"It was the year 1799, during the “Dalton Minimum” when the sun was quiet that George Frederick Bollinger led a group of early pioneers from North Carolina to establish early settlements in Missouri. They hoped to cross their largest obstacle, the Mississippi River, on the ice, frozen solid in mid-winter.
The pioneers and their wagon train moved westward a few miles each day, making and breaking camp each night, fording the small streams and floating across the larger ones on rafts which they made from the nearby trees, following roads that were barely trails through forests and valleys.
They arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River opposite St. Genevieve in late December, pitched camp and explored potential river crossings. St. Genevieve is located about a 100 miles downstream from St. Louis. Winter had come early and the Mississippi river was already covered with ice. It was bitterly cold. They determined the ice was not yet thick enough to support a crossing of ox-carts and covered wagons. Daily the thickness of the ice was measured and then on Dec. 31, a chopped hole in the ice indicated thickness well over two feet. They tested the ice by making a few trips across on foot and horseback. The believed the ice was thick enough to support a loaded wagon.
As a test, a wagon was selected to be driven across with no one riding and the driver would walk ahead watching the ice and leading his team. The trip across and back to camp was made without the ice cracking and preparations were made for an early crossing New Year’s Day.
The next morning final preparations were made to break camp and all supplies were loaded. The weather remained bitter cold with dark skies overhead and light snow falling, but the decision had been made to cross and there was no turning back. The group was devout German Reformed Protestants and they gathered together in the early cold gray dawn to seek guidance from their God for a safe crossing.
The cracking of whips like pistol shots rang out over the heads of the oxen to coax them out onto the ice; the crossing had began. All that were able, walked to lighten the loaded wagons, keeping a safe distance from the wagons, which were also spaced far apart to lessen the danger of breaking the ice. The crossing was made successfully with no mishaps, except extremely cold hands and feet.
The townsfolk of St. Genevieve had built a large fire to welcome and warm these new settlers. Safely across the Mississippi, they were relieved of their crossing fears and enjoyed the local hospitality. They exchanged news from the East for information of what they might expect ahead. Needed supplies were purchased and even the weather abated a little as the sun broke through the clouds. They settled along the Whitewater River where the soil was rich.
We are transitioning into Solar Cycle (SC) 24 and the sun has become fairly quiet. During most of the last century (SC 16-23) the sun has been in a Grand Maxima. As a result the Earth has experienced warming. But with SC 24 the sun is again changing states. From the peak year 1998, the lower Troposphere temperatures globally have already fallen around 1/2 degree Celsius. This is despite the fact that during that same time period, atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen 5% from 367 ppm to 386 ppm. Several solar scientist are predicting the sun will slide into a “Dalton Minimum” event in SC 25, about a decade from now. If that happens, the Earth will experience some bitterly cold winters for several decades.
The winters may once again resemble the winters 200 years ago during the time of the early pioneers. Imagine for a minute the west fork of the White River near Bloomfield freezing into a block of ice two feet thick.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/11/19/carbon-capture-wastes-energy/,,Carbon Capture & Burial also Wastes Energy,"Here is another Monument to the Madness of CCB (carbon capture and burial) – it needs a lot of  energy – currently estimated to require 30% of the output of a power station.
So in order to satisfy the existing market for electricity, we would have to build a new power station for every three existing ones just to provide the power to capture and bury, not just the CO2 from the existing ones, but also from the new one as well.
Most coal fired power stations are about 33% efficient. Put simply, they burn 3 tonnes of coal to get the equivalent energy of 1 tonne. With CCB, they will now burn 4 tonnes of coal and increase CO2 emissions by 33% for the same useful output.
If however we spend the money required for CCB on increasing the efficiency of thermal power stations even to a modest 50%, they would only need to burn 2 tonnes of coal to get the equivalent energy of 1 tonne and that alone will reduce CO2 emissions by 33%.
Combined cycle is already at 50% and China has been developing super critical boiler temperatures which they claim will be 50% efficient.
But what does Government do? They introduce a tax, as a solution which may not work, for a problem which may not exist.

Plant life in turn benefits all mammals as it releases oxygen. All decent scientists agree with us, as they are appalled at a decision of The Australian Society of Vandals, (otherwise known as The Labor Party), to inaugurate an ETS which will tax us into industrial oblivion. 
On the other hand we have the Leader of the Australian Society of Dills, (also known as The Liberal Party), who want to install their own brand of inauspicious anti-industrial EMS. The leader of The Dills could not win an election even if they were the only party for whom we could vote.

They have successfully recruited large numbers of useful fools who have been brainwashed into believing they can ‘save the planet’ by doing petty things such as this claim at the bottom of an invoice received recently from a supplier: ‘We’re Green. We have saved a total of  0.5143  trees since January 2005 by using paperless invoicing for 4287 invoices’. 
It would have taken less effort to simply plant a tree, for all the good even that would have done in the vastness of things. And what is a tree? What is 0.5143 of a tree? How much carbon dioxide does it contain? Questions, questions. This is the sort of Garbage In – Garbage Out that we can expect if any form of an ETS is introduced. How many lawyers, accountants and regulators will waste their lives measuring, auditing, accounting for and policing thin air? And to how many decimal places? And how are we going to feed them all while the producers of real wealth sink in a tidal wave of paperwork even if the forms are paperless.
Prosperity is the key to eliminating real pollution (particulate matter, rubbish, sulphates etc) on a global scale. An ETS will introduce a new pest into this country more destructive to our prosperity than the rabbit, and our ability to deal with natural climate change will be greatly diminished if our politicians continue down this yellow brick road, at the end of which they will find only smoke and mirrors.

Very few scientists support the IPCC’s core claim and a huge number world-wide oppose the IPCC’s core claim.
There is no evidence human production of CO2 caused global warming.
Many IPCC claims are unscientific.
Many claims of the IPCC are false.
The lack of an effective peer review process and the unjustified dismissal of well-founded comments demonstrates that IPCC reports were written to a predetermined aim to ensure a predetermined outcome.

“The advocates of global warming alarmism ask for an almost unprecedented expansion of government intrusion, of government intervention into our lives and of government control over us.

“The current Global Warming Debate is not about temperature or CO2 levels. It is also not part of a scientific dispute inside climatology.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/09/21/copenhagen-liars/,,The Great Copenhagen Liar’s Conference,"By Alan Caruba
From December 6 through the 18th, a conference sponsored by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will gather in Copenhagen, Denmark, to explore ways to “prevent global warming” and I would like to be among the first to tell all those idiots checking their passports and deciding what to pack that they can all stay home.
This is not an original thought on my part and, in fact, is occasioned by Prof. Henrik Svensmark. He is director of the Center for Sun-Climate Research at the Technical University of Denmark and, not surprisingly, knows a lot about the Sun and climate.

Permit me to share some of his thoughts. In a September 9th opinion titled, “While the Sun Sleeps”, Prof. Svensmark wrote, “Last week, the scientific team behind the SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) reported that the number of sunspot-free days suggest that solar activity is heading towards its lowest level in about 100 years.”
“Everything indicates that the Sun is moving into a hibernation-like state and the obvious question is whether it has any significance for us on Earth.” Good question, Professor! Particularly since the Sun is the sole source of heat for the Earth. When it takes a nap, everybody takes notice.
The professor then had a little professorial fun describing the Little Ice Age that occurred after a period of medieval warmth that had begun around 1000 AD. After 1300, however, it got a lot colder. Settlements in Greenland disappeared. The Thames froze over repeatedly. And here’s where we need to pay attention, there were “long periods of crop failure.” Between starvation and disease, it reduced the population of Europe by about a third.
“It is important to note that the Little Ice Age was a global event,” said Prof. Svensmark. It did not end until the mid-to-late 19th century; around 1850 in America. Do your math. That’s five centuries. As the Earth began to warm up and particularly in the last fifty years, “solar activity has been the highest since the medieval warmth of 1,000 years ago.”
Now, keep in mind that a couple of hundred, perhaps a thousand or more diplomats, scientists, and environmentalists are going to gather in Copenhagen for the single purpose of extending or expanding the Kyoto Protocols that are based on the assertion that the Earth is warming even though it is not.
Moreover, the IPCC will announce that, if the industrialized nations do not dramatically reduce the production of “greenhouse gases” (carbon dioxide), we are all doomed. In the United States, the Cap-and-Trade bill which passed the House by a slim margin will be up for consideration in the Senate. It is based on the global warming lie. It will drive up the cost of energy for all Americans and basically wreck the economy!
Like the witches in Macbeth, for years the IPCC has been stirring a cauldron of lies about global warming and the world’s media, intoxicated by the fumes rising from the pot, have never ceased from telling us that the Earth is warming when it is not.
The Sun, however, is not cooperating.
“It now appears that the Sun…is heading towards what is called ‘a grand minimum’ as we saw in the Little Ice Age,” says Prof. Svensmark.
“Indeed, global warming has stopped and cooling is beginning.” At a recent World Climate Conference in Geneva one of the participants predicted the cooling will likely continue through the next 10 to 20 years.
All those IPCC computer models that have been predicting global warming were wrong, are wrong, and will remain wrong for all time until the Earth actually begins to warm again.
If, however, the Earth slips into a new Ice Age and not just a “little” one, it will be several hundred thousand years before they are valid.
The Copenhagen conference is, like global warming, a hoax.
I hear it’s very cold in Copenhagen in the winter.

In a lifetime of observing and participating in politics, the world wide campaign by the international green movement (aided by the power-seeking UN bureaucracy) to monitor, control and tax every food, energy and transport business in the world is the most dangerous development I have ever seen. It has the potential to blight the lives and investments of the majority of Australians who are unable to find a safe place for themselves on the government payroll or in the protected Climate Change Industry.

Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction.
Therefore everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us.

The Liberals are unlikely to stop it – they are too engrossed in considerations of survival, and too many are hostage to Green dreamers, Green Industry speculators and vested interests lined up to profit from suffering electricity consumers.
This bill has nothing to commend it.
Firstly, the whole idea of the Emissions Trading Systems beloved by the Lib-Lab party and the merchant banking speculators is that it allows the market to determine the cheapest way to reduce emissions. It is totally negated when politicians mandate or subsidise certain energy systems. Thus the Rent Scheme should be shelved until the fate of the Ration-N-Tax Scheme is finally decided.
Secondly, it would be foolish in the extreme to force Australian industry to pay elevated electricity costs before it is clear what is coming out of the IPCC talkfest in Copenhagen in December, and what our international competitors are doing.
Thirdly, there is no chance that a force fed program to force solar/wind to supply 20% of Australia’s power will succeed without the risk of disruptions to power supplies and rapidly escalating costs for electricity and gas (which will be needed to back up unreliable green power).
And finally, the environmental “benefits” are very doubtful. When the massive land dislocation, and the minerals, energy and emissions resulting from the manufacture and installation of thousands of wind towers and solar panels are fully accounted for, we may find that Green Power is not so green after all.
This bill should be postponed until a full sensible assessment is made.

“Whenever politicians claim to create jobs, close examination usually finds that the jobs were created in another country and their policies have merely created more welfare recipients.
“Much of the tax funded subsidy money being thrown at “alternative energy” is creating jobs in China making the hardware. Then it employs a few short term people installing the stuff. In the end, the only real jobs created are repairing wind towers and cleaning dust off solar panels. Even these are not real jobs because the moment the government stops forcing electricity companies to use their expensive and unreliable green power, these jobs will also evaporate.

Forbes explains:
“PM Rudd proposes to spend $19 million shooting one million wild camels.
“A big camel probably weighs about a tonne, so Mr Rudd is going to let a million tonnes of valuable meat rot under the Centralian sun.
“Each camel probably has about 190 kg of carbon sequestered in its body. As it rots and absorbs oxygen, this carbon will increase into about 700 kg of carbon dioxide which will then dissipate into the atmosphere.
“If the Australian Senate is silly enough to pass the Wong carbon dioxide Ration-n-Tax Scheme this shootout will thus trigger a huge carbon tax liability.
“At a carbon emission price of say $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide, the carbon tax on one million rotting camels would be about $28 million.
“If we add to that the actual cull costs of about $19 million and the carbon tax due on helicopter emissions and other activities, the total cost of the cull is about $50 million.
“This illustrates the dangers of costly unexpected consequences resulting from complex poorly designed bills being rushed through both Australian and US Legislatures by Mr Rudd and his buddy Mr Obama. Luckily Senators in both countries will probably reject this nonsense.

“If not, this $50 million invoice for the full costs of the camel shootout should not be presented to the taxpayers, but sent to Cull Commander Minister Garrett.
“This may convince him to chase up a few old Territorian buffalo shooters who could make a tidy profit at no cost to the taxpayer by culling the camels and selling the meat to Taiwan. Or we could sell permits to a few big game hunters. Or sell live camels to the Arabs.”
A Reader’s Comment:
Culling is a stupid blind man’s solution to the camel problem…!!
By Paddy McHugh
My name is Paddy McHugh and I have been working with camels in Australia and overseas for some 35 years. I am deeply disturbed by what is about to happen and feel that people and the media have only been told only one side of the story and a very slanted and incorrect one at that. Spending 19 million dollars on the wholesale slaughter of camels is not the answer. I would like to bring to your attention another side of the Australian camel problem and the industry’s potential.
The current proposal leads down the path of mass slaughter, disease potential from rotting carcasses, dingo explosion and missed opportunities. There is another road which looks to the future – a golden opportunity for another viable rural industry for this country with employment in a new bio-diverse industry that will employ hundreds of Aboriginal people and bring large amounts of export dollars into this country.
The traditional land owners are yet again about to be ripped off and left in the dark. The people in APY lands and CLC deserts are being told complete untruths and are having the wool pulled over their eyes in one of the greatest and most immoral scams this country has ever witnessed.
As a very good friend of mine has stated “The Camel is the animal of the 22nd century” This statement came from Dr Alex Tinson who is quite possibly the world’s leading camel vet and works for the President of the UAE.
My office receives dozens of emails seeking camel products from milk, meat, blood and all the by-products that come from this animal – the international potential for this industry is immense.
It is an animal easily farmed like cattle and sheep and has a far less detrimental impact on the environment. In fact camels enhance the land by helping eradicate woody weeds and have a forage overlap of no more the 20% with cattle and sheep. 70% of Australia’s land mass is classed arid, why are we not farming camels?
The commercial side of this potential industry has been suppressed in discussions regarding the feral problem.
A mandate to shoot the camel at any cost is absurd. People who advocate this are completely one track and have absolutely no vision or hands on experience in the husbandry and handling of this animal.
Out of the 19 million dollars that has been allocated for this slaughter none of it has been put into education and training or industry development and that is where the bulk of this funding should be put. Who is accountable here?
What happens in years to come when the camel population comes back to the same present numbers, do we spend another 20 million dollars..!! again and again I acknowledge that we do have a camel problem that needs to be fixed, but mass shooting of them is certainly not the answer. It is not even close. All parties need to come together and discuss this animal’s future.
A real camel industry could not only fix the immediate problem but also stabilise the long
term and give many people a great future.
For years I have passionately championed the camel and its potential in Australia. It is now time to take a firm stand against the so called experts who are ill informed on these matters. Many people will have senseless blood on their hands with what is about to happen. I will not let the mindless slaughter of these animals take place.
I look forward to sitting down and discussing this for the good of all Australians.

Most of human history has been a struggle for food and energy.
The abundance of food in the western world during the last century or so is not the normal human condition. Snow and ice, drought and famine have been regular and persistent visitors to mankind.
We are lucky to live in a time of recent natural global warming. Warmth increases plant growth rate, lengthens the growing season, expands plant habitat and makes more land arable. As the oceans warm, they expel some of their vast reserves of carbon dioxide, the essential atmospheric plant food. Warm oceans also produce more evaporation, and thus more precipitation for adjacent land masses. Man’s recent production of carbon dioxide from burning coal and oil and calcining limestone has also helped to unlock buried carbon and restore valuable carbon dioxide to the biosphere.
Warmth, water and more abundant carbon dioxide have been the main causes of the 20th century Green Revolution which has enabled farmers to feed the growing millions on earth.
All these beneficial developments are threatened by two things – the distinct possibility of a return to natural global cooling, and silly government policies all over the western world that will slash food production.

Martin Ferguson is in touch with real people who keep the wheels turning in the mines, factories and transport fleet. He knows that none of these industries could operate without using carbon fuels which all produce harmless carbon dioxide gas. He knows we need efficient reliable power stations, not wind and solar playthings.
Barnaby Joyce represents the farmers, foresters and fishermen who produce the food, fibre and building materials we all need. He also knows that none of these essential items can be produced without producing more harmless CO2 gas.
Steve Fielding stands up for all the Australian families hoping for jobs for themselves and their kids. He knows that every job in Australia depends on our basic industries making the minerals, food, fibres and processed goods the world buys from us.
Public opinion polls show that ordinary Australians are increasingly swinging behind these leaders while Mr Rudd trips the Climate Change Stage, and Malcolm Turnbull agonises over how to make a more comfortable green noose for Australia. The only people who support such nonsense are the huge Climate Change Industry and those trying to buy green votes in the leafy suburbs.
All real work produces carbon dioxide.
The only way we can quickly reduce production of CO2 is by reducing jobs or reducing our consumption of food, fibre and minerals – the Ration-n-Tax Scheme thus offers unemployment and poverty in real industry in return for more taxes to create make-believe green jobs.

A decision is to be made in 2013 about including agriculture as a ‘covered sector’ in 2015. The Government is ‘disposed’ to include agriculture, which means that it is very likely to be included, and will then become subject to obtaining/buying Carbon Credits, or as they are to be known under the CPRS, Australian Emission Units (AEU’s) to cover the emissions that are calculated as being emitted.
Some AEU’s may be initially given to farmers, or may have to be purchased at auction, or at a fixed price determined by the government.
In any event it is proposed to reduce the number of AEU’s regularly (such as annually) to reduce Australia’s total emissions to meet the target it has set in the CPRS by 2020 and 2050.

All life on earth depends on our atmosphere for four essentials – oxygen, water, carbon and nitrogen. This foolish Institute aims to permanently sterilise two of them, carbon and oxygen. It destroys valuable resources and wastes extra energy doing it.
Every tonne of carbon buried in CO2 by CCS takes almost 3 tonnes of oxygen with it. It is more accurately referred to as Oxygen Capture and Burial (OCB).
Planets like earth gradually lose their life-sustaining atmosphere and end up as lifeless planets like Moon and Mars. It just takes time.
The essentials of life are already being continually lost by other processes, largely locked up in rocks as limestone or coal, lost to space, or buried in ocean sediments, land fill or human cemeteries.
These buried treasures are lost for eons, maybe forever, to the cycle of life. The OCB scheme would deliberately accelerate that deathly process.
Burning coal and oil, smelting metals, mining phosphate and calcining cement make small contributions to reverse this long term disappearance of essential elements from our atmosphere and biosphere.
There are no climate benefits of this silly proposal because CO2 in the atmosphere does not control climate – the tiny effect of man’s CO2 emissions is wholly beneficial.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/07/05/solar-appendage/,,Solar Power – a Subsidised Appendage,"By Viv Forbes, Chairman, The Carbon Sense Coalition.
Australian electricity consumers can look forward to soaring charges for electricity and blackouts if state and federal politicians continue to undermine the power grid by mandating and subsidising solar power generation.
Solar power can never produce continuous, predictable low cost power. It must always be supported by expensive power storage systems or by reliable power sources such as coal, gas, hydro or nuclear.
No matter how many millions of taxpayer money is poured into “research”, it can never solve the two fatal flaws of solar power.

Firstly, sunlight energy arrives in very dilute form, and thus needs vast areas of collectors to harvest significant energy. This results in high capital costs and much environmental disturbance. Solar power can light one 75-watt bulb for every card table of collectors (in the middle of the day only). How many card tables do we need to run the trains, factories, fridges, homes, heaters, hospitals and tools of a big city?
Secondly, the solar energy produced during daylight hours is constantly variable and unpredictable, and zero power is generated at night. As a result, solar power farms seldom produce more than an average of 15% of their rated capacity over a year and as low as 1% for a day or so.
In Australia, the maximum electricity demand occurs at about 6.30 pm in mid-winter in the big southern cities. The maximum solar power is generated at noon in mid-summer in clear northern deserts. If the nightly solar curfew is to be covered by solar power alone, this necessitates a vast area of collectors to provide grid power as well as charge a storage backup during the day and run it down at night. The scattered solar collectors also need a huge new transmission network. Such a system is inefficient and very costly.
More likely, however, is that the solar farms will be backed up by gas or coal power stations running on idle and wasting fuel and capital until they are needed to supply power during the nightly solar blackouts.
Solar energy has useful applications, but supplying the power grid is NOT one of them. Solar power can never supply the reliable low cost electricity needed for Australian cities and industries. In that application, it can only exist as a subsidised and troublesome appendage propped up by serious power sources such as coal, gas, nuclear or hydro.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/06/27/epa-negligent/,,Australia’s EPA was Negligent,"Australia’s EPA (Environmental Protection Authority) has been negligent in listing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a pollutant without conducting an independent public review of the scientific evidence to support that decision.
The Garnaut Doomsday report, the CSIRO Scare forecasts, and the Cap-N-Tax Scheme of Senator Wong are all based on faulty foundations. Like trusting children following the Pied Piper, Senator Wong follows the EPA, which follows CSIRO and Garnaut, who follow the US EPA, which follows the IPCC, which follows the Pied Piper of Gore, whose movie has been found to contain many untruths. Only a few key people in this Conga Line of gullibles know where they are going and why. Even fewer have checked the scientific basis of the Global Warming Theory.

They are all following the completely outdated IPCC AR4 report. This report was published in 2007 but relies on scientific papers at least 3 years out of date, and some such as the NAS 1979 study are 30 years old.
Now a critical draft report has emerged from inside the US EPA. It was written by very competent EPA staff, warning that organisation that their classification of CO2 as a pollutant was too heavily based on the latest IPCC report “which is at best three years out of date in a rapidly changing field.” This EPA report has been suppressed for months.
The comprehensive 98 page report details six areas where important new findings demand re-assessment of the EPA ruling. These include the end of the warming trend that is now obvious, the gross failure of IPCC forecasts of temperature and CO2 emissions, the lack of correlation between CO2 and temperature, and the “strong association between solar/sunspots/irradiance and global temperature fluctuations.”
The report also finds that the assumption of positive feedback from water vapour that underlies all global warming models is “not supported by empirical evidence and the feedback is actually negative.”
Finally, in a statement that demolishes the key argument for the Cap-N-Tax Scheme, this suppressed EPA report notes: “Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations appear to have so little effect that it is difficult to find any effect in the satellite temperature record, which started in 1978”.
The emergence of this critical report from within the EPA citadel, indicates the urgency for Australia to follow New Zealand, put the Cap-N-Tax Scheme on indefinite hold, and conduct a thorough independent enquiry into the basis for the Australian EPA actions which attempt to demonise CO2.
The best evidence before us now, supported completely by this in-house thinking in the US EPA, is that Australia’s EPA was hasty and negligent in classing CO2, the valuable and harmless Gas of Life, as a pollutant.
This decision should be reversed until an independent enquiry is held.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/06/27/gw-analysis-lycklama/,,Vote NO on Cap and Trade Carbon Tax,"Dr. Heinz Lycklama (PhD in Nuclear Physics, McMaster University)
Earlier this year I started to look into the issue of Global Warming (GW) and attempted to understand why the issue had become such a controversial one. The general public has become attuned to the issue of GW and I (as an independent scientist) wanted to do my part in educating the public on the underlying science so that good public policy would be established. I assumed that science should be able to show the extent of GW and determine whether GW is due to man-made causes or to natural causes. Once we get the science right we would then know how to deal with GW. It turns out that things are a lot more complicated and unsettled than I thought they were. So I dug into the science behind GW much more thoroughly.

This scheme is not about carbon or pollution. Its main effect is to provide for a cap on the human production of carbon dioxide, a colourless harmless natural gas. Carbon dioxide is no more a pollutant than oxygen or water, the other two atmospheric gases on which all life on earth relies.
The bill will also levy a tax on whatever carbon dioxide is produced, and levy an excess production tax on anyone whose production exceeds the legal cap. It is a carbon dioxide Cap-n-Tax Bill.

It is not about carbon or pollution. It aims to Ration and Tax man’s production of carbon dioxide (CO2), but it will have no benefits for the climate or the environment. It is better named “the RAT scheme”.
There is no human activity whatsoever that does not generate CO2, and no plant can grow without a generous supply of CO2 in the atmosphere. More than any other substance on earth, production of CO2 measures human prosperity and plant growth.
The RAT scheme thus plans to ration and tax human prosperity and plant growth. Never has a more destructive bill appeared in our Parliament.

There is no empirical evidence available to demonstrate or prove this relationship, despite the expenditure of some $50 billion directed to this end.

The cost benefit worked out as follows:

Federal tax credit of $7,500
State rebate of about $9,600
Yield after subsidies (if qualified) – a total net cost of $7,900 with a return on my investment of just over 6%.
In other words the state and federal governments (taxpayers) would pay $17,100 in subsidies to support an overall yield on the total investment (theirs and mine) of 0.7%.
Every scrap of the product installed is of foreign manufacture sending the bulk of the taxpayer money overseas.

The current hysteria about man-made global warming, which is focussed almost exclusively on carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, exceeds by a large margin any political movement any of us have experienced in our life time. Originating with a few long-term Green extremists and serial doom merchants in USA and Europe, it now engrosses the world’s politicians and media.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/05/14/slippery-green-words/,,Slippery Green Words,"By Alan Caruba
Every so often The New York Times slips up and lets some truth appear on its hallowed and vastly over-rated pages.
Such was the case on May 2nd when reporter John M. Broder wrote “Seeking to Save the Planet, With a Thesaurus.”  As he put it in the first sentence, “The problem with global warming, some environmentalists believe, is ‘global warming.’” This is a very real problem, especially when the word is getting out that the planet has been cooling for a decade.
The problem worsens for them as word leaks that the ice at the North Pole is a lot thicker than earlier suspected—something that does not happen if it’s supposed to be melting. And the same holds for the South Pole whose ice is growing, along with many of the world’s glaciers.

Having spent the past twenty years or so blaming “global warming” for everything happening on Earth, the public has grown tired of the endless blather about it. Since it has provided much of the funding that Green organizations have pulled in from the gullible, not to mention from millions in government grants to study something that is not happening, the time has come to “re-brand” global warming into something that will still generate the money these charlatans depend upon.
Broder had laid hands on a memorandum by ecoAmerica, “a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm in Washington.” To rephrase that, ecoAmerica is no different from any Madison Avenue advertising or public relations firm whose job is to get you to buy or believe something.
When you have a lemon, make lemonade, and global warming is rapidly becoming a lemon. So the folks at ecoAmerica advise the Greens to avoid grim warnings about global warming and talk about “our deteriorating atmosphere.”
This has been tried. Remember the Ozone Layer that was supposed to be disappearing? It didn’t. It hasn’t. It won’t. Meanwhile you and everyone else has lost access to Freon, the miracle chemical that was vital to refrigeration as well as one of the best fire extinguishers ever invented. Those holes? They tended to show up over active volcanoes!
The atmosphere is not deteriorating. It hasn’t deteriorated for more than 4.5 billion years, permitting Earth to be the only planet in our solar system capable of sustaining life.
EcoAmerica went on to recommend moving away from discussing carbon dioxide (CO2) in favor of telling lies about “the dirty fuels of the past.” Well, those “dirty fuels” are not in the past. They are responsible for all of the energy we use every day and, unless you don’t like electricity and don’t want to drive or fuel anything, you better learn to like oil, natural gas, and coal.
Nuclear energy is nice too, but the Obama administration has just made it impossible to store nuclear waste in the multi-million dollar facility at Yukka Mountain in Nevada. Why? There is no good answer except to note this is the most anti-energy administration since the days of Jimmy Carter.
EcoAmerica doesn’t want to “confuse” the public about “cap and trade” legislation that would run up the cost of energy for everyone by thousands of dollars a year. Instead, they recommend that Greens talk about “cap and cash back” or “pollution reduction refund.”
Having apparently concluded that the Greens have been lying to them for years, all the polls and surveys reveal that “Environmental issues consistently rate near the bottom of public worry, according to many public opinion polls.
Indeed, ecoAmerica suggests that Greens stop using the word “environment” and begin talking about “the air we breathe, the water our children drink.”
The problem with that is that the air in America is as clean as humanly possible to achieve and the water is the safest on Earth to drink.
The truth means nothing to the Greens. Their game is all about power over everyone’s lives and the means to drain every dollar they can from the government and from gullible people who buy products whose prices have been jacked up by claiming it is environmentally friendly in some fashion.
They have spent several decades indoctrinating and frightening the newest generations of Americans in the nation’s schools and via the print and broadcast media.
These people are utterly contemptible.

It is widely believed that the carbon emissions of our modern industrial civilization will cause catastrophic global warming. It is called anthropogenic [man-made] global warming (AGW). Media headlines and political chatter have become obsessed with carbon. There is endless talk of carbon emissions, carbon pollution, carbon footprint, carbon offsets, carbon rationing, carbon tax and carbon trading.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/04/11/two-fatal-flaws/,,Two Fatal Flaws,"The Carbon Sense Coalition has delivered its submission to the  Australian Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change in response to the Exposure Draft of the “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009″.
The recommendations are:

The Senate must reject the “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill” on the basis of its “Two Fatal Flaws” – the science and the economics. It is not supported by independent scientific assessment, nor does it present any credible cost benefit analysis. Moreover, at a time when politicians are calling for better financial disclosure and discipline, this Bill is alarming in its deceptive advertising, shows contempt for good practice by omitting independent expert reports, and stands condemned for failure to disclose the numerous vested interests supporting its claims.
The Bill should also be rejected for promoting the risky and repugnant idea that Australia can or should lead the world into universal acceptance of a massive program of wealth distribution administered by bodies such as the United Nations. This shows a lack of appreciation of the fact that popular opinion all over the world is turning strongly against the global warming hysteria, and many significant industrial nations such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are motivated solely by what they see will promote their own national interest and industrial strength.
Finally the Bill should be rejected because of the naivety of people who tell us that a nation which generates 90% of its electricity from coal, and which also prohibits nuclear power, can maintain energy supplies for its people while cutting per capita production of carbon dioxide by 30% over the next decade or so. This cannot be done without either significant cuts in living standards or reduced population.
However, the Carbon Sense Coalition supports every initiative to reduce pollution of land, air or water. We also support energy conservation, and oppose any subsidies that encourage waste and overuse of any energy type.
However neither of these worthy goals have anything to do with the effect of carbon dioxide on global warming. Unproven climate scares should not be used to promote secret agendas to introduce massive new consumption taxes on top of the rash of taxes already there such as Goods and Services Tax, Income Tax, Payroll Tax, Coal and Oil Royalties, petrol excise, vehicle and stock levies and so on

There are no climate benefits in mandating ever increasing shares of the electricity market for “renewable” energy. Therefore any scheme to generate electricity should stand on its own feet with no special tax breaks, subsidies or mandated market shares to support it.
All of this also leads to the conclusion that mandating market shares for “renewable energy” is not justified. This is just a sneaky way to impose taxes on conventional electricity generators in a way that most consumers will not notice. It is part of a deliberate Stealth Tax Scheme. It will stifle growth and deter economic recovery.
Mandated market shares are incompatible with the logic (if there is any) of Emission Trading Schemes or carbon taxes.

https://carbon-sense.com/2009/02/10/check-the-science/,,The Need to Check the Science of Climate Change,"The Department of Climate Change base their case for Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW), now referred to as ‘Climate Change’, on an uncritical acceptance of the IPCC’s Reports. Claims are made that these findings are supported by a ‘consensus’ of scientists and scientific opinion.
 
This however is increasingly not the case as literally thousands of peer reviewed and published papers and many thousands of highly respected scientists, including some who contributed to the IPCC Reports, are now concerned that these findings lack an adequate or convincing scientific base.

Despite the expenditure of over $50 billion to find evidence that man-induced greenhouse gasses are the primary cause of the current warming, not one piece of empirical evidence in support of this theory has been found.
 
The infamous ‘Hockey Stick Graph’ (Mann et al.) has been comprehensively discredited and has been removed by the IPCC from their 4th Report. It is therefore surprising to still find it in the government’s section on the scientific justification of ‘Climate Change’.
 
Likewise the claims that temperature has historically over the last 650,000 years moved in close relationship with levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is disingenuous. The Vostok and other ice core data clearly show that there is an average 800-year lag time between temperature rise and the subsequent increase in CO2 levels. This clearly indicates that CO2 was not the cause of the warming but resulted naturally from it, and that the peak levels CO2 reached did not inhibit the subsequent coolings that occurred.
 
There is much evidence that warming has occurred and that CO2 (and other greenhouse gasses) have increased, but no evidence to link the two. There are other valid explanations.
 
The IPCC (and the Australian Government) are therefore relying solely on computer models to justify their stand. While these models have improved, it is nevertheless widely accepted that they are incapable of predicting future climate. Even the IPCC agree.
 
And even Houghton says, “The fact that the mean global temperature has increased since the late 19th century and that other trends have been observed does not necessarily mean that an anthropogenic effect on the climate has been identified. Climate has always varied on all time-scales, so the observed change may be natural” (Chapter 1 of Houghton et al 2001).
 
Climate models are ‘uncertain’ about the effect of clouds on temperature and entirely ignore the influence of the varying magnetic flux of the sun and its effect on world climate, amongst many other shortcomings.
 
The world has failed to warm over the last decade, despite rapidly escalating levels of CO2. This fact alone should be cause to at least check the facts before implementing far reaching new policies designed to ‘mitigate’ climate change.
 
But the reasons are much broader than this and the consequences for both the Australian population and the Government from ‘getting it wrong’ are so great that it would be both wise and prudent to at least comprehensively and openly check the science before implementing these measures.
 
Finally, even if Australia entirely eliminated its emissions (impossible), China alone last year increased its emissions by more than our total, effectively negating all Australian actions and making them a costly exercise in futility.

Global climate is not a still life, it is a moving picture. Weather and climate (average weather
over 30 years) are always changing, but mankind has little to do with it and can do nothing to
change it. Life has always been threatened by natural disasters such as cyclones, droughts,
floods, blizzards, hail storms, earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. Sensible people accept
that and try to be prepared for what seems most likely to occur. Right now, global cooling
seems more likely to occur than global warming, but we should be prepared for either.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/12/23/solar-energy-and-oil-dependence/,,Is solar energy a viable solution to reducing oil dependence?,"by Allan Taylor
From 
http://www.helium.com/items/1270584-is-solar-energy-solution-to-us-oil-dependence
No, solar energy is not the solution to reducing US oil dependency.
Considerable progress has been made in the development and use of solar energy world wide over the last decade. This is a good thing and no doubt will continue. But where does solar energy fit into the overall energy crisis problem?

The production of oil in the US has been declining since about 1975 due to apparent depletion of oil fields and to unfavorable Federal Government intervention and regulation, such as banning offshore drilling and closing down of oil wells. After all, why produce oil yourself when it can be imported more cheaply?
The recent sudden oil price hike to the unheard of $148 a barrel was a wake up call to the US, illustrating its precarious economic and strategic position in the world. The source of much imported oil is from Venezuela and some Middle East Arab countries which are not exactly friendly to the US. They seem to take a delight in taking a swipe at the world’s super power!
Today (December 2008), on settling in of the global financial crisis, the price of oil has plummeted to ca $45 a barrel! Why has this happened? Demand for and the use of oil couldn’t possibly have dropped over 50% within a month. Maybe credit to buy it has dried up?
The oil exporting countries are none too happy about the situation. For many this is their sole source of foreign currency and their economies are geared to having an oil price much higher, like $70 a barrel or more (Government expenditure always rises to meet income). OPEC has now decided to reduce supply by ca. 5%, in hope of improving the price and income for them. What a shambles the world economy is in!
Americans are rightly concerned about their over dependence on oil imports. What to do about it has produced a wide range of ideas and created businesses which need careful analysis as to their sensibility and viability. The time factor is important as these projects may be short, medium or long term solutions, or non-solutions to the problem (i.e., years to decades for results).
The popular response to the energy crisis today is to move away from the use of fossil fuels and towards “renewable energy”, such as solar and wind power and biofuels. This idea is promoted by Obama and the Democrats, and of course the Green Movement.
This is emphasized by Obama’s recent appointment for Secretary of Energy, namely Professor Steven Chu, of the University of California, Berkeley, an expert on renewable energy and Nobel Prize co-winner (Physics 1997). Chu is also the Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which is a center for research into biofuels and solar energy technologies, which employs 4000 people and has a budget of $650 million (Wikipedia).
If the future development of solar energy is going to make an impact on the energy crisis then it would seem that the choice of Steven Chu as Secretary of Energy is an excellent one. Well done Obama!
However, on reading the fine print of Chu’s biography I have my doubts that anything positive will come of it all. A major research objective of the National Laboratory is to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He is an advocate of alternative energy and believes that it is essential to move away from fossil fuels to combat global warming. In other words, he is a believer of Al Gore’s propaganda and the Green’s “Theory of Cataclysmic Global Warming”. He has to accept this to maintain his research grants. Chu, in my opinion, is “out on a limb and can’t get back”, and also, he is “barking up the wrong tree”.
This does not harbor confidence in many people for the future economy and prosperity of the USA!
So what is the solution to the energy crisis?
Firstly it is necessary to realize that all this demonization of carbon and atmospheric CO2 is unwarranted. It arises from it being an essential part of the Green religious propaganda but has no support from scientific observation. It is simply religious dogma. Like in the Middle Ages it was generally believed that the sun and moon revolved around the earth. The skeptics were imprisoned or burnt at the stake!
In fact, atmospheric CO2 produced by power stations, other industrial plants and automobiles acts as a free fertilizer for the biosphere. We need, of course to remove pollution from sulfur, particulates, and other minor toxic components of combustion, but CO2, like water vapor, is harmless and essential to life on earth. Atmospheric CO2 is NOT a pollutant. The gradual increase observed in atmospheric CO2 over the last 100 years, to 380 ppm, has been very beneficial to mankind by increasing crop yields and rates of growth. At atmospheres below 200 ppm CO2, plants wither, but at 1000 ppm they are quite happy and grow prolifically, such as when used in commercial controlled hothouse environments.
Also, the idea that increasing atmospheric CO2 causes global warming is bunkum, (nor can it make the oceans acidic), as shown by the huge amount of scientific evidence that has accumulated over the last decade. The United Nation’s IPCC which promotes this fraudulent scare mongering should be ignored (preferably sued) otherwise the world will descend further into economic chaos. This has already started due to the dodgy financial systems promoted by US bankers and financial “experts” of Wall Street. As President Putin of Russia is reported as saying ” You Americans started it all and caused this chaos”. However, maybe we can also lay blame on the Europeans (EU) for promoting all the bunkum about global warming and promoting a useless and harmful “Emission Trading Scheme” to remedy this non-problem.
Let’s forget about who is to blame and consider what to do about it all.
Once you accept the true state of affairs, that is that CO2 gas is an essential component of the atmosphere for life to exist and that more of it is a good thing then the best path ahead is obvious.
The world economy is totally dependent on oil for transport fuels and petrochemicals which maintain our present high standard of living. I predict that this will be so FOR EVER because the properties of element carbon and its derivatives are so unique that there are no adequate substitutes. Viva Carbon!
Also, I predict that in the year 2100, your descendants will be happily driving a GM? product (or Toyota) automobile fueled by gasoline, diesel or LPG.
Obviously, Professor Chu, the Director of the National Laboratory in Berkeley has got it wrong.
It would be more sensible if the objectives of this high powered laboratory were rotated 180 degrees and they concentrated on how to get “more bangs for the buck” out of fossil fuels.
Forget about Al Gore and his religious mania and get back to science!
For starters, immediately the US should get rid of Government restrictions on drilling for oil both on and off shore, so as to boost domestic production. Ditto impediments on construction of thermal and nuclear power stations. Requirements for utility companies to produce 10 or 20% of power from renewable resources should be abolished, this just being part of the Green’s eco-religious nonsense.
Research and development should concentrate on finding better, and more efficient ways of getting hydrocarbon fuels from coal and oil, and of generating electricity, without undue pollution, bearing in mind that atmospheric CO2 is NOT a pollutant.
Let us squeeze the last drop of oil out of the fields we know about. Let’s find new oil fields that we suspect exist. Let’s query the traditional theory of oil formation. What about the igneous origin of oil? What about the role of meteorite impact on the origin of oil? Let’s apply de Bono’s invention of lateral thinking to the problem , or are you a Greenie and content to accept the religious bunkum promoted by Al Gore? God help America!
Much needs to be done on defining the enormous reserves of oil shales and sands that exist and which in the latter part of this century I predict will be the main source of our petroleum. How best to mine it? Open cut methods no doubt, but how to process it?
We have coal reserves sufficient to last a couple of hundred years, maybe 1000 years. Natural gas reserves too are extensive. R & D needs to concentrate on how better to extract and produce transport fuels, both natural and synthetic, such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel and propane (LPG) so that in future we can fuel our cars, buses, trucks and airplanes.
I feel sure that this is the sensible way ahead out of the energy crisis.
Concurrently, it is very important to conserve (not waste) the hydrocarbon fuels so produced.
Longer term is the need to address the transport infrastructure of major cities. Ideally, people shouldn’t have to drive their cars to work. It is important to have efficient rail, light rail, tram and bus services get people moving around, also having inner city free transport is a good thing. Working at home with a computer link to the office should be encouraged.
I am optimistic for the future because I believe that this bizarre global warming bandwagon will fizzle out within a couple of years. Let’s hope so!

This is the worst possible outcome. 
Better they stayed at 25% tax, which would have provoked such a revolt that even the Liberals would have objected. The whole thing would then have been abandoned at the first opportunity.
But this sneaky Fabian tax will get onto the books and we will all be trained to submit annual returns to the Greenhouse office. Then later, exemptions will be abandoned, the tax will become a permanent feature of the mess called the Australian Tax “System”, and 5% will creep to 10%, to 20%, where they wanted it in the first place.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/12/13/geopolitics-climate-change/,,The Geopolitics of Climate Change,"By Lance Endersbee
23 October 2008
In the western nations there is a strong popular belief that mankind is causing global warming, and that natural climate change has ceased. We are told that man-made climate change will determine our future, with warmer climates, increased droughts, and rising sea levels. The media have become advocates in support of this view, and contrary debate is suppressed. Western governments now plan to “stop” climate change, an arrogant idea that has already caused enormous costs. In my view it is all a scientific scandal, a political farce, and a financial calamity. Meanwhile, certain other nations are profiting by the popular delusion in the west, notably Russia, and China.

The Russian Academy of Sciences rejects the UN/IPCC view that the combustion of carbon fuels causes global climate change. The Russian government is alert to the fact that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, and regard emissions trading as financial game playing. Air pollution in cities, and global climate change, are scientifically separate matters.
The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions. Russia was not an original signatory, for scientific reasons. Even though they regarded the IPCC conclusions as wrong, Russia finally signed the Protocol, for commercial purposes. It was evident to the Russians that western governments were being stampeded by false prophets, that the many of the actions proposed in western nations were scientific nonsense, and enormously harmful to their economies.
The financial opportunities for Russia were truly enormous. Because of the decline in Russian industry with the end of the cold war, carbon emissions had declined. This was a credit under the Kyoto Protocol.
The total value of Russian carbon credits was estimated at $40 to $60 billion. But if future negotiations to extend the Kyoto Protocols were to collapse, the carbon credits would be worth nothing. The Russian energy giant Gazprom moved quickly to bundle carbon credits with contracts for sale of natural gas and oil to Europe. Russia became the world’s largest exporter of oil and natural gas.
Russia is now very active in energy supply to Europe, helped by carbon trading. It is all quite business like and pragmatic. Europe now buys over 40% of its oil and gas from Russia, Germany 80%. The demand is rising rapidly, and almost all the increase is from Russia. Because of environmental concerns, Europe is not building any new coal or nuclear electricity generation, and using gas for electricity generation. Plans for new electricity generation in Britain also depend on Russian gas.
The future of the EU is now heavily dependent on Russia. Europe simply cannot cut itself off from Russian oil and gas. Europe is concerned about this, but helpless. It has all been a Russian geopolitical victory, made possible by the popular delusion in the west about climate change. The Russian incursion into Georgia, and their confident rejection of EU and US criticism, reveals the new geopolitical reality. Meanwhile, it seems that the Russian government has not moved to pass legislation to implement the Kyoto Protocol domestically.

I wish to complain about the Australian Government “Climate Change” advertisement currently showing on Australian TV (August, 2008). The text of the advertisement is as follows:

“Scientists warn Australia will be hit hard by climate change, with temperatures rising, water more scarce, and economists warn to protect our economy we must act now. We’re developing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to tackle climate change, putting a limit on carbon pollution, and encouraging cleaner energy solutions. Think ‘climate’, think ‘change’. We can’t afford not to.”
I claim the advertisement fails these Advertising Standards Bureau Truth and Accuracy issues:

Misleading or deceptive advertising.
Misrepresentation in advertising.
The exploitation of community concerns in relation to portraying a product or service as benefiting the environment, if it does not.


The advertisement says, “scientists warn”, without qualification or reference to whom those scientists are. There are many scientists who dispute that climate change will cause significant problems. [http://www.petitionproject.org/; http://www.climatescienceinternational.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid=1; http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.SenateReport]
There is no qualification of what “hard hit” means.
There is no qualification of how high temperatures are supposedly going to rise; thus it is impossible to know from the advertisement whether such rises are significant and will thus result in a “hard hit”.
There is no qualification of whether “more scare” water applies to certain areas of Australia, nor of how significant such scarcity will be.
The reference to “economists warn” does not reference those economists, or that there are dissenting economists with differing views.
The advertisement uses the term “carbon pollution”. That is a meaningless (and misleading and deceptive) phrase. Carbon is an element. In the context of the climate change discussion, carbon as an element is not part of the discussion. The advertisement should refer (at least) to carbon dioxide, which is a gas.
The advertisement states that “carbon”, hence carbon dioxide, is a pollutant. But carbon dioxide is an essential gas present in trace amounts in the atmosphere. Without it, life on earth would not exist. Except in high concentrations, carbon dioxide is harmless to humans. There is considerable doubt that increases in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are a significant cause of increased temperatures.

The advertisement implies all climate change is something to avoid (“We’re developing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to tackle climate change…”), but does not mention that climate has been changing for thousands of years, with the earth having been both colder and warmer than it is now. That is a misrepresentation of facts. [http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm#2000]
The advertisement exploits community concerns by attempting to cause fear by using the phrases “hard hit”, “must act now” and “can’t afford not to”.
The claim that we “must act now” are misleading because it implies temperatures are rising at a dangerous rate. In fact, global temperatures since 1998 have not passed that 1998 peak, and early 2008 global average temperatures are marginally less than the equivalent period of 1988 (repeating: 1988, not 1998). [http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/what-a-difference-20-years-makes/; http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm#2000]
The claim that a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will “tackle climate change”, presumably successfully, is false and deceptive. Australian greenhouse gas emissions are less than 1.5% of global emissions, so even if such a scheme were to be totally successful in eliminating all Australian emissions, the effect globally would be minuscule.
The phrase “We can’t afford not to” is misleading and deceptive. There is no qualification as to what the costs will be, so it is impossible for the advertisement to so claim.
The advertisement displays images of both cooling towers and “smoke stacks”. Both are deceptive. In the case of cooling towers, the only emission is of condensed water vapour. In the case of the smoke stacks, there is a misleading confusion of particulate pollution with colourless carbon dioxide gas.

The advertisement thus fails, in many instances, the tests for truth and accuracy.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/08/04/clearing-the-smog/,,Clearing the Smog of Beijing with “Coal by Wire.”,"A statement by Viv Forbes, Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition.
[PDF version of this document is here; 32KB]
As the TV turns nightly to Beijing, we can expect chilling pictures and doomsday comments about the “Asian Pollution” and the “Beijing Smog”. This will induce media and political scaremongers to use these images to sell dud products like the “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme”.
It is not carbon dioxide from burning coal that pollutes the skies of Asia and Africa. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring, clean, invisible, beneficial gas. CO2 is an essential part of the natural world but a very minor trace constituent of our atmosphere.

The major gases in the atmosphere are Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%) and Argon (less than 1%). These three gases make up 99.9% of the atmosphere (ignoring the variable water vapour which can rise to 4%). Seven other trace gases, including CO2, together make up less than 0.1% and CO2 is less than 0.04%.
This trace amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is the aerial food store for all plants, and thus also sustains all animals, including humans. CO2 is a boon to life, not a pollutant.
Moreover, the claim that man’s emissions will cause dangerous global warming is strongly and increasingly disputed by scientists and is not supported by historical evidence. It also defies common sense to believe that such a minor natural gas can cause all the climate disasters that are blamed on it.
We are about to hang an innocent hero.
Asia’s visible pollution is largely caused by the crude and inefficient open air combustion of low quality fuels. It is caused by millions of open-air cooking fires in India, China, North Korea and Africa using scavenged fuels like cow dung, cardboard, wood, and low quality coal and coke; by thousands of backyard brickworks and small dirty furnaces along the Yangtze River and in other places; by forest clearing fires in Indonesia and bush and grass fires elsewhere; and by millions of small obsolete and dirty wood, charcoal and coal stoves, heaters, boilers and furnaces all over Asia and Africa. Similar pollution is obvious in places in South America. “Open fires” was the cause of similar smogs in England as recently as the 1950’s.
Open-air combustion of poor quality carbon fuels produces not only the harmless clean so-called “greenhouse” gases of water vapour and carbon dioxide, but also real pollutants such as soot, smoke, ash, dust, unburnt fuel and chemicals containing sulphur, chlorine, nitrogen, fluorine, and metals. In confined unventilated places, open fires can also produce the very poisonous gas, carbon monoxide – this is the one that will quickly kill the canary. China also emits more sulphur dioxide than anywhere else in the world. This chokes their people, causes acid rain and damages buildings.
The elements contained in smoke pollution all came from rich ancient soils in the first place, and are needed in soils today in trace quantities to maintain the health of plants and animals. In dilute quantities, they are not a problem in the atmosphere, and rain recycles them to enrich the soil. But when concentrated in city air, they can be visible, annoying, corrosive or even toxic.
The “Asian Brown Cloud”, is a haze of pollution about 3 km thick and sometimes covering an area as big as Australia. The brown haze obscures the sun in some polluted Asian cities and at times this cloud drifts right across the Pacific Ocean and is noticed as far away as the west coast of America.
This pollution is already affecting local climate and community health. In Arctic areas, soot drifts onto snow making it darker in colour which allows it to absorb more heat from the sun. This process may be contributing to melting glaciers in China and the Himalayas.
The western world went through this pollution phase half a century ago, and although improvements can still be made, we have banished the notorious smoke pollution in places like London, Manchester and Pittsburgh.
Today’s Beijing Smog is a tame affair compared some air pollution events of the past.
For the century ended in about 1960, London smoke pollution was so bad that the city became known as “The Big Smoke”. Children developed rickets from the lack of sunshine, plants and animals died and lung disease was widespread. Mike Williamson, a Brisbane resident who lived in Yorkshire at that time, says that the smog was sometimes so dense that a driver could not see the curb, and the passenger was obliged to walk along the edge of the road with a torch to lead the way. Mike says “Buses stopped running and trains ran with difficulty because signals could not be seen. Detonators were placed on the rail tracks to warn trains of potential dangers.”
England’s last and worst ever pollution event, “The Black Fog” of 1952, was triggered by a temperature inversion over London. Visibility was reduced to less than one foot and 4,000 Londoners died from SO2 poisoning (50 in one small London park alone).
This shock brought action.
Two things cleared the Big Smoke from London and Manchester. Firstly was the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1956 – cooking and heating with open fires of wood and coal was banned in big cities. But bans would not have worked without other better heating options. No matter what the laws say, people will use whatever fuel they can find to keep warm and cook their food. Londoners only stopped burning wood and coal in their homes when electricity and smokeless fuel came available. The government encouraged people to use electricity – it was called “Coal by Wire”. Clean coal-powered electricity saved the forests from destruction and cleared the smog from the air.
The western world has largely beaten its city smogs, firstly with inventions such as the chimney and the stove, secondly with clean air legislation and anti-pollution technology and finally with the magic of electricity – the clean, silent, invisible “Coal by Wire”.
This clean energy can be generated reliably 24 hours a day, using high quality coal in non polluting power stations located far from densely populated areas. It is then transported silently and cleanly with zero pollution and minimal loss of energy to deliver lighting, heating, cooling, cooking and motive power into the most humble home in the poorest suburb. It is the magic of the modern world.
To fly over a modern non-polluting coal-fired power station at say 10,000 m is to put things into perspective – a puny cooling tower or two emitting wisps of water vapour (steam). They also emit carbon dioxide, but this is invisible and harmless (in fact generally beneficial). These wisps of steam are regularly displayed dishonestly on TV to illustrate the supposed pollution caused by coal power (or they dig up a picture of an old dirty polluting power station). There is almost no pollution, no noise, no smoke and no landscapes of forests of whirling blades and solar panels in a modern coal burning power station. In fact those wisps of steam are often the only visible evidence that massive energy conversion is taking place inside – coal into electricity.
Yet that facility and its linked coal mine can supply a whole city with heat, light and power for machines as diverse as the handyman’s drill, the kitchen toaster or the locomotives that move train-loads of commuters in safety and comfort during rain, hail, snow or heatwave.
“Coal by Wire” has already banished most of the terrible pollution that affected cities such as London, Manchester and Pittsburgh, and allowed the regrowth of American forests. City pollution now comes not from coal, but from cars sitting in traffic jams caused by poor road design, inefficient traffic controls and lack of sensible pricing for congested roads.
Today’s irrational and hysterical focus on harmless carbon dioxide by governments and media is misdirected and counter-productive. It is diverting attention and resources from damaging pollution which is altering local climate and affecting many areas of the world. And it is delaying the spread of coal powered electricity to many areas now desperate for clean invisible power.
It is also giving an enormous boost to the demand for nuclear power, for all the wrong reasons.
The world pollution problem which is most obvious now in Asia, presents a real opportunity for Australian energy companies to make profits and clean up the environment. All Australians will benefit from a stronger economy and from the satisfaction that will come from being able to point to the contribution we can make to cleaning up the REAL pollution represented by the smog over the Olympic Stadium.
Instead of trying to lead the world to commit Kyoto suicide, Australian politicians should be promoting clean non-polluting modern power stations burning high quality Australian coals. Just one well designed, well scrubbed, Australian designed coal power plant running on Australian coal could provide the light, heating, cooling and entertainment silently and invisibly to the front door for about 3 million Asian homes, housing maybe 10 million people. No wonder the Chinese are importing coal and building modern power stations as quickly as they can. They recognise clearly that their huge cities need “Coal by Wire”.
History shows that people cannot and will not live without energy in their homes. Unless we allow coal to supply clean silent invisible electric energy, the people will continue to burn dung, wood, cardboard, trees, oil, charcoal or reject coal to get their warmth or cook their food.
If Asians had access to better fuel, it would allow cow dung to be used for soil improvement and would encourage forest regrowth in areas denuded by centuries of scavenging for fire wood.
Russian scientists are not conned by the Kyoto hysteria focussed on the harmless natural gas, carbon dioxide. In fact the Russian Academy of Science advised President Putin that the Kyoto Protocol had “no scientific foundation” (Putin joined Kyoto for other very sound political and economic reasons that had nothing to do with global warming).
Man’s emissions of CO2 are a miniscule factor in determining Earth’s temperature. But while we are wasting decades of time and buckets of money trying to catch and imprison this harmless Will o’ the Wisp, an ominous brown smelly choking cloud of real pollution is growing in our northern skies.
Russian ecologist Dr Sergei Golubchikov has the last word:
“Ecological treaties should seek to curb emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals and other highly-toxic pollutants instead of targeting carbon dioxide, which is a non-toxic gas whose impact on global warming has not been proved.”

BSc, BE-EE, MA (Sydney), MS-EE, MS-Stat, PhD EE (Stanford)
[A slightly shorter version of this article appeared in The Australian newspaper on Friday 18 July 2008.]
I devoted six years to carbon accounting, building models for the Australian Greenhouse Office. I am the rocket scientist who wrote the carbon accounting model (FullCAM) that measures Australia’s compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, in the land use change and forestry sector. FullCAM models carbon flows in plants, mulch, debris, soils and agricultural products, using inputs such as climate data, plant physiology, and satellite data. I’ve been following the global warming debate closely for years.

When I started that job in 1999 the evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming seemed pretty good -CO2 is a greenhouse gas, the old ice core data, no other suspects. The evidence was not conclusive, but why wait until we were certain when it appeared we needed to act quickly? Soon government and the scientific community were working together, and lots of science research jobs were created. We scientists had political support, the ear of government, big budgets, and we felt fairly important and useful (well, I did anyway). It was great. We were working to save the planet!
But since 1999 new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming, and by 2007 the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon plays only a minor role and is not the main cause of the recent global warming. As Lord Keynes famously said, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”
There has not been a public debate about the causes of global warming and most of the public and our decision makers are not aware of the most basic salient facts:
1. The greenhouse signature is missing. We have been looking and measuring for years, and cannot find it.
Each possible cause of global warming has a different pattern of where in the planet the warming occurs first and the most. The signature of an increased greenhouse effect is a hotspot about 10 km up in the atmosphere over the tropics. We have been measuring the atmosphere for decades using radiosondes – weather balloons with thermometers that radio back the temperature as the balloon ascends through the atmosphere. They show no hotspot whatsoever. Not a little hotspot, but none at all.
If there is no hotspot then an increased greenhouse effect is not the cause of the global warming. So we now know for sure that carbon emissions are not a significant cause of the global warming. If we had found the greenhouse signature then I would be an alarmist again.
When the signature was found to be missing in 2007 (after the latest IPCC report), alarmists objected that maybe the readings of the radiosonde thermometers might not be accurate and maybe the hotspot is there but went undetected. Yet hundreds of radiosondes have given the same answer, so statistically it is not possible that they missed the hotspot. Recently the alarmists have suggested we ignore the radiosonde thermometers, but instead take the radiosonde wind measurements, apply a theory about wind shear, and run the results through their computers to estimate the temperatures. They then say that the results show that we cannot rule out the presence of a hotspot. If you believe that you believe anything.
2. There is no evidence to support the idea that carbon emissions cause significant global warming. None.
There is plenty of evidence that global warming has occurred, and theory suggests that carbon emissions should raise temperatures (though by how much is hotly disputed), but there are no observations that implicate carbon emissions as a significant cause of the recent global warming. The world has spent $50b on global warming since 1990, and we have not found any actual evidence that carbon emissions cause global warming. Evidence consists of observations made by someone at some time that support the idea that carbon emissions cause global warming. Computer models and theoretical calculations are not evidence, they are just theory.
3. The satellites that measure the world’s temperature all say that the warming trend ended in 2001, and that the temperature has dropped about 0.6C in the last year (to the temperature of 1980). Land based temperature readings are corrupted by the ‘urban heat island’ effect – urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro-climate around the thermometer, due to vegetation changes, concrete, cars, houses. Satellite data is the only temperature data we can trust, but it only goes back to 1979. NASA report only land based data, and report a modest warming trend and recent cooling. The other three global temperature records use a mix of satellite and land measurements, or satellite only, and they all show no warming since 2001 and a recent cooling.
4. The new ice cores shows that in the past six global warmings over the past half a million years, the temperature rises occurred on average 800 years before the accompanying rise in atmospheric carbon. Which says something important about which was cause and which was effect.
None of these four points are controversial. The alarmist scientists agree with them, though they would dispute their relevance.
The last point was known and past dispute by 2003, yet Al Gore made his movie in 2005 and presented the ice cores as the sole reason for believing that carbon emissions cause global warming. In any other political context our cynical and experienced press corps would surely have called this dishonest and widely questioned the politician’s assertion.
Until now the global warming debate has merely been an academic matter of little interest. Now that it matters, we should debate the causes of global warming.
So far that debate has just consisted of a simple sleight of hand: show evidence of global warming, and while the audience is stunned at the implications, simply assert that it is due to carbon emissions. In the mind of the audience, the evidence that global warming has occurred becomes conflated with the alleged cause, and the audience hasn’t noticed that the cause was merely asserted, not proved. If there really was any evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming, don’t you think we would have heard all about it ad naseum by now?
The Labor Government is about to deliberately wreck the economy in order to reduce carbon emissions. If the reasons later turn out to be bogus, the electorate is not going to re-elect a Labor government for a long time. When it comes to light that the carbon scare was known to be bogus in 2008, the ALP is going to be regarded as criminally negligent or ideologically stupid for not having seen through it. And if the Liberals support the general thrust of their actions, they will be seen likewise.
The onus should be on those who want to change things to provide evidence for why the changes are necessary. The Australian public is eventually going to have to be told the evidence anyway, so it might as well be before wrecking the economy. It is the job of our opposition politicians and press to demand the evidence from the relevant minister, Penny Wong.
And what is going to happen over the next decade as the global temperature continues not to rise? When the public find out that all the above points were known in 2008, might they feel deceived, furious at the futility of the economic sacrifices?
Who is going to be held responsible? Perhaps the political class, for not having the wit to examine the evidence? Maybe the press, for not have not done even the most elementary job of informing a debate and asking questions? (If any of the missing signature, the lack of actual evidence, the lack of temperature rises since 2001, or the 800 year lag of CO2 in the ice cores are news to you, then no, your press has not been keeping you well informed.)
Don’t you think some evidence is required before wrecking the economy? Someone simply has to demand to see evidence. You will find that there is none.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/07/20/alleviate-world-hunger/,,Alleviate world hunger: produce more clean carbon dioxide,"By Dirck T. Hartmann Thursday, July 3, 2008
(Editor’s Note: To many in the know, Dirck T. Hartmann, who worked on the Apollo Space Program and many other significant NASA projects, was a fighter pilot in WWII, flying P38s. So when this gifted scientist/engineer/physicist and 87-year-old hero felt compelled to answer the questions of Man Made Global Warming, not only his son and grandchildren knew he had something to say with factual substance, truth and knowledge. What he has to say is clear and concise and should be read by everyone.)
What is your carbon footprint? That is the wrong question to ask. A more meaningful question is – How much carbon dioxide does it take to grow the wheat required to produce a loaf of bread? Or – How much carbon dioxide does it take to grow the corn for the chicken feed required to produce a dozen eggs?

Far from being a pollutant, man along with every animal on land, fish in the sea, and bird in the air is totally dependent on atmospheric carbon dioxide for his food supply.
Some politicians complain that the United States with only 3% of the world population uses 25% of the energy. But the clean carbon dioxide which we produce is increasing food production everywhere on earth. China, on the other hand, is building new power plants at a record rate using the abundant domestic supply of coal they have and has now passed the United States as the leading producer of carbon dioxide. Although their coal has a high sulfur content, they are building the new plants without any pollution controls. The sulfur dioxide which these power plants are releasing to the atmosphere, besides smelling like rotten eggs is, in sunlight, readily converted to sulfur trioxide, the highly solublegas responsible for most acid rain.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, using energy from sunlight, convert carbon dioxide and water into high energy fuels. It is responsible for all the fuel that feeds forest fires, and for the rapid grow-back of fuel after a fire. But even with the hundreds of millions of tons of coal and the billions of barrels of oil and gasoline that are burned annually, the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere remains about .04%.
It has been estimated that more than two hundred billion tons of atmospheric carbon are fixed yearly by photosynthesis, 10% to 20% by land plants, and the remaining 80% to 90% by plant plankton and algae in the ocean, which constantly resupply us with oxygen. Atmospheric carbon dioxide acts like a thermostat for plant growth, increases triggering vast blooms of ocean algae, and spurts in the rate of growth of land plants. As long as man burns coal and oil responsibly, that is with pollution controls that minimize the production of acid rain, the earth can never have too much carbon dioxide. The plants will not permit it.
Anyone who has lived in a desert area where the relative humidity is frequently below 5%, knows that dry air is a lousy green house gas. It can be 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) during the day yet cool off so rapidly that a sweater is needed two or three hours after sunset. Despite the heat sink of the ground with rocks hot enough to fry an egg, the heat is radiated rapidly away through the dry air to the clear night sky. Since dry desert air has about the same .04% concentration of carbon dioxide as air everywhere else, it is not credible to conclude that carbon dioxide is causing global warming
Water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas by far. With high humidity, even without cloud cover, the night air cools at a rate so slow as to be nearly imperceptible, particularly if you are trying to sleep without air conditioning.
High humidity is the reason nights are so balmy in the tropics. At 100 degrees F and 100% relative humidity, water vapor accounts for only 2% of the atmosphere. It has a greater effect than all other greenhouse gases combined but, since it cannot be regulated, is rarely mentioned as a greenhouse gas.
If human activity is not the cause, why are the ice sheets on the earth poles receding? They are melting for the same reason that the polar caps on Mars are melting. For the 200 years or so that a record of sun spot activity has been kept, it has been observed that global temperatures on earth correlate closely with sun spot activity, very low activity corresponding to a mini ice age, and high activity to global warming.
Every second the sun converts 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium, consuming its mass at the rate of 4 million tons per second. It has been doing this for 4.5 billion years and has about 4.5 billion years to go before all its hydrogen is used up. At that time it will have consumed less than 1% of its mass. This enormous solar furnace is responsible for climate change as well as all weather on earth.
The U.S. has a domestic supply of coal that is alone sufficient to meet our present power needs and projections for growth for at least 1,000 years, even without building any new nuclear power plants. Burning the coal responsibly and releasing the carbon locked up in it as clean carbon dioxide will benefit crop yields all over the earth. The great atmospheric patterns of air movements ensure a steady supply of carbon dioxide for crop growth, and a steady supply of oxygen for animals and people. To increase the rate at which photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a respected scientist proposed to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, seeding the ocean to trigger algae blooms. This practical, inexpensive, highly effective means for sequestering carbon dioxide would benefit the food chain in the oceans and increase fish populations. But because it did not impose hardships, require trading carbon credits, punish the U.S. or any other nation, or require increased governmental control, the IPCC rejected it. The IPCC uses the hoax of man made global warming to increase its power and that of a corrupt, anti-American United Nations that has proven itself impotent in combating world wide acts of terrorism, genocide in Sudan, the real threat of nuclear proliferation in the mid-east from Iran and Syria, or human rights violations in China and Africa.
Our mainstream media uses every opportunity to hype the hoax of man made global warming by repeated reporting of data and events that appear to support it, and ignoring those that contradict it. When the NFC championship game In 2007 between the Packers and the New York Giants was played at Green Bay in record low temperatures and blizzard conditions, there was no mention of global cooling; nor was there any in 2007 when below freezing temperatures threatened the vegetable crops in the south and the citrus crops in Florida. The drought in California is the result of colder than normal conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the fact that ocean temperatures along the Pacific coast have been falling for the last three years is never mentioned. But after hurricane Katrina we were fed a host of dire predictions which warned of the increasing severity of storms, the melting of the polar ice caps, and the flooding of coastal areas from rising sea level, if we do not drastically reduce the release of greenhouse gasses to combat global warming. Which greenhouse gasses is not specified. We already have pollution controls in the smokestacks of most power plants, steel mills, and factories that minimize the release of sulfur dioxide.
The only completely uncontrolled exhaust gas is carbon dioxide, and photosynthesis automatically controls its atmospheric concentration for us.
Three billion years ago when the earth’s atmosphere was an unbreathable brew of noxious gases with almost no oxygen, a small green algae evolved in the ocean which, using the energy from sunlight over a few million years, completely altered the earth’s atmosphere. This oceanic green algae, the first plant to use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide and water into high energy fuel, was of course followed by the evolution of an almost limitless number and variety of carbon dioxide consuming plants.
Fortunately for mankind and all animals, fish,and birds, all of whom are totally dependent on plants, the oceanic green algae continues to perform its magic in the oceans of the earth today. Every three centuries all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and dissolved in the waters of the earth goes through the cycle photosynthesis, decay, photosynthesis, with the cycle constantly renewing the earth’s supply of oxygen.
People on the left claim global warming is real, a threat to the continued existence of mankind, and the debate as to its cause is over! Although none of this is true, it nevertheless is what four of my grandchildren were taught in high school. Most politicians on the left have little respect for truth and no regard for clarity, and apparently many high school teachers reflect their views. My oldest granddaughter just graduated from MITwhere she was spared the political rhetoric of the left on global warming. However Caltech’s Argyros Professor and professor of chemistry, in an article titled “Powering the Planet” states “The carbon dioxide we produce over the next 40 years, and its associated effects will last for a timescale comparable to modern human history. This is why, within the next 20 years we either solve this problem or the world will never be the same.” This is nonsense. It ignores the more than 200 billion tons of carbon that is sequestered yearly through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide In the atmosphere. Since this has been known for 40 years, I can only assume he is politically motivated to make such a statement. Hopefully man made global warming will come to be recognized for the hoax it truly is.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/07/20/safely-graze/,,Cows and Sheep May Safely Graze?,"Opinion piece by Prof. David Bellamy
28 June 08
Cows and Sheep May Safely Graze?
As a youngster in a post war London I was brought up on lamb and anchor butter from New Zealand.
My first dabble into TV commercials was with WOOLMARK NZ, in what became a successful attempt to slow down the ingress of synthetic fibre into the carpet market. I still meet sheep farmers around the world who greet me their thanks and a pint of beer.
I still delight in your butter and lamb which I can buy in my local supermarket, the latter at half the price of the local product sold in our village butchers shop.
What a strange world we live in now bombarded with the rhetoric of food miles let alone tourist miles.

Hence I beg leave to put in this plea for the good husbandry of these two ruminants.
Cows and sheep are Mother Nature’s own brand of internal combustion engines. They get their energy by “burning” cellulose, the same stuff wood is made of.
During their life they produce all sorts of useful things; butter, cheeses, curds, dripping, gelatine, hide, horn, yoghurt, lamb, lard, milk, mutton, tallow, whey and wool.
Each one is a solar powered, self building, repairing and regenerating mobile mini supermarket. The solid waste from which is recycled, returning organic compost to the soil.
At the end of their useful lives any potential waste can be turned into heat and power.
Both of these amazing mammals depend on teeming hordes of ever smaller, internal combustion engines, (mini beasts, yeasts and bacteria) that live within their complex stomachs.
Chewing is not enough to crack open the tough cellulose packaging that wrap the goodies in each and every plant cell.
To release the energy rich fuels, (sugars, proteins and fats) stored within the cellulose boxes that make up the grasses and herbs, they need the power of the digestive enzymes of all their internal helpmates.
Without these, all cud chewing ruminants and non-vegetarian humans could not gainfully graze.
Please note even cows and sheep are not strict herbivores because they can and do digest these tiny animals relegating them to the ranks of the omnivores.
Exhaust from these internal combustion engines both large and small contain carbon dioxide and methane and thereby hangs my tale.
The molecules of carbon that make up their flesh, wool, hide, burps and farts is not fossil carbon.
It was sequestered from their pasture rarely longer than a year and most within a few days before their release back into the atmosphere.
Although somewhat modified by human influence they are part of the 97% of the main cycle of carbon dioxide that makes the living world go round. Not the 3% that the global warmers say are tipping the World, towards an omnivore driven armageddon.
Please note that long before the days of New Zealand lamb the world’s paddy fields, termite mounds and rotting organic matter were producing their fare share of greenhouse gasses including methane.
The IPCC reckon there is an annual production of 600 million tonnes of methane of which 25 million tonnes remain in the atmosphere. An increase of 25 million tonnes would raise the temperature by a mere 0.005 of a degree centigrade.
Not much to worry about, especially if you take into account, the fact that since 1999 the rate of increase of atmospheric methane has slowed down dramatically. Surely these ruminants should be left to safely graze.
Unless they are strict vegetarians, I beg the carbon cops not to tax these exemplary carbon trading internal combustion engines that do such wonderful things by chewing the cud.
The green dream of bio fuels has already turned into a nightmare of starvation across the poor world while devastating local biodiversity.
Since the far off days of good old British mutton and horse drawn milk carts, more and more small farmers have gone to the wall of extinction. With ever larger farms worked by machines not people, soils have lost much of their structure and hence their self-draining and nutrient retaining capacity.
In consequence they need massive applications of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides all of which guzzle fossil fuels in their production and application.
The good news is that over the past 25 years farmers both great and small have joined forces with the Queen Elizabeth 2 Trust, DOC, conservation groups and other local and national stakeholders. Together they are working wonders of what I like to call the green renaissance.
Together they are dealing with the many feral plants and animals, while putting their patch back into more bio diverse and hence more sustainable working order.
My own small part in this was when I had the privilege to work with TVNZ and Massey University on a book and TV series called “Moa’s Ark” ready for the Treaty of Waitangi Year.
I also made another famous TV advert “Old Mans Beard Must Go” and was there both at the start and completion of the world boggling mouse proof fence around the mountain-tops of Maungatautari.
My case rests, when it comes to the future of New Zealand butter, beef, lamb, leather, mutton and wool please don’t fart in the face of common sense.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/07/16/the-deep-green-yonder/,,The Deep Green Yonder,"A response to the Green Paper on Climate Change – a comment by Viv Forbes, Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition. 16 July 2008
The Climate will fluctuate.
It always has, it always will.
Get used to it.
The Government Green Paper completely ignores the main question – should Canberra try to control the weather, or is it better to foster a strong Australia able to cope with whatever climate change brings us?
The Government also justifies the need for action on completely worthless long term forecasts of Australia’s weather.

Not even the IPCC claims an ability to forecast the weather beyond a few days, but the CSIRO has sullied its reputation by pretending they can project temperature and rainfall 30 years into the future. Why have they not revealed the calculations for these predictions? In the corporate world, anyone making such wild unsubstantiated claims would be quickly disciplined by the regulators. Public figures who repeat and embellish these scaremongering prophecies lack common sense and should also be called to account.
The only credible weather forecast for such a long period is “It will Fluctuate”.
Minister Wong obviously believes that if we give her enough powers to tax and regulate, she can change the world’s weather.
This belief is as silly as the CSIRO weather forecasts out to 2040. Man has never been able to control the weather and there is no credible evidence that his activities have caused unusual weather. In fact, despite all the hot air about carbon emissions, the world has not warmed since 1998 and has been cooling for the last 6 years. Moreover, we have had extreme droughts, floods, ice ages and global warming long before man started using coal and oil.
Minister Wong should make sure Australia has the industrial ability and economic strength to cope with any adverse weather that occurs, be it floods, fires, droughts, snow, heat, cyclones or tsunamis.
Poor people cannot cope with Climate Change and the Rudd/Garnaut/Wong carbon taxes will make every Australian poorer.
This Deep Green Paper should be recycled and replaced by an enlightened White Paper outlining how to make Australia strong and prosperous. This will provide the best insurance for our children against any climate change.

I notice someone running advertisements saying that as livestock are greenhouse emitters, we should all become vegetarians.
But this business about blaming livestock for greenhouse gas emissions is nonsense. It’s true that livestock do emit CO2 and/or methane (CH4) – but that’s only part of the story. From where does the carbon come that comprises that CO2 or CH4? From the food that the livestock eat. That is plants, which extract CO2 from the atmosphere. So animals don’t generate carbon products – they simply recycle them. In short, livestock are already carbon neutral. Likewise, so are humans (as far as our eating, burping and farting goes) – we eat either carbon neutral animals, or plants.
In fact if the vegetarians claim livestock are bad with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, then becoming vegetarian makes themselves no better than those animals, because livestock are vegetarians, too!

Excerpt:
‘In recent years another Czech threat expert has been sounding the trumpet for freedom. Vaclav Klaus was born in Prague in 1941 and became an outstanding student in economics, graduating from the University of Economics in Prague in 1963. He was allowed to study abroad in Italy in 1966 and in the USA in 1969, where he came under the influence of Milton Friedman. In 1968 he was awarded his PhD from the Institute of Economics of the Czech Academy of Sciences. From 1970 until 1987 he was kept under wraps in the State Bank of Czechoslovakia, but after the successful uprising of November 1989 he was appointed Federal Minister of Finance, and he became Prime Minister in June 1992. In February 2003, and again in February 2008, he was elected President of the Czech Republic.
‘The presidency is a non-executive role and so Vaclav Klaus has been able to immerse himself in the global warming debate. He has written a book entitled Blue, Not Green Planet, published in Czech last year and due out in English translation (as Blue Planet in Green Shackles) in the USA this May. He has spoken regularly on the issue at home and abroad. In February 2007 he was interviewed by a Prague journalist who took him to task for his refusal to accept the global warming thesis now hegemonial throughout Europe. Klaus was very blunt: “Global warming is a false myth and every serious person and scientist says so.”’

As independent scientists researching atmospheric and climate problems, we — along with many of our fellow citizens -– are apprehensive about the Climate Treaty conference scheduled for Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. This gathering of politicians from some 160 signatory nations aims to impose — on citizens of the industrialized nations, but not on others — a system of global environmental regulations that include quotas and punitive taxes on energy fuels.

Fossil fuels provide today’s principal energy source, and energy is essential for all economic growth. Stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide — the announced goal of the Climate Treaty — would require that fuel use be cut by as much as 60 to 80 percent — worldwide!In a world in which poverty is the greatest social pollutant, any restriction on energy use that inhibits economic growth should be viewed with caution. We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the emerging Kyoto protocol — to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only part of the world community — is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.
More to the point, we consider the scientific basis of the 1992 Global Climate Treaty to be flawed and its goal to be unrealistic. The policies to implement the Treaty are, as of now, based solely on unproven scientific theories, imperfect computer models — and the unsupported assumptions that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action. We do not agree. We believe that the dire predictions of a future warming have not been validated by the existing climate record. These predictions are based on nothing more than theoretical models and cannot be relied on.
As the debate unfolds, it has become increasingly clear that –- contrary to the conventional wisdom — there does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. In fact, many climate specialists now agree that actual observations from weather satellites show no global warming whatsoever–in direct contradiction to computer model results.
Historically, climate has always been a factor in human affairs -– with warmer periods, such as the medieval “climate optimum,” playing an important role in economic expansion and in the welfare of nations that depend primarily on agriculture. Colder periods have caused crop failures, and led to famines, disease, and other documented human misery. We must, therefore, remain sensitive to any and all human activities that could affect future climate.
However, based on all the evidence available to us, we cannot subscribe to the politically inspired world view that envisages climate catastrophes and calls for hasty actions. For this reason, we consider the drastic emission control policies likely to be endorsed by the Kyoto conference — lacking credible support from the underlying science — to be ill-advised and premature.

The harsh reality is that if we must cut CO2 emissions by 90%, then we have to cut our energy use by about 70%. The only proven alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear, but reactors are expensive, take years to build and have been ruled out by the Rudd government. While “dam” is a dirty word, there will be no more hydro power. Using gas for base load electricity generation is a criminal waste. Only the dangerously deluded believe that solar and wind will ever supply more than a small fraction of energy demand. It will be decades before geothermal “hot fractured rock” power is contributing significantly to the grid – if technical problems and the tyranny of distance can be overcome. “Bio-fuels” are environmentally devastating; incur a carbon-debt that won’t be repaid for decades; and are already causing global food shortages. Nuclear Fusion’s promise of unlimited clean energy could be a century away – if it is ever economically viable. “Clean coal” is expensive, unproven, and faces significant opposition from the environmental movement.
Earth Hour should be expanded to Earth Month. Electric lighting, television, computers, home heating and air-conditioning, private motor vehicles and air transportation would be banned. All energy-intensive industries would be shut down and affected workers stood down without pay.
By giving people a small taste of life under future energy rationing, and testing their resolve, Earth Month would be more than just empty, feel-good symbolism.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/05/12/where-do-plants-get-their-carbon/,,Where do plants get their carbon?,"The essential ingredient for all growing plants is CO2 in the atmosphere. But organic matter in the soil is also of value for the plant life on which we all depend. It can only be put into the soil by growing plants (including fungi) and the bacteria, worms and other microbes that live on and beside the plants. All plant and soil carbon comes, in the end, from CO2 in the atmosphere.

Leaves collect carbon and oxygen from the air, roots collect minerals, water and nitrogen plus some carbon from the soil. Plants can live without carbon in soil (as in hydroponics), but not without carbon dioxide in the air.
The biggest stupidity in the carbon debate is treating carbon dioxide as an atmospheric pollutant. All food for plants and animals comes from this gas of life – it is not a pollutant.
The second biggest stupidity in the soil carbon debate is the biofuel myth that we can use the “waste” from crops or grasslands to produce motor spirit without affecting soil fertility and productivity. There is no “waste”in a sustainable farming operation. All organic “waste” should be mulched back into the soil, to feed the soil microbes that add humus, that holds mineral nutrients and soil moisture. Every tonne of carbon trucked off from a bit of land reduces soil productivity and has to be replaced from the CO2 in the air.
Once the biofuel gets burnt in motors, it gets back to the soil or the oceans eventually via carbon dioxide in the air (unless some fool has buried the CO2 in geo-sequestration cemeteries).

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/05/10/cant-we-have-less-waste/,,"Can’t we have less waste, less pollution and more renewable energy?","Question:
I think that companies that are making millions of dollars should be forced to use renewable energy, and/or invest in it; they should be doing their bit for the planet. The government should not be forcing householders to pay a tax or more for living, food, electricity etc., especially when they can’t stop what big business does to the environment, or what the government spends the carbon money on.
You can’t be serious that the burning of fossil fuels doesn’t hurt the environment; even if you don’t believe in climate change, this would be one point that I don’t agree with. Also I don’t agree that the planet needs more emissions to be able to grow food, as plants were growing on this planet long before companies started burning fossil fuels to fuel factories.

Answer:
The key thing to grasp is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, not poisonous and is a beneficial gas in the atmosphere. It is colourless, odourless and non-toxic. It is the holes in your bread and the bubbles in your beer. And it is present in the atmosphere in minute quantities. Over 99.9% of the atmosphere is other gases, but every living creature relies on there being enough CO2 in the air to survive.
People who run greenhouses pump CO2 into them to help the plants grow. More CO2 in the air has allowed us to produce more food, and makes plants stronger and more resistant to heat, cold and drought. People have done careful experiments on this, and warmer temperatures and more CO2 are significant factors in all plant growth.
You are of course correct that plants grew long before we started to burn coal and oil, but food production (and population) were far, far lower then. Aerial fertilisation by man-made CO2 is a significant factor in allowing the growth in world population (as is in-ground fertilisation by nitrogen fertilisers from the same fossil carbon industry). No doubt people will say our population is too large, and in places that may be true, but it is not sustainable without carbon fuels and the food they help to produce and transport. That is the ugly truth, which will be illustrated in several countries soon.
There is also no essential difference between wood, grass, natural gas and coal – all are natural non-toxic hydro-carbon materials with all the elements of life in their structure. Ethanol and whiskey are man-made versions of the same things. Burning any one of them will produce mainly two harmless gases – water vapour (which is what you can see emitting from power stations) and carbon dioxide (which is invisible).
That is not to say that burning these materials in open fires does not cause addition of some gases that are noxious to humans in heavy concentrations (like oxides of sulphur, nitrogen, metals, ash and other particles, or even the poisonous carbon monoxide). The cause of the bad pollution in Asia is not coal fired power stations (modern ones remove almost everything except the beneficial gases of life: water and carbon dioxide). The clouds of pollution choking Asian cities is caused by bushfires in Indonesia, cow dung cooking fires in India, dirty smelters and open fires in China and North Korea and the occasional volcano. Most of these problems have been largely solved in the rich developed world by using clean silent invisible electricity in our cities. Cars are the big polluters in our cities, but even they improve every year.
It always seems attractive to tax the hell out of those rich corporations. But corporations are just people at the end. Our biggest coal company in Queensland is BHP, owned by millions of little people like public servants via pension funds, your parents via savings, and lots of other little people.
And we cannot contain taxes – they keep spreading around – if we tax more heavily every tonne of coal burnt, one of two things will happen (probably a bit of both) – power prices will rise, or some power stations will close down (the huge brown coal stations in Victoria, who supply massive power to the Australian electricity grid will be the first to close). Again, blackouts or increases in power costs will follow (and both are already happening because of carbon hysteria in several countries). And the share prices for coal mines and power stations will fall, making it difficult to raise more money to build wind farms, solar cities or anything else. (Why do you think the government of NSW is desperate to sell their power stations?)
There are direct taxes and sneaky taxes.
If I decide to reduce pollution in the city of Brisbane, I could put a toll gate on every main road, collecting a central city pollution tax from every vehicle. That is a direct tax. Everyone can see what it is for and what it achieves. If you don’t pollute the city with car fumes, you don’t pay it. Honest and open.
Or I could decide to force Energex to get 18% of their power from “renewables”. That costs them money for wind farms and things. There are only two places for them to get the money – from consumers like you via increased electricity charges or from shareholders like your parents via reduced dividends. These are the sneaky taxes which only one person in a hundred will recognise. And the posturing politicians who levy them can blame the increased costs on wicked corporations. (As an aside, the government of Queensland does force Energex and other suppliers to get 18% of electricity from expensive “renewables”.)
But no matter how much we wish for it, wind and solar will never supply the quantity of electricity we are using now for our survival and comfort. There is just not enough sun, wind or geothermal where we need it. Solar is good for hot water systems, but not for powering processing plants, factories and big cities. The carbon cutting goals can only be achieved by either a massive switch to nuclear power, which seems politically unlikely in Australia, or a severe reduction in power use per person.
And what about the cars, trucks, planes and ships that supply us all with daily food, travel and goods? There is no feasible option for replacing carbon fuels in less than decades, and then the only real option yet visible is hydrogen fuel generated by coal or nuclear power!
So, we cannot cut carbon usage significantly, or punish carbon using companies, without punishing ourselves severely and in unexpected ways. Already the costs of food and power are spiralling up, and the major cause is fear of carbon taxes, or subsidies that are diverting food to produce motor fuel or using up other resources to produce renewable energy.
It is a long complicated story, and most people do not go past catchy slogans. Chanting the slogans are people with other agendas, which do not include our prosperity or jobs for our kids.
Lots of people also think, deep down, that “we are a wasteful society and some good may come of all this”. Everyone thinks those other people are wasteful. But waste is a value judgement. I do not drink beer or eat bread, unless there are no polite options. Therefore the massive resources devoted to making bread and beer are “waste” in my eyes. We could turn those fields of wheat and barley to native grasses and “waste” would be reduced.
Other people do not eat meat, and thus believe people like us who breed cattle and sheep should be closed down and the land restored to national parks. What is “waste” and what is “essential” industry is a value judgement and we will never agree on any government enforced measure to “reduce waste”. In fact every law will create more waste, as it will stop some things that some people value and encourage other things that other people consider waste – no one will be completely happy. The total “waste” in society is a reflection of the amount to which government distorts things. Left to ourselves, liable for the full cost of every thing we choose to use, and not taxed for a single thing we do not want, we will minimise the total waste in society.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/04/06/all-cows-are-green/,,All Cows are Green,"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on all farmers and those who eat farm products to raise their voices in opposition to the silly proposals of Australian and New Zealand governments to include emissions and motions from farm animals as a taxable carbon emission.
The chairman of “Carbon Sense” Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that New Zealand has already agreed to include farm animal emissions in their taxable emissions output and Prof Garnaut is also thinking of driving Australian farmers to the Kyoto bail for a similar milching.

“We smart farmers in the South Pacific must have the longest cows in the world – they feed on farms in Queensland and Queenstown and are about to be milked in Canberra and Wellington.
Forbes, who is an animal breeder, pasture manager and soil scientist, said he could not believe the lack of noise from farm groups and consumers on this matter.
“Any farmer would know that no cow, sheep, pig or goat has yet managed to create carbon out of nothing. Nor do they eat fossil fuel. Every bit of carbon sequestered in meat, bones, wool and milk, or expelled in solid, liquid or gaseous animal waste, was extracted from the air by the pastures and grain crops the animals ate. Pastures, crops and soil fungi live on carbon dioxide, the universal plant food from the atmosphere, and water and minerals from the soil. Ultimately, all carbon in the food chain comes from the air (apart from some artificial “foods” made from coal or petroleum derivatives, and very minor soil humus derived from oxidised coal or oil shale).
“This carbon extraction process starts the day the animal is conceived and ceases on the day it dies. This is the carbon food cycle we all live by.
“In fact all farm animals should get a carbon credit, because they sequester part of the carbon extracted from the air in bones, meat, milk and wool. Much of this carbon then gets transferred to the bones and flesh of the growing human population, and eventually gets sequestered in sewerage (often, unfortunately, on the sea floor), bones in the coffins, and soil in the cemeteries. This is a proven process which provides more secure and far cheaper carbon sequestration than some of the billion dollar schemes being investigated.
“In this respect grazing animals are just like trees; both sequester CO2 for their lifetimes, sometimes much longer.
“Of course other parts of the food chain generate net carbon emissions for agricultural machines, processing, chemicals and transport. Each of these activities would attract its own carbon tax. None are essential elements in the raising of domestic animals – the essentials are soil, water, grass and the atmospheric gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide.
“No matter how you do the sums, farm animals cause a net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Thus they should get a carbon credit, certainly not a carbon tax.
“We all know the moon is made of green cheese. It is time to educate politicians that “All cows are also green”.

I and a few friends around Australia and overseas founded the Coalition. I have paid for the business registrations, web servers and all such related matters. No one has reimbursed me. A computer friend built the web site and has not sent a bill. He maintains our web site and has not sent a bill.
Other members have helped with research, editing and writing, and none have been paid for it.

My wife and I have paid for all email, phone, copying, postage and printing costs. And I have never sent a bill or been paid for my considerable contribution of time. Carbon Sense occupies an office under our home on a farm at Rosevale in Queensland. You are very welcome to visit, inspect and chat if you wish. We have never submitted a bill for office rent.
One long acquaintance provided us, gratis, a second hand colour printer.
A cousin who is a farmer sent two donations, totalling $1,500 to cover general expenses. A long term friend, who is a retired engineer, sent a donation of $250. There have been no other donations of any sort since Carbon Sense was formed. And we have not asked for them.
So, in summary, funding to date for the Carbon Sense Coalition is $1,750 cash and a second hand colour printer. 
(I notice on this morning’s news that Al Gore has raised $150 million of a planned $300 million for a campaign against carbon. It looks like he will outspend us. I wonder who is looking at where that big money is coming from?)
 Volunteers
You see, Louise, for committed people, reading, thinking and writing do not cost much. On this issue, the key requirement is a logical mind and a good scientific education. Many of our activists were lucky to be educated in the days when science education was a serious subject, not yet another excuse to promote some sociological agenda.
We rely on a world-wide band of volunteers, members and correspondents who assist with ideas, editing, and distributing our reports. We rely heavily on the people’s media, the internet. Our latest report was distributed in Europe, America, South Africa and New Zealand by an enthusiastic and growing band of supporters. With our network of web sites, blogs and contacts, we are dodging past the media monoliths like rabbits racing thru a mob of dozing elephants.
None of our growing band of contact managers are paid. They are motivated by their concern for the future and desire to use their knowledge to expose the truth. This coalition continues to grow and its numbers and geographical reach extend as people start to see the reality. We collaborate with about 50 other such bodies in almost every country of the world.
However, since you have raised the subject of funding, it is time we raised some funds. Should anyone offer funds with no strings attached, we would take them, even from newspaper barons. My truthfulness, opinion, or reputation is not for sale.  
Vested Interests
Funding touches on the subject of vested interests. I cannot think of a single person in Australia who has no vested interest in the Global Warming debate.
Every tax payer is being slugged for the hundreds of millions already being spent by federal, state and local governments on what we believe is a totally wasted cause. Should I be gagged because I am a taxpayer?
Every farmer faces huge increases in power and fuel costs and also carbon taxes on animal emissions. Should all farmers be prevented from speaking out? If farmers cannot speak out about their industry, who has a better right, or more knowledge?
Every person who eats food faces huge increases in food costs because of the increasing fuel and transport costs and the competition for food and land from subsidised ethanol production and carbon-credit plantations.  (I assume that you are aware of the growing international alarm about increasing food prices due largely to grains being diverted from food to fuel production?) Should I be prevented from commenting because I have a continuing interest in consuming food?
The shareholders of every coal company face bankruptcy if Bob Brown achieves his aim of closure of every coal fired power station and every coal mine. Should I be prevented from speaking out because among my investments for retirement, my wife and I hold a small shareholding in a coal mining company? Have you checked where your super-fund invests its money?
Every mining company faces huge increases in costs for power and transport if “Emissions Trading” is introduced. Should every shareholder, employee, contractor and executive in Australia’s most important industry be muzzled? 
I still earn part time money from mining and farming. I always have, long before Global Warming became a media tart. I have never hidden that fact – I am proud of it. Does this disqualify me because mining and farming are the primary targets of the anti-carbon crowd?
I travel occasionally, and the cost of travel will increase hugely because of proposed taxes on fuel. Does this disqualify me from speaking out if I believe this policy harms all travellers and tourists? 
Look Also on the Dark Side
Do not forget to look at the other side. Al Gore is earning millions from lecturing and shareholdings in companies set to benefit directly from the Cap and Trade policies he promotes. 
Moreover, every official and representative who contributes to or attends IPCC regular meetings (in remote unattractive spots like Bali, Kyoto and Rio) gets paid to do so by some poor taxpayer, as does every grandstanding politician. They are all off again on another junket right now. Have you revealed their vested interest in maintaining the rage?
Another vested interest is that large body of climate “researchers” who have received a huge slice of the $50 billion spent on this scam to date by governments around the world. Many of them are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them (although, as a farmer producing some of their food, I see they are doing just that.)
A closely related vested interest is that of the large body of dedicated environmental journalists who need daily environmental scares to keep the papers selling.
And of course do not forget the banks, merchant banks, regulators, lawyers and auditors looking forward to the enormous profit or growth possibilities in Emissions Trading. Look to the money trail – who’s going to benefit? I hope you ask them the same question you ask me.

Look for the Big News
So, Louise, I’m sorry there is no big story in the funding of the Carbon Sense Coalition.
However, there is big news in the Global Warming scam.
Have you as a citizen explored the fact that CO2 is the world’s plant food and the basis for all food on earth? Have you looked at what could happen to world food supply if we did indeed manage to significantly reduce CO2 in the atmosphere?
Are you aware that a colourless, odourless, non-toxic gas comprising a miniscule 0.038% of earth’s atmosphere and which is the source of all food on earth has been labelled a pollutant by unthinking zealots in the EPA?
Have you realised that the famed “Hockey Stick Graph” that started this whole hysteria has been proved a fabrication?
Have you reported the fact that global temperatures have plateaued for the last ten years, despite continual increases in man’s emissions of CO2?
Have your readers been told that because of the very steep fall in temperature in 2007, the average global temperature in January 2008 was the same as in January 1900?
Are you aware of the work on past climate history of the world that indicates that we have had several warm benign periods like today, but they are generally short lived. We have more to fear from barren ice ages than from today’s flourishing warm world?
Are you aware of the fascinating research by Danish scientists on the way the sun controls the formation of low level clouds, thus playing a major role in controlling surface temperature?
Have you checked out whether producing ethanol does reduce greenhouse gases?
Have you looked at what would happen to your lifestyle if we did manage to eliminate man-made CO2 emissions?
Well Louise, I hope I have given you enough material. Sorry this letter went on so long, but there is much to say. I hope to see you say more and am happy to be prompted by more questions.
If you would like to talk to some local representative of Carbon Sense in Perth, please let me know.  We may lack funds, but we do not lack people.
And remember, “David did slay Goliath”.
Yours sincerely

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/03/28/lights-out-a-sign-of-the-times/,,Lights Out – a Sign of the Times,"The Carbon Sense Coalition today came out in support of “lights out” during Earth Hour (Saturday 29th) but claimed the time should be renamed “Dark Hour” and suggested that consumers should also forgo the consumption of gasoline and diesel during this period.
The chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that consumers should spend the hour they sit in the dark with no transport, air conditioning or hot coffee, remembering the contribution that carbon fuels have made to modern society.

“And while contemplating this hour of darkness, they should steel themselves for the hour when, if the Global warming alarmists have their way, this will become a necessity not a nicety.
“The only thing that lifted mankind from the Stone Age was carbon energy from charcoal, coal, oil and gas – for heating; for steam power; for electricity and water; for mining, smelting and refining of metals; for transport on land, sea and air; for lighting, heating, cooling and communications; for production of food and chemicals; and for power for processing and manufacturing.
“All of this comfort, safety, convenience and prosperity is now threatened by hysterical claims that man’s carbon emissions can and should be stopped. Even though the weather records and the science deny the doomsday forecasts, the politicians, like lemmings, are leading us over the Greenhouse Cliff. Without the nuclear parachute, it will not be a pleasant fall. 
“Many other countries have already experienced their own dark days, most caused by silly decisions taken to appease the Greenhouse Gods.
“If we continue down this path, we can no longer assume that electricity will come at the flick of a switch. Consumers need to learn a new vocabulary for these bad new times – “load shedding, demand management, quota allocation, rolling blackouts, brownouts, emission permits, load prioritisation, interruptible customers, emergency customers, zone rota systems, power emergency declarations, priority lines, three-day-week rationing, power outages, grid instability, electricity rationing, operating reserve, maintenance shutdowns . . . ” all the jargon of a power system in crisis, suffering from stagnant or falling capacity and growing demand.
“One of the first places to experience power shortages was, appropriately enough, California in the early 2000’s, where Deep Greens have harassed and delayed every practical method of generating base-load power. The operating reserve margin in California is now about 5% whereas 15% is considered safe. More “Dark Hours” can be expected there. And their Green Tick solar collectors will produce 12 Dark Hours EVERY DAY.
“Then came South Africa, which was forced to shut its big mines for several hours because of insufficient power to guarantee safe operation of the hoists. The South African government has now admitted that demand for electricity will exceed supply until 2013 – five years of dark hours are in prospect there. 
“Then it was China’s turn. The Global Cooling of 2007 plus insufficient generating capacity and inadequate coal stocks caused widespread power failures. Whole regions and millions of people were forced to cope with blizzards without power for days. Power blackouts and brownouts hit 17 Chinese provinces.
“Then one day in Texas recently, the wind dropped, the whirling blades stopped turning, power supply collapsed and load shedding commenced before the old reliables of coal, nuclear or gas could pick up the slack.
“The aging European power grids are now also subject to similar disruptions from the intermittent supply from unreliable sources like wind and solar. However France has been very canny by building large nuclear capacity, then agitating for decarbonisation for their competitors. Foolish Germany got sucked into this caper, but also committed to phase out their nuclear power. It is not possible to cut both nuclear power and carbon emissions at the same time without morbid consequences. Germans can only continue this rot while their accommodating neighbours will sell them the power.
“Across Africa, the Americas and the -stans, the same problem appears – an aging power grid and an orchestrated campaign to delay and deter new power stations.
“Even here in Queensland, the coal capital of the world, a few blackouts in 2004 revealed an over-loaded and under-funded electricity grid. There may be a few more Dark Hours for us, at less convenient times. 
“Australia and New Zealand both live in cuckoo land, believing they can maintain living standards in the face of population growth while drastically cutting carbon emissions and prohibiting nuclear power. Saturday’s “Dark Hour” caper may be just a practice run.
“So, let us all in Australia and New Zealand spend our “Dark Hour” thinking on the realities of life – such as where we will get the electricity, motor fuel, food and jobs for our kids and grandkids if we allow the Deep Greens to destroy our backbone industries, on the false promise that our sacrifice will improve the future climate. 
To steal a phrase from my friend, Rod Bates: “On Saturday night, after they have turned off their lights, I suggest the participants in Earth Hour wander down to the nearest beach, pee into the sea and observe what effect it has on the tide.”
“This will illustrate the effect that cutting man-made carbon emissions will have on future climate.”
Additional Notes:
Both the science and the past records are indicating very strongly that man-made carbon dioxide has negligible consequences for climate change. For a very good summary of the science, by a scientist, in plain language see: www.middlebury.net/op-ed/global-warming-01.html
Given the political momentum for the introduction of damaging policies such as Emissions Trading or Carbon Taxes, Carbon Sense repeats its call for a joint ANZ Royal Commission into the science of man-made global warming.  Carbon Sense strongly believes that only through settling the science will the truth emerge.” See: www.carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/royal-commission.pdf

PS. Since the above statement was released I received an email on Monday 31st March 2008 from a South African associate, Will Alexander, a respected water engineer and Professor Emeritus of the Department of Civil and Biosystems Engineering of the University of Pretoria. (His studies of rainfall patterns also demolishes any dominant role for man-made CO2 in climate cycles.) Here is a direct quote from Pretoria, on the future facing all of us unless we wake up:
“The planned electricity blackouts also start on Monday. In our suburb the power will be switched off from 10.00 to 12.30 on alternate days of the week excluding Sundays. In addition, Eskom is urging all of us to make personal sacrifices such as switching off our geysers during daylight hours and hanging up our clothes to dry instead of using clothes driers. Cosatu has threatened to have nation-wide strikes because of the job losses. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has expressed his concern about the effect that the proposed 60% increase in electricity tariff on top of the load shedding will have on our national economy. 
“Looking on the brighter side all that is missing is the air raid sirens and Vera Lynn singing “We’ll meet again” on the battery operated radio set.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/03/26/emissions-trading-the-new-bubble-economy/,,"Emissions Trading, the new Bubble Economy","The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that imposing a Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme was not justified by the science and was likely to be very costly and disruptive to the lives of all Australians. 
Responding to the draft Garnaut report, the chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that it is becoming very clear that carbon dioxide is not a key driver of earth’s temperature, and attempts to reduce man’s emissions of CO2 will do more harm than good.

“There is certainly no justification for the premature imposition of any de-carbonisation proposals in Australia – no emissions trading systems, no cap and trade nonsense, no subsidies for converting food to motor spirit, no mandating of fairyland energy proposals, no geo-sequestration and no more carbon taxes. 
“However, if we were forced to choose between all the above unpalatable de-carbonisation alternatives, we would reluctantly support a simple carbon tax on all net direct emissions of CO2 from all industries. This should be accompanied by the IMMEDIATE abolition of all the other state and federal legislated Greenhouse foolishness. As soon as the climate and the science make it clear, even to economists such as Professor Garnaut, that man does not control the climate, we can then easily abolish the silly carbon tax (amid great rejoicing among those who do not dwell in the capital city hothouses).
“The Precautionary Principle so loved by those spreading doomsday stories on everything, suggests that a simple carbon tax is far less risky than grandiose plans to create an expensive and artificial bubble industry based on Carbon Emissions Trading. 
“The immediate effect of cap and trade legislation is the creation of new electronic assets called “permits to emit” with no reality, no separate existence, no asset backing and no intrinsic value whatsoever. Their value depends solely on a politician’s promise that people holding an emissions permit will have a protected position compared to those without a permit from the Carbon Czar. It is a principle Al Capone would have understood and welcomed.
“Immediately the government creates these securities with no substance and the Carbon Bank which stores no carbon, a huge new artificial industry will be created. There will be administrators and auditors, bankers and brokers, barristers and bureaucrats, carbon credit farmers and foresters, lawyers and lobbyists, traders and tax advisers, and all the high paid never ending research jobs in Zero-Gen and Zero emissions.
“To some people, the Greenhouse industry looks like the saviour of Australia after the last coal mine and the last cement plant are closed, the last farm becomes a carbon credit plantation, and the sounds of planes, trains, trucks, tractors and dozers are no longer heard in the land. 
“However, decarbonisation will never create one more roof on a new house, a slice of toast on one plate, a steak on a single barby, a blanket on one bed or a light in one dunny. And the warm inner glow from Canberra will not boil one kettle in Cairns. 
“When the real economy dies, so too will this huge parasitic bubble economy manufactured in Parliament. It will be better for all concerned that it is never created.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/03/09/%e2%80%9cno-regrets%e2%80%9d-is-the-best-policy/,,“No Regrets” is the Best Policy,"Manhattan Conference on Global Warming Indicates that “No Regrets” is the Best Policy.
The Carbon Sense Coalition based in Australia, says that the science and empirical evidence on Global warming is now clearly indicating that a “No Regrets” policy is the best course for the world to follow.
The Carbon Sense Coalition was one of the 52 organisations from 20 different countries which co-sponsored the recent International Conference on Climate Change in New York. Al Gore was invited to address the conference (he was even promised his $200,000 fee) but he declined to appear. Jim Hansen of NASA, another prominent alarmist, was also invited, but declined. (Contrast this with the Bali conference when a delegation of prominent sceptical scientists sought to present their petition to the UN. They were denied admission and refused an audience.)

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense” Mr Viv Forbes, who attended the conference along with about 20 other Australian and New Zealand speakers and observers, said that with over 500 delegates attending over 100 sessions presented and discussed by scientists, economists, politicians and policy analysts (many of world standing) there was no aspect of global warming science and policy that was not examined in the light of current knowledge and evidence.
For more information on the conference see:
www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=22875 and www.americanthinker.com/2008/03/ny_climate_conference_journey.html
Forbes claimed that a number of clear conclusions arose from the conference:

There is no doubt that the earth is in a warming phase, and has been in this phase for some 300 years. Warming started after the frigid years of the Little Ice Age, and has continued, in waves, ever since.
There is no doubt that the short warm eras in earth’s history have proved very beneficial for life on earth as evidenced by the rising population, increased prosperity, increased life span, increased food production and the flourishing of art and architecture that has accompanied every one of the recent warm eras. Ice Ages, not Warm Ages, are the big threats to life on earth.
There is considerable uncertainty about the future trends in earth’s temperature. However, there is close correlation between past temperature trends and variations in solar output and planetary cycles, and these indicate that the current warming is likely to end, no matter what man does, maybe within decades. The cooling may have already started.
It is very clear that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen, but close study of the correlations between CO2 and temperature shows that it is far more likely that temperature changes trigger changes in CO2 levels. Past records also show that current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are neither unusual nor concerning.
There are no credible claims or evidence from any quarter that current or projected levels of CO2 in the atmosphere pose any other threat to human, animal or plant life on earth. CO2 is not a contributor to air pollution; in fact it is a precious plant food on which all life on earth depends.
Man’s activities contribute less than 5% of total emissions into the atmosphere, and this addition has had only minor effect (probably undetectable) on the rising temperature trend.
There is good evidence that oceans, volcanoes and other natural sources expel large but variable quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. Oceans expel CO2 as they warm and absorb it as they cool.
It is agreed in all quarters that the computerised General Circulation Models utilised heavily by the IPCC to produce their warming alarms have no proven ability to forecast climate even one year in advance, let alone the 50 or more years that some people have quoted.
It is a fact that CO2 and the other atmospheric gases provide an insulating blanket to the earth, keeping surface temperature higher than it would otherwise be. However, science is agreed that CO2’s warming potential is almost exhausted, and even if current levels of CO2 doubled, it would not on its own cause alarming global warming. There is nothing to fear from CO2 induced warming.
The large positive warming feedbacks assumed by the IPCC are quite likely to be much smaller or even negative. Recent work is showing that the earth has a huge capacity to distribute and dissipate heat via winds, ocean currents, evaporation, precipitation and radiation to space. There is a large degree of self regulation in the natural global temperature controllers.

“In summary, man is not as important or as smart as some people believe he is. He is nowhere near to understanding the complex interactions between the big climate players – the sun, planetary cycles, atmospheric circulation, volcanoes and the dominating role of water in clouds, in the atmosphere, in the oceans, and in snow and ice. Moreover, his tiny contribution to an extremely minor atmospheric gas such as CO2 is highly unlikely to be the main driver of world climate.
“The inevitable conclusion to be drawn from the above observations is that man is unlikely to achieve any positive climate benefits from a very costly and disruptive policy of forcible decarbonisation of all human activities. The earth will largely ignore him.
“This indicates that the huge sums of money contributed by consumers, taxpayers and businesses to this futile war on carbon will be largely wasted, and future generations will have great regrets that their parents were so profligate with their inheritance.
Forbes claimed that the nations of the world should follow a “No Regrets Policy” which yields dividends no matter what the future climate holds.
“We should abandon all policies that assume either warming or cooling, because there is no clear evidence on what the future holds.
“We should be strengthening our ability to adapt our lifestyle and our economy to whatever climate the future holds for us. We can be certain that climate will change, perhaps dramatically, but no one is yet competent to predict it, and man is powerless to have significant effect on it.
“A “No Regrets” policy means exposing all people to the full cost of their actions, and allowing the climate and the market to deter silly practices and encourage sensible ones.
“Specifically, all governments should assist their communities to adapt to whatever changes are surely in store for us by ceasing to mandate market shares for any particular energy source, and abolishing all discriminatory energy taxes and subsidies and all limits, caps and taxes on harmless emissions of CO2. They should also abandon all plans to mandate the Emissions Trading Game – leave that to the gamblers who choose to play. It will be more fun than Monopoly with a similar outcome – a few big winners and all the rest losers.
“No one has the right to gamble the seed corn of the community on preparing for last year’s climate crisis. Governments are currently planning to spend huge and growing amounts of money on the very dubious assumption that global warming is a clear and present danger. This money would be far better spent on infrastructure to insulate us from future shortages of water, energy or food, procuring emergency equipment that can cope with ANY natural disaster, tackling real air or water pollution problems or designing policies that ensure that rising prices are left free to discourage the waste of scarce resources.
“Useful equipment and facilities and sound stable policies will serve us well in drought, flood, fire, tempest, tidal wave, global warming or global cooling.
This indeed would be a policy of “No Regrets”.
“Man believes he is a heavy hitter, confident in his ability to dominate and manipulate the climate. But he needs to remember, “Nature bats last”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/03/08/manhattan-declaration-on-climate-change/,,Manhattan Declaration on Climate Change,"“Global warming” is not a global crisis
We, the scientists and researchers in climate and related fields, economists, policymakers, and business leaders, assembled at Times Square, New York City, participating in the 2008 International Conference on Climate Change,

Resolving that scientific questions should be evaluated solely by the scientific method;
Affirming that global climate has always changed and always will, independent of the actions of humans, and that carbon dioxide (CO2) is not a pollutant but rather a necessity for all life;
Recognising that the causes and extent of recently observed climatic change are the subject of intense debates in the climate science community and that oft-repeated assertions of a supposed ‘consensus’ among climate experts are false;
Affirming that attempts by governments to legislate costly regulations on industry and individual citizens to encourage CO2 emission reduction will slow development while having no appreciable impact on the future trajectory of global climate change. Such policies will markedly diminish future prosperity and so reduce the ability of societies to adapt to inevitable climate change, thereby increasing, not decreasing, human suffering;
Noting that warmer weather is generally less harmful to life on Earth than colder:
Hereby declare:
That current plans to restrict anthropogenic CO2 emissions are a dangerous misallocation of intellectual capital and resources that should be dedicated to solving humanity’s real and serious problems.
That there is no convincing evidence that CO2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past, is now, or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change.
That attempts by governments to inflict taxes and costly regulations on industry and individual citizens with the aim of reducing emissions of CO2 will pointlessly curtail the prosperity of the West and progress of developing nations without affecting climate.
That adaptation as needed is massively more cost-effective than any attempted mitigation and that a focus on such mitigation will divert the attention and resources of governments away from addressing the real problems of their peoples.
That human-caused climate change is not a global crisis.
Now, therefore, we recommend —
That world leaders reject the views expressed by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as well as popular, but misguided works such as “An Inconvenient Truth.”
That all taxes, regulations, and other interventions intended to reduce emissions of CO2 be abandoned forthwith.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/03/07/from-climate-alarmism-to-climate-realism-vaclav-klaus/,,From Climate Alarmism to Climate Realism – Václav Klaus,"Speech by Hon Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic. March 4, 2008.
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like first of all to thank the organizers of this important conference for making it possible and also for inviting one politically incorrect politician from Central Europe to come and speak here. This meeting will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the moving away from the irrational climate alarmism to the much needed climate realism.

I know it is difficult to say anything interesting after two days of speeches and discussions here. If I am not wrong, I am the only speaker from a former communist country and I have to use this as a comparative – paradoxically – advantage. Each one of us has his or her experiences, prejudices and preferences. The ones that I have are – quite inevitably – connected with the fact that I have spent most of my life under the communist regime. A week ago, I gave a speech at an official gathering at the Prague Castle commemorating the 60th anniversary of the 1948 communist putsch in the former Czechoslovakia. One of the arguments of my speech there, quoted in all the leading newspapers in the country the next morning, went as follows: “Future dangers will not come from the same source. The ideology will be different. Its essence will, nevertheless, be identical – the attractive, pathetic, at first sight noble idea that transcends the individual in the name of the common good, and the enormous self-confidence on the side of its proponents about their right to sacrifice the man and his freedom in order to make this idea reality.” What I had in mind was, of course, environmentalism and its currently strongest version, climate alarmism.
This fear of mine is the driving force behind my active involvement in the Climate Change Debate and behind my being the only head of state who in September 2007 at the UN Climate Change Conference, only a few blocks away from here, openly and explicitly challenged the current global warming hysteria. My central argument was – in a condensed form – formulated in the subtitle of my recently published book devoted to this topic which asks: “What is Endangered: Climate or Freedom?” My answer is clear and resolute: “it is our freedom.” I may also add “and our prosperity.”
What frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published, that all rational arguments have been used, yet it still does not help. Global warming alarmism is marching on. We have to therefore concentrate (here and elsewhere) not only on adding new arguments to the already existing ones, but also on the winning of additional supporters of our views. The insurmountable problem as I see it lies in the political populism of its exponents and in their unwillingness to listen to arguments. They – in spite of their public roles – maximize their own private utility function where utility is not any public good but their own private good – power, prestige, career, income, etc. It is difficult to motivate them differently. The only way out is to make the domain of their power over our lives much more limited. But this will be a different discussion.
We have to repeatedly deal with the simple questions that have been many times discussed here and elsewhere:
1) Is there a statistically significant global warming?
2) If so, is it man-made?
3) If we decide to stop it, is there anything a man can do about it?
4) Should an eventual moderate temperature increase bother us?
We have our answers to these questions and are fortunate to have many well-known and respected experts here who have made important contributions in answering them. Yet, I am not sure this is enough. People tend to blindly believe in the IPCC’s conclusions (especially in the easier to understand formulations presented in the “Summaries for Policymakers”) despite the fact that from the very beginning, the IPCC has been a political rather than a scientific undertaking.
Many politicians, media commentators, public intellectuals, bureaucrats in more and more influential international organizations not only accept them but use them without qualifications which exist even in the IPCC documents. There are sometimes unexpected and for me unexplainable believers in these views. Few days ago, I have come across a lecture given by a very respected German economist (H. W. Sinn, “Global Warming: The Neglected Supply Side, in: The EEAG Report, CESifo, Munich, 2008) who is in his other writings very critical of the German interventionist economic policies and statist institutions. His acceptance of the “conventional IPCC wisdom” (perhaps unwisdom) is striking. His words:
– “the scientific evidence is overwhelming”;
– “the facts are undeniable”;
– “the temperature is extremely sensitive to even small variations in greenhouse gas concentration”;
– “if greenhouse gases were absent from the atmosphere, average temperature of the Earth’s surface would be -6°C. With the greenhouse gases, the present average temperature is +15°C. Therefore, the impact of CO2 is enormous”;
– he was even surprised that “in spite of all the measures taken, emissions have accelerated in recent years. This poses a puzzle for economic theory!” he said.
To make it less of a puzzle, let me make two brief comments.
As an economist, I have to start by stressing the obvious. Carbon dioxide emissions do not fall from heaven. Their volume (ECO2) is a function of GDP per capita (which means of the size of economic activity, SEA), of the number of people (POP) and of the emissions intensity (EI), which is the amount of CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP. This is usually expressed in a simple relationship which is, of course, a tautological identity:
ECO2= EI x SEA x POP
but with some assumption about causality it can be turned into a structural equation. What this relationship tells is simple: If we really want to decrease ECO2 (which most of us assembled here today probably do not consider necessary), we have to either stop the economic growth and thus block further rise in the standard of living, or stop the population growth, or make miracles with the emissions intensity.
I am afraid there are people who want to stop the economic growth, the rise in the standard of living (though not their own) and the ability of man to use the expanding wealth, science and technology for solving the actual pressing problems of mankind, especially of the developing countries. This ambition goes very much against the past human experience which has always been connected with a strong motivation to go ahead and to better human conditions. There is no reason to make the, from above orchestrated, change just now – especially with arguments based on such an incomplete and faulty science as is demonstrated by the IPCC. Human wants are unlimited and should stay so. Asceticism is a respectable individual attitude but should not be forcefully imposed upon the rest of us.
I am also afraid that the same people, imprisoned in the Malthusian tenets and in their own megalomaniac ambitions, want to regulate and constrain the demographic development, which is something only the totalitarian regimes have until now dared to think about or experiment with. Without resisting it we would find ourselves on the slippery “road to serfdom.” The freedom to have children without regulation and control is one of the undisputable human rights and we have to say very loudly that we do respect it and will do so in the future as well.
There are people among the global warming alarmists who would protest against being included in any of these categories, but who do call for a radical decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. It can be achieved only by means of a radical decline in the emissions intensity. This is surprising because we probably believe in technical progress more than our opponents. We know, however, that such revolutions in economic efficiency (and emissions intensity is part of it) have never been realized in the past and will not happen in the future either. To expect anything like that is a non-serious speculation.
I recently looked at the European CO2 emissions data covering the period 1990-2005, which means the Kyoto Protocol era. My conclusion is that in spite of many opposite statements the very robust relationship between CO2 emissions and the rate of economic growth can’t be disputed, at least in a relevant and meaningful time horizon. You don’t need huge computer models to very easily distinguish three different types of countries in Europe:
– the EU less developed countries – Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain – which during this very period tried to catch up with the economic performance of the more developed EU countries. Their rapid economic growth led to the increase of their CO2 emissions in 15 years (in which they signed Kyoto) by 53%;
– the European post-communist countries which after the fall of communism went through a fundamental, voluntarily unorganizable transformation shake-out and an inevitable radical economic restructuring with the heavy industry disappearing (not stagnating or retreating) practically over night. Their GDP drastically declined. These countries decreased their CO2 emissions in the same period by 32%;
– the “normal” EU, slow-growing if not stagnating countries (excluding Germany where it’s difficult to eliminate the impact of the fact that the East German economy almost ceased to exist in that period) increased their CO2 emissions by 4%.
The huge differences in these three figures – +53%, -32% and +4% – are almost fascinating. And yet, there is a dream among European politicians to reduce CO2 emissions for the entire EU by 30 per cent in the next 13 years (compared to the 1990 level). What does it mean? Do they assume that all countries would undergo a similar economic shock as was experienced by the Central and Eastern European countries after the fall of communism? Now in the whole of Europe? Do they assume that European economically weaker countries would stop their catching-up process? Or do they intend to organize a decrease in the number of people living in Europe? Or do they expect a miracle in the development of the emissions/GDP ratio, which would require a technological revolution of unheard-of proportions? With the help of a – from Brussels organized – scientific and technological revolution?
What I see in Europe (and in the U.S. and other countries as well) is a powerful combination of irresponsibility, of wishful thinking, of implicit believing in some form of Malthusianism, of cynical approach of those who themselves are sufficiently well-off, together with the strong belief in the possibility of changing the economic nature of things through a radical political project.
This brings me to politics. As a politician who personally experienced communist central planning of all kinds of human activities, I feel obliged to bring back the already almost forgotten arguments used in the famous plan-versus-market debate in the 1930s in economic theory (between Mises and Hayek on the one side and Lange and Lerner on the other), the arguments we had been using for decades – till the moment of the fall of communism. Then they were quickly forgotten. The innocence with which climate alarmists and their fellow-travelers in politics and media now present and justify their ambitions to mastermind human society belongs to the same “fatal conceit.” To my great despair, this is not sufficiently challenged neither in the field of social sciences, nor in the field of climatology. Especially the social sciences are suspiciously silent.
The climate alarmists believe in their own omnipotency, in knowing better than millions of rationally behaving men and women what is right or wrong, in their own ability to assembly all relevant data into their Central Climate Change Regulatory Office (CCCRO) equipped with huge supercomputers, in the possibility to give adequate instructions to hundreds of millions of individuals and institutions and in the non-existence of an incentive problem (and the resulting compliance or non-compliance of those who are supposed to follow these instructions).
We have to restart the discussion about the very nature of government and about the relationship between the individual and society. Now it concerns the whole mankind, not just the citizens of one particular country. To discuss this means to look at the canonically structured theoretical discussion about socialism (or communism) and to learn the uncompromising lesson from the inevitable collapse of communism 18 years ago. It is not about climatology. It is about freedom. This should be the main message of our conference.

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/02/25/cold-shower/,,Global warming to take a cold shower in New York next week.,"The Carbon Sense Coalition (“Carbon Sense”) based in Australia is supporting an International Conference on the Science of Global Warming in New York next week (2-4th March 2008).
This conference, sponsored by The Heartland Institute of Chicago, is co-sponsored by 19 other organisations all over the world including the Carbon Sense Coalition.

The Conference will feature internationally recognised speakers from Australia, New Zealand, UK, USA, Canada and Europe. Carbon Sense has registered 10 delegates from Australia and New Zealand and several other individual delegates and scientists from Australia and New Zealand will attend.
For more information on the Conference see: http://www.heartland.org/NewYork08/newyork08.cfm
The chairman Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that this conference would highlight the fact that a large number of eminently qualified scientists all over the world are rejecting the IPCC proposition that human emissions of carbon dioxide have caused or will cause dangerous global warming.
“We compliment Professor Garnaut for acknowledging that the science is not settled and for seeing value in expanding the global scientific effort beyond the IPCC. We urge Professor Garnaut, and Ministers Wong and Garret to attend the New York conference to see the powerful new scientific arguments and evidence that have emerged since the now outdated work supporting latest IPCC reports.”
According to Forbes, “Global warming hysteria will take a cold shower in New York next week”.
A copy of the submission by Carbon Sense to the Garnaut Review can be found at: http://carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/garnaut-submission.pdf
“There is definitely no “consensus” on man-made global warming even if this were relevant to determining a question of science. In fact, far more scientists have openly rejected the IPCC propositions than are publicly supporting it.
“The Carbon Sense Coalition, supported by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition and other groups and individuals in Australia and New Zealand, recently called on the governments of Australia and New Zealand to set up an Australia New Zealand Royal Commission on the Science of Global Warming (to be known as “The ANZIG Royal Commission” – the Australia New Zealand Inquiry into Global Warming). We strongly believe that establishment of this enquiry should be a recommendation of the Garnaut Review.”
The submission by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition to the New Zealand Parliament in 2006, calling for a Royal Commission can be found at: http://nzclimatescience.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=205&itemid=1
“The interim report released recently by Professor Garnaut makes it more urgent that this independent scientific enquiry should take place.
“Garnaut’s proposal that Australia should target a 90% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 is so extreme that Australians need to take notice what destruction is being proposed in such a cavalier fashion. At one stroke, he could destroy the value of the huge public assets in coal fired power stations, as well as causing a dramatic fall in food production, power shortages and the migration to Asia of much of Australia’s cement, steel, processing and manufacturing industries.
“These people have already brainwashed our children into a state of fear about the future, now Garnaut will guarantee them lives of shortages and poverty. Without coal and oil the world could not maintain the world population, or produce and transport its food.
“Coal fuelled the British Industrial Revolution, and coal-fired electricity cleaned the air of last century’s polluted cities in Europe and America. Coal is still the most reliable and economical source of energy for modern life and is now offering its magic to Asia.
“There is loose talk about how we can simply replace coal by non-carbon sources such as uranium, hydro, wind, solar, bio-energy or hydrogen.
“Of these, only nuclear power has the proven capacity to replace coal, but to do so would require more time, more capital, less political hurdles and cheaper supplies of uranium than are in prospect. There is almost zero prospect that Australia could virtually replace its total carbon based generating capacity with nuclear by 2050.
“Hydro is a good reliable source of energy, but all the best sites are taken or sterilised by World Heritage disease.
“Gas can generate significant power, but it is enormously wasteful to use gas for base load power. Gas should be used for peak power, for standby power for solar or wind energy toys, for transport fuel to reduce our dependence on unstable Arab supplies and as a chemical feedstock. It is too valuable to be wasted on base load power generation.
“Hydrogen does not occur naturally, and is thus not a source of energy – it can be used to store and transport energy if the considerable engineering and economic hurdles are overcome.
There are some ways that can help you, driving there are two or three activities known as Kegel exercise that helps you in managing the vaginal dividers usingv-tight gel review solution.
“Nowhere in the world is wind or solar energy contributing significant base load energy for the simple reason that it is impossible. Neither can supply energy continuously and both supply ZERO power for significant parts of their operating cycle. Both must be supplemented by conventional power sources (such as gas or hydro) ready to start up instantly the wind drops or a cloud passes in front of the sun. Such backup power needs to be the same capacity as the solar/wind facility, thus doubling total generating capacity and making this option an expensive, unstable and wasteful exercise.
“Wind power is useful for pumping water to storage ponds for other use, and solar is useful for heating and storing domestic hot water. Beyond these applications, they will never survive without costly subsidies or mandated shares. No one runs a big city or a steel works solely on solar or wind.
“The only efficient way to harvest the sun’s energy is to use plants such as grass, trees and algae. However, “Biofuel” is a costly con which does more harm than good to energy supplies, energy costs and the environment.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2008/01/30/submission-to-the-garnaut-review-by-prof-r-m-carter/,,Submission to the Garnaut Review by Prof. R. M. Carter,"Dear Professor Garnaut,
I note that your review has been commissioned to “examine the impacts of climate change on the Australian economy, and recommend medium to long-term policies and policy frameworks to improve the prospects for sustainable prosperity”.
As written, this is a straightforward if challenging task. Unwritten, however, is that the term “climate change” today carries connotations of human causation, thanks mainly to lobby group pressure and media propaganda. This transforms a straightforward task into one of immense complexity, because of the existence of both many unresolved, controversial scientific issues and the fierce environmental politics that becomes involved.

There is wide variation in scientific opinion as to whether any human impact on global climate can be measured, or is likely to prove dangerous in the medium term future. It is, however, the case that the preparation of four comprehensive IPCC reports since 1998, accompanied by the estimated expenditure of more than US$50 billion on climate research worldwide, has as yet failed to document a human signal above the level of the noise in the natural climate system.
In view of this, it is alarming that previous Australian governments have signalled publically that they were basing their climate policy on advice from the IPCC, which is now widely accepted to be a flawed and partisan advocacy body for the existence of dangerous human-caused global warming.
The IPCC’s advice – together with that of now numerous climate lobby groups and interests – occupies the extreme, alarmist end of the range of possible views on climate change. At the other end of the spectrum are the handful of (mostly unqualified) persons who deny altogether any danger from human-caused climate change. Much more attention needs to be accorded in the public debate to the balanced, and balancing, views of the many thousands of independent qualified scientists, engineers and economists who, whilst acknowledging that natural climate change is an important issue, remain unconvinced that strong evidence exists for dangerous human-caused change and are not involved in the IPCC process.
I attach four documents that exemplify the views of some of these moderate centrist scientists, who are perhaps best described by the term “climate rationalists”, and urge that you heed their advice. The centrist view can be summarized by the following quotation from the third attachment:
————————————–
“Climate changes naturally all the time. Human activities have an effect on the local climate, for example in the vicinity of cities (warming) or near large areas of changed land usage (warming or cooling, depending upon the changed albedo). Logically, therefore, humans must have an effect on global climate also. This notwithstanding, a distinct human signal has not yet been identified within the variations of the natural climate system, to the degree that we cannot even be certain whether the global human signal is one of warming or cooling. Though it is true that many scientists anticipate that human warming is the more likely, no strong evidence exists that any such warming would be dangerous.”
“The gentle global warming that probably occurred in the late 20th century falls within previous natural rates and magnitudes of warming and cooling, and is prima facie quite unalarming, especially when consideration is given to the likelihood that the historic ground temperature records used to delineate the warming are warm-biased by the urban heat island and other effects. Once corrected for non-greenhouse climate agents such as El Niños and volcanic eruptions, the radiosonde (since 1958) and satellite (since 1979) records show little if any recent warming and certainly none of untoward magnitude.”
“Atmospheric carbon dioxide is indeed a greenhouse gas, but the empirical evidence shows that the warming effect of its increase at the rates of modern industrial emission and accumulation is minor, given an assumed pre-industrial level of about 280 ppm and noting the established logarithmic relationship between gas concentration increases and warming. As one such empirical test, it can be noted too that no global increase in temperature has now occurred since 1998 despite an increase in carbon dioxide concentration over the same 8 years of about 15 ppm (4%). Putative human influence aside, it is certain that natural climate change will continue, sometimes driven by unforced internal variations in the climate system and at other times forced by factors that we do not yet understand.”
“The appropriate public policy response is, first, to monitor climate accurately in an ongoing way; and, second, to respond and adapt to any changes—both warmings and the likely more damaging coolings—in the same way that we cope with other natural events such as droughts, cyclones, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Neither the Stern Review itself, nor the additional papers that our critique has stimulated, address the above cautious and widely held assessment of the situation. Instead, straw-man arguments are erected and attacked, detail is endlessly obfuscated and IPCC orthodoxy is relentlessly repeated.”
“In dealing with the certainties and uncertainties of climate change, the key issue is prudence. The main certainty is that natural climate change will continue, and that some of its likely manifestations—sea-level rise and coastal change in particular locations, for example—will be expensive to adapt to. But adapt we must and will. Moreover, reducing vulnerability to today’s climate-sensitive problems will also help the world cope with future challenges from climate change whether that is due to natural variability, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or other human causes. The most prudent way of ensuring that happens is to build wealth into the world economy and to be receptive to new technologies. This will not be achieved by irrational restructuring of the world’s energy economy in pursuit of the chimera of “stopping” an alleged dangerous human-caused climate change that, in reality, can neither be demonstrated nor measured at this time.”
Finally, and given the strong and polarized views that have come to exist on the topic of human-caused climate change (including amongst prestigious science organizations and academies), an objective assessment of the matter in Australia can now only be achieved by government through the mechanism of a Royal Commission, operating under appropriately neutral terms of reference. For, to ascertain the truth, it has become necessary that expert witnesses on all sides of the argument be heard under oath, under a neutral, scientifically competent chairperson and under stringent conditions of cross examination.
Yours sincerely,
Bob Carter

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/12/30/climate-change-is-nothing-new/,,Climate Change is Nothing New,"By Emeritus Professor Lance Endersbee, AO.
The accompanying paper, Climate Change is Nothing New [PDF, 1.2MB], was published in the March 2007 issue of the journal, New Concepts in Global Tectonics (http://www.ncgt.org/).
I was invited to prepare the paper by the Editor as a scientific response to the IPCC report, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policy Makers, issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, February 2007. The paper can also be regarded as a response to the movie by Al Gore, and to the report on carbon trading by the London financier, Sir Nicholas Stern.
The key points of the paper are:-


The Earth, the Sun, and indeed the Cosmos, comprise an inter-acting, dynamic, and evolving system. It is all in a state of continuing change. There is no steady state. In contrast, the IPCC assumes that the Earth was in a steady state until 250 years ago, which was upset by Man through increasing use of carbon fuels, and that led to atmospheric changes and consequential global warming.
In geological time, the climate of the Earth has been influenced by the immediate environment of the solar system as it travels through our Milky Way Galaxy. There were times when the solar system was enveloped in vast clouds of gas and dust, causing extreme cooling on Earth, and ice ages lasting for millions of years. In recent times the solar system has been travelling through space that is virtually empty, enabling a benign climate in which our civilization has flourished.
The Sun is the dominating influence on the climate of the Earth. That simple fact is not recognised by IPCC. The Sun is a churning, quivering body of hot plasma, generating intense electromagnetic fields in space that envelop the Earth. The electromagnetic behaviour of the Sun dominates and determines the electromagnetic and geotectonic response of the Earth, and thereby climate.
The climate of the earth has always changed. There have been times lasting centuries when the Earth was warmer or colder than now. The period of 500 years from 800 to 1300 AD was warmer. It brought prosperity to Europe. It is known as the Medieval Warm Period. Many great cathedrals were built, the Vikings discovered a verdant land they called Greenland, and there were vineyards in England. After that, for the next 450 years from 1300 to 1750 AD, Europe experienced a progressively colder climate. It is known as the Little Ice Age. It was especially cold for 100 years from 1600 to 1700 AD, when there was famine and starvation in the northern parts of Europe. In London, the River Thames often froze in winter.
A key part of the IPCC report is the presentation of evidence of parallel increases in both global temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is claimed by IPCC that the increased carbon dioxide emitted by Man is causing global warming. In my paper it is shown that the cause and effect relation is exactly the opposite; that natural global warming has caused an increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, simply because of the reduction in solubility of carbon dioxide in sea water with increasing sea temperatures.
It is the vast surface area of the oceans that determines the interchange of gases between the oceans and the atmosphere. The oceans breathe carbon dioxide and methane in and out with the seasons, and the oceans release carbon dioxide and methane with the natural warming caused by the Sun. If in the future there is a significant decrease in the electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, the Earth will cool down, and the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere will then decline.
IPCC refers to a rise in sea levels over the past century as evidence of global warming caused by Man. I show that the rise is due to the great exploitation of non-rechargeable groundwater over the past century which has led to a net addition to the hydrosphere, and thereby, the oceans.
Air pollution and global warming are scientifically separate issues. Global warming is natural and global. Atmospheric pollution is man-made and mostly close to the sources of emission. The IPCC have locked themselves into a scientifically untenable position by interweaving air pollution and global warming.
The deadly pollution of dust, acid gases, and water vapour entering the atmosphere in many cities of the world should be the focus of action. A large number of cities are most unhealthy places, with a lower expectation of life. The problems are not global but local. The correction of the problems must be industry and city-centred.
Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, it is essential to all life. There is no need for carbon trading or geosequestration. The concept of carbon trading has been advocated by IPCC, and by many governments signing the Kyoto agreement, and is being welcomed by the financial community. But carbon trading has not arisen from the normal operation of the market. It is the result of fears about global warming created by IPCC and others. It thereby presents risks to investors. If it comes to be recognised that global warming has a natural cause, and the fears subside, the value of carbon credits will then drop to zero, and the market in carbon trading will collapse.

Our worries are a new idea
And chicks who think the sky is falling
Keep cropping up at rates appalling.
“Hold your breath” you hear them shout
“And never let your methane out”.

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/11/18/put-the-carbon-killers-last/,,Put the Carbon Killers Last,"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on voters to put the Greens and the ALP last on their ballot papers, with most government candidates just above them.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that he had listened with alarm and disbelief to the increasingly hysterical statements from the Greens and their copy cats in the opposition and the government.

“The Greens would like a carbon free world. We hope they volunteer themselves first in this suicidal ambition.
“Carbon is the essence of life and carbon dioxide is the gas which recycles the essence of life. These carbon killers would have us bury the gas of life in carbon cemeteries.
“However, despite the increasingly lurid horror stories being concocted regularly by the IPCC, it remains a fact that there is no evidence that man-made carbon dioxide is the key driver of world temperature.
“As a sacrifice to the Greenhouse religion, the ALP has just announced a silly, costly and unnecessary scheme to dictate the share of future energy supplies coming from so-called “alternative energy”.
“Alternative energy has always played a useful part in Australia’s energy mix, and the booming prices for oil, coal and uranium will ensure that this process accelerates.
“Alternative energy was not discovered by Bob Brown.
“Kangaroos running on grass power provided most of the energy needs for the aboriginal people for thousands of years. Then wind power, pushing the sailing clippers, brought the first Europeans to Australia and provided the first transport for our world trade. Cobb and Co coaches used horses running on hay and grain energy to create a huge land transport network in Australia. This provided a mail and passenger service better than the Government railways provide today. Then in the hungry thirties, rabbits and jumbucks running on grass power provided energy for many a swagman. Even today, millions of windmills, wood stoves, camp ovens and solar hot water systems are providing decentralised energy to outback Australia, and hydro-electricity still powers many city homes.
“However, to advocate the closing of all coal power stations (Greens) or just 20% of them by 2020 (ALP), is just too silly for words, and could only be done at great cost to every Australian consumer.
“Nature has already taken out Victoria’s biggest power station at Yallourn, and the Greens have invaded and called for closure of the huge Munmorah Power Station in NSW. If the drought causes any more cutbacks in Queensland’s generating capacity, we may soon experience a carbon free future as the power grid fails during the next heat wave. Or suburbia may find how little energy comes from solar panels and windmills on a freezing, still winter night.
“Carbon Sense is also opposed to the silly and unnecessary carbon caps and emission trading dreams of the Government, but of all the policies designed to prevent the sky from falling, this is the least silly. It will at least minimise the cost of killing carbon.
“It seems that only a few mavericks on the government side in parliament and some minor party and independent candidates are game to brave the abuse they would receive if they questioned the Greenhouse religion.
“We recommend that voters use the power of preferential voting to rank every one of them. Number every square. Put anyone who defends the gas of life first and the carbon killers last.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/10/30/fuelish-food-policies/,,Fuelish Food Policies,"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that mis-guided government policies on global warming were going to cause a crisis in food.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that subsidising ethanol, taxing carbon fuels and covering grasslands and farms with trees would cause massive dislocation of rural industries and shortages and runaway prices for food.

“The ethanol swindle has sucked in many people, but the costs will far exceed the benefits. Demand for ethanol feedstock has already caused massive increases in prices for corn in USA and similar things will happen with sorghum and sugar in Australia. If the current foolish policies persist, these problems will also infect the soy industry, palm oils and other grains.
“Australian taxpayers will subsidise a huge ethanol plant being built at Dalby which will gobble 500 tonnes of grains per day – that is a lot of chook feed.
“Rising prices for grains, sugar and soy will feed through into higher prices for all food produced in farms, feedlots and factories. Beef, lamb, dairy products, chicken, eggs, breakfast cereals, bread and confectionery will all become more expensive, to the detriment of every consumer. The biofuels mania has caused price increases for pasta in Italy, cornflakes in Kansas, tortillas in Mexico and croissants in Paris.
“According to a recent EU report: ‘The current push to expand the use of biofuels is creating unsustainable tensions that will disrupt markets without generating significant environmental benefits’.
“Ethanol contains less energy than is used to produce it. Making alcohol from corn is a good way to make whiskey, but a terrible way to make motor spirit.
“Moreover, to produce one litre of ethanol uses 4 litres of water, so ethanol plants will cause increases in the prices of both food and water.
“Naturally there are vocal beneficiaries of the ethanol boom, but the net cost to the whole community will be negative – it will always be cheaper to produce motor fuel from oil or coal than to use fossil fuels to produce organic fuels via ethanol.
“We should plant our seed corn, not turn it into motor fuel. Burning food for fuel is a very fuelish policy. What do we do as an encore? Pay subsidies to oil companies to produce pizzas from petroleum?
“Even more foolish than subsidising ethanol is the process whereby people are encouraged to evade carbon taxes by planting trees.
“These force fed forests will result in a creeping infestation of woody weeds into land currently producing grass, pastures and crops.
“If some extremists had their way, Australia would become a monoculture of unproductive eucalypts, which are rightly regarded as invasive weeds in other countries. And the rules for carbon credits will probably dictate that they stay there forever, becoming a haven for feral pests and weeds and a magnet for bushfires.
“There is a place for trees in any productive landscape, and previous stupid government policies caused excessive clearing of trees on government controlled leasehold land. But banning all land clearing and subsidising tree planting is just as stupid.
“Farm forestry or wildlife refuges should be allowed to flourish on a fair basis alongside all other land businesses – none should receive discriminatory tax breaks. Well managed grasslands can extract just as much carbon from the air as will tree plantations (unless the trees are harvested and turned into timber houses).
“The final stupid food policy will be carbon taxes, which will push up the already high costs for fuel and power for every farming operation. Soaring prices for diesel, petrol and electricity will escalate the cost of operating tractors, harvesters, trucks, dozers, road trains, water pumps, feedlots, food processing plants and supermarkets. The end result will be seen at every checkout.
“The world has always depended for most of its food on great grasslands of Australia, the savannas of South America, the prairies of North America and the farmlands on the European plain. And the key food resource is the native and domesticated cereals and grasses and the grazing animals that live in harmony with them. Turning these ancient grasslands into forests will have far reaching and costly consequences.
“All of this is justified to calm a world hysteria about the modern era of global warming which started long before man started burning fossil fuels and will continue to rise or fall irrespective of what puny vote-seeking politicians do.
“Despite the recent Ignobel awards to Al Gore, more and more independent scientists are concluding that the facts and the evidence do not support the hysterical claims that the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere by mankind will cause runaway warming.
“A Judge in Britain got it right recently when he called Gore’s film a biased political document with eleven specific claims not supported by any evidence.
“Politicians are about to inflict huge Greenhouse costs on the whole community, for nothing.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/10/14/climate-pornography/,,Climate Pornography,"By Rocky Wood
Australian of the Year Tim Flannery attempted to scare the horses recently by baldly claiming greenhouse gases are now at levels far higher than has ever been publicly admitted before. Is this a cry of warning from an eco-warrior or yet another blast of climate-porn from one of the world’s leading climate pornographers?
Traditionally pornographers produce material their audience may regard as obscene, or at least titillating. Climate pornographers produce material that is obscene, regardless of your viewpoint – extremist, alarmist and designed to frighten regardless of the facts, or the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the information to hand.

And, no, pornographer is not too harsh a word to use in regard to the climate change debate. Polemics such as Flannery and Al Gore have taken to using very harsh rhetoric in an attempt to silence their critics and anyone who dares question climate change dogma. If you want to live by words you risk death by words.
According to one website the earliest use of the term ‘climate porn’ to describe the excesses perpetrated by the mass media, environmental groups, politicians and celebrity eco-warriors to attract attention was this, in the Financial Post, as long ago as 2004:
Parental warning: Better lock down the Discovery channel along with the Playboy channel next Thursday unless you want to subject your kids to hours of climate porn and scenes of polar bears being killed off by the evil legacy of the industrial revolution and human addiction to speed, technology, power, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.
The same site, wordspy.com, defines climate porn as ‘extremist or alarmist language or images used to describe the current or future effects of man-made climate change.’
Flannery’s latest claims are the very definition of climate porn. He revealed to Australia’s ABC the contents of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) update report not due to be released until next month.
Why? Could it not wait a few weeks? Perhaps to alarm? Perhaps to get his name in the news again? According to the ABC news website Flannery was able to reveal, no doubt in tones of impending doom, that greenhouse gases are at ‘dangerous’ levels ‘far higher than has ever been publicly admitted before.’ One presumes the reference to public admission was intended to imply that governments, presumably those headed by Bush and Howard, have somehow conspired to hide data from an unsuspecting public. The problem of course is that governments do not control this data. In fact, the IPCC consists of thousands of scientists and reports to the UN, which is not exactly a hotbed of right-wing pro-business, oil-company loving conspirators.
Flannery was quoted as saying the new figures (the ones he had rushed to reveal ahead of proper scrutiny and release by the scientific community) show greenhouse gases had reached levels already deemed dangerous by mid-2005. Of course he neglected to reveal that there is no consensus about what these dangerous levels should pegged at. Nor did he rush to explain why, if the levels are ‘already’ so dangerous, the dire predictions he constantly peddles had not already come to pass.
Worse, he claimed these new figures, which only he is currently privy to, were ‘beyond the worst-case scenario as we thought of it in 2001’; and that the levels of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere were far beyond those previously modelled by climate scientists. Which all begs another question – if these climate models, which vary from one researcher to another by orders of magnitude are so accurate, why should we put any faith in them now they are apparently all proven to be wrong? Even the ‘worst-case scenarios’.
Then, the climate pornographic climax from Prof. Flannery: ‘We are already at great risk of dangerous climate change – that’s what the new figures say. It’s not next year, nor next decade; it’s now’. Now – no ifs, buts or maybes, dangerous climate change is upon us.
Flannery is intent on making constant outrageous predictions. He has claimed ‘there is a fair chance that Perth will be the 21st century’s ghost metropolis’ and that ‘we face … rapidly rising sea levels, maybe up to 6 metres and hundreds of millions of refugees, because there are whole cities going under.’
Flannery is a man who likes to mix possibilities and imagination to come up with apocalyptic headline-grabbing scenarios. Try this one: ‘Let’s project ourselves 50 years out and imagine that the rate of melt has continued so that the sea level has come up three or four metres. What that means is there’s barely a functioning port facility on the planet. So how do we go about international trade which is actually the centre of our global civilisation?’ Discounting the likely response of engineers and government completely this whole nightmare is constructed on the term ‘imagine’, not on science. On fear, not fact.
These types of gloom and doom catastrophe claims are starting to have an impact quite the reverse of that expected by the claimants. Just last week a leftist Think-Tank in the UK released a report arguing the overwhelmingly alarmist claims about climate change and global warming peddled in the mass media is ‘confusing, contradictory and chaotic, and with the likely result that the public feels disempowered and uncompelled to act.’
Warm Words: How are we telling the climate story and can we tell it better? was published by the Institute for Public Policy Research. It declares that the use of the sort of alarmism in which Flannery and Gore specialise is counterproductive. They say eco-celebrities and the mass media largely portray climate change as ‘awesome, terrible, immense and beyond human control.’ As one might expect from a leftist think-tank they then go on to recommend ‘communications from government and green groups should treat climate-friendly activity as a brand that can be sold, making it feel natural to the large numbers of people who are currently unengaged with the problem.’ Marketing tactics are better than fear tactics, they seem to argue.
But the point they are making appeals to common sense – if extremist fear tactics are in constant use the masses will soon feel disempowered. Not long after that they will give up all hope of participating in the debate and whatever reasonable changes might actually be required.
In other words climate porn is likely to be counterproductive. That which outraged our grandparents is now standard fare on Channel 10 – to them it was pornography, to today’s teenagers it is but entertainment.
Much of the alarmism and the fear tactics may very well be misplaced. Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth implies, wrongly, that Hurricane Katrina’s devastation can be put down to global warming. Links between Australia’s recent drought and global warming are also unproven. Use of terms such as fear, inevitable, catastrophe, freak weather, chaos, the collapse of civilisation, submerged, global threat and disaster in every headline, article and press release is unreasonable and the common man senses it.
Not every bad weather event is related to global warming. Not every catastrophe predicted by Flannery will come to pass. In fact most of his claims are so extreme, so pornographic, that perhaps none ever will?
Who knows – it might even turn out to be the best thing for the environment if Prof. Flannery and his fellow travellers stuck to science and swore off climate porn.

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/10/01/the-conscience-of-a-celebrity/,,The Conscience of a Celebrity,"By Rocky Wood
Have you ever wondered if celebrities have a conscience? Whether they consider their impact of their words and deeds in much the way as the common man? Let’s investigate that matter in the context of the raging debate over climate change.
Did you tune into the Live Earth concerts promoted by Al Gore on the catchy date of 7/7/07? No? Well, you certainly heard of them, thanks to the free time given by the media. Concerts on seven continents, headlined by Madonna, Genesis and the Black Eyed Peas. Concerts designed to arouse awareness of the apparent threats of climate change and global warming.

Concerts watched by fewer people, even in the United States, than the Princess Diana Tribute Concert a week or so earlier. Concerts attended by disappointing crowds but lauded by Al Gore, his promoters and the usual suspects in the Hollywood and music industry.
Indeed, not everyone saw value in another headline-grabbing event of this type – Bob Geldof, who organised concerts against poverty and starvation in Africa in earlier times sniffed, ‘We are all f***ing conscious of global warming. It’s just an enormous pop concert or the umpteenth time that, say, Madonna or Coldplay get on stage’. Right on, Sir Bob. In fact, even the youth who were targeted Gore’s media machine were unconvinced of the motives, with many downright cynical.
The issue promoted may or may not be bigger than world poverty, starvation in Africa, or many other issues facing our planet – although I doubt if a starving family in Darfur gives a single thought for Tim Flannery’s worries about the sea rising to swamp multi-million dollar mansions on the coastlines of Florida or Queensland. But, when the hypocrisy of opposing greenhouse gas emissions by consuming large amounts of electricity on stage, and flying to and from events in private jets, is the subject of greater debate than the so-called problem, then the promoters have an issue.
Let’s take Madonna, a serial and successful publicity grabber if ever there was one. Her charity, The Ray of Light Foundation, happened to own millions of dollars of stock in aluminium giant Alcoa, one of the single largest corporate users of electricity in the world; the Ford Motor Company; and Weyerhaeuser, a forestry giant. All these companies are on the radical environmental hit list. When this information came to light, Live Earth founder Kevin Wall’s defence was this: ‘I didn’t see the Fox News Report but Madonna is here today, which shows her commitment.’ So just turning up absolves one’s eco-sins, does it? ‘Today, we’re not focussing on what she or other artists may have done in the past; it is about the future. Whatever is being said, I know that her commitment to this cause runs deep. She is performing for free and has written a new song for us, which I think goes to show that.’
Apparently celebrities can write off their greenhouse gas emissions by giving their services for free, and of course, by writing a nice new, catchy tune.
You and I of course don’t, or soon won’t have it that easy. A breed of radical environmentalists, fronted by Gore, Flannery and others, is beginning to demand we give up many of life’s luxuries and even economic necessities, while they individually continue to consume enough energy to power small villages. Al Gore’s house has been revealed to use 20 times the energy of the average home; who knows what Madonna’s houses chew through in electricity; or the cars and jets she and her entourage use go through in gas and aviation fuel?
Another celebrity eco-warrior is Sting, who reunited with his band Police for the 7/7/07 gig. The same Sting who advertises, according to the leftist British newspaper, The Guardian, ‘the biggest gas-guzzling Jaguar of them all’.
Let’s take a little tour of the wacky world of global warming and climate change publicity… and see what we can discover – a little of the truth for ourselves, perhaps?
Remember, these are demands put forth by celebrities – many of them wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of workers in the suburbs of Los Angeles or Melbourne, let alone those struggling to make better lives in Brazil, Burma, South Africa, Cuba or the Ivory Coast. Remember, any amount of taxes or restrictions implemented at their behest cannot truly affect their own lifestyles, while they most certainly will damage yours or mine.
Here are some interesting proposals put forward by celebrities who feel sure climate change is largely driven by human intervention – factories, cars, aircraft, energy consumption and the like.

‘I propose a limitation on the number of squares of toilet paper to be used in a sitting…’ – singer and celebrity environmentalist Sheryl Crow
A ban on cremations, replaced with upright burials in cardboard tubes!
A congestion tax on trucks in New York City (with no viable alternative to move goods such as food in or out) – Mayor Michael Bloomberg
The leading celebrity environmentalist who suggested those who oppose the man-made climate change theory might one-day face ‘a prosecutor in some yet-to-be-formed international court’. You know, a court like Nuremberg (he didn’t need to say). And, by the way, this is no fringe nutcase – it is a direct quote from Tim Flannery, author of a leading text on man-made climate change, The Weather Makers

Okay, let’s agree most of those ideas are just plain silly. The power needed to pump water to your home so you can wash your hands thoroughly after using one or two squares of toilet paper proves that.
With little solid evidence, other than a series of climate models, which vary widely and are subject to massive manipulation to prove a particular point, the world is being railroaded into making a series of changes that may have huge consequences for our economy, and our lifestyles.
Claims are thrown about like confetti – a leading aid agency recently said, with an apparent straight face, ‘between now and 2050 climate change will push the number of displaced people globally to at least 1 billion.’ Note the will, not may; climate change will create 1 billion refugees! Apparently we are expected to simply accept the claim at face value and then… well, what? Turn off our air-conditioning?
How about the demand from a British charity that the US must pay $22 billion a year to help deal with the ‘ravages’ of global warming. How much do you think they propose should be China’s share? Remember, China is now the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Do we hear zero? Correct!
Why would China not be asked to pay? The answer seems quite simple – they are not a democracy, environmental campaigners have no real levers over their government, media or the thinking of their masses. But those same campaigners do have influence over those in America and Europe, so it’s they who must be badgered into what could well turn out to be very bad policy indeed.
The same Tim Flannery mentioned earlier, and who was mystifyingly made Australian of the Year in 2007, has made this claim: ‘I think there is a fair chance that Perth will be the 21st century’s ghost metropolis’ (Perth in Western Australia is a city of over 1.5 million people and is in the middle of an economic boom). Flannery also said that ‘some time in the next 30 years, we face… rapidly rising sea levels, maybe up to 6 metres and hundreds of millions of refugees, because there are whole cities going under.’ Now, 6 metres is 236 inches, nearly 20 feet of increased worldwide sea levels. It sounds and is scary. One suspects it was meant to sound scary. But, wait, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the touchstone of faith for the world’s leading climate change promoters, projects only 59cm (23 inches, not even two feet) of increased sea levels. What gives here? Deliberate sensationalism by Mr Flannery, or just poor science on his part? Either answer is damning.
Why does the hard-core environmentalist movement seek out hypocrites and the ill-informed to front their views (seriously as they take them)? And why do celebrities seek out opportunities to flash their ‘green’ views at every opportunity. Clearly there is a Faustian bargain here.
But a bargain with the Devil has payback. In this case the environmental movement and the celebrity musos, actors and soft scientists are already beginning to find that payback has come early.
When the green movement allows those compromised by their behaviour (Gore, Madonna, Sting et al) to display their hypocrisy the message itself is damaged, possibly irreparably. When the celebrities make claims that are wrong, irresponsible or just plain hypocritical and are exposed their credibility suffers, possibly irreparably. In fact whether they care, or even know, is a moot point and it is hard to imagine them lying awake at night worrying about that, or much else other than the source of their next dose of that most addictive of drugs – fame.
And for those who wonder if climate change is natural, who wonder if nothing man does to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will alter that, and who wonder if the real reason behind proposed carbon taxes and the like is being left unsaid, the exposure of a few compromised celebrities may be comforting. But it is cold comfort.
Do these celebrities actually have a conscience? Or did they trade that to the Devil as well?

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/09/25/warm-watered-and-well-fed-is-better/,,"Warm, Watered and Well Fed is Better","The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that all government efforts to stop global warming and cut carbon dioxide emissions were anti-life and against the interests of mankind.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that this generation of foolish politicians are the first in history to complain about the beneficial effects that have always accompanied the periodic but short warm eras that punctuate earth’s history.
“The human story is intimately tied to the grand cycles of climate and the Chicken Littles should study these before squawking.

“Distant climate history is well recorded in rock strata, ice cores, tree rings, ancient shore lines, marine sediments, pollen distribution, fossil occurrences, coral reef growth, and carbon isotope ratios. More recent history is abundantly supplemented in clay tablets, cave paintings, rock art, ancient scrolls, inscriptions, historical events and records, monuments and epitaphs, the rise and fall of empires and direct records of temperature, sun spots, river levels, rainfall, droughts, floods, heat waves and bone chilling blizzards.
“Anyone who studies these records will see that eras warmer than today are periodic but short chapters in the earth story. The most recent major ice age ended a mere 11,500 year ago, when the Modern Interglacial commenced. Since then, earth has experienced five warm eras.
“In the first warm era starting about 4300 BC, the Sahara bloomed with plants, forests spread over Northern Europe and Canada and there was sufficient water for irrigation in Arabia. This era ended when blizzards and ice returned for nearly 1,000 years. Another short warm era started about 1450 BC, but was ended by another bout of cold dry weather that caused depopulation in Greece and Turkey and hardship everywhere.
“In the Roman Warm era, starting about 250 BC, the world smiled again and populations grew. But the warmth was cut short by the return of the snows which forced Vikings and Norsemen out of their frozen North to pillage and then colonise warmer southern lands.
“Then we had the Medieval Warm Period, starting about 800 AD, a time of great achievement and prosperity. Farmers moved back into Scotland and Norway, Greenland was colonised and corn was grown. Vineyards produced wine near Manchester, in East Prussia and Norway. Even Tasmania warmed up. Trade and industry flourished and people had surpluses for culture and education. Cambridge, Oxford and Bologna Universities were founded and cathedrals and temples were built at Westminster Abbey, Notre Dame, Canterbury, Cologne, Florence, Castile and Angkor Wat.
“But Jack Frost returned with the Little Ice Age starting about 1300 AD. Famine, food riots and disease again stalked Europe. Glaciers advanced, ice caps expanded, droughts and blizzards became more common and gales wracked Europe (and destroyed the Spanish Armada). Frosts killed orchards, North Sea cod moved south, food prices soared and farms were abandoned. In Scotland and Norway the capitals moved south and villages were abandoned. The Greenland colony perished. During the frigid years of the Dalton Minimum (1790 – 1820 AD) Napoleon’s Grand Army perished in a bitter Russian winter.
“Then in 1860, with no help from men burning coal or oil, earth started to warm again. This continued until 1942. A cooling spell from 1942 to 1976 had the Alarmists worried that the ice was about to return, but warming resumed from 1976 to 1998. Temperatures have been cooling slightly since then, despite the boom in burning of coal and oil.
“Even a casual glance at climate and human history will show that the warm eras like today are far more beneficial for all life than the cold dry eras.
“People prefer warm climates. They do not flock to Alaska, Archangel or Antarctica for winter – they head for Bermuda, the Black Sea or Bali. All over the world, the human race is migrating towards the sun belts – Florida, the Riviera, and Capricornia – very few volunteer to live in Siberia or Patagonia. President Putin voiced what many Russians must think – “a bit of warmth would be welcome here”.
“Moreover, a bit of warmth would vastly increase the land suitable for growing food and fibres. On the other hand, a slight cooling would take much of the farmlands of Canada, Northern Eurasia and New Zealand out of production, and parts of Tasmania and Victoria may have to convert from producing wheat and dairy products to farming caribou or reindeer.
“Warm eras also provide more rainfall because of the additional evaporation from oceans, lakes, snow and ice.
“When warmth and moisture are combined with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the beneficial effects on plant life are multiplied. A doubling of the CO2 content of the air would have insignificant effect on global warming but would have marvellous effects on plant (and then animal) life:

Growth rate of herbaceous plants would increase 30%
Growth rate of forest plants would increase 50%
All plants would be more tolerant of drought and heat
Food production would need less land and less artificial fertiliser
“All of this magic can be achieved by allowing man’s activities to recycle more CO2 and water to the atmosphere. Why then are politicians taxing carbon and encouraging people to waste money on foolish schemes such as trying to bury valuable carbon dioxide in artificial and expensive carbon cemeteries?
“The whole animal kingdom, including mankind, relies totally on plants to survive. Without grasses and cereals on land and plankton in the sea, most of mankind would starve.
“All plants need moisture, warmth, and carbon dioxide to grow and flourish. Why then are we having hysterics because the earth is currently blessed with more than average of these three magic life sustainers?
“Even the dumbest sheep in Australia knows that being warm, watered and well fed is better than being cold, thirsty and starving.”
“Maybe we should give sheep a vote?”

We all know the maxim that common sense just isn’t that common. Nothing proves this more than the current debate about Climate Change. ‘Global Warming’ has become the propaganda term of choice for those who make a living from scare tactics about the climate. Yet, brave souls in the scientific and political community are offering alternate views, views that receive scant regard in the mainstream media.
In a series of columns for carbon-sense.com we will investigate just how much, or little, common sense is being applied in the worldwide debate. We will expose the facts Al Gore and his cohorts don’t want the average citizen to know; and we will challenge the orthodox view that has enveloped the mass media and politicians of all stripes. More importantly, we will investigate the motivations of many of those who are on the climate change bandwagon – from simple economic avarice right through to an intent to alter the entire economic and political order.

Let’s start with a simple example – the Alliance for Climate Protection, set up by Al Gore. It’s aim? ‘A three to five-year campaign to educate people from all walks of life that the climate crisis is both critically urgent and something we can solve.’ The Alliance is trying to get people to sign a seven-part pledge, which requires countries and politicians to ‘join an international treaty within the next two years that cuts global warming pollution by 90 per cent in developed countries and by more than half worldwide in time for the next generation to inherit a healthy Earth.’ Apart from the ludicrous demand of 90% reductions in the West the pledge is not constrained by date or other specifics and hangs on the generalisations of ‘in time for the next generation’ and ‘a healthy Earth’. Exactly who appointed these people to be making decisions on behalf of those of us in democrat societies? More importantly, exactly how is the US or the Australian economy supposed to survive and grow if ‘global warming pollution’ is cut by 90% in a couple of decades at most?
Before we think these pledges are meaningless to our own lifestyles let’s note that the two most powerful Democrats in the United States signed up – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Mysteriously, there are no reports of Ms Pelosi and Mr Reid reducing their own emissions by 90% – yet. And don’t hold your breath waiting.
To undertake our analysis of the Climate Change debate we can begin by asking the questions that cry out to be answered:
Is climate change actually occurring? Is there a man-made component to climate change (anthropomorphic global warming or AGW)? Can we actually slow, or alter, climate change, whether or not human activity can be shown to be a cause? Despite attempts by Gore and his Australian disciples, Peter Garrett and Bob Brown, to pretend the contrary there is no scientific consensus on any of these questions.
Is the risk to our future so high that we must make huge changes to our economy and our daily lives to mitigate that risk? If so, how much change is required? What processes should be employed in making decisions about these changes? Can a worldwide response be developed, considering the strategic, political and economic needs of Russia, China, India and the Third World? Who should make these decisions and how transparent must the decision-making process be? Who, apart from a few celebrities and leftist political movements decided that the most dysfunctional political entity in history – the United Nations – should have the authority to impose its will upon Australia, the United States, China and India?
Who stands to gain from the changes proposed and the vast sums of money that will flow from carbon trading, carbon taxes, government subsidies and the like? Who stands to lose?
What are the myths peddled by the environmental movements? What are the real truths that are lost in the debate?
What do we, as individuals have to do to prepare our families, our friends, and our communities for the inevitable changes that will be wrought either by climate change, or the reaction to perceived climate change?
What should be done to protect freedom of speech for sceptics, both scientists and commentators, who do not agree with aspects of global climate dogma?
Perhaps most important of all, how do we protect our hard-won social and individual freedoms from the corporatist assault by the political left disguised as necessary environmental protections?
All things considered, we’ve run hands-on with a huge amount of extraordinary laptops under 500, so you have a bigger number of Best Laptops For Businessoptions than you may might presume. Immediately, these are the best tablets under $500 that have become through our labs
Almost every change proposed by the environmental movement and their fellow-travellers involves taxes; fines; laws against certain actions, processes or products; regulation; or emotional blackmail. Almost every change has the potential to inflict economic damage on the developed world and eliminate opportunity for the disadvantaged in developing countries and the Third World. Almost every change has a political flavour – restriction of personal and economic freedoms.
Through these columns we will come to a better understanding of the facts relating to the Climate Change debate; the possible consequences of actions or inactions we as individuals and societies take; and the destructive aims of the Marxist-dominated environmental movement.
If we have one responsibility as individuals it is surely this – we must inform ourselves of issues that affect our families, our society and ourselves. Surely this means investigating the issues ourselves and not simply serving as earpieces for propaganda and opinion masquerading as confirmed science.
Topical Note:
The New South Wales State Government plans to make water restrictions in Sydney permanent, the decision ‘made on the basis of scientific evidence on the future impact of global warming on Sydney’s rainfall’. In fact, the real reason this decision has been made is glaringly obvious – the politicians don’t want to spend the money required to build new dams, water saving and water recycling infrastructure. And they don’t want the political hassles that go with selecting sites for dams and desalination plants.

China and India recognise clearly that “Global Warming” is just another European plan to hobble economic competition from Asia. The Global Warming Scam would deny cheap clean power to millions of energetic Asians.
France closed its last coal mine in 2004 and is now heavily dependent on nuclear power. German coal mines are no longer economic, and even in Britain, fewer than 5,000 coal miners work the mines that once fuelled an empire. Thanks to their Dark Greens, Europe is now dependent on imported coal for steel production and gets its power from imported uranium and gas piped in from Russia and beyond.
France has always envied and feared the cheap and abundant coal of the Anglo American world. The world dominance of Britain and then America in steel, manufacturing, metals, steam, railways, electricity and naval power was fuelled by coal, supported later by oil. China and India are about to tread the same road. The Dark Greens of Europe, secretly supported by their decaying industrialists, fear the growing power, energy and competitiveness of these emerging giants.
This is not about climate – it is about using public hysteria to benefit certain countries, business interests and ideologies.
There was no declaration of carbon emission targets from last week’s Russian delegation to Queensland. Russian scientists are not sucked in by distortions, exaggerations, half truths and poor science being peddled by the likes of Al Gore and Bob Brown.
The Russians, the Arabs, the Indians and the Chinese cannot believe the apparent stupidity of the English speaking world. They have no intention of adding to their energy costs or forcing their businesses to waste money on dreamtime research such as carbon sequestration – they are cynically planning exploit the declining competitiveness of western industries and to milk stupid westerners of any “carbon offset credits” they can find or invent.
There is already a groundswell of opposition from well informed scientists, engineers and individuals all over the world to the lack of evidence supporting the Greenhouse Religion. A recent scientific conference in Melbourne organised by the Lavoisier Society drew scientists and delegates from all over Australia and South Africa. Even the PM’s own backbench contains well informed climate sceptics, and the ranks of scientific sceptics are growing all over the world.
A Royal Commission taking evidence from more than a few government or United Nations hacks would soon establish the facts that:

1934 was the hottest year of the twentieth century.
There was no global warming from 1940 to 1980, a time when CO2 emissions grew strongly.
There has been no global warming since 1998.
Current temperatures are not extreme or unusual.
Past records and scientific evidence show that changing surface temperature is more likely to be a cause (not a result) of increased CO2 in the atmosphere.
CO2 and water vapour have always been essential components of the atmosphere. Neither is toxic, both tend to retain some of the sun’s warmth, and both are absolutely essential and beneficial to all life on earth.
The most likely causes of variations in surface temperature are connected with solar cycles, variations in the heat output of the sun and eras of volcanic activity.
More CO2, water vapour and warmth in the atmosphere would be a boon to most of humanity.
There is empirical evidence to suggest that earth’s temperature is more likely to fall than rise – ice ages are more normal than today’s balmy climates.
There is significant scientific opposition to the proposition that man’s emissions of CO2 are causing global warming or any other harm.

Earth’s climate is always changing and we must do what every generation of our ancestors did – “adapt to whatever nature has in store for us”.
Our ability to adapt is severely reduced by crippling our economy and misdirecting billions of dollars of research funds into nonsense like carbon sequestration or rich man’s toys like windmills and solar panels.
While billions of dollars are being spent on naïve attempts to build ever more complex computer models of atmospheric heat circulation, our oceans are largely unexplored. The vast deposits of methane under our oceans are both a threat and a promise for future generations, but too little research is being done in this field. And the hundreds of thousands of undersea volcanoes, which may hold the key to past and future climate change, remain largely unmapped and un-monitored.
Australia, an island almost alone in the Great Southern Ocean which circles the globe, should take the lead in ocean research instead of letting scheming politicians from abroad mis-direct our research priorities to spurious questions.

The author is a geologist with 30 years experience in the metalliferous mining
industry. He is currently Chief Operating Officer of a public listed gold mining
company. Opponents of the following view will claim bias, but knowledge of, and
training and practise in, the subject does not equate with bias.
There are strident calls for the reduction and elimination of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions, based on the assumptions that (a) increasing carbon dioxide emissions are
the cause of global warming and (b) that human activities are responsible for a rise in
carbon dioxide emissions. The conclusion is then drawn that restricting human
emissions of CO2 will reduce global warming.
The basis of the scientific method is that a series of observations are made, a
hypothesis is drawn up to explain the observations, then a series of tests are made to
see if the hypothesis holds under all circumstances. If test results indicate the
hypothesis is flawed, then the hypothesis must be altered to fit ALL data.
The following data DO NOT FIT the assumption that human activities result in global
warming. It follows then that the assumption that anthropogenic CO2 causes global
warming is fundamentally flawed.

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/08/12/ethanol-biofuel-is-uneconomic-unsustainable-and-un-green/,,"Ethanol Biofuel is Uneconomic, Unsustainable and Un-green","The Carbon Sense Coalition today called for an end to all government promotion and subsidies for the domestic production of ethanol.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that all taxpayers, all consumers of food and most farmers will be harmed by the creation of an artificial industry producing subsidised ethanol.
“Subsidising the production of ethanol will waste taxes, harm the environment, cause sharply increased costs for everyone in the food chain, and do nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or air pollution.

“Many people think that ethanol production will provide wins for the whole community – farmers, the community and the environment. But there is no free lunch.
“As usual with government promotions, the benefits are obvious but the costs are hidden.
“Most of the benefits will go to large corporations set up to harvest ethanol subsidies, and some will trickle down to those growing cereals and sugar cane – they will get higher prices for their products than they would otherwise.
“The majority of farmers will be losers – all those using grains or molasses for supplementary feeding of cattle, horses, chooks, sheep and pigs will see their feed prices increase – this has already happened in America.
“Higher prices for grains and sugar will then pass thru farms, feedlots and factories to show up as rising costs for cereals, bacon, eggs, milk, meat and all sweets – a hidden ethanol tax on every breakfast table.
“In addition, the inevitable government subsidies or tax breaks for ethanol will consume tax dollars, giving higher taxes for tax payers or lower services for tax consumers.
“Then there are environmental costs. We will use heaps of diesel tractor fuel to bring marginal land, either grassland or bush, into a dead mono-culture of cereals or cane. (Professor Ausubel of the Rockefeller University in New York has calculated that each car would need 1-2 hectares of pasture to produce its motor fuel in this inefficient way.) And the excessive cultivation and chemical fertilisers used will reduce the soil organic matter and produce – – – – – more greenhouse gases.
“Then when we burn ethanol in cars, we get the same old dreaded greenhouse gases, water vapour and carbon dioxide – releasing exactly the same amount of these gases as were removed from the environment by the growing plant a few months before.
“Moreover, the cultivation, harvesting, transport and processing of the ethanol inputs adds more pollutants to the atmosphere – in fact, careful energy audits show that there is less energy in a gallon of ethanol than is required to produce it from plant material (see reference below).
“And what do we do in times of drought – burn our cereals and sugar in ethanol cars and import food to eat?
“Finally, who pays for the damage or modifications required to many engines to allow them to use ethanol?
“If people think ethanol can be produced profitably in a competitive market with no tax breaks or subsidies, they should be free to try with their own dollars.
“But taxpayers and consumers should not be forced to subsidise the ethanol industry – any full audit will show that the costs outweigh the benefits.
“If the government wants to increase energy security or reduce the price of motor fuel they should remove all the barriers to exploring for oil in Australia or producing gas or liquid fuels from Australian coals.”

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/08/08/q-are-you-in-favour-of-pollution/,,Q: Are you in favour of pollution?,"A: No, we are opposed to pollution.
Pollution is the transfer of unusual or harmful matter or energy to another person’s property without their consent. Thus I should not allow smoke, ash particles, industrial effluent, noise, noxious gases, bad smells or light from my property to annoy anyone else unless we have negotiated an agreement.
Burning of carbon fuels has been part of the natural cycle of the earth since the first plant was set on fire by the first lightning strike. All the products of burning natural carbon fuels are easily and beneficially absorbed by the atmosphere, dissolved by rain and go to fertilise the soil.
However there are some emissions that are annoying or dangerous in concentrated amounts, for example nitrous oxide, hydrogen chloride, sulphur dioxide. And others such as soot and ash that are not so dangerous, but visible and annoying. Bush fires produce all of these, but usually not in troublesome amounts.
Burning coal or oil in power stations can produce continual pollution in a small area, so modern clean plants remove almost everything from the emissions except water vapour and carbon dioxide, which are disseminated into the atmosphere via a tall stack. These two are normal beneficial atmospheric gases not pollutants. Taking them out of the emissions would be a silly and very expensive exercise for no benefit.

https://carbon-sense.com/2007/07/17/policies-for-poverty/,,Policies for Poverty,"The newly formed Carbon Sense Coalition today described the Global Warming Policies of both Federal and State government and opposition parties as “Policies for Poverty”.
Chairman of the new group, Mr Viv Forbes, says that at a time when scientific and informed opinion was becoming more sceptical of the apocalyptic prophecies of the Global Warming Industry, politicians and the media were competing to propose the most extreme and expensive options to “solve” a non- problem.

“A coalition of big business, big government and state funded media and research bureaucrats is colluding to impose job losses, power shortages and increased costs for electricity, transport and food on the unsuspecting Australian community – a well designed total package of Policies for Poverty.
“Ordinary workers, consumers and taxpayers will be sacrificed on this Altar in the vain hope that it will have some beneficial effect on earth’s future climate.
“Even casual analysis of the evidence will show that even if Australia closed every coal mine and power station, and stopped all cars, trucks, ships and aeroplanes, it would be impossible to detect any effect on world temperature.
“Politicians seem prepared to impose enormous costs on the Australian people in order to achieve miniscule effects on a non problem.
“Professor Lance Enderbee has published graphs of mean temperatures from 27 rural recording stations in Australia for 100 years from 1890 to 1990. The trend is horizontal, with mean temperature in 1990 below that for 1880. This has occurred during the century of the motor car, two world wars, and massive growth of coal burning for steel production and power generation. Rising carbon dioxide levels have had no effect on temperatures.
“A similar data set for six Australian capital cities shows a generally rising trend in temperature since 1950 – that is, rising temperature in Australia is an urban effect, not a result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
“Urban heating is caused by air conditioners pumping heat into or out of buildings, motors cars exhausting hot fumes, hot factories, millions of hot bodies, politicians emitting hot air, hot concrete and bitumen, polluted air, fewer breezes and less cool pastures, swamps and scrub.
“This urban heating will be made worse by the silly proposal to replace electric appliances (whose source of heat and emissions is controlled in an isolated power station in the countryside) with millions of small open fires burning in gas stoves and hot water systems in every home all over the city.
“The federal government and five state governments have six different programs and models covering emissions trading, carbon caps, carbon taxes and renewable energy schemes. Each jurisdiction is rushing to set up new energy, greenhouse and climate change offices with hierarchies of expensive public officials to staff them.
“Merchant banks are gearing up for the easy profits to be generated by carbon trading. Lawyers are preparing for the rush of new business from the disputes, legal challenges and shady deals which will follow the complicated sets of laws and regulations on carbon caps, emissions trading rules, conditions covering free permits, penalties, exemptions, offset policies, early abatement rules, reporting requirements and international trading rules.
“All of this is creating a totally artificial industry living on the sweat of ordinary workers, farmers, miners, foresters, consumers, tax payers and shareholders.
“Every carbon cap or tax will increase the cost of electricity in every home, farm and factory. Every increase in power costs will drive one more business and its jobs to China or India. Every subsidy for playthings like solar collectors or wind farms will cause an increase in taxes. And every ethanol plant built will increase the costs of every bit of food on the table of every home in the country – all of these are Policies for Poverty.
“The long term effects on the community will be obvious, but different. Emission traders and regulators will get bonuses in their pay packets. The beautiful people in the leafy suburbs will cut back on cappuccinos. Grain and sugar farmers supplying ethanol plants will prosper. All other farmers and consumers will suffer losses as grain, sugar and electricity costs rise. Coal miners will lose their job. Factory workers will lose their house. Politicians will lose office.”
