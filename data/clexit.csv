Eric Worrall / September 1, 2020

One Nation Senator Macolm Roberts
Guest essay on WUWT by Eric Worrall
One Nation federal senator Malcolm Roberts wants a simple answer from the Aussie CSIRO: what is the evidence that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are causing dangerous climate change?
So far, the answer appears to be CO2 is a problem, because other people think other people think CO2 is a problem.

By Dr. John Happs
It is now widely known that there is a complete lack of empirical evidence to show that atmospheric carbon dioxide drives global temperature. Dr. Horst-Joachim Ludecke has demonstrated this fact from readily available data:

 https://notrickszone.com/2020/07/29/data-from-2-independent-studies-show-no-correlation-between-co2-and-temperature/
Perhaps not as widely known is that, on those rare occasions when atmospheric carbon dioxide and global temperature have tracked closely, it is temperature that drives carbon dioxide levels.
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/10/06/news-from-vostok-ice-cores/
Despite these facts, we are increasingly encountering media reports about how the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that we are heading for climate catastrophe if we fail to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions and continue with so-called “business as usual.”
The media inevitably emphasise the IPCC’s computer model projections, referring to one in particular – RCP8.5. So what is RCP8.5 and why do the media and other alarmists like to parade this model at every opportunity?
Model projections of dangerous global warming have failed spectacularly in the past, as demonstrated by Dr. John Christy who compared 32 climate models with observations from satellite and weather balloon data:

 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2020/07/15/pat-michaels-worse-than-we-thought/
But such computer predictive failure is simply brushed aside with alarmists, including many scientists, seeing a need for more urgency. After all, a good deal of their funding depends on a continuation of the climate scare. Fortunately the public is starting to find predictions of global warming Armageddon and warnings about the end of all life on Earth just a little tiresome.
Undaunted, the IPCC has now presented a series of emission scenarios called Representative Concentration Pathways where RCP8.5 is at the (more scary) top-end whilst RCP2.6 refers to a benign, low-end emission scenario:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0091-3
As expected, RCP8.5 was based on computer modeling that assumed atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would continue to increase, with global temperature in lock-step, should emissions rise dramatically by 2100.
Note that the IPCC has sensibly branded RCP8.5 as being “Highly Unlikely” with the next lower projection being regarded as “Unlikely”. So why wasRCP8.5 mentioned so many times in the 2019 IPCC report?
The RCP8.5 “business as usual” scenario assumes a 500% increase in the use of coal, which no sensible person would see as being likely. In fact the RCP8.5 scenario would mean burning more coal than actually exists on the entire planet.
The RCP8.5 “business as usual” scenario also assumes there will be no improvement in energy technology yet we know there are a number of revolutionary nuclear projects and clean coal initiatives underway.
The RCP8.5 “business as usual” scenario assumes that the population will double to 12 billion by 2100 even though we know that populations fall in those countries that increase their standard of living.
 https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-that-the-world-is-facing-a-population-crisis/
The publication “Risky Business” has the temerity to say (page 14) that the “business as usual” trajectory is our current pathway and it should be noted that the questionable prediction was made that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels will reach 1,000 ppm by the end of the century.
Referring to the following projections as “global emission scenarios” is drawing a very long bow.

 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/EHS14-0016.1
RCP8.5 is definitely not “business as usual” but none of this is important to those spreading the climate alarmist message. The deliberate use of RCP8.5 represents another excellent example of how climate science has been skewed so the media, vested interest groups and politicians can spread further alarm.
Small wonder then that investigative journalist Donna Laframboise considers that RCP should mean: Ridiculous Climate Prophecy.
Anyone aware of how the IPCC operates and its use of RCP8.5 knows that it was developed and paraded as an outlier whilst UN officials also knew that it would be seen by many as a distinctly possible pathway. In other words RCP8.5 was always an improbable scenario and definitely not a “business as usual” forecast.
Of course this would never bother UN officials. We can be confident they knew that the more realistic predictions would receive little media attention.
Never wanting to let a good opportunity go to waste, UN Officials also knew that few would read and understand the IPCC technical reports so RCP8.5 was unleashed with the most extreme and highly unlikely scenario being widely advertised as “business as usual.”
Not surprisingly, The Guardian’s Jonathan Watts (13th June 2020) was quick to report that:
“Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards ..”
And:
“Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be incredibly alarming”.
 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/13/climate-worst-case-scenarios-clouds-scientists-global-heating
And which experts would those be?
No doubt those climate scientists and others that have embraced the “business as usual” scenario for their own ends. But we know exactly how the game is played with a number of scientists caring little for academic rigour or scientific integrity as long as they can rack up more publications and rake in more research funding.
They take the most extreme scenario knowing that the media and politicians won’t know anything about RCP8.5. They then refer to it as “business as usual” and describe a doom and gloom scenario for their own area of interest, whether this involves polar bears, insect-borne disease, butterflies, bees, coral reefs and – well just about everything is doomed by RCP8.5.
For instance, a senior researcher at the Cold Climate Housing Research Centre warned:
“There is a very grave crisis in the Arctic which might only be resolved if the world uses geo-engineering to cool the Arctic and there are drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.”
And:
“With business as usual life on earth is largely doomed.”
 http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2014/02/with-business-as-usual-life-on-earth-is.html
Myers et al. (2017) looked at climate change and global food systems and the potential impacts on food production and under-nutrition. They concluded that:
“Under the high-emissions RCP8.5 scenario, such restrictions on labor during the hottest month become widespread across tropical and subtropical regions by the end of the century.”
And:
“A recent study indicates that, as a result of these changes in size and distribution of plankton communities, under a high-emission RCP8.5 scenario, global fish catch potential would decrease by 3-13% by 2050 relative to recent decades.”
And:
“In a low-economic-growth/rapid-climate-change (RCP8.5)
scenario, 43% of all countries in the world would be poorer in absolute terms by the end of the century than they are now.” 
 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031816-044356
IPCC Lead Author and serial alarmist, Macquarie University biologist Dr. Leslie Hughes told the ABC’s Leigh Sales:
‘Business as usual’ will give us the warmest planet in human history and create conditions beyond the experience of any humans ever.”
 https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/business-as-usual-will-create-the-warmest-earth/5863966
The message that RCP8.5 represents “business as usual” continues to be promoted by a number of other scientists who should know full well that this is alarmist fantasy. Dr. Mark Urban from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut writes:
“If we follow our current, business-as-usual trajectory [representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5; 4.3°C rise], climate change threatens one in six species (16%).”
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6234/571
Dr. Matt Collins, Professor of Climate Systems at Exeter University, promotes a similar view:
“The scenario with the most warming is the “business as usual” RCP8.5, in which global mean temperature could be 4°C or more above pre-industrial times.”
 https://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/11/05/visions-of-dark-climate-future-90153/
Im et al. (2017) in their article: “Deadly heat waves projected in the densely populated agricultural regions of South Asia.” write:
“On the basis of an ensemble of high-resolution climate change simulations, we project that extremes of wet-bulb temperature in South Asia are likely to approach and, in a few locations, exceed this critical threshold by the late 21stcentury under the business as usual scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions.”
https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603322.full
Mora et al. (2015) also jumped on the “business as usual” bandwagon, writing:
“We show that although the global mean number of days above freezing will increase by up to 7% by 2100 under “business as usual” (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5), suitable growing days will actually decrease globally by up to 11% when other climatic variables that limit plant growth are considered (i.e., temperature, water availability, and solar radiation).”
 https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002167
Of course we can expect UN officials such as IPCC Chair Ottmar Edenhofer to refer to RCP8.5 as the “business as usual” scenario. He has made clear his views on the real purpose of climate policy:

Edenhofer argues that: “We are far away from a departure of the business-as-usual scenario.”
And:
“Even for 2.5C we need always a fundamental departure from the business-as-usual, and we can discuss now what can we do to find that effective entry point.”
 https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-interview-prof-ottmar-edenhofer
Dr. Bob Jackson is Chair of the Global Carbon Project that leads the research tracking worldwide emissions levels. He was asked:
“Are we currently on the worst-case scenario for climate change?”
Not surprisingly, he responded:
“We’re actually a lot closer than we should be; I can say that with confidence.”
And:
“Under RCP 8.5, the world’s average temperature would rise by 4.9 degrees Celsius, or nearly 9 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s an inconceivable increase for global temperatures-especially when we think about them being global average temperatures. Temperatures will be even higher in the northern latitudes, and higher over land than over the ocean.”
 https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario/579700/
Oliver et al. (2015) looked at the effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation on drought-sensitive butterflies and concluded:
“Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of some climatic extremes. These may have drastic impacts on biodiversity, particularly if meteorological thresholds are crossed, leading to population collapses. Should this occur repeatedly, populations may be unable to recover, resulting in local extinctions.”
They then throw in the inevitable:
“Under RCP8.5, which is associated with ‘business as usual’ emissions, widespread drought-sensitive butterfly population extinctions could occur as early as 2050.”
https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2746?proof=t
Pal and Eltiahir (2015) see problems for human adaptability with the “business as usual” scenario:
“We project using an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate model simulations that extremes of wet-bulb temperature in the region around the Arabian Gulf are likely to approach and exceed this critical threshold under the business-as-usual scenario of future greenhouse gas concentrations. Our results expose a specific regional hotspot where climate change, in the absence of significant mitigation, is likely to severely impact human habitability in the future.”
Pal and Eltiahir specifically point out that RCP8.5 represents a “business as usual” scenario,
http://eltahir.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper.pdf
Dr. Roger Pielke has observed how the Climate Impact Laboratory has also quoted RCP8.5 as representing a “business as usual” scenario, focussing on extreme outcomes such as:
1.5 million people may die in India by 2100 due to extreme heat by climate change.
Rising sea levels could swamp major cities and displace almost 200 million people.
The rise in climate-related deaths will surpass all infectious diseases.
Pielke notes that his search of academic citations (using Google Scholar) provided a record of more than 4,000 academic papers that have deliberately used RCP8.5 as representing a “business as usual” scenario.
 https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2020/01/02/how-billionaires-tom-steyer-and-michael-bloomberg-corrupted-climate-science/#66ced5b1702c
No surprise then that the “polar bears are doomed” brigade have jumped on to the RCP8.5 “business as usual” scenario.
Polar bear numbers have climbed from around 7,000 in the 1950’s to more than 30,000 today, largely due to the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act and the 1974 International Agreement for the Conservation of Polar Bears.
Ignoring these facts, the BBC continues to provide polar bear alarm, reporting:
“Polar bears will be wiped out by the end of the century unless more is done to tackle climate change, a study predicts.”
Left out of the BBC’s report was the fact that the study they quoted used the ridiculous RCP8.5 “business as usual” scenario.
 https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/is-the-demise-of-polar-bears-being-exaggerated-
The deliberate misuse of RCP8.5 is widespread and it is virtually certain that any media or “scientific” report that serves up dire warnings about future climate catastrophe will be referring to the “business as usual” RCP 8.5 model. More examples of this sleight of hand can be found at:
 https://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/11/05/visions-of-dark-climate-future-90153/
Many scientists know full well that predictions based on RCP8.5 are fanciful but very few have raised concerns. Papers that have been published should have been diligently peer-reviewed and the RCP8.5 fraud exposed. This has not happened and the dishonesty continues.
Fortunately we now have a few frank comments emerging about RCP8.5 with Dr. Zeke Hausfather from the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California and Dr. Glen Peters from the Center for International Climate Research, Oslo, Norway criticising the alarmists:
“RCP8.5 was intended to explore an unlikely high-risk future.But it has been widely used by some experts, policymakers and the media as something else entirely: as a likely ‘business as usual’ outcome. A sizeable portion of the literature on climate impacts refers to RCP8.5 as business as usual, implying that it is probable in the absence of stringent climate mitigation. The media then often amplifies this message, sometimes without communicating the nuances.”
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3
To its credit, the UK’s Meteorological Office has attempted to put the record straight saying:
“Despite not being explicitly designed as business as usual, RCP8.5 has often been misrepresented as the “business as usual” scenario – becoming the basis for hundreds of predictions about our certain doom from climate change.”
 https://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/11/05/visions-of-dark-climate-future-90153/
The corruption of climate science and the unnecessary alarm about catastrophic anthropogenic global warming has occurred because many of our scientific institutions have failed to apply due diligence on this issue.
It has occurred because a number of our universities have encouraged and even vigorously defended climate alarmism since such alarmism has been good for business.
It has occurred because the peer-review process has failed to question the climate alarmism promoted in so many papers and it has failed to identify obvious methodological errors. There is evidence of “pal-review” allowing this.
In summary, it has occurred because money, politics and ideology have corrupted climate science and has brushed aside academic standards and scientific integrity.
There is no doubt that RCP8.5 results are deliberately used to induce “climate hysteria” and Matt Ridley probably best sums up the problems with RCP8.5 when he writes:
“What is more, in the small print describing the assumptions of the “representative concentration pathways”, it admits that the top of the range will only be reached if sensitivity to carbon dioxide is high (which is doubtful); if world population growth re-accelerates (which is unlikely); if carbon dioxide absorption by the oceans slows down (which is improbable); and if the world economy goes in a very odd direction, giving up gas but increasing coal use tenfold (which is implausible).”

By Dr. John Happs

United Nations officials knew there would be a number of environmental groups waiting in the wings to assist them in promoting climate alarmism and achieving the UN’s goals.
The UN wanted to provide a platform for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO’s) since they are essentially about radical environmental restrictions. Attending the UN’s climate sessions were a number of environmental activists with links to organisations such as Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the David Suzuki Foundation, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), Conservation International, Nature Conservancy, Earth First, Sierra Club, Al Gore’s Alliance for Climate Protection, the Environmantal Defence Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, the UN Green Climate Fund and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
Julia Patrick writes of the WWF:
“Working “in partnership” with Greenpeace, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is the world’s richest and largest environmental group, with its secretariat in Switzerland, but run from the USA. The Australian president is Robert Purves, founder of the Purves Foundation. WWF is well known for its cute little panda emblem, but there’s nothing naive or artless about WWF. Claiming that agriculture, land clearing, overgrazing and overfishing “are the main pressures on biodiversity”, its aim is to reduce fishing to zero and run farmers and graziers off their land by making it untenable to live on. Without human input, land cannot generate an income.”
 https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2014/09/insidious-misanthropy-green-socialism/
We can expect these activist groups to continue with their promotion of radical environmentalism, along with their stance against industrial activity, linking this with (imaginary) catastrophic global warming. After all, there is a great deal of money in it for them.

Dave Foreman from Earth First was quick to support Strong’s philosophy: “Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?”
Foreman said:
“We must make this place an insecure and inhospitable place for Capitalists and their projects – we must reclaim the roads and plowed lands, halt dam construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness tens of millions of acres of presently settled land.”
 https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/carroll/opinion/ph-cc-rothschild-column-061515-20150615-story.html
Foreman’s contempt for humans and their achievements are found in his book: Confessions of an eco-warrior:

Greenpeace co-founder Paul Watson appears to be another Green Zealot who is prepared to be deceptive. Watson is on record as saying:
“It doesn’t matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.”
https://www.azquotes.com/quote/658014
Bing.com: Paul Watson
Steve Sawyer, described as Political Director of Greenpeace International, was quick to exaggerate the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions:
“Without urgent measures to rapidly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the possibility of limiting the temperature rise below a dangerous level will have disappeared within a decade.”
https://www.wiseoldsayings.com/global-warming-quotes/
Glenn Beck in his book “An Inconvenient Book” quotes Michael Oppenheimer from the Environmental Defense Fund:
“The only hope for the world is to make sure there is not another United States. We can’t let other countries have the same number of cars, the amount of industrialization we have in the US. We have to stop these Third World countries right where they are.”
 https://www.amazon.com/Inconvenient-Book-Solutions-Biggest-Problems/dp/1416560440
Keith Farnish, environmental writer and activist would also like to see extreme action taken against all aspects of civilization:
“The only way to prevent global ecological collapse and thus ensure the survival of humanity is to rid the world of Industrial Civilization… Unloading essentially means the removal of an existing burden: for instance, removing grazing domesticated animals, razing cities to the ground, blowing up dams and switching off the greenhouse gas emissions machine.”
 https://www.prisonplanet.com/nasa-global-warming-alarmist-endorses-book-that-calls-for-mass-genocide.html
Environmental reporter Jim Sibbison was formerly a public relations official for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1988 he admitted:
“We routinely wrote scare stories… Our press reports were more or less true… We were out to whip the public into a frenzy about the environment.”
 http://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2013/11/ipccs-foul-weather-friends/#_ednref17
Jack Trevors, Editor of the magazine: “Water, Air and Soil Pollution” revealed his political bias:
“The capitalistic systems of economy follow the one principal rule: the rule of profit making. All else must bow down to this rule… The current USA is an example of a failed capitalistic state in which essential long-term goals such as prevention of climate change and limitation of human population growth are subjugated to the short-term profit motive and the principle of economic growth.”
https://wmbriggs.com/post/4225/
Judi Bari, organiser of Earth First would agree:
“I think if we don’t overthrow capitalism, we don’t have a chance of saving the world ecologically.”
 https://panamazonsynodwatch.info/articles/commented-news/global-warming-global-myth-part-3/
Campaigner for Friends of the Earth Emma Brindal said:
“A climate change response must have at its heart a redistribution of wealth and resources. Not protecting Earth from manmade CO2 emissions or natural and manmade climate change – but redistributing wealth and resources, according to formulas that self-appointed ruling elites decide is “socially just.” 
 https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/climategate-ten-years-later
In 2010 Kevin Andrews described the Green’s agenda, saying:
“What is at stake in the Greens ‘revolution’ is the heart and soul of western civilisation, built on the Judeo-Christian/Enlightenment synthesis that upholds the individual -with obligations and responsibilities to others, but ultimately judged on his or her own conscience and actions – as the possessor of an inherent dignity and inalienable rights. What is also at stake is the economic system that has resulted in the creation of wealth and prosperity for the most people in human history.”

Ben Webster reported how:
“Friends of the Earth, a registered charity, avoided restrictions on political activity by claiming that its anti-fracking campaign was being carried out by a non-charitable company called Friends of the Earth Limited.”
In 2015 Friends of the Earth was accused of scaremongering to raise money by suggesting that sand used in fracking could cause cancer.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed his concern to the Queensland Resources Council in November 2019, saying that:
“A new breed of radical activism was harrying those in mining and businesses associated with it. I am very concerned about this new form of progressivism… intended to get in under the radar but [which] at its heart would deny the liberties of Australians.” 
 https://intpolicydigest.org/2019/11/04/scott-morrison-s-authoritarian-streak-crushing-anti-mining-protest-in-australia/
Dr. Aynsley Kellow from the University of Tasmania observed that the “lawfare” engaged in by environmentalists against the Adani Mine, on environmental and native title grounds had delayed the project several years with the argument that the site had a large population of Black-Throated Finches that would be threatened by the mining operation. This despite the fact that the 2019 Red List shows that the Black-Throated Finch is not even threatened or vulnerable.

It is becoming increasingly evident that a number of registered charities, claiming tax-free status are undermining the Australian economy and threatening jobs. The anti-coal organization 350.org CEO Blair Palese appearing to encourage protesters to break the law when, at an event in Sydney in April 2016, Ms. Palese said the organisation was urging supporters to take part in the blockade of Newcastle Harbour to prevent coal shipments leaving. She said:
“It’s a big ask. We’re asking some people to get arrested. We’re asking some people to step up, join the event, be in kayaks and boats, literally blockade that day and be part of a flotilla that will say no more fossil fuels out of that port.”

In 2014, India’s Intelligence Bureau noted how Greenpeace activists were campaigning against coal-fired and nuclear power stations when nearly 4 million Indians are still living in poverty and need inexpensive, accessible power to lift them into a higher standard of living. The Intelligence Bureau noted:
“Greenpeace has been growing exponentially in terms of reach and impact, volunteers, movements it supports and media influence. Activists have been focused on ways to create obstacles in India’s coal based energy plans and methods to pressure India to use only renewable energy.”

Christine Stewart, former Canadian Minister of the Environment led the Canadian delegation to the Kyoto climate change negotiations and pushed for action on the Kyoto Accord. Apparently, Stewart didn’t worry about the odd deception. She commented:
“No matter if the science of global warming is all phony… climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.”

The spectre of socialism is always behind those claims of concern for the Earth.
Naomi Klein clearly stated her position in her book: “This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate.”
Bing.com: Naomi Klein
Klein said:
“What if global warming isn’t only a crisis? What if it’s the best chance we’re ever going to get to build a better world?”
And:
“We cannot change the laws of nature. But we can change our economy. Climate change is our best chance to demand and build a better world.”
And:
“Forget everything you think you know about global warming. The really inconvenient truth is that it’s not about carbon-it’s about capitalism. The convenient truth is that we can seize this existential crisis to transform our failed economic system and build something radically better.”
Apparently, as far as Klein is concerned, a better world means more socialism.
 https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/41247321-this-changes-everything-capitalism-vs-the-climate
So here we have further proof that the UN and its supporters are seeking global governance whilst promoting their socialist goals to penalise successful, wealthy nations and re-distribute their hard-earned wealth.
Additionally, we have environmental groups who seek to de-industrialise the world and dramatically reduce living standards. Perhaps of more concern is the number of influential people who would like to see population control, if not the total elimination of humanity. For instance, the Club of Rome opines:
“The Earth has cancer and the cancer is Man.”
 https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/a5q2k/the_club_of_romes_world_government_climatechange/
John Davis, Editor of the Earth First journal appears to have a very poor opinion of humans:
“Human beings, as a species, have no more value than slugs.”
http://thetrackerseries.com/john-davis-on-humans-as-slugs/
Christopher Manes, also from the Earth First journal agrees:
“The extinction of the human species may not only be inevitable but a good thing.”
https://www.quora.com/Is-climate-change-a-religion-1
Dr. Reed Noss from The Wildlands Project also thinks little of humans:
“The collective needs of non-human species must take precedence over the needs and desires of humans.”
http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/Food-Land96.html
As does Dr. Paul Ehrlich:
“A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people. We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer.”
 https://www.aei.org/society-and-culture/is-the-world-in-danger-from-overpopulation/
Ted Turner, founder of CNN and a major UN donor also thinks the population should be stringently controlled:
“A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.”
Bing.com: Ted Turner
 https://me.me/i/ted-turner-founder-of-cnn-a-total-population-of-250-300-million-17265483
David Brower, a founding member of the Sierra Club has suggested how the human population should be controlled:
“Childbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license. All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.”
https://www.activistfacts.com/person/3507-david-brower/

Some individuals, such as the UK’s science reporter Susan Blakemore would like to see disease take its toll:
“For the planet’s sake, I hope we have bird flu or some other thing that will reduce the population, because otherwise we’re doomed.”
And:
“Finally, we might decide that civilisation itself is worth preserving. In that case we have to work out what to save and which people would be needed in a drastically reduced population – weighing the value of scientists and musicians against that of politicians, for example.”

Former President of the organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Ingrid Newkirk is happy to see the extinction of humans:

“We have become a plague upon ourselves and upon the Earth. It is cosmically unlikely that the developed world will choose to end its orgy of fossil energy consumption, and the Third World its suicidal consumption of landscape. Until such time as Homo Sapiens should decide to rejoin nature, some of us can only hope for the right virus to come along.”

So we have a significant number of influential people who would like to see a dramatic reduction in the human population along with the stifling of economic growth and the re-distribution of wealth from successful economies to developing nations. Not surprisingly, the IPCC now has several green groups and celebrity activists supporting their aims.
Fortunately, an increasing number of politicians have come to realise that any restriction of inexpensive, reliable hydrocarbon energy is a restriction on freedom and our standard of living. It is becoming clear to more people that the “global warming” alarmism aka “climate change” aka “extreme weather” aka “climate disruption” was never about a better understanding of climate science, rather it has always been about promoting the UN’s socialist cause and the radical environmentalist quest to stop economic growth whilst dramatically lowering global population.
The scene was set and science was about to be hijacked and manipulated by UN officials and radical environmentalists for political/ideological reasons known as “The Noble Cause.” This has led to what many scientists now believe is the biggest fraud in the history of science with former Professor of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg, Dr. Tim Ball being explicit:
“The argument that global warming is due to humans, known as the anthropogenic global warming theory (AGW) is a deliberate fraud. I can now make that statement without fear of contradiction because of a remarkable hacking of files that provided not just a smoking gun, but an entire battery of machine guns.” 
And:
“Carbon dioxide was never a problem and all the machinations and deceptions exposed by these files prove that it is the greatest deception in history, but nobody is laughing. It is a very sad day for science.”

By Dr. John Happs

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”
Carl Sagan :  The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.
The media and many politicians from around the world actually believed and proclaimed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an independent scientific body comprising the world’s best climate scientists. We were told:
“The IPCC is an intergovernmental organization established jointly in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Agency (a specialized agency of the United Nations). Its mission is to collect, assess, and publish the latest scientific findings on climate change.”
 https://nofrakkingconsensus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hopeforourearthfromyokohama.pdf
There is ample evidence to show that the IPCC is the “Trojan Horse” for the UN’s environmental/socialist aims. The IPCC masquerades as a rigorous independent team of the world’s top climate scientists whilst taking advantage of the low level of scientific understanding amongst the media, the public and politicians.
Following two years of research into the IPCC, investigative journalist Donna Laframboise concludes that:
“Almost nothing we’ve been told about the IPCC is actually true.”
And:
“What most of us don’t know is that, rather than being written by a meticulous, upstanding professional in business attire, the Climate Bible is produced by a slapdash, slovenly teenager who has trouble distinguishing right from wrong.”
 https://www.amazon.com/Delinquent-Teenager-Mistaken-Worlds-Climate/dp/1466453486/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=The+Delinquent+Teenager+Who+Was+Mistaken+For+The+World%E2%80%99s+Top+Climate+Expertandqid=1571685418andsr=8-1-fkmr0
The UN needed to persuade the public and (especially) politicians that the planet is warming dangerously and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible and must be curtailed.
Knowing that most people would not read (and understand) the technical reports produced by the IPCC, UN officials made sure that the media and politicians would read the Summaries For Policymakers. Those summaries could be “massaged” by UN officials to ensure that the early messages from the IPCC would be sufficiently alarmist to make developed nations feel guilty about their carbon dioxide emissions and pay climate compensation into the UN’s Green Climate Fund, to be passed on to developing nations.
The following examples of questionable IPCC science and process are provided with appropriate links to enable the reader to access further information and decide for themselves if such examples represent carelessness or deliberate fraud.
1. The IPCC framed a problem when there was no empirical evidence to show that a problem exists.
Without any evidence, the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), specifically defined climate change in terms of human activity:
“A change in climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is, in addition to natural climate variability, observed over considerable time periods.” (My emphasis)
 https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/SR15_AnnexI_Glossary.pdf
It appeared from the outset that the IPCC would give serious consideration only to those aspects of climate change that might support the UN’s promotion of human-induced global warming. See:
http://donaitkin.com/a-sober-defence-of-the-ipcc/
The IPCC were prepared to change climate history:
 https://saltbushclub.com/2020/03/06/michael-mann-erases-climate-history/#more-1334
But they failed to convince the scientific community:
 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1260/095830507782616788?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.1and
2. The IPCC claimed that over 4,000 scientists contributed to the IPCC reports. This claim is demonstrably false.
In 2007 the IPCC claimed that human activity is contributing significantly to global warming and that this claim was supported by up to 4,000 IPCC contributing scientists. This claim was widely publicised and repeated by politicians around the world.
Dr. John McLean pointed out that thiscore claim was actually endorsed by only 5 reviewers of the IPCC’s 2007 report. Additionally, there is some doubt that they were actually scientists. It appears that the entire catastrophic anthropogenic global warming alarmism was promoted by a small, incestuous political/ideological group. See how IPCC contributing scientists exaggerate global warming:
https://www.thegwpf.com/here-comes-climategate-part-ii/
Few IPCC members were climate scientists:
https://concen.org/oldforum/thread-4498.html
Politics drives the IPCC process rather than science:
 https://cei.org/content/ipcc-report-criticized-one-its-lead-authors
Claims that over 2,000 of the world’s leading scientists say human activity has a significant influence on climate are wrong:
 https://www.thegwpf.com/the-ipcc-consensus-was-phoney-says-mike-hulme/
3. The IPCC produces Summaries for Policymakers (SPM) that are made available to the media and politicians. UN officials instruct authors to make the technical reports conform to the summaries that often contradict what the scientists have written.
The following instruction is given to IPCC authors:
“Changes (other than grammatical or minor editorial changes) made after acceptance by the Working Group or the Panel shall be those necessary to ensure consistency with the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) or the Overview Chapter.” See:
https://blog.jim.com/global-warming/how-global-warming-“science”-works/
There is no evidence to support the UN’s claim that there is a discernible human influence on global climate:
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/11/24/after-the-catastrophe-signal-when-science-entered-the-policy-greenhouse/
Senator Timothy Wirth and NASA’s Dr. James Hansen conspired to start the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming scare in the same year (1988) that the IPCC was born:
https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2012/05/the-serpent-s-egg/
IPCC contributing scientist Dr. Vincent Gray described how the IPCC produced 5 reports to persuade governments that their carbon dioxide emissions control global temperature:
 https://theclimatescepticsparty.blogspot.com/2013/10/controlling-scientists.html
The IPCC’s computer-based predictions have been widely criticised:
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/276/5315/1040.full
IPCC contributing scientist Dr. Richard Lindzen observed:
“Almost all reading and coverage of the IPCC is restricted to the highly publicized Summaries for Policymakers which are written by representatives from governments, NGO’s and business; the full reports, written by participating scientists, are largely ignored.”
 https://defyccc.com/richard-lindzen-on-ipcc-and-climate-dispute-2001/
4. The former IPCC Chairman Dr. Rajendra Pachauri publicly declared his bias about climate change.
The IPCC’s former Chairman, the late Dr. Rajendra Pachauri clearly stated his position on transforming the world’s economy and his desire to demonize carbon dioxide:
“Unless we live in harmony with nature, unless we are able to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and adopt renewable energy sources and until we change our life styles, the world will increasingly become unfit for human habitation.”
 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Live-in-harmony-with-nature-says-Pachauri/articleshow/7697556.cms
Pachauri wrote the Foreword to a 2008 Greenpeace paper: Energy Revolution: A Sustainable Global Energy Outlook.
 https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Global/usa/report/2009/4/energy-r-evolution-a-sustain.pdf
Rajendra Pachauri no longer tries to hide his intentions, stating:
“I am not going to rest easy until I have articulated in every possible form the need to bring about major structural changes in economic growth and development. That’s the real issue. Climate change is just a part of it.”
 https://www.masterresource.org/malthusianism/malthusianism-climate-alarmism-jt/
5. The IPCC Summaries for Policymakers about extreme weather is more alarmist than the scientific report.
The IPCC have released 2 documents on extreme events. These being the scientific report:IPCC, 2012: Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. A Special Report of Working Groups I and II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a summary: IPCC, 2012: Summary for Policymakers. In: Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation.
We have seen how IPCC officials, when compiling the Summaries for Policymakers have routinely exaggerated/distorted/ignored findings documented by IPCC contributing scientists and this report on extreme weather events is no exception.
In the scientific report we find the following statements:
“There is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration), after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities.” (My emphasis)
“There is low confidence in observed trends in small spatial-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail because of data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in monitoring systems.” [3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5] (My emphasis)
“There is medium confidence that some regions of the world have experienced more intense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions droughts have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example, in central North America and northwestern Australia.” [3.5.1] (My emphasis)
“There is limited to medium evidence available to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and frequency of floods at regional scales because the available instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited in space and time, and because of confounding effects of changes in land use and engineering. Furthermore, there is low agreement in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of these changes.” [3.5.2] (My emphasis)
“There is medium confidence that anthropogenic influences have contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation at the global scale.”
“The degree of tropical cyclone variability provide only low confidence for the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic influences. Attribution of single extreme events to anthropogenic climate change is challenging.” [3.2.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.4.4, 3.5.3, Table 3-1]
(My emphasis)
“Long-term trends in economic disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate change. Projected changes in climate extremes under different emissions scenarios generally do not strongly diverge in the coming two to three decades, but these signals are relatively small compared to natural climate variability over this time frame.” (My emphasis)
“Projected precipitation and temperature changes imply possible changes in floods, although overall there is low confidence in projections of changes in fluvial floods. Confidence is low due to limited evidence and because the causes of regional changes are complex.” (My emphasis)
 https://www.climateconversation.org.nz/2018/01/what-ipcc-scientists-actually-say/
In summary, the IPCC scientific report is saying there is no clear anthropogenic signal in extreme weather events and there is no evidence of an increase in extreme weather events such as cyclones, tornadoes, flooding and drought.
So what does the IPCC’s Summary for Policymakers say about extreme weather events, bearing in mind that this is the document prepared by UN officials and most likely to be read by the media, environmental activists and politicians?
“Models project substantial warming in temperature extremes by the end of the 21st century. It is virtually certain that increases in the frequency and magnitude of warm daily temperature extremes and decreases in cold extremes will occur in the 21st century at the global scale.” [3.3.1, 3.1.6, Table 3-3, Figure 3-5]
“It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls will increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe.” [3.3.2, 3.4.4, Table 3-3, Figure 3-7]
“Average tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is likely to increase, although increases may not occur in all ocean basins.” [3.4.4]
“There is medium confidence that droughts will intensify in the 21st century in some seasons and areas, due to reduced precipitation and/or increased evapotranspiration.” [3.5.2]
 https://ww2.kqed.org/climatewatch/2011/11/18/un-panel-says-more-severe-weather-on-the-way/
These two documents have clearly reached different conclusions.
6. The IPCC claims that a large number of scientists write the IPCC reports when only a select few do and these include vested interest groups.
The IPCC gives the impression that their conclusions are reached via input from a large number of scientists from a wide range of climate-related disciplines. In fact a small group of geographers, meteorologists, computer modellers and environmentalists exert a disproportionate influence on IPCC conclusions. Relatively little input comes from astrophysicists, geophysicists and geologists who perhaps represent the more important fields that feed into climate science.
Leaked email (5251) shows Dr. Ray Bradley and Dr. Keith Briffa deciding not to get a writing team together, rather they considered they knew the “appropriate people” who would provide the “necessary input.” See:
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/06/250-plus-noteworthy-climategate-2-0-emails/
IPCC Lead Author Dr. Richard Lindzen enlarged on this:
“The consensus was reached before the research had even begun.”
And:
“It’s not 2,500 people offering their consensus, I participated in that. Each person who is an author writes one or two pages in conjunction with someone else… but ultimately, it is written by representatives of governments, of environmental organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, and industrial organizations, each seeking their own benefit.”
http://www.green-agenda.com/science.html
Donna Laframboise has documented numerous cases where environmental activists have been involved in the writing of IPCC reports:
 https://www.wsj.com/articles/warming-up-for-another-climatechange-reportwarming-up-for-another-climatechange-report-1380064012
7. When IPCC scientists have resigned because of perceived IPCC malfeasance, UN officials and the media simply ignore this.
Dr. Paul Reiter heads the Insects and Infectious Disease Unit at the Pasteur Institute. Because of his history of excellence in research of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and other insects, the U.S. State Department in 2001 nominated Reiter to be a lead author of the IPCC’s health chapter.
The IPCC was taking the line (with no supporting evidence) that global warming was increasing the habitats for mosquitoes, putting hundreds of millions of people in the tropics at risk of contracting malaria and dengue fever. They promoted the view that these diseases would spread around the world because of global warming.
Reiter reported that, in its Second Assessment Report chapter on human population health, the IPCC displayed’ “glaring ignorance” about mosquitoes, their survival temperatures and the altitudes where mosquitoes can be found.
Reiter testified to a U.K. parliamentary committee in 2005. He said:
“The paucity of information was hardly surprising: Not one of the lead authors had ever written a research paper on the subject. Moreover, two of the authors, both physicians, had spent their entire career as environmental activists.”
 https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeconaf/12/12we21.htm
Reiter resigned from the IPCC.
Dr. Chris Landsea pointed out how:
“The IPCC process is driven by politics rather than science. It uses summaries to misrepresent what scientists say and exploits public ignorance.”
Landsea resigned from the IPCC.
 https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/12/03/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/cop-25-opens-in-madrid-science-experts-debunk-ipcc/660960/
Dr. Richard Lindzen described the IPCC alarmism as:
“An implausible conjecture backed by false evidence and repeated incessantly has become politically correct ‘knowledge,’ and is used to promote the overturn of industrial civilization.”
Lindzen resigned from the IPCC.
 file://localhost/Climate%20Change%20File/Lindzen/Lindzen%20hits%20alarmism/Lindzen%20hits%20CAGW%20nonsense.html
In 1995 Dr. Roger Pielke was invited to be a contributing author to the IPCC chapter that dealt with regional climate modelling. He submitted recommended text and papers but all of his material was ignored (as it was in 1992 when he was asked to review several chapters in the IPCC supplement report).
Pielke resigned from the IPCC.
 https://pielkeclimatesci.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/my-1995-resignation-letter-from-the-ipcc/
The IPCC has done nothing to investigate any of the problems or to offer an explanation for these resignations. They simply move on with the pursuit of their agenda.
8. The IPCC claims to use only peer-reviewed published literature when it clearly does no such thing.
The non-scientist former Chairman of the IPCC, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri was always dismissive of any scientist or journalist critical of the IPCC selection of literature. Here is one defensive line he used regularly:
“The IPCC studies only peer-review science. Let someone publish the data in a decent credible publication. I am sure the IPCC would then accept it, otherwise we can just throw it into the dustbin.” Rajendra Pachauri, November 2007.
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/10/31/science-is-in-deep-trouble-new-paper-shows/
Similar incorrect statements about the IPCC and peer-review have been echoed by others who actually believed Pachauri:
“Without a strong, peer-reviewed science base (provided by the IPCC) … the case for action on climate change would not be as unequivocal as it is today.” Ban Ki-Moon, United Nations Secretary General, August 2008.
“The IPCC relies entirely on peer reviewed literature in carrying out its assessment.” US Environmental Protection Agency, December 2009.
“The IPCC bases its work on papers that have been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.” The Economist, December 2009.
One has to ask if the above statements are correct?
A team of 43 auditors from 12 countries has scrutinised the IPCC’s 2007 report which comprises 44 chapters in its almost 3,000 pages.
It became clear that, of the 18,531 references cited in the IPCC report, 5,587 (nearly one third) of these were not peer-reviewed. They included press releases, newspaper and magazine articles, discussion papers, student theses, working papers, and literature published by environmental groups.

And:

9. IPCC associates block submissions of papers critical of the anthropogenic global warming alarmism.
There is clear evidence of gate-keeping activities with regard to blocking submitted papers that argue against the notion of the IPCC’s catastrophic anthropogenic global warming alarmism. One of the Climategate emails from IPCC Author Dr. Phil Jones to his colleague Dr. Michael Mann on July 8, 2004, shows Jones confiding that he and IPCC co-author Dr. Kevin Trenberth were determined to keep contrary evidence out of the IPCC Report:
“I can’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin (Trenberth) and I will keep them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is!”
 https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/rorting-data-is-hell-nino/news-story/1a75c66d0a80b3e89d5c9c50e338246a?sv=2ed080c298a30080102e3bb1932cc06b
There are currently more than 1,300 peer-reviewed papers that are skeptical of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming claims.
 http://www.populartechnology.net/2009/10/peer-reviewed-papers-supporting.html
When Dr. Jason Johnston, former Professor of environmental law at the University of Pennsylvania in a paper entitled: Global Warming Advocacy: A Cross-Examination, looked to see if the IPCC reports actually represented “an unbiased and objective assessment.” Johnston reported:
“Such verification means comparing what the IPCC has to say about climate science with what one finds in the peer-reviewed climate science literature.”
He concluded:
“On virtually every major issue in climate change science, IPCC reports systematically conceal or minimize what appear to be fundamental scientific uncertainties.”
Johnston went on to say that when they examined research by “scientists at the very best universities” who are of “unimpeachable credibility” they found “facts and findings that are rarely if ever mentioned” by the IPCC.
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1612851
10. Evidence is clear that temperature rises before atmospheric carbon dioxide level increases. The IPCC ignores this fact.
The proposition that carbon dioxide drives global temperature has been central to the IPCC’s claim of anthropogenic global warming. Yet there is ample empirical data to show this is not the case. In fact there are numerous peer-reviewed published papers showing that rising global temperature precede increasing carbon dioxide levels:
 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10855143_Timing_of_Atmospheric_CO2_and_Antarctic_Temperature_Changes_Across_Termination_III
And:
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V6/N26/EDIT.php
11. The IPCC ignores data showing that carbon dioxide is a minor greenhouse gas and has never driven global temperature.
The notion of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming has been linked with current historic low levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the relatively small inputs of carbon dioxide produced by human activity. Proxy data clearly show that:
Carbon dioxide levels have never driven global temperature over 500 million years of geologic time. See:
https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/Carboniferous_climate.html
Dr. Myles Allen, an IPCC Lead Author, has admitted that the climate computer models are exaggerating warming. He told the London Times (September 2017):
“We haven’t seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models.”
 https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-global-warming-paris-climate-agreement-nature-geoscience-myles-allen-michael-grubb-a7954496.html
The logarithmic warming effect of increasing levels of carbon dioxide was explained by Dr. William Happer, Professor of Physics at Princeton University, to the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, U.S. House of Representatives:
 https://www.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2009/12/professor_happers_testimony_on.html
Retired CSIRO research scientist Dr. LeBlanc Smith questions the role of carbon dioxide in climate change:
“I have yet to see credible proof of carbon dioxide driving climate change, yet alone man-made CO2 driving it.”
 https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=2674e64f-802a-23ad-490b-bd9faf4dcdb7
Dr. Terry Wimberley:
“The CO2 theory of global warming is not verified by geological and climate records going back thousands of years or by observed fact. The CO2 theory of climate change is based upon a computer simulation model and flawed data that has been widely criticized in scientific literature.”
 https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/400467/original/2010_Senate_Minority_Report.pdf
12. A senior IPCC scientist gave an assurance of no NGO input into IPCC reports. This assurance proved false.
Sir John Houghton was Professor of Atmospheric Physics at Oxford University (1976-1983), former head of the UK Meteorological Office (1983-991) and chairman or co-chairman of the IPCC Science Working Group for the first three IPCC reports.
Houghton is also chairman of the John Ray Initiative, an organisation “connecting Environment, Science and Christianity”, where he has compared the stewardship of the Earth, to the stewardship of the Garden of Eden by Adam and Eve. In a presentation called “Climate Change: a Christian Challenge which he gaveto the National Association of Evangelicals (Washington DC, March 2005) he made his position clear:
https://inel.wordpress.com/category/christian-music/
Houghton gave the assurance that: “The IPCC is too big an organisation to be captured by an ideological cabal or fall foul of group-think.”
And: “The IPCC process also makes it impossible for green propaganda to be slipped in.”
And: “A report from Greenpeace or any other campaigning body would not be included because the science would not be considered robust enough.”
 https://motls.blogspot.com/2010/03/john-houghton-about-ecofanatics.html
In fact the IPCC has used input from a number of non-peer reviewed reports and there are many examples.For instance, expert reviewers have connections with Greenpeace; Friends of the Earth; Climate Action Network; World Wildlife Fund; Environmental defence and the David Suzuki Foundation.
Not only has former IPCC Chairman Dr. Rajendra Pachauri had questionable links with environmental advocacy groups, a number of contributors to the IPCC’s reports also have close links with such groups. These include Richard Klein who was a Greenpeace campaigner and Lead Author for the IPCC:

In July, 1999, Adam Markham from the WWF wrote to Mike Hulme and Nicola Sheard, at the University of East Anglia about a paper that Hulme and Sheard had written about climate change in Australasia. They wrote:
Hi Mike
I’m sure you will get some comments direct from Mike Rae in World Wildlife Fund Australia, but I wanted to pass on the gist of what they’ve said to me so far.
They are worried that this may present a slightly more conservative approach to the risks than they are hearing from Australian scientists. In particular, they would like to see the section on variability and extreme events beefed up if possible. …
I guess the bottom line is that if they are going to go with a big public splash on this they need something that will get good support from Australian scientists (who will certainly be asked to comment by the press).
Here are personnel from an environmental activist organisation urging scientists to make sections of their papere more alarming.

Investigative journalist Donna Laframboise has provided numerous examples illustrating how IPCC chapters have input from activists and other vested interests rather than scientists simply looking dispassionately at the evidence:

13. IPCC raw temperature data were withheld by the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit and then “lost.”
The Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UK) was established in the 1980’s and produces a comprehensive record of global surface temperature to be used by the IPCC.
Dr. Phil Jones and Dr. Tom Wigley produced the primary surface temperature reference standard to be used by the IPCC. Despite concern from a number of climate scientists about the location of stations (close to parking lots, trees, airports and heat vents) and limited coverage, the questionable temperature record led to the IPCC declaring there was: “a discernable human influence in global climate.”
 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12518438_Global_Warming_Draft_Report_Affirms_Human_Influence
Jones and Wigley didn’t specify how station data were “adjusted” to allow for location problems. Nonetheless, they produced a record which supposedly showed a warming trend of 0.6° +/- 0.2°C over the 20th century.
Warwick Hughes was suspicious and, in 2005, he asked Dr. Phil Jones for the original raw data. Jones responded:
“Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?”
 https://climateaudit.org/2005/10/15/we-have-25-years-invested-in-this-work/

In November 2011, Willis Eschenbach reported how he also applied for station data, held by the CRU, using a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. He wrote to the University of East Anglia’s David Palmer but it appeared that nobody had the data Eschenbach requested.
It could be argued that someone at the CRU may have committed a crime by refusing to release global warming documents sought in 95 Freedom of Information Act requests. As Dr. Patrick Michaels reflected:
“If there are no data, there’s no science.”
http://breden.org.uk/2009/11/29/climate-change-climategate/
The CRU’s Ian “Harry” Harris was given the seemingly hopeless task of managing their temperature data files. Leaked emails from the CRU highlight his frustration over the “bloody mess” and “the state of the Australian data” and “so many false references” and“so many changes that aren’t documented” and“the whole project is SUCH A MESS.”
 https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2019/11/ten-years-after-climategate/
As the late Christopher Booker observed:
“What is tragically evident from the Harry Read Me file is the picture it gives of the CRU scientists hopelessly at sea with the complex computer programmes they had devised to contort their data in the approved direction, more than once expressing their own desperation at how difficult it was to get the desired results.”
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/05/17/robots-recreating-past-temperatures-are-best-to-avoid-australian-data/
14. IPCC personnel claimed the Earth is “running a fever” when there has been little or no global warming for at least the last 20 years.
IPCC Lead Author, Dr. Kevin Trenberth told Congress in 2005 that evidence for manmade warming is “unequivocal.” He claimed “the planet is “running a fever” and the prognosis is that it is apt to get much worse.”
https://skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=122
In 2009, leaked emails reveal that Trenberth knew that global warming wasn’t happening. He commented to Stephen Schneider, Myles Allen, Peter Stott, Phil Jones, Ben Santer, Tom Wigley, Thomas Karl, Gavin Schmidt, James Hansen and Michael Oppenheimer:
“The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.”
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/05/22/kevin-trenberth-struggles-mightily-to-explain-the-lack-of-global-warming/
Other leaked emails from the University of East Anglia showed IPCC scientists privately admitting their concern that global warming has stopped.
Dr. Phil Jones emailed Tim Johns and Chris Folland expressing concern about the lack of warming. He said:
“Tim, Chris,
I hope you’re not right about the lack of warming lasting till about 2020. I’d rather hoped to see the earlier Met Office press release with Doug’s paper that said something like – half the years to 2014 would exceed the warmest year currently on record, 1998! Still a way to go before 2014.”
 https://www.thegwpf.com/met-office-climate-forecasts-always-wrong-but-never-in-doubt/
There is no evidence to support continued global warming with Dr. Richard Keen of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado pointing out:
“Earth has cooled since 1998 in defiance of the predictions by the UN IPCC… .The global temperature for 2007 was the coldest in a decade and the coldest of the millennium… which is why ‘global warming’ is now called ‘climate change.”
 https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2008/12/post-d6d95751-802a-23ad-4496-7ec7e1641f2f
It is clear that although carbon dioxide levels have increased, mainly via natural inputs, uncontaminated satellite data are showing that global temperatures are not rising as alarmists claim, with cooling at 12 stations in Alaska:

Although there have been a number of warming episodes over the last 3,000 years, the current interglacial maximum temperature has not reached the maximum attained during the previous four interglacial episodes:
https://i1.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GISP2.jpg?ssl=1
IPCC contributing scientist Dr. Don Easterbrook notes that the IPCC reported:
“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950’s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.”
Easterbrook comments:
“There just isn’t any nice way to say this-it’s an outright lie. A vast published literature exists showing that recent warming is not only not unusual, but more intense warming has occurred many times in the past centuries and millennia. As a reviewer of the IPCC report, I called this to their attention, so they cannot have been unaware of it.”

The Covid-19 lockdown as a blueprint for a permanent economic shutdown to ‘save the Earth’
By Paul Driessen
More than 1.4 million cases of Wuhan Coronavirus and 106,000 deaths in the United States alone have accompanied stay-home lockdowns, businesses bankruptcies, over 40 million unemployed workers, plummeting tax revenues and unprecedented debt. Ongoing rioting, vandalism, arson and looting are compounding problems for many cities and minority communities.
But where many see disaster, others see opportunity. Some want to use the crises to enact laws and welfare programs they could never get otherwise. More ambitious activists see the lockdown as a blueprint or dress rehearsal for a total energy, economic and lifestyle transformation to “save the planet.” If three months of Covid lockdowns can reduce fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, they argue, permanent fossil fuel bans are possible, essential and should be undertaken immediately.
Five years ago, former UN official Christiana Figueres said the real goal of climate actions was to “intentionally transform the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years” – and replace it with socialist-environmentalist global governance. More recently, she said post-Corona economic stimulus packages should be used to “kick-start” investments “in low-carbon infrastructure projects that will create jobs and put the world on a safer, fairer, more resilient path.” Others want to use climate change as a pretext for dictating how global wealth and resources will be redistributed.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff is on the same page. The Green New Deal “wasn’t originally a climate thing at all,” he said in May 2019. It was “a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.” Presidential candidate Joe Biden and other leading Democrats have endorsed the GND.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres believes “the pandemic could create an opportunity to rebuild the global economy along more sustainable lines.” His environment chief thinks COVID-19 presents “a chance to do capitalism differently.” The UN Green Climate Fund says it “offers an opportunity to direct finances towards bolstering climate action” and “re-launch[ing] economies on low-emission, climate-resilient trajectories,” to control climate and weather and prevent massive extinctions.
In short, echoing former Obama science advisor John Holdren, they want the United States and other modern societies to de-develop and de-industrialize, establish low-consumption life styles that ensure “more equitable distribution of wealth,” and tell poor countries how much “ecologically feasible” development they will be permitted to pursue.
Perhaps most important, these “visionary” ruling elites will be in charge. They will define what is clean, green, renewable, sustainable, ecologically feasible, safer, fairer, more resilient. They will demand less travel, trade and commerce – for the masses. They will live quite well, while telling today’s oilfield and factory workers their industries must disappear and they must be content with minimum-wage jobs installing, maintaining and dismantling wind turbines and solar panels made overseas.
Fans and implementers of Covid-19 lockdowns have been oblivious to the economic, societal and human devastation caused by the lockdowns: not just economic losses, depleted savings and ruined dreams, but millions of cases of depression, drug addiction, alcoholism, domestic violence, obesity, stroke, heart attack, thousands of deaths from these causes, and suicide and murder attributable to the lockdowns.
Add to that millions of future or still uncounted deaths and disabilities from missed biopsies, skipped cancer screenings and chemotherapy, missed early treatments for stroke and heart-attack patients, and organ transplants simply not performed – because “non-essential” medicine was closed down, people lost their health insurance, or patients were afraid to go to clinics and emergency rooms.
Many hospitals, clinics and practices lost so much money that they may have to close their doors. The cumulative long-term impact from that on healthcare, life spans, and death tolls among obese, diabetic, elderly and severely ill patients could be enormous. These human costs will take years to manifest themselves and be calculated. Indeed, the ultimate cost of the lockdown could be worse than the virus.
We still do not have reliable data on Covid infections, cases and deaths – and don’t know whether deaths were due to Corona, or merely associated with the virus and primarily due to age or serious underlying health problems. We don’t even know how many vulnerable elderly people died from Covid complications inflicted on them by decisions by New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and other officials to force nursing homes to accept recovering Corona patients and keep Covid-infected staff working in those facilities.
All this is from lockdowns lasting several months. Suggestions that we “transform” our economy with expensive, unreliable, weather dependent energy – and endure energy, employment, healthcare and other deprivations in perpetuity – border on homicidal insanity. They would postpone or eliminate any economic recovery, result in unimaginable misery and death in now-developed countries – and condemn tens of millions of people in still impoverished nations to horrible suffering, disease, starvation and death.
As to saving the planet and ensuring “ecologically feasible” development, GND energy systems would be vastly more devastating to scenic areas, habitats and wildlife – and to human health and welfare – than any likely effects from manmade portions of future climate changes or weather events.
As Michael Moore’s new film, “Planet of the Humans,” dramatically demonstrates, wind, solar, battery and biofuel technologies are the antithesis of clean, green, renewable and sustainable. Even worse, the ecological devastation it documents is happening in a world that is still 81% dependent on oil, natural gas and coal, 4% on nuclear and 7% on hydroelectric. The impacts and species losses would be orders of magnitude greater if we were 100% dependent on pseudo-renewable energy sources.
Adopting UN-AOC energy prescriptions would require literally millions of 800-foot-tall wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of half-ton batteries, thousands of biofuel plantations and clear-cut forests, billions of battery-powered vehicles, and thousands of new and expanded mines to provide tens of billions of tons more metals and minerals. The ecological impacts would reach every corner of every continent. Hundreds of bird, bat, reptile and mammalian species would disappear. Household, hospital, school, business and factory electricity costs would skyrocket. Jobs and industries would vanish.
Those prescriptions would also make the United States enormously dependent on China, not just for medical devices and pharmaceutical components – but for metals, raw materials and component parts needed in wind turbines, solar panels, backup power batteries, and defense, aerospace and high-technology applications. And all that mining and manufacturing, in Asia and other distant lands, would require fossil fuels, at levels far beyond anything seen in history, under minimal to nonexistent pollution, workplace safety and human rights laws, accompanied by prodigious emissions of carbon dioxide.
Fans and implementers of GND transformations are willfully oblivious of these realities. They refuse to discuss them or allow others to discuss them – because to do so would destroy their phony “saving the planet” narrative and quest for total control over our lives, livelihoods, living standards and liberties.
No wonder the UN-AOC-environmentalist crowd went ballistic over Moore’s film. YouTube yanked the movie from its viewing platform, and “mainstream” media, social media, search engines and information sites are now engaging in blatant censorship on climate, energy and environmental issues.
An increasingly activist, liberal media complex also wants to dictate and control what people see, hear, say and think on race relations, medicine and virtually every other political topic. From the NY Times and Washington Post, to Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Wikipedia, platforms that should be forums for robust debate instead are used to dictate what is true or false, permissible or banned.
US, EU and UN green new deals are just one component of the battle for our future. Corona lockdowns should serve as a bitter taste of what could come – not as a dress rehearsal or blueprint for it.

By Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
18 May 2020
The response to our appeal for Naomi Seibt has been splendid – but more of us need to help her, because the State Media Authority in North Rhine Westphalia, in the hope of interfering with Naomi’s right to post YouTube videos critical of the Party Line on climate, have menaced her not only with two enormous fines and two sets of costs but also with prison.

Naomi really, really needs our help. If you have already donated, many thanks for your generosity. More than $1000 a month has been pledged in just 24 hours. Keep it coming – she’ll need every penny. Just donate to Naomi directly. Do it now, if not sooner.
Monthly contribution ($10 or more if you can): https://www.patreon.com/naomiseibtmy.
One-off contribution ($100 or more if you can): https://ww.paypal.me/naomiseibt2000.
Naomi’s defense lawyer has already scored one success: the Authority has been compelled to abandon its campaign to force her to take down the first of the three videos it has complained of, because she made it long before she had met anyone from the Heartland Institute, which the Authority dislikes because they regard her single mention of it in one of the three videos complained of as constituting “product placement”, contrary to the anti-free-speech law of North Rhine Westphalia, where she lives.
Though the two videos of which the Authority continues to complain would constitute a first offense – Naomi is only 19, after all, and cannot be expected to have known that free speech had been shut down in her part of Germany by an obscure and inspissate law – the Authority is trying to make her pay a fine of 1000 euros plus another 200 euros costs for each of the two videos: total 2400 euros. If she doesn’t pay, this is the threat these wretches have made:
“If the enforcement of the penalty payment is unsuccessful, the competent administrative court may, upon application by the enforcement authorities, order first-time compulsory detention. The substitute compulsory detention is at least one day and at most two weeks.”
You be the judges. Here’s the text of the first video the Authority wants to ban:
I WANT YOU TO THINK
Welcome to the Heartland Institute 2020
Posted Feb 11, 2020

Hello, everyone. My name is Naomi Seibt and I am a new member at the Heartland Institute. And I’ve got very good news for you. The world is not ending because of climate change. In fact, 12 years from now we will still be around, casually taking photos on our iPhone 18s, Tweeting about the current President on Twitter and ranting about the latest celebrity gossip. However, we are currently being force-fed a very dystopian agenda of climate alarmism that tells us that we as humans are destroying the planet and that the young people especially have no future: that the animals are dying, that we are ruining nature.
I truly believe that many members of Antifa, Fridays for Future groups, Rebellion Extinction, I really believe that many of them have good intentions but they are genuinely scared of the world ending, and scared that their parents and grandparents are ruining the planet, that it’s breaking relationships, it’s breaking up families, and we at the Heartland Institute, we want to spread truth about the science behind climate realism, which is essentially the opposite of climate alarmism.
Many people are now actually developing mental disorders, and referring to it as eco-anxiety and eco-depression. And I believe it is important that we act now and change this entire mainstream narrative of fear-mongering and climate alarmism, because it’s basically just holding us hostage in our own brains.
With all of that said, don’t let an agenda that is trying to depict you as an energy-sucking leech on the planet get into your brain and take away all of your passionate spirit.
I don’t want you to panic. I want you to think.
Would you inflict a fine of 1000 euros plus 200 euros costs, or up to two weeks’ jail in lieu, for that short, harmless video that does little more than announce to Naomi’s 46,000 subsecribers that she was going to work for the Heartland Institute? This was a first “offense” – if “offense” were the right word, which of course it is not. Would you imprison a teenager who had not actually said or done anything wrong, except to exercise her right of free speech in terms of the European Human Rights Convention? No. But welcome to today’s Europe.
Here’s the full text of the second video, which doesn’t mention Heartland at all. It is a speech that Naomi gave in Germany. Heartland had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not pay for it and did not influence the content in any way. Much of the material, including data and even some direct quotations, came from a speech that Naomi had heard me give in Munich a few weeks previously:
ANTI-GRETA or PRO-HUMAN?
Posted Feb 16, 2020
Manmade climate change has become a topic so unquestionable that everyone who dares to express even just a hint of scepticism is immediately labelled a “Climate Denier”. And, out of all people, it is the ones who tend to call us “Nazis” who fail to realize that this is a truly disgusting way to mock the severity of the Holocaust. I personally prefer the term “Climate Realist”. [Applause]
But why should you, in the context of such a profound and scientific topic, listen to some girl with long blonde hair giving a speech? And – yes, exactly – this question, “Why are you listening to a young girl?”, is the same question that I ask the people who go out and protest for Fridays for Future every single week,as Greta-worshippers.
And this is why I ask you not to believe every word I say unconditionally, but to give me a chance to speak, to listen carefully, and then to continue doing your research and form your own opinion on the climate change situation and any other political topic. I can be wrong sometimes. Don’t create an ideology out of something that a young girl has to say, regardless of the political side she’s on.
All the predictions that the IPCC, which you have probably heard of before, has published since 1990 have not been supported by the empirical evidence. In the last copule of decades global warming has been way less severe than initially foretold by the IPCC. They calimed that we would have tro expect a third of a degree of global warming per decade. Well, that prediction failed, so they are now calling it “Climate Change” instead of “Global Warming”. On top of that, they overestimated the magnitude of global warming even despite the fact that CO2 emissions have been increasing more than anticipated by the IPCC – which shows us just how successful all those political “Climate Conferences” with their CO2 reduction goals have been in recent years.
Moreover, all hypotheses that the IPCC has put out there are entirely based on climate models. So this means that they come up with lots of climate-related variables that they think will have an effect on global warming. But in reality those variables cannot possibly describe climate processes accurately, because the climate is way too complex to be depicted by a computer model. We have to consider so many factors, such as the makeup of the Earth’s surface, feedback responses, from water in all of its aggregate phases, mechanisms in the atmosphere – and what about the Sun? Has anyone considered the immense impact that the Sun has on the climate in comparison to manmade CO2 emissions?
The IPCC’s climate models predict that you get a warming effect of 4.1 degrees per doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, when we apply the reverse calculation with real temperature data since 1850, we will find that CO2 emissions only account for 1.4 degrees of actual extra warming. So that means that those climate models are calculating with amplifying factors that artificially inflate the global warming prognoses.
But what is so dangerous about all of this is that we are now doing real politics with this fictional science – and that does not work. [Applause]
Man overestimates his power if he thinks that his plastic straw could have any significant effect at all on the climate. Furthermore, it is incredibly primitive to confuse “climate ” with “weather” in the same breath, which is what most people do. This overestimation of Man’s power leads to a hysterical implementation of climate policies and we must not tolerate such an impulsive reaction because the consequences for our society will be detrimental. We know that.
The scientific scepticism of climate alarmists fails in the face of even the most simple questions: What is the ideal global mean surface temperature for the Earth? [Applause]. Has anyone ever given you an answer to that question? And if not, that means that we don’t even have any kind of foundation upon which we can base an evaluation of the repercussions of global warming. Perhaps global warming isn’t even that detrimental. But as long as we don’t answer simple questions, we cannot tolerate impulsive political reactions. [Applause]
And this is exactly what becomes evident: it is not about science. It is all about politics. It is about the suppression of scepticism. It is about the suppression of free science and free speech, and that’s why we have to fight back. [Applause]
And they all worship Greta, a young and innocent, but als an utterly immature and uneducated girl who is being shamelessly taken advantage of for the perfidious agenda of climate hysteria. And this is why I want to make this very clear: I am not the anti-Greta. Because that is exactly the label that those protesters outside want me to embrace, so that they have another scapegoat whom they can put in a simple box with the rest of their adversaries.
The message that I want to send out is way more than “Anti-Greta”. I am not “Anti-Greta”. I don’t force anyone to give up their dogmas about climate change. I want us to havew more opportunities for discussion. I want us to listen to one another. And I want us to be allowed to be scientific sceptics. [Applause]
Instead, by misrepresenting us in the media, chanting malicious slogans to defame us and prohibiting us from making public appearances, they want to strip us of every opportunity to speak up, because our words and free thoughts are a threat to those whose world-views are no more than an ideological complex on shaky foundations. [Applause]
No, I am not “Anti-Greta”, and we are not “Climate Deniers”. We must not let anyone degrade us and make us members of the controlled opposition. For we have our own positive ambitions, ideas and qualities. We are not “Anti-Nature”, but “Pro-Science, “Pro-Innovation”, “Pro-Sensible Environemtnal Policies”; and, most importantly, we are “Pro-Human”. [Applause]
The true Anti attitude belongs to the enemies of reason – the proponents of anti-humanism. [Applause]
We are not parasites on the planet. For hundreds of years we have been exploring, researching, inventing and building for a healthier, better and freer society. We must not put ourselves into a tight strait-jacket of overtaxation. We must not deny to ourselves, nor to the people from very poor third-world countries, access to cheap and reliable energy. We must not take away the young generation’s hope for a good future and drive them into an eco-depression. [Applause]
So please do not leave this event with a profound rage against Greta or the protesters or even the media who might want to depict us as Climate Deniers or radical right-wing egoists. It’s time we put an end to this depressing “Anti” attitude. Rage and panic belong to our opponents. [Applause]
My last words to you: I don’t want you to panic. I want you to think. [Standing ovation]
Some commenters on my first piece about this burgeoning international scandal could not quite believe that fines – and, as it now turns out, menaces of imprisonment – could possibly have been issued in what is supposed to be a democratic country without any court hearing. But that is exactly what happened.
Worse, when the Authority demanded that Naomi should reply to its original letter, it gave her a frighteningly short time to reply in detail. Yet she had been very ill with an ailment that came quite close to proving fatal, so her lawyer wrote to ask for more time. The Authority paid no attention and issued the demand for fines and costs regardless.
Thanks to your generosity, Naomi is now going to fight this fundamental and malicious attack on her human rights in court. The good news is that under the European Human Rights Convention she is entitled to a fair trial. Extensive case law establishes that if at any stage the trial process was defective and the defendant was not given a fair hearing the defect cannot be remedied at any subsequent stage, and the entire case must be thrown out.
But arguing in court costs an arm and a leg. So please donate at once. Thank you very much.

Planet of the Humans is a hauntingly beautiful production, not being a film buff I can’t grade the camera work but I suspect it is gold standard – see the shots of rusting windmills, the desolate ruins of a gigantic billion dollar solar farm and the wasteland of tree stumps created to provide “sustainable” power from “biomass”.

By Viv Forbes
In their frantic attempts to delay the spread of the Wuhan virus, governments are sowing the seeds of economic depression and currency destruction, which will blight Australian lives for a generation. They are adding financial stress to the medical stress.
The ordinary flu virus kills many people every winter despite vaccines. And both viruses are more lethal for the old and the sick.
We do not close the whole country every flu season but this year’s crisis is being exploited by scare mongers, centralists and globalists whose slogan is “never let a decent crisis go to waste”.
Whole industries are being destroyed before our eyes – airlines, shipping, the whole tourism and entertainment industry, sport, small business, pubs and clubs, retailers and most investment and retirement funds. All sacrificed because governments fear that a sharp spike in illnesses will expose inadequacies in the government-managed hospital/health/welfare bureaucracy. Next they will exploit this economic crisis to promote digital currency, kill cash and get their sticky fingers on our superannuation assets.
Already the green globalists are celebrating as industry emissions fall and political power moves towards central governments and global organisations. They will now abuse this economic crisis by pushing their climate agenda with stimulus packages that favour green energy.
As this government-created economic cyclone destroys industry and jobs, politicians are panicking and scattering cash like confetti at a wedding. This encourages immediate consumption, but this “stimulation” stops dead when the money tap is turned off. The debts will remain, somewhere.
We don’t want more sit-down-money from big government while we hide forlornly at home ordering take-aways – we want conditions which encourage investment and productive employment.
We need measures to encourage the creation of new businesses, industries and jobs. For starters, immediate repeal of payroll taxes, stamp duty, capital gains tax, wage controls, a rates holiday and reduced income tax. And immediate and permanent repeal of all green barriers to new business and jobs.
We need Australians building new dams, railways, roads, real power stations, factories, farms, forests and mines, not sitting sadly at home fearing ration coupons and being drip-fed on some piddling new allowance.

Professor Guus Berkhout
President of CLINTEL

Your Excellencies,
LESSON IN HUMILITY ­- UNPREDICTABLE NATURAL FORCES CHANGE THE WORLD
The world is in the middle of a serious health crisis. Today, the people of the world face a true emergency – a health crisis in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. People need an inspiring narrative that promises them a hopeful future. Today, for instance, it is totally inappropriate that the billion-dollar Green New Deal focused on climate is still on the agenda of leaders such as Mr. Antonio Guterres of the UN and Mr. Frans Timmermans of the EU.
Your Excellencies, compared to COVID-19 climate change is a non-problem! It is based on computer models and looks into the far future. In current health emergency, however, your attention to the peoples’ needs is today! Please, don’t continue pushing your zero carbon emission ambition in a time that the world is dealing with a deadly global crisis. Yes, there is an emergency, but it is NOT the climate.
While courageous doctors and nurses are saving many lives, climate alarmists and climate critics should stop fighting, step over their own shadow and work together against this deadly virus. In this difficult time, humility suits us all. World leaders, please show us the way! As a very first step, designated Green New Deal money must be redirected and invested in a significantly better global health system. In such a renovation process, don’t exclude critical professionals. History tells us that a pandemic like COVID-19 will happen again. At least, we must be better prepared.
ZERO CARBON EMISSION – IMPOSSIBLE AND UNDESIRABLE
The past 150 years show that affordable and reliable energy is key to public health, sanitation, education and prosperity. The past 150 years also show that more CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth and increasing the yields of crops. Why do world leaders ignore these hard facts? Why do world leaders do the opposite with their Green New Deal and lower the quality of life by forcing high-cost, dubious low-carbon energy technologies upon their citizens?
COVID-19 COMBINED WITH ZERO CARBON – AN UNFORGIVABLE MISTAKE
Today, billions of public monies need to be spent to avoid mass bankruptcies and to get the economy on its feet again after we have left the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. CLINTEL’s strong advice to the world leaders is: “To revive the global economy don’t further increase government debts. Instead, apply the money intended for your costly Green New Deal to the present needs of people and society. Call it the COVID-19 RECOVERY PLAN. Be aware that in today’s crisis the conjectural policy of CO2 reduction is highly counterproductive!”
CLINTEL’S ADVICE FOR THE FUTURE – FIGHT VIRUS NOT CARBON
The world is moving to an open global economy of ten billion people. Top priority must be given to significant investments in a global health system that makes any pandemic less catastrophic. Considering COVID-19, climate alarmists and climate critics should admit that global warming is a non-problem. Therefore, stop fighting, step over your own shadow and work together against the deadly virus. In this tough battle we need each other!
Your Excellencies, be responsible to the people and stop immediately with the Green New Deal plans. These plans would push the global economy into an even deeper recession. Please, don’t spend billions of dollars on subsidizing dubious low-carbon energy technologies and mass deforesting projects for biomass fuel while thousands are dying. Use these designated billions of dollars to improve the global health system on our planet. In CLINTEL’s COVID-19 RECOVERY PLAN we also suggest to issue bonds to invest in a top global monitoring system that informs experts about early changes in group-health all over the world.

The Federal Gallery journal has published this article by Dr Brady in its March 2020 edition. Dr Brady says that “politicians on both sides of the climate debate are making statements that are actually false. In good faith they think that certain propositions are correct”, so he needs to show otherwise.

https://clexit.net/2020/02/25/net-zero-albanese-goes-for-broke/,clexit-admin,Net-Zero by 2050? Albanese Goes for Broke,"

From: https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2020/02/net-zero-by-2050-albanese-goes-for-broke/
There’s no great mystery about what Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese’s net-zero-by-2050 emissions announcement last weekend will cost. The answer: trillions galore. How do I know? Because Dr Brian Fisher, former head of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, who has no political allegiance and no vested interest, last May in the run-up to the federal election costed a much weaker version of Albanese’s plan. These costs were astronomic: a maximum $540 billion by 2030.
Then-opposition leader Bill Shorten’s plan was for a 45 per cent cut in CO2 emissions on 2005 levels by 2030. Note, firstly, how much less stringent is this compared with Albanese’s net-zero by 2050, especially as the initial work plucks the low-hanging fruit and thereafter the abatement costs rise exponentially.
New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, last year announced carbon neutrality by 2050. In a rare but commendable bit of sanity, she asked a respected economics institute to estimate the cost. This revealed that getting to 50 per cent below 1990-levels in 2050 would cost at least 5 per cent of GDP annually by 2050. The cost would be similar to the current entire NZ expenditure on socialised education and health care.
Back home, as they say on the TV news, Labor’s pre-election 2030 plans involved some undetailed pledges to protect “emissions intensive trade-exposed industries (EITEs)” but also a ban on using Kyoto credits arising from over-achievement of previous emissions reductions. Fisher allowed for these factors plus varying use of international emissions permits. Such use of international permits would greatly lower costs of Labor’s 2030 plan, but Blind Freddy knows that such permits are rife with rorting and mere virtue-posturing. As Fisher says hopefully, the permits would have to involve best-practice “independent measurement, verification and audit.”[1]
You want costings? Here we go[2]:
# Labor’s target of a 45 per cent cut by 2030 would involve the equivalent of a carbon tax of between $67 and $405 a tonne of CO2 in 2030. Julia Gillard, eat your heart out. ABCTV News’ presenter Tamara Oudyn last night (Feb 23) quoted Albanese as saying that Labor could meet net-zero-2050 “without putting a price on carbon”.[3] Go figure.
# Fisher: Cumulative GNP losses from 2021-30 are estimated at $542 billion for a scenario in which Labor pursues its climate policy by restricting trade in international emissions permits to 25 per cent of the abatement task while protecting EITEs (emissions intensive trade-exposed industries). These losses can be more than halved, to $264 billion under a scenario in which there are no restrictions on trade in international permits, while still protecting EITEs.
To get these $264b-$542b losses in perspective, Australia’s entire annual economic output is currently about $1400 billion.
# However, the more Labor protects the emissions-exposed trade sectors, the worse cost burden falls on unprotected sectors and households (that is, on you and me).
# Fisher: Negative consequences for real wages and employment are projected under all scenarios, with a minimum 3 per cent reduction in real wages and 167,000 less jobs in 2030 compared to what otherwise would have occurred.
Sadly, the maximum would be more than 10 per cent reduction in real wages and about 320,000 jobs lost. Australia’s working class, with friends like Labor, doesn’t need enemies. Don’t forget that we’re talking here about quite a mild Labor target compared with Albanese’s net-zero-2050.
# Wholesale electricity prices as things stand are likely to rise 1.5 per cent a year this decade in real terms. “Each of the [Labor] policy scenarios considered here results in a far greater growth rate in electricity prices,” Fisher wrote. In numbers, the price rise would be from 36 per cent to 67 per cent. Suppose your household power bill these days is $2000. Labor would bring you a different bill of between $2700 and $3340. And that’s the Opposition Leader’s first installment of increases in his quest for net-zero-emissions. Albanese’s line is that renewables are cheaper. Yeah, right, Albo.
# The 45 per cent emissions-cut plan by 2030 would lower the output of the Land Transport sector by 2.1 per cent to 11.3 per cent by 2030. Other reductions would be Water and Air Transport down 1.8 – 8 per cent, Construction down 2.1 -7.2, per cent, Services 2.1 – 4.9 per cent, and Iron & Steel, 2.0 –10.6 per cent, compared to no-policy-change.
When the Business Council of Australia trumpets its love for zero-by-2050 policies, members ought to ask in whose interest the BCA is speaking.
The numbers above may all look big, but keep in mind that green ambitions don’t come cheap. Globally, spending on emissions reduction runs now at about $US1.5 trillion, i.e. $US1,500,000,000,000 per year.
All but a trifle of this is being spent by the West. China, India and Africa are going hell-bent for cheap, reliable coal-fired electricity and their emissions growth will continue to swamp utterly whatever cuts are made, at such fearsome costs, by Europe and its fellow travellers like us.
So the West’s anti-emission crusade, let alone Australia’s, will make not a jot of difference to the climate, even assuming that CO2 is the climate’s control-knob, which is kindergarten science given the unknowns and complexities of the climate system and solar forces.
There’s another way to come at Albanese’s zero-by-2050 target, based on technologies required.
Simply put, to get to the net zero by 2050 would involve phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with emissions-free nuclear power. Obviously wind and solar power can’t do the job alone or at all.
Albanese’s target would require the deployment of a new nuclear-power plant each 65 days until January 2051, each of about the scale of Florida’s Turkey Point nuclear plant (1400MW) or Victoria’s Hazelwood coal-fired plant (1600MW). That’s five and half new nukes per year. This equation can be simply calculated from data from the International Energy Agency (see formulae below).
Keep in mind that one nuclear plant could cost at least $13 billion, based on overseas best-practice. Just imagine how the CFMMEU and State Premiers like Dan Andrews could amplify that cost. (Premier Dan in 2015 incurred a net $640m costs to taxpayers just to break the contract for Melbourne’s desperately-needed East-West tunnel because he needed some green-electorate NIMBY votes). But to be conservative, in a perfect world the cost of Australia’s required wholesale transition to nuclear power plants would be about $2 trillion, compared with our annual GDP of $1.4 trillion.[4]
The maths are also exciting for those with faith in wind power. For the same output of a Turkey Point US nuclear plant (1400MW) substitute 1500 state-of-the-art 2.5MW wind turbines, each 130 metres tall.
Albanese’s plan would require 23 of these wind turbines per day coming on-line, or 161 a week or 250,000 in total to January 2051. A giant farm of 1500 turbines needs close to 800 square kilometres of ground, so pity help the bats and birds. Wind turbines installed in penny packets would squander even more land. Conservatively, Australia’s quarter of a million turbines would need about 130,000 square kilometres — twice the area of Tasmania. Not in my backyard? If we assume 80 backyards per street, that would mean two 130-metre wind towers for every street in Australia.[5]
Albanese’s plan must involve a giant leap in our engineering and technology sectors. To get real, the Opposition leader ought to demand that every Arts student at universities, including those writing PhD theses on LGBTI Dance Theory, must transfer to science and technology faculties. Greenies also need to suck up that their transition to renewables will require a vast increase in the mining and processing sectors to acquire the resources needed. (If we shut down coal and gas exports, as Greenies demand, the impact on the Australian dollar exchange rate will make imported resource materials pricey indeed).
Albanese is flat-out deluded: “The private sector has taken up the challenge which is there, because they recognise that action on climate change isn’t just a challenge, it’s an opportunity.” Some opportunity, mate.
The formulae:
I’ve provided the Australian maths courtesy of a template from Dr Roger J. Pielke Jr, writing in Forbes and published on September 30, 2019. He’s a long-term IPCC author on weather disasters and his degrees include one in maths. Incidentally, he’s also a research expert on cheating in world elite sports.
Pielke’s simple formulae go like this:
Global fossil-fuel consumption, 2018 – 11,743 MTOE (million tonnes of oil equivalent)[6]. Output of Florida’s Turkey Point 1400MW nuclear plant, 1 MTOE. Days left till end-2050 – 11,037. Global deployment of nuclear power required by 2050 in Turkey Point units, more than one per day. To include forecast energy growth of 5800 MTOE (1.25% a year to 2040), add half a Turkey Point per day. One Turkey Point nuclear output equals 1500 wind turbines of 2.5MW each.
The recent BP Statistical Review of World Energy has fossil fuel energy use for US and Australia. BP put Australia in 2018 at 133 MTOE. With assumed 20 years growth of usage at 1.25 per cent p.a., the task by 2050 is to get rid of 170 MTOE. Divide 11,000 days by 170 = one nuclear plant per 65 days. Concurrently, we’d also need to be decommissioning the equivalent in fossil-fuel power sources.
It’s not as though any meaningful global switch from fossil fuels is already underway. As I mentioned here, each day humanity is moving in the other direction: more fossil fuels. In 2018 the world added more than 280 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) of fossil fuel consumption compared with 106 MTOE of carbon-free consumption, says Pielke, citing BP. To move towards net-zero, all of those 400 MTOE additions ought to be carbon-free, while replacing and retiring 400 MTOE of existing fossil fuel consumption. “In a round number,” he remarks., “the deployment rate of carbon-free energy would need to increase by about 800 per cent.”
It’s symptomatic of the madness besetting Australia that the States (Labor and conservative-led) have all subscribed to the net-zero-2050 mantra. So has the clueless Australian Academy of Science. So have scores of nations. Where will it all end?

[1] Moreover, the UN climate zealots are unlikely to agree to unrestricted emissions trading, as Fisher concedes.
[2] Fisher was not doing a cost-benefit analysis as he said he didn’t know what the benefits of emissions reductions would bring. Since Australia’s impact on global emissions is effectively zero vis a vis emissions growth by China, India and the sensible Third World, our impact on the climate would also be zero. Further, the climate impact of all the Paris pledges would also be in significant or effectively zero, according to Bjorn Lomberg’s estimates based on IPCC formulae. In any event, some mild further warming could be beneficial rather than detrimental. And no-one knows if global climate trends might revert to natural cooling.
[3] ABC didn’t show the quote directly
[4] I’ll cite this just for fun, but Extinction Rebellion’s local demands for zero-net emissions by 2025 would require a new Australian nuclear plant every 11 days, or 33 nukes per year.

https://clexit.net/2020/02/24/clintel-climate-debate/,clexit-admin,CLINTEL Plans a Grand Climate Debate,"


By   David Wojick  |February 23rd, 2020




The fast growing Climate Intelligence Foundation (CLINTEL) is planning a major debate on climate change. The event will coincide with the COP 26 UN climate summit in Glasgow this November. Unlike previous attempts at decisive debates, this one has an excellent chance of really happening.

CLINTEL President, Professor Guus Berkhout, explains the plan this way: “We are starting to organize the ‘debate of all debates’ just prior to COP 26 in Glasgow. More specific, CLINTEL will organize a constructive high-level meeting between world-class scientists on both sides of the climate debate. The meeting will give effect to the sound and ancient principle that both sides should be fully and fairly heard. Audiatur et altera pars. In CLINTEL we call it ‘The Grand Climate Debate’ and we plan to repeat such a landmark event each year! In this way we start a serious global depolarising initiative that could be the beginning of a new era. We propose to use the factual and well formulated World Climate Declaration as a basis for the agenda.”
Planning is fluid at this point but the ideas being considered are most intriguing. Here is a quick look at just some of them.
Rather than have debaters wing it, with lengthy ad hoc opening presentations, they will focus successively on the six principles outlined in CLINTEL’s World Climate Declaration. These are central issues in climate science and policy:
1. Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause global warming. Nobody knows the ratio between the two.
2. Warming is far slower than predicted. There is no climate emergency.
3. Climate policy relies on inadequate models. Models provide poor physical-numerical insight, making updating no more than guessing.
4. CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth. CO2 is not a pollutant and more CO2 is indispensable for a greener Earth
5. Global warming has not increased natural disasters. Increase of natural disasters only exists in computer models.
6. Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities. Current medicine (mitigation) is much worse than the disease (warming).
To avoid speech making there will be strict time limits on statements. The goal is to generate as much back and forth as possible, so that each argument gets fully fleshed out. There will be no lengthy canned presentations.
Berkhout says “The Secretary-General of the UN, António Guterres, has been invited to organize this grand debate together with CLINTEL. If he refuses to cooperate, the President of the EU will be approached. If the EU also refuses, which would be a huge embarrassment for the mainstream climate community, CLINTEL will even consider the use of trained stand-ins. These will be skeptics who have thoroughly studied the alarmist’s arguments and are prepared to present them.”
This stand-in concept is aligned with the standard scholastic debating technique, where debaters are assigned a position to defend and their actual beliefs are irrelevant. But again, what a disgrace for the mainstreamers if stand-ins would be required!
There have been several prior attempts to generate a systematic scientific debate, but each has failed. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wanted to convene a “Red Team” exercise, but he was blocked by Whitehouse staff on political grounds.
The National Security Council’s Will Happer argued for a critique of alarmist claims relevant to national security. Reportedly President Trump liked the idea, but it too was killed on the grounds that making big waves is bad in an election year.
In another case, the Heartland Institute invited several prominent alarmist scientists to a televised debate moderated by John Stossel. None accepted so the skeptics presented their side unopposed. CLINTEL wants to avoid this result at all costs.
Mind you, the world doesn’t want canned presentations and it doesn’t want stand-inns. What CLINTEL is proposing will be unique and powerful. Looking what they have achieved so far, they can make it happen. Here’s hoping they do! The world needs to see the real debate over the truth in climate science.
Moreover, Berkhout explains “The point is to have a genuine debate. It will result in a summary, giving an overview of the issues the scientists agree and don’t agree on. This list will be the source of a new global climate research program that is supported by all parties.”
To conclude, understanding the climate system has the highest priority. That is the responsibility of scientists, not politicians. Politicians should be aware that science always advances via the articulation of critical questions. Climate science needs this, and needs it badly.

By Dr. John Happs
The term “climate denier” continues to be used by those promoting catastrophic global warming from the trivial emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. It is a derogatory term, first coined by the journalist Ellen Goodman. In 2007 she wrote for the Boston Globe:
“I would like to say we’re at a point where global warming is impossible to deny. Let’s just say that global warming deniers are now on a par with Holocaust deniers, though one denies the past and the other denies the present and future.”
https://sites.google.com/site/climategenocide/goodman-ellen-1
Dennis Prager responded to Goodman’s vitriol:
“The Ellen Goodman quote is only the beginning of what is already becoming one of the largest campaigns of vilification of decent people in history – the global condemnation of a) anyone who questions global warming; or b) anyone who agrees that there is global warming but who argues that human behaviour is not its primary cause; or c) anyone who agrees that there is global warming, and even agrees that human behaviour is its primary cause, but does not believe that the consequences will be nearly as catastrophic as Al Gore does.”
https://www.dennisprager.com/on-comparing-global-warming-denial-to-holocaust-denial/
The terms “climate denier” and “global warming denier” are deeply offensive. They equate disagreement about science with Holocaust denial, which is obviously the reason “denial” rather than “disagreement” is used. It is nasty and insulting, and no decent scientist, journalist, or anyone else for that matter, should ever use those expressions.
There will always be (and should be) disagreement about various issues in science among scientists but should Einstein have been called a “physics denier” because he rejected the widely held luminiferous ether hypothesis? Should Copernicus have been called an “astronomy denier”?
Science has always been about debate. Science progresses by the constant testing of ideas and hypotheses against experiment. Terms such as “consensus” should never be used as an argument since it is a political/ideological term and not one that belongs in science.
Try telling that to the media and today’s climate alarmists.
Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has come under much criticism, a number of conclusions reached by the IPCC about climate change have been endorsed by many scientists.
Presumably all scientists would agree that the Earth’s climate is changing and has always changed over the last 4 billion years.
Presumably all scientists would agree that the Earth has warmed since the end of the Little Ice Age (1300-1850) via natural processes.
Presumably most scientists would agree that doubling the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide would raise global temperature. What appears to be contentious and divisive is the amount of warming that might be attributed to human activity and whether global warming or any future increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would be beneficial or harmful.
It is unfortunate that those who embrace the climate alarmist position continue to malign those who claim there is no climate emergency with repeated use of the term “climate denier” along with attempts to marginalize and even ridicule those scientists who do not embrace their climate alarmism.
Some climate alarmists continue to denigrate anyone who attempts to provide alternative scientific facts. One common ploy has been to use vilification along with the suggestion that skeptical arguments come from unreliable sources.
For instance, in October, 2009 Annabel Crabb interviewed journalist Andrew Bolt on the ABC’s Insiders program. Crabb acidly asked:
“Where does Andrew Bolt get his climate change sceptic facts and figures from? The University of East Bumcrack?”
Other climate alarmists have attempted to persuade the general public and politicians that “only a handful” of scientists reject the mantra of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming.
Bing.com: Only a handful?
Science historian Naomi Oreskes, in her publication: “The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change: How Do We Know We’re Not Wrong?” Claimed:
“Today, all but a tiny handful of climate scientists are convinced that earth’s climate is heating up and that human activities are a significant cause.”
https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/resources/globalwarming/oreskes-chapter-4.pdf
This claim was repeated in the Oreske and Conway 2012 book:
“Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming.”
Journalist Johann Hari, writing for The Independent and The Huffington Post also claimed that a mere handful of scientists rejected climate alarmism. He stated:
“Quite apart from being a damaging and unscientific climate change denier, Senator Inhofe could be described as an enemy of science and reason themselves. The Senator’s statements have been “repudiated” by “even the handful of contrarian scientists Inhofe constantly cites.”
https://www.campaigncc.org/climate_change/sceptics/hall_of_shame
John Cook and Thomas Farmer, in their book “Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis” also referred to that handful of dissenters:
“A variation of the Fake Expert strategy is to take the handful of remaining dissenting climate scientists and magnify their voices to give the impression of more significant disagreement than there actually is.”

Paul Krugman, writing in The New York Times also implied that a mere handful of scientists rejected climate alarmism, saying:
“As far as I can tell, every one of the handful of well-known scientists who have expressed climate skepticism has received large sums of money from these companies or from dark money conduits like Donors Trust.”
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/opinion/climate-change-denial-republican.html
Edvardsson et al. (2017) go one step further in their paper: “Climate and environmental science denial: A review of the scientific literature published in 1990-2015″ asserting (my emphasis) that:
“The number of countries where climate change denial is strong is still limited to a handful.”
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617317821
Astrophysicist Richard Schwartz used the expression: handful of contrarians:
“Most important, contrarians must show why the scientific basis of greenhouse gas warming is incorrect. It remains unfortunate that the opinions of a handful of contrarians should be given the same weight in the press and the popular media as the studied conclusions of thousands of scientists.”
https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/22/1/article/i1052-5173-22-1-44.htm
So where should we look to find that mere “handful of contrarians” from only a “handful of countries” that reject climate alarmism?
Let’s start with the more than 4,000 scientists, including 70 Nobel Laureates, who have signed the 1992 Heidelberg Appeal.
 

The petition site says:
“We are, however, worried at the dawn of the twenty-first century, at the emergence of an irrational ideology which is opposed to scientific and industrial progress and impedes economic and social development.
We contend that a Natural State, sometimes idealized by movements with a tendency to look toward the past, does not exist and has probably never existed since man’s first appearance in the biosphere, insofar as humanity had always progressed by increasingly harnessing Nature to its needs and not the reverse. We fully subscribe to the objectives of a scientific ecology for a universe whose resources must be taken stock of, monitored and preserved.”
And:
“The Heidelberg Appeal was publicly released at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. By the end of the 1992 summit, 425 scientists and other intellectual leaders had signed the appeal. Since then, word of mouth has prompted thousands more scientists to lend their support. Today, more than 4,000 signatories, from over 100 countries have signed it, including more than 70 Nobel Prize winners. In spite of this spontaneous and growing support from the world’s scientific community, the Heidelberg Appeal has received very little media attention.”
https://americanpolicy.org/2002/03/29/the-heidelberg-appeal/
In 1997 more than 100 scientists and climate/atmospheric research journal editors, signed the Leipzig Declaration.

The petition site says:
“Based on all the evidence available to us, we cannot subscribe to the politically inspired world view that envisages climate catastrophes and calls for hasty actions. For this reason, we consider the drastic emission control policies likely to be endorsed by the Kyoto conference – lacking credible support from the underlying science – to be ill-advised and premature.”
http://www.sweetliberty.org/issues/weather/leipzig.html
In 1998 (and onwards) more than 31,000 scientists, including geophysicists, climatologists, meteorologists, oceanographers and environmental scientists, signed the Oregon Petition. Included were over 9,000 with PhD’s.

The petition site says:
“We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind.
There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.”
http://www.petitionproject.org/
In 2007 more than 400 prominent scientists disputed man-made global warming claims and this resulted in a US Senate Report:

The report stated (in part):
“Even some in the establishment media now appear to be taking notice of the growing number of skeptical scientists. In October, the Washington Post Staff Writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, writing that climate skeptics “appear to be expanding rather than shrinking.”
And:
“Many of the scientists featured in this report consistently stated that numerous colleagues shared their views, but they will not speak out publicly for fear of retribution. Atmospheric scientist Dr. Nathan Paldor, Professor of Dynamical Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, author of almost 70 peer-reviewed studies, explains how many of his fellow scientists have been intimidated.”
https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=f80a6386-802a-23ad-40c8-3c63dc2d02cbandIssue_id
In 2007 a group of German scientists declared themselves climate change skeptics and issued a proclamation titled “The Climate Manifest of Heiligenroth.” 

Their 6 basic points were:
1) There is no proven influence on climate by man-made emissions of CO2;
2) Scenarios on future climate change derived from computer models are speculative and contradicted by climate history;
3) There has been climate change in all times of Earth history with alternating cold and warm phases;
4) The trace gas CO2 dos not pollute the atmosphere. CO2 is an essential resource for plant growth and therefore a pre-condition for life on Earth;
5) We are committing ourselves to an effective preservation of our environment and support arrangements to prevent unnecessary stress on ecosystems;
6) We strongly warn against taking action using imminent climate catastrophe as a vehicle which will not be beneficial for our environment and will cause economic damage.
A list of the 342 signatories can be found at:
https://www.klimamanifest-von-heiligenroth.de/liste.pdf
In 2008 over 1,500 scientists, including 200 with expertise and qualifications in climate science signed the Manhattan Declaration established by the International Climate Science Coalition.

This states (in part):
“Affirming that attempts by governments to legislate costly regulations on industry and individual citizens to encourage CO2 emission reduction will slow development while having no appreciable impact on the future trajectory of global climate change.  Such policies will markedly diminish future prosperity and so reduce the ability of societies to adapt to inevitable climate change, thereby increasing, not decreasing human suffering.
That current plans to restrict anthropogenic CO2 emissions are a dangerous misallocation of intellectual capital and resources that should be dedicated to solving humanity’s real and serious problems.
That there is no convincing evidence that CO2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past, is now, or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change.”
http://www.climatescienceinternational.org/index.php?option=com_contentandtask=viewandid=37andItemid=54
Another document that records comments from a large body of scientists rejecting the mantra of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming can be found here:
“More Than 1,000 International Scientists Dissent Over Man-Made Global Warming.”

This states (in part):
“More than 1,000 dissenting scientists (updates previous 700 scientist report) from around the globe have now challenged man-made global warming claims made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former Vice President Al Gore.
This new 2010 321-page Climate Depot Special Report — updated from the 2007 ground breaking U.S. Senate Report of over 400 scientists who voiced skepticism about the so-called global warming “consensus” — features the skeptical voices of over 1,000 international scientists, including many current and former UN IPCC scientists, who have now turned against the UN IPCC.”
http://www.cfact.org/pdf/2010_Senate_Minority_Report.pdf
In 2009 an open letter was sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the signatures of more than 140 scientists.

This stated:
“There is no sound reason to impose expensive and restrictive public policy decisions on the peoples of the Earth without first providing convincing evidence that human activities are causing dangerous climate change beyond that resulting from natural causes. Before any precipitate action is taken, we must have solid observational data demonstrating that recent changes in climate differ substantially from changes observed in the past and are well in excess of normal variations caused by solar cycles, ocean currents, changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters and other natural phenomena.”

Claims are often made by climate alarmists that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agrees that the Earth is experiencing dangerous global warming. In fact such climate alarmism has been promoted by NASA’s activist scientists Dr. James Hansen (now retired) and the current Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) Dr. Gavin Schmidt.
In response to unfounded climate alarmism from GISS, the following petition from NASA scientists, engineers and astronauts was sent to the NASA Administration in 2012:

March 28, 2012
The Honorable Charles Bolden, Jr. NASA Administrator NASA Headquarters Washington, D.C. 20546-0001
We, the undersigned, respectfully request that NASA and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) refrain from including unproven remarks in public releases and websites. We believe the claims by NASA and GISS, that man-made carbon dioxide is having a catastrophic impact on global climate change are not substantiated, especially when considering thousands of years of empirical data. With hundreds of well-known climate scientists and tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief in the catastrophic forecasts, coming particularly from the GISS leadership, it is clear that the science is NOT settled.
The unbridled advocacy of CO2 being the major cause of climate change is unbecoming of NASA’s history of making an objective assessment of all available scientific data prior to making decisions or public statements.
As former NASA employees, we feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate. We request that NASA refrain from including unproven and unsupported remarks in its future releases and websites on this subject. At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees, and even the reputation of science itself.
For additional information regarding the science behind our concern, we recommend that you contact Harrison Schmitt or Walter Cunningham, or others they can recommend to you.
Thank you for considering this request. Sincerely, (Attached signatures)
CC: Mr. John Grunsfeld, Associate Administrator for Science CC: Ass Mr. Chris Scolese, Director, Goddard Space Flight Center

In 2017 Dr. Richard Lindzen sent a petition to President Donald Trump with more than 300 signatures from eminent scientists and other qualified individuals from around the world.
Bing.com: Dr. Richard Lindzen
The petition stated:
“We petition the American and other governments to change course on an outdated international agreement that targets minor greenhouse gases, primarily Carbon Dioxide, CO2 for harsh regulation. Since 2009, the US and other governments have undertaken actions with respect to global climate that are not scientifically justified and that already have, and will continue to cause serious social and economic harm-with no environmental benefits.”
And:
“Restricting access to fossil fuels has very negative effects upon the wellbeing of people around the world. It condemns over 4 billion people in still underdeveloped countries to continued poverty.”

In 2019 a group of Italian scientists sent a petition to the President of the Italian Republic, the President of the Italian Senate, the President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the President of the Italian Government.
The petition stated:
1. We must be aware that carbon dioxide (CO2) is not a pollutant. On the contrary, like water, it is an indispensible element for the life on our planet.
2. The claim that the observed warming has been induced by anthropogenic activity is an unproven conjecture that has been deduced only from some climate models.
3. The anthropogenic responsibility for the climate change observed during the last century is exaggerated.
4. Climate simulation models do not reproduce the observed natural variability of the climate at multiple time scales.
5. The scientific method requires that the facts, and not the number of adherents, make a conjecture a theory.

A recent international petition, with signatures from more than 300 scientists from more than 15 countries challenges the claim from climate alarmists that only scientists from a handful of countries are skeptical of climate alarmism.
This international petition states:
1. Climate change is a fact. The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with naturally-driven cold and warm cycles.
2. After leaving the Little Ice Age (around 1870 AD), it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a warming-up period. This is fully in line with the natural behavior of the climate system. However, measurements show that the temperature-increase is significantly less than mainstream models predict. 
 
3. Anthropogenic Global Warming is only a hypothesis. There exists no proof that anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the principal cause of global warming. On the contrary, latest insights confirm that more CO2 has only a modest influence on climate. In addition, more CO2 is hugely beneficial for agriculture, forestry, and for the photosynthesis that is the basis of life on Earth. 
4. Moreover, there is no scientific evidence that increasing CO2 levels have an enhancing effect on natural disasters. Quite the reverse, there are many indications that most CO2-reduction measures have a devastating effect on wildlife, land use and economic development. 
 
5. Energy policy must be based on scientific and economic realities.  We argue strongly against a harmful and unrealistic “2050-carbon-neutral policy”. There is no climate emergency and therefore no cause for panic and alarm. If superior approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and transition. Our aim should always be reliable and affordable energy at all times.

Claims are also made by climate alarmists that there are only a handful of peer-reviewed, published papers that argue against the notion of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming.
Such claims are also false.

http://www.populartechnology.net/2009/10/peer-reviewed-papers-supporting.html
Claims are often made by climate alarmists and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that the trivial amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (400 ppm) is the dominant driver of climate change. The role of the sun was all but ignored by the IPCC despite there being more than 100 peer-reviewed, published papers that point to the role of solar activity and its impact on global climate.
These can be found at:
https://notrickszone.com/100-papers-sun-drives-climate/
The next time anyone tells you that only a handful of scientists from a handful of countries reject global warming alarmism or that there are only a handful of peer-reviewed, published papers that reject the mantra of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming, they are either misinformed or spinning a deliberate lie.

This essay is by Guus Berkhout, President of CLINTEL. It is based on the text and the explanation of The World Climate Declaration (see: https://saltbushclub.com/2019/11/21/no-climate-emergency/).
A global network of more than 800 prominent scientists and experienced professionals has signed the World Climate Declaration. The statements of the Declaration contain a clear message: ‘There is NO Climate Emergency’. The Declaration also states that CO 2 is NOT a pollutant but a blessing for our planet and that current computer models of climate – on which international policy is founded – are unfit for their purpose. Therefore, it is unwise to advocate spending trillions of dollars on the basis of speculative results from such immature models. Current climate policies not only dangerously undermine the global economic system, but they also put lives at risk in countries where large-scale access to reliable and affordable electricity is made unfeasible. In part I of this essay the Declaration is shown. In part II the Science behind the Declaration is explained. The essay ends with a message to the young generation.

23 December 2019
Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist who first claimed that the burning of hydro-carbons like coal, oil, gas, peat and wood may cause global warming.
In 1895 he calculated (incorrectly) that a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration would lead to a 4-5o C rise in global temperature.
However, Arrhenius suggested that this increase could be beneficial, making the various climates on Earth “more equable” and stimulating plant growth and food production.
Then a showman/politician, Al Gore, gave life to the theory that extra carbon dioxide due to human activities will cause dangerous global warming.
But temperatures refused to obey the alarmist computer model forecasts. So they switched to the universal bogey-man – climate-change, where every bit of bad weather was blamed on western industry. But this did not scare enough people so it morphed into climate emergency, which allows coal, oil, gas, cars and cattle to be blamed for everything bad – floods and droughts, snowstorms and heatwaves, bushfires, coral bleaching, species extinction and pollution anywhere.
But the carbon dioxide scare is proving false – it’s time for some climate sense.
Human activity can never control atmospheric CO2 or global temperature. Much bigger forces are at work – solar system cycles, earth orbital changes, volcanic activity (especially on the sea floor), El Nino episodes, declining magnetic field and magnetic pole reversals, variable cosmic rays and cloud cover, and absorption/expulsion of CO2 by the mighty oceans.
Geological records show that today’s CO2 levels are very low – so low that plants grow slower and need more water.
Moreover, the ice core records from Antarctica and Greenland show clearly that atmospheric temperature always rises before CO2 levels rise. So rising CO2 is the effect of rising temperature not the cause. Warming oceans are like warming beer – they both expel bubbles of CO2 into the atmosphere. When oceans cool, they take it back.
The dense plant and animal populations in equatorial regions shows that humans need not fear global warming – in fact the Russian President has welcomed the possibility of warming for his cold land.
We live in a natural warm interlude but we are past the warming peak. There will still be fluctuations and extreme weather events but the next big move will be global cooling – the 11th freeze-up in about a million years. All it needs are oceans heated by submarine volcanoes, and skies made cold by volcanic ash that blocks incoming solar energy. This will trigger evaporation of water from the oceans and heavy snowfalls on land. Once the summer sun fails to melt all the winter snow, glaciers and ice sheets will advance again. The increased albedo from the snow and ice will cause further cooling.
Ice ages have been a periodic threat to much of life on Earth. As the ice sheets spread from the North Pole there will be massive depopulation and survivors will need to relearn hunter-gatherer skills or have access to reliable energy. Wind turbines and solar panels will not work in snowy conditions and many hydro-energy supplies will also freeze up. Even the Great Niagara Falls froze in 1848 during the Little Ice Age.
But the UN climate bureaucracy will probably still collect climate taxes and organise well-fed conferences in places with a warm climate and reliable power.
Alarmism over climate is the great gravy train for academics, bureaucrats, speculators, globalists and politicians seeking excuses for more power and more taxes.
“Climate emergency” is an exercise in global politics, not science. The plan is to scare us into transferring money and power from western nations to the UN – a fake answer to an invented problem.

By Viv Forbes
16 December 2019
Thanks to Boris Johnson, Brexit will now occur. And thanks to Donald Trump, the US will exit the destructive Paris Climate agreement. And the UN alarmists made little progress at the big climate-fest in Madrid.
It’s now time for Clexit (Climate Exit) – the great climate escape from all UN/IPCC alarmism and entanglements. Australia should join this rush for the exits.

Australia is a huge island continent whose prosperity was built on mining, farming, grazing, transport, hydro-carbons and cheap reliable electricity. Australians have much to lose from the UN/Paris shackles, carbon taxes and globalist agenda.
The war on coal, oil, gas, diesel, cattle, exploration and mining has harmed Australia’s backbone industries resulting in reduced prosperity, lower tax collections and more Aussies on welfare. The Kyoto forest lockups have sterilised useful private land and the promotion of unreliable wind/solar energy is destroying industry, jobs and electricity reliability.
Sensible Australians will suddenly revolt and, like Jeremy Corbyn, the Turnbull/ALP/Green/ABC climate alarm choir will find they are singing the wrong tune.
Like Brexit, Clexit is now inevitable. The burden of climate alarm costs and energy disruption ensure that western democracies will dump it. The sooner it is scrapped, the lower the cost.
CLEXIT NOW.

Media Release/Opinion Piece
7 December 2019
This week Clintel attended the Heartland COP 25 conference at the Marriott Hotel in Madrid. The hotel was full of champagne-drinking COP delegates who were clearly enjoying themselves (‘climate business model in action’). To be sure they were not disturbed by demonstrators, Clintel had a recording room somewhere at the back and we heard about its coordinates on the same morning.
Guus Berkhout was the first speaker at the event that was live-streamed from the Marriot Hotel. It was not an official COP25 event but a Heartland side-event with the aim to sound a different message to the world.
Heartland had arranged several excellent speakers, such as Will Happer (who for the past year worked as an adviser in the White House), Lord Monckton, Anthony Watts, Douglas Pollock (our Chilean Clintel ambassador), Tom Harris, Stanley Goldenberg and a fascinating young German girl, Naomi Seibt, who gave an impressive speech about contentious issues such as climate change and the immigration crisis.
The whole event was available online at https://climaterealityforum.com/ and a record 76,000 watched.
A few conclusions:
1) The world should move from mitigation panic to intelligent adaptation (Guus Berkhout)
2) The economy of Chile is ruined by climate policy (Douglas Pollock)
3) The energy prices in Germany are vastly increasing (Wolfgang Müller)
4) New scientific insight shows that future climate sensitivity for CO2 is not more than 1.5 degrees, probably significantly smaller than 1.5 due to saturation effects (William Happer)
5) Climate models are immature and unfit for making policy (Christopher Monckton)
5) There is no evidence that global warming causes more natural disasters (Stanley Goldenberg)
6) Homogenisation of measurements lower the temperatures in the past (Anthony Watts)
7) The killing of birds and bats by wind turbines is much higher than reported (Tom Harris)
8) School children are massively brainwashed (Naomi Seibt)
Here is the Monckton address:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZhcnRe3qd8
The World Climate Declaration was also prominently featured this week in one of Swedish largest newspapers, the Göteborg Posten (we hope to arrange a translation). Also the largest Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf sent a correspondent to our session in Madrid which resulted in a big largely positive article (we will make a translation).
We are full of energy to continue reaching out to the public with our message “there is no climate emergency”.

https://clexit.net/2019/12/20/madrid-climate-conference/,clexit-admin,"Pelosi, Casten, and Dems:  Wasting Taxpayer Money at the Madrid Climate Conference","
Originally published in  Energy Central.
By Steve Goreham
Fourteen Democrat members of Congress have arrived at the United Nations Climate Conference in Madrid. Speaker Nancy Pelosi leads the US delegation, which includes Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Representative Sean Casten of Illinois. However, there is little evidence that the conference will have any effect on the climate, but Ms. Pelosi’s delegation will spend a lot of taxpayer money.
Speaker Pelosi describes the delegation and the conference as an effort to “combat the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis.” More than 25,000 attendees and 1,500 members of the media have joined the conference.
After flying halfway around the world on private or commercial jets, Ms. Pelosi and her team will be discussing with world leaders how best to put restrictions on citizens of the US and other nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Reduced air travel, forced adoption of electric cars, and elimination of natural gas for heating and cooking are all likely to be topics in an effort to “save the planet.”
The official conference name is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP25. COP25 means that this is the 25th “Conference of the Parties.” These meetings have been held every year for the last quarter century.
If we all live long enough, we may see the 50th Conference of the Parties. But there is no evidence that these meetings and the thousands of climate laws enacted around the world over the last 30 years can measurably change global temperatures.
The Pelosi delegation trip is expensive, probably costing millions of dollars in travel, lodging, food, and security. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The 2015 Paris Climate Accords called for the United States to transfer billions of taxpayer dollars each year to “developing” nations, including China and India, payments which the Democrat delegation favors. The Trump Administration ended these payments with US  withdrawal from the Paris Accords.
All leading Democrat candidates for president propose massive expenditures to “solve the climate crisis.” Senator Bernie Sanders touts the most extravagant spend,  proposing a total of $16 trillion over 10 years, or more than $50,000 for each man, woman, and child in the US.
Representive Sean Casten of Illinois calls for “massive, coordinated, international action” to “stabilize” the climate. But Earth’s climate has been changing for all of history, including ice ages, warm periods, and cold periods. There is no evidence that driving electric cars, building wind turbines, or changing light bulbs can “stabilize” the climate.
The Madrid delegation should return to the US and get to work on real economic, jobs, trade, and health care issues that affect Americans.

By Dr. John Happs
Climate alarmists often make the claim that (imaginary) global warming is already resulting in more extreme weather events. They cite escalating insurance claims following fire or flood as evidence. The link between extreme weather and an increasing number of insurance claims can easily be examined to determine if, in this particular case, correlation actually does mean causation.
From England, Nick Oldridge writes in his article “Insurance and Climate Change”
“With climate change set to be one of the greatest risks of them all, insurers stand to be impacted in significant and far-reaching ways. The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority has identified three key areas of risk for the insurance industry, many of which are already happening.”
And:
“The first of these is known as physical impact risk, which relates to the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events across the globe. The specific types of weather events include hurricanes, extreme precipitation, tornadoes, landslides, mudflows, drought, wildfires, heat waves, flash floods and rising sea levels.”
 https://theecologist.org/2019/jan/11/insurance-and-climate-change

From Canada, Weatherfarm reported that weather-related  insurance  claims hit  a record  high in 2013 with:
“The Insurance Bureau of Canada reporting a record total of $3.2 billion in severe weather-related insured losses in 2013 – after four years in a row in which natural disaster-related losses topped $1 billion.”
The Weatherfarm report added:
“Intact Financial Corp., Canada’s biggest property and casualty insurance provider, was quoted by Reuters in November as saying it expected to boost homeowner insurance premiums by 15 to 20 per cent in most provinces to handle higher claims.”
 https://weatherfarm.com/2014/01/weather-related-insurance-claims-hit-record-high/
Reporting from New Zealand in 2017 Julie Iles quoted Insurance Council Chief Executive Tim Grafton as saying:
“The $242m in insurance losses were a clear sign of the impact climate change is having on our country”.
And:
“As time goes on, we expect to see more of these sorts of extreme weather events occurring.”
 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/99578862/climate-change-blamed-for-record-year-of-weatherrelated-insurance-claims
Writing for The Guardian, Damian Carrington said that the ClimateWise coalition of 29 insurers, including Allianz, Aon, Aviva, Lloyd’s, Prudential, Swiss Re and Zurich, produced a report saying:
“Since the 1950s, the frequency of weather-related catastrophes has increased sixfold.”
We were told that:
“The economic impact of these natural catastrophes is growing quickly, according to Swiss Re, with total losses increasing fivefold since the 1980s to about $170bn today.”
 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/07/climate-change-threatens-ability-insurers-manage-risk
In 2019 Julien Vincent, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, claimed to have identified the source of those extreme weather problems:
“AXA, Allianz, Aviva, Lloyds, Munich Re, SCOR and Swiss Re are among those to have divested from coal companies from their investment portfolios, and/or restricted underwriting to the coal industry.”
And:
“These actions are undertaken on the basis that it is incongruent for insurance companies whose business models are at exposed to the physical climate change impacts to be invested in or actively supporting the source of the problem.”
 https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/none-of-our-insurers-are-keeping-pace-with-climate-change-20180213-p4z073.html
In what would be news to most scientists, German re-insurer Munich Re claims to have evidence that human-induced climate change is leading to more weather catastrophes. The company asserts that natural disasters over the last few decades show the “footprint” of anthropogenic climate change in North America.
What is surprising is that any insurance company can claim to know more about the causes of extreme weather than the community of climate scientists. Dr. Roger Peilke Jr. has criticised companies such as Munich Re for making public their alarmist statements on extreme weather. Peilke retorted:
“If Munich Re believes it has found the footprint of human-caused climate change in disaster data, then they should prepare a scientific paper and send it to Science or Nature, where it would be a major finding.”
And:
“Releasing such claims via promotional press release suggests otherwise.”
 https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/scientists-denounce-dubious-climate-study-by-insurer-munich-re-a-862857.html
It is no surprise that green activists, media commentators, politicians and other vested interest groups have promoted the baseless idea that human-produced carbon dioxide has increased the number and intensity of extreme weather events.
For instance, European Commissioner for Climate Action Connie Hedegaard said:
“More intense weather extremes have become a “new reality” and climate change is the “new normal.”
 https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/scientists-denounce-dubious-climate-study-by-insurer-munich-re-a-862857.html
But what does the evidence really tell us?
Media outlets are likely to report on loss projections whilst ignoring what Bouwer et al. reported:
“Societal change and economic development are mainly responsible for increasing losses.”
 https://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2573-2007.27.pdf
And what do those scientists who have no vested interest in promoting climate alarm say? Dr. Michael Kelly from Cambridge University reflects:
“It is widely promulgated and believed that human-caused global warming comes with increases in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. A survey of official weather sites and the scientific literature provides strong evidence that the first half of the 20thcentury had more extreme weather than the second half, when anthropogenic global warming is claimed to have been mainly responsible for observed climate change.”
 https://www.longdom.org/open-access/trends-in-extreme-weather-events-since-1900–an-enduring-conundrum-for-wise-policy-advice-2167-0587-1000155.pdf
There are numerous peer-reviewed, published papers that attest to the fact that we are currently experiencing a period of remarkable climate stability and many of those papers can be located at:

Of more interest are the statements about extreme weather from the (usually alarmist) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In its 2018 report, much like its 2013 report, the IPCC reported that there is no evidence to show that drought, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes have increased, despite rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
The IPCC’s Working Group II AR5 said:
“Apart from detection, loss trends have not been conclusively attributed to anthropogenic climate change; most such claims are not based on scientific attribution methods.” (AR5 10.7.3)
On tropical cyclones, the IPCC reported:
“There is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration), after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities.” [3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5]
And:
“Over periods of a century or more, evidence suggests slight decreases in the frequency of tropical cyclones making landfall in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific.”
Callaghan and Power (2011) find a statistically significant decrease in Eastern Australia land-falling tropical cyclonessince the late 19th century
 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248146391_Variability_and_decline_in_the_number_of_severe_tropical_cyclones_making_landfall_over_eastern_Australia_since_the_late_nineteenth_century
On tornadoes and hail, the IPCC reports:
“There is low confidence in observed trends in small spatial-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail because of data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in monitoring systems.” [3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5]
On droughts, the IPCC reported:
“There is medium confidence that some regions of the world have experienced more intense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions droughts have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example, in central North America and northwestern Australia.” [3.5.1]
On floods, the IPCC reports:
“There is limited to medium evidence available to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and frequency of floods at regional scales because the available instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited in space and time, and because of confounding effects of changes in land use and engineering. Furthermore, there is low agreement in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of these changes.” [3.5.2]
Taking a rational look at specific instances of so-called climate related disasters reveals quite a different story to those promoted by climate alarmists.
Contrary to recent alarmist claims, flooding in Venice has long been a regular occurrence since the Adriatic tectonic plate is being subducted beneath the Apennine Mountains. Adding to the already natural subsidence of Venice, urgent engineering of the city foundations and flood prevention measures are long overdue. Flooding will continue to be a problem in Venice because of procrastination and neglect.
http://www.livescience.com/19195-venice-sinking-slowly.html
The 2014 flooding in Somerset, England is known to have been exacerbated by “green legislation” that prevented the dredging of waterways, allowing vegetation and silt to accumulate. The Spectator noted:
“The unprecedented scale of this mess is not just due to nature. It is a disaster that has resulted from a deliberate policy followed by the Environment Agency since, 18 years ago, it was given overall responsibility for river management and flood defences throughout England.”
 http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/02/memo-to-the-environment-agency-humans-have-needs-too/
The recent flooding in Yorkshire, England also resulted from the Environment Agency ignoring repeated warnings, issued since 2007, that a similar lack of maintenance along the River Don would lead to serious flooding.
 https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/flood-warnings-about-river-don-were-ignored-for-years-lp5d8spkd
Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. reflected on the hurricane – economic loss link:
“Anyone wanting to understand trends in US mainland hurricanes should look at data on US mainland hurricanes, not economic data on losses.”
 https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2019/11/15/no-hurricanes-are-not-bigger-stronger-and-more-dangerous/#480337f64d9e
Factual information shows that the planet is not experiencing any increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes or tornadoes. Yet the evidence from insurance companies also appears to be clear that severe weather-related insurance claims are increasing.
We can now see that both claims are valid but not for the reasons some insurance companies, politicians, climate alarmists and other vested interest groups would have us believe.
The 2014 IPCC report: Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (Working Group II Fifth Assessment Report) highlighted the real cause of increasing losses:
“Economic growth, including greater concentrations of people and wealth in periled areas and rising insurance penetration, is the most important driver of increasing losses…  loss trends have not been conclusively attributed to anthropogenic climate change.”
In fact more people are living in areas that are exposed to natural disasters. People choose to build near old lava flows, produced by still-active volcanoes:

People choose to build close to earthquake fault lines:

People choose to build on flood plains:

Because of increasing global prosperity, people now have more assets to lose. There is no evidence to show that anthropogenic global warming aka climate change has had any impact on losses from natural disasters.
Research into normalised insurance losses from Australian natural disasters (1966-2017) showed:
“When aggregated by season, there is no trend in normalised losses from weather-related perils; in other words, after we normalise for changes we know to have taken place, no residual signal remains to be explained by changes in the occurrence of extreme weather events, regardless of cause.”
And:
“In sum, the rising cost of natural disasters is being driven by where and how we chose to live and with more people living in vulnerable locations with more to lose, natural disasters remain an important problem irrespective of a warming climate.”
 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332641296_Normalised_insurance_losses_from_Australian_natural_disasters_1966-2017
IPCC contributing scientist Dr. Indur Goklany puts extreme weather events and deaths in perspective:
“Not only do “extreme weather events” account for a tiny fraction of deaths — five one-hundredths of one percent — but the rate at which angry weather kills people has been falling steadily and continues to do so from the last decade to this.”
The International Disaster Database shows this:
OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database: www.emdat.be
In 2018 Dr. Bjorn Lomborg summed up:
“Notice that the reduction in absolute deaths has happened while the global population has increased four-fold. The individual risk of dying from climate-related disasters has declined by 98.9%. Last year, fewer people died in climate disasters than at any point in the last three decades.”
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/03/14/inconvenient-data-fewer-and-fewer-people-die-from-climate-related-natural-disasters/
The emotive claim that an (imaginary) increase in extreme weather is responsible for more deaths and property loss does not stand up to even the most cursory examination.

By Viv Forbes
Leaders of the Clintel Group of world scientists and professionals will attend the UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) which starts in Madrid today (2 December) and runs for twelve long days. (The Climate Summit was shifted suddenly to Spain after Chile cancelled because of violent riots in Santiago.)
Clintel will present their “No Climate Emergency” petition at the Climate Reality Forum. This petition has already been presented to the UN Secretary General, the European Commission and the European Parliament.
Voting on a motion promoting a climate emergency declaration (in opposition to the Clintel statement), over one third of the members of the EU Parliament voted for “No Climate Emergency”. This shows there is a significant opposition to alarmism, even in the EU.
The Climate Summit is expected to attract up to 25,000 high-flying delegates and hangers-on from 197 member countries. Most will not arrive using bicycles, sailing boats or gliders – they will burn hydrocarbons. Desperate to spread their “Climate Emergency” alarmism, delegates will try to force high energy costs and rationing on us while they waste it conspicuously themselves.
Clintel says that computerised global temperature simulation models are unfit for the purpose of setting climate policies – they have consistently run hot for 20 years.
The real global climate has warm and cold cycles. Current global temperatures are about as warm as the Medieval Warm era (which was followed by the Little Ice Age).
There is no uniform global temperature at any place or any time, and no one knows what ideal temperature we should aim for – the Frigid Zone would probably like it warmer, the Torrid Zone would probably like it cooler.
We need to take heed of climate history and energy realities, both neglected in alarmist/UN propaganda. Too many UN “scientific” reports are tinkered with by officials before release, and are designed to alarm rather than inform.
For too long we have been forced to listen to biased academics (chasing research funds), energy speculators (chasing government subsidies and tax breaks), alarmist journalists (chasing sensations), noisy children (chasing days off school) and greenish politicians (chasing votes).
It’s time to stop the chasing.

https://clexit.net/2019/11/06/another-blatant-lie/,clexit-admin,Another Blatant Lie: In Fact All Science Academies do not Support Global Warming Alarmism,"
Dr. John Happs
We often read statements such as:“All science academies support the notion of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming.”
In fact position statements about climate change from science academies and associations are usually made without debate or consultation with the wider membership. Of the international science bodies that have issued statements warning of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming, to my knowledge, not one has provided evidence showing that the majority of their members subscribe to those statements.
Alarmist statements about climate change appear to represent the opinions of a mere handful of members. Academy officials are well aware of where their funding originates and the rank and file members could be blissfully unaware of alarmist, unsubstantiated statements released by their governing board until it is too late.
Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (RSC) and a leading Canadian energy expert, the late Dr. Archie Robertson explained:
“The president of the Royal Society of London … drafted a resolution in favour and circulated it to other academies of science inviting co-signing. … The president of the RSC, not a member of the [RSC’s] Academy of Science, received the invitation. He considered it consistent with the position of the great majority of scientists, as repeatedly but erroneously claimed by Kyoto proponents, and so signed it. The resolution was not referred to the Academy of Science for comment, not even to its council or president.”
 https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/sciences-untold-scandal-the-lockstep-march-of-professional-societies-to-promote-the-climate-change-scare/
A survey of statements from other science bodies shows that the apparent support for the IPCC’s climate alarmism is usually the opinion of the executive or a committee specifically appointed by the executive. The full membership is rarely, if ever, surveyed in an even-handed way, for its opinion.
So what happens when it is revealed to the membership that their organisation has issued an alarmist statement as if it represented the views of all members?
Members of the London Geological Society expressed their views in no uncertain terms in letters to the Editor of their journal.
For instance, LGS member Clive Randle (FGS) said:
“I am not a denier that Climate Change has existed throughout the Earth’s history and is apparently taking place but I do question the sole focus on Anthropogenic Global Warming as being the cause.
And:
A concerned portion of the membership and past members wrote to the President on 1stJune 2018 requesting a review of the Society’s Position Statements on Climate Change. So far, there has been no response. Yet the Society, through one of its publications, gives voice to some unscientific ramblings.”
Another LGS member, Howard Dewhirst (FGS) said:
“Dear Editor, I support the  proposal by Dr D’Olier that the society should explore members’ views on climate change, but not through a petition with a particular agenda. Several dozen concerned scientists (the majority Fellows or ex-Fellows of this Society) wrote an  open letter to the President on 1st June 2018 requesting a review of the Society’s Position Statements on Climate Change. We still await a reply to that joint letter. Clearly, there is not a consensus amongst Fellows on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), so a survey of members’ views would seem more appropriate than a petition.”
Joe Brannan (FGS) added:
“Martin also regurgitates the claim that the fossil fuel industries conspired to thwart action on global warming by a campaign of disinformation. He should better justify or withdraw this claim, which resonates with media coverage by outlets such as the BBC, the Guardian or the Daily Mail-channels that have fed us a non-stop diet of alarmism for most of this century.”
Chris Matchette-Downes (FGS) said:
“A concerned portion of the membership and past members wrote to the President on 1stJune 2018 requesting a review of the Society’s Position Statements on Climate Change, because there is not a consensus for the position taken by Dr D’Olier foisted on the membership. There has been no response.
The debate is far from over. It is a debate that is needed and one the Geological Society should not shy away from, else it runs the real risk of not adhering to expected scientific rigour.
It is clear from the several ice-core records that are now available that CO2follows temperature change not the other way around.
There are several inconvenient truths and several unanswered questions that the Society should be grappling with.”

Britain’s Royal Society shifted its position on climate change in 2010 away from total support of the IPCC toward expressing much more uncertainty.
In fact a review of the Royal Society’s initial position was forced on the society by 43 of its Fellows who demanded that its publication Climate Change Controversies, produced in 2007 and published on its website, should be rewritten to consider more rational views.
In a statement about global warming, the Royal Society now says:
“There remains the possibility that hitherto unknown aspects of the climate and climate change could emerge and lead to significant modifications in our understanding.”

Sir Alan Rudge, a society Fellow of the Royal Society and former member of the Government’s Scientific Advisory Committee, said that the society had previously adopted an:
“unnecessarily alarmist position on climate change.”

The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) was formed in 1980 from the merger of the Chemical Society, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Faraday Society and the Society for Analytical Chemistry.
Society Fellow, Dr. Leslie Woodcock told the Yorkshire Evening Post:
“If you talk to real scientists who have no political interests, they will tell you there is nothing in global warming. It’s an industry which creates vast amounts of money for some people.”
 https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/environment/global-warming-is-rubbish-says-top-professor-1-6536732
The US National Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of Ralph Cicerone, appeared to have taken on the role of an alarmist climate advocacy group intent on promoting the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming meme. Unfortunately, the NAS has long been regarded as an advocacy group.
In 2010, through its executive, it urged the government to take drastic action by raising the cost of coal and oil to slow (imaginary) global warming. Clearly, not knowing what the science actually says, Robert Fri said:
“We really need to get started right away. It’s not opinion, it’s what the science tells you.”
In a 2012 interview with John Humphrys (BBC Radio 4 Today program) the NAS president Dr. Ralph Cicerone appeared to soften his alarmist stance. He was asked:
“You’re not saying – if we don’t do these things, we’re going to go to hell in a handbasket, we’re going to fry, in a few years.”
He cautiously backtracked: “No. I don’t think it’s useful, I don’t think it gets us anywhere, and we don’t have that kind of evidence.”

In 2009, the American Physical Society (APS) Council decided to review its current climate statement when more than 250 of its membership urged a change to the APS climate statement.
Manyphysicists wrote to the APS governing board, pointing out:
“Measured or reconstructed temperature records indicate that 20th – 21st century changes are neither exceptional nor persistent, and the historical and geological records show many periods warmer than today.” 
Dr. Roger Cohen, a respected fellow of the APS, said:
“The APS response to the petition was the appointment of a committee that took months to review the 157 word Statement. Only one of the members was familiar with the climate science field, and more than one had a vested interest in continued climate alarm. The committee’s final report referred only to IPCC reports and its supporting material, and so we had the predictable outcome: not a single change to the original Statement. Thus, as is the practice of bureaucracies, a position once taken is rigidly adhered to, even when the process that produced it was flawed.”
Dr. Lance Wallace agreed:
“This is truly upsetting to me, as a physicist. I had seen the revolt against the original policy statement (“the science is incontrovertible”) and expected that surely the voices of reason would prevail, particularly since physicists are (I thought) less dependent on CAGW funding than atmospheric chemists, oceanographers, dendrochronologists, etc. But it was not to be. Feynman, as far as I know, is the only person to resign from the National Academy of Sciences, on the grounds that the organization only exists to select (or blackball) new members. But now there is an order of magnitude more funding at stake, so we see that such organizations also exist mainly to assure future funding for their members. So the “policy statements” are created by Society bureaucrats (e.g., Leshner of AAAS), for government bureaucrats (Chu of DOE), without troublesome input from members.”
Dr. Roger Cohen again:
“Thus far more than two dozen (members) have told me that they have resigned or will resign from the APS climate activity. A few may resign from the APS though I have discouraged that.”
And:
“There is evidence that the process itself that produced the Statement was at least highly questionable if not downright illegitimate. It is known that a small group of individuals, not satisfied with the degree of alarm contained in the original draft produced by the officially charged committee, acted unilaterally and without authority to raise the level of alarm. A senior APS professional confides in writing that:
“This [the original draft] was unfortunately changed ‘on the fly, over lunch’ by several [APS] Council members who were not pleased with the ‘mild tone’ of the drafted statement. Then the modified statement was voted on at the end of the Council meeting (probably as people were leaving to catch planes) [parentheses original].”
And:
“As I reflect on my experience, I cannot avoid the question of whether we have passed the point of no return, whether the descent of once grand scientific societies into advocating bureaucracies and self-satisfied clubs lobbying for funds can be arrested, reversed, and integrity restored; or is what we have now a permanent feature of modern science – a postmodern distortion of the best values of the scientific tradition that has served humanity well for centuries.”

Dr. Judith Curry sent the following message to the APS Panel on Public Affairs (POPA):
“No one cares about your political preferences in the climate change debate.  You have demonstrated that you bring nothing intellectually to the table (once Koonin and Rosner left).   You simply have no business issuing a policy statement on climate change. You have embarrassed the APS membership.”

“Climategate was a fraud on a scale I have never seen.”
And: “… the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, and has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist.”

A statement by APS editor Jeffrey Marque explains:
“There is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the IPCC conclusion that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution.”
The American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) has made its position clear:
“Geologists study the history of the earth and realize climate has changed often in the past due to natural causes. The earth’s climate naturally varies continually, in both directions, at varying rates, and on many scales. In recent decades global temperatures have risen. However, our planet has been far warmer and cooler today than many times in the geologic past, even within the past 10,000 years.”
And:
“Certain climate simulation models predict that the warming trend will continue, as reported through National Academy of Sciences, American Geophysical Union, American Academy for the Advancement of Science, and American Meteorological Society. AAPG respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data. These data do not necessarily support the maximum-case scenarios forecast in some models.”

The American Chemical Society (ACS) considers itself to be the world’s largest scientific society. In 2009, skeptical members of the ACS openly revolted against the ACS Editor in Chief, Rudy Baum with many ACS scientists demanding he be removed after he promoted, without due consultation, the position that:
“The science of anthropogenic climate change is becoming increasingly well established.”
ACS members also rebuked Baum’s use of the word “deniers” stating that it was a derogatory term “associated with Holocaust deniers.” In addition, the scientists called Baum’s editorial: “disgusting”; “a disgrace”; “filled with misinformation”; “unworthy of a scientific periodical” and “pap.”

A survey of members, published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that 50% disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement:
“Most of the warming since 1950 is likely human induced.”
In fact only 8% strongly agreed.

Dr. José Duarte made this observation about the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS):
“The American Association for the Advancement of Science (2014) broke my heart, by releasing a wildly unscientific report that cherry-picked only the studies that gave it the inflated consensus figures it wanted — many of which are so bad as to be inadmissable. When scientists want to review a body of research, they conduct a meta-analysisthat includes all the research that meets certain criteria of rigor and validity. The AAAS strangely chose not to perform a meta-analysis — they simply ignored most studies, and cherry-picked four studies that gave them the inflated, shock-value numbers they wanted.”
And:
“Among the four was an obsolete one-page study from 2004 that doesn’t clearly describe its methods (Oreskes, 2004, yes, really, one page long). That is, they skipped past all the more recent and credible studies from the intervening decade (e.g. Harris (2007), Bray and van Storch (2008), and others) to reach all the way back to a junk study from 2004. I’ve never seen such behavior – we clearly can’t do anything with mysterious one-pagers from 2004. This isn’t what I expected.”

Dr. Rush Holt, President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has highlighted the need for science to remain open and collaborative. He sees some scientists as being so untrustworthy that no one trusts them. He adds:
“Unfortunately, science is often treated as just another interest group to be pushed aside by more powerful interests. In recent decades, opinion and ideological assertions have crowded out scientifically validated evidence on some issues. “

The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) is the UK’s professional and learned society devoted to the interests of statistics and statisticians. The Society has members in over 50 countries worldwide.
The RSS submitted a memo critical of members of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. Those scientists were withholding data and the RSS stated:
“The Society welcomes this opportunity to submit evidence to the Science and Technology committee on the disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia inquiry.”
And:
“The RSS believes that the debate on global warming is best served by having the models used and the data on which they are based in the public domain.”
And:
“The raw data, and associated meta-data, used for these analyses should, within reason, also be made available.”
They emphasised again:
“The RSS believes that a crucial step in improving the quality of the debate on global warming will be to place the data, the analysis methods and the models in the public domain.”
 http://antigreen.blogspot.com/2010/03/climate-chiefs-e-mails-and-procedures.html
In 2010 the British Institute of Physics, with a worldwide membership of over 36,000, made a statement to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee’s inquiry into the integrity of the IPCC and scientists at the CRU.
It stated:
“The Institute is concerned that, unless the disclosed e-mails are proved to be forgeries or adaptations, worrying implications arise for the integrity of scientific research in this field and for the credibility of the scientific method as practised in this context.”
In fact the emails were genuine.
And:
“The CRU e-mails as published on the internet provide prima facieevidence of determined and co-ordinated refusals to comply with honourable scientific traditions and freedom of information law.”
And:
“The e-mails reveal doubts as to the reliability of some of the (climate) reconstructions and raise questions as to the way in which they have been represented.”
And:
“There is also reason for concern at the intolerance to challenge displayed in the e-mails. This impedes the process of scientific ‘self correction’, which is vital to the integrity of the scientific process as a whole, and not just to the research itself.”

In 2015 The French Mathematical Society (Société de Calcul Mathématique) released a comprehensive 2-part document arguing against the meme of dangerous anthropogenic global warming, stating:
“Mathematicians do not believe in crusades; they look at facts, figures, observations and arguments.”
And:
“There is not a single fact, figure or observation that leads us to conclude that the world’s climate is in any way disturbed – It is variable, as it has always been, but rather less so now than during certain periods or geological eras.”
The society issued a detailed white paper on climate change with the title:
“The battle against global warming: an absurd, costly and pointless crusade”
The report included the following statement:
“Conclusions based on any kind of model should be disregarded. As the SCM specializes in building mathematical models, we should also be recognized as competent to criticize them. Models are useful when attempting to review our knowledge, but they should not be used as an aid to decision-making until they have been validated.”

In 2012 the German Academy of Sciences and Engineering rejected the notion of climate catastrophe and stated that coping with climate change would not pose any difficult challenges. In a study commissioned by the German Federal Government, Acatech President Dr. Reinhard Hüttl said:
“No climate conditions are going to occur here that already do not exist on the globe elsewhere and that we cannot cope with.”
The report went on to say that, should warming occur, there would be benefits such as longer growing seasons and reduced wintertime heating costs. Germans typically heat their homes for about 8 months per year and are facing ever-increasing energy costs due to the widespread introduction of inefficient, unreliable wind and solar energy sources.

In 2009 the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS)produced a report that pointed to the IPCC’s position on catastrophic anthropogenic global warming as becoming increasingly untenable. The Geologic Science Committee of the PAS reported:
“Experiments in natural science show that one-sided observations, those that take no account of the multiplicity of factors determining certain processes in the geo-system, lead to unwarranted simplifications and wrong conclusions when trying to explain natural phenomena.”
And:
“Politicians who rely on incomplete data may take wrong decisions. It makes room for politically correct lobbying, especially on the side of business marketing of exceptionally expensive, so called eco-friendly, energy technologies or those offering CO2 storage (sequestration) in exploited deposits. It has little to do with what is objective in nature.”
And:
“The PAN Committee of Geological Sciences believes it necessary to start an interdisciplinary research based on comprehensive monitoring and modelling of the impact of other factors – not just the level of CO2 – on the climate. Only this kind of approach will bring us closer to identifying the causes of climate change.”

In 2007 the Royal Belgian Weather Instituteconcluded that carbon dioxide could never play the decisive role that is currently attributed to it.
Climate scientist Dr. Luc Debontridder said:
“Not CO2, but water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. It is responsible for at least 75 % of the greenhouse effect. This is a simple scientific fact, but Al Gore’s movie has hyped CO2 so much that nobody seems to take note of it.”
He added:
“Every change in weather conditions is blamed on CO2. But the warm winters of the last few years (in Belgium) are simply due to the ‘North-Atlantic Oscillation’. And this has absolutely nothing to do with CO2.”
 https://www.nationalreview.com/2008/05/chill-out-climate-hysteria-deroy-murdock/
The Russian Academy of Science completely rejects the notion of anthropogenic global warming, predicting that:
“In the coming years the temperature over the entire planet will fall.”
And: “The average temperature on Earth is now returning to the level of the 1996-1997 years, 0.3°C lower.”

A Japanese Geoscience Union symposium surveyin 2008 “showed 90 per cent of the participants did not believe the IPCC report.” Dr. Akasofu, Kusano and Dr. Maruyama state that large influences on global climate over time may be global cosmic rays and solar activity.
 https://anhonestclimatedebate.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/japanese-scientists-cool-on-theories/
In 2007, Dr. Michael Griffin, from NASA said: “I have no doubt that … a trend of global warming exists. I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with.”
And:
“To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth’s climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn’t change. First of all, I don’t think it’s within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown. And second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings – where and when – are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that’s a rather arrogant position for people to take.”
An initial skeptical petition, from scientists, engineers and astronauts, was sent to the NASA administration.
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/04/10/hansen-and-schmidt-of-nasa-giss-under-fire-engineers-scientists-astronauts-ask-nasa-administration-to-look-at-emprical-evidence-rather-than-climate-models/
This petition was followed up In 2013, when a group of 20 ex-NASA retirees (calling themselves The Right Climate Stuff TRCS team) reported that the science used to support the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming meme is not settled and no convincing physical evidence exists to support catastrophic forecasts. They state:
“There is no convincing physical evidence of Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming. Most of the alarm regarding AGW results from output of unvalidated computer models.”
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/01/23/team-of-ex-nasa-scientists-concludes-no-imminent-threat-from-man-made-co2/
In 2008 A survey of more than 51,000 scientists from the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta, Canada(APEGGA) found 68% of them disagreed with the statement that: “The science is settled.”
 https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2012/07/17/that-scientific-global-warming-consensus-not/#2ec7749f3bb3
In 1991,a survey of U.S. atmospheric scientistsconfirmed that there is no consensus about the cause of the slight warming observed during the past century. They pointed to sunspot variability, rather than anthropogenic carbon dioxide, as being responsible for the global temperature fluctuations recorded since the 1800’s.

The Geological Society of Australia’s president Dr. Laurie Hutton said the society was unable to produce a definitive statement on climate since the issue: “had the potential to be too divisive and would not serve the best interests of the society as a whole.”
http://jonjayray.com/grejun14.html
The Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering objected to the alarmist statements made by its president, Australia’s former chief scientist, Dr. Robin Batterham.
Members of the AATSE objected to alarmist claims by the academy executive. Rather they wanted to make their position clear along the lines that:
“The academy does not believe the science is settled regarding climate change.”
And:
“Many scientists believed climate changes are nothing unusual, based on past geological records.”
Subsequently, in a recent lecture at the University of Western Australia, Dr. Batterham warned of the dangers of a political over-reaction to climate change.
He said there was: ”still much of the science that is uncertain.”
Academy member and Melbourne World Climate Research program director Dr. Ann Henderson-Sellers said that the academy will:
“Continue to foster open and reasoned debate on all aspects of climate change” but sees “little point in promoting debate based on belief rather than evidence.”

The Australian Academy of Science’s (AAS) alarmist position on global warming (stated in 2010) was hardly surprising since it merely parroted the findings of the discredited Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), apparently without asking its membership for their opinions.
The AAS President, Dr. Kurt Lambeck secured $55,000 from the Australian Labor Government that appeared to be for the promotion of the catastrophic global warming alarmist view. This money enabled the production and update of the February 2015 booklet:
The Science of Climate Change: Questions and Answers.
 https://www.science.org.au/files/userfiles/learning/documents/climate-change-r.pdf
It appears that many of the AAS panelists were IPCC authors and Professor Andrew Holmes said in the Foreword:
“The Academy recognises the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the mechanism for the international scientific assessment of climate change science, impacts and response strategies.”
Atmospheric scientist and former Chief Research Scientist at the CSIRO Dr. Garth Paltridge was critical of the AAS process indicating that he did not want to endorse the document in any way.
Paltridge said:
“The problem is that, after several decades of refining their story, the international gurus of climate change have become very good at having their cake and eating it too.  On the one hand they pay enough lip service to the uncertainties of global warming to justify continued funding for their research.  On the other, they peddle a belief – this with religious zeal, and with a sort of subconscious blindness to overstatement and the cherry-picking of data – that the science is settled and the world is well on its way to climatic disaster.”
He added:
“The Academy document fits neatly into the pattern.  It is a sophisticated production that tells only one side of the story.”
 http://joannenova.com.au/2015/02/australian-academy-of-science-hides-model-failures-other-rainfall-predictions-feedbacks-evidence/
The President, Dr. Andrew Holmes (his academic background is in chemistry and light-emitting polymers) penned the document foreword.
I emailed Dr. Holmes and asked him:
“Can you assure me that all members of the AAS were consulted about the conclusions reached in your report and if they considered those conclusions to be balanced?”
His reply was:
“The Academy sought to ensure that the document represented the views of the expert climate science community in Australia  and did this by using a Working Group of active climate researchers and an Oversight Committee of Academy Fellows with a high level of experience and expertise in Earth system science.”
And:
“One of the roles of the Academy Council is clearly to act for the entire Fellowship in endorsing statements prepared by subject matter experts after due consultation and consideration.”
In other words, it appears that all academy/society members were not consulted.
In October 2016 New York lawyer Francis Menton sent a letter to over 30 scientific societies pointing out that none of the societies had been able to:
“… find in any scientific study a rigorous empirical validation of a statistically significant quantitative relationship between rising greenhouse gas concentrations and tropical, contiguous U.S. or global temperatures.”
And:
“As you might realize, we are concerned that prestigious scientific societies, including your own, have subscribed to a letter to Members of Congress purporting to convey scientific propositions as having been definitively established, when in fact there has never been a mathematically rigorous empirical validation of the propositions stated, and indeed there now appears to be a definitive scientific invalidation of those propositions.”
And:
“In short, if you have mathematically rigorous empirical validation of the hypotheses that underlie your advocacy, kindly provide it. If you do not, kindly say so.”
http://www.carlineconomics.com/archives/3079
Of course it would be reassuring to know that the presidents of all those academies can readily provide evidence to show that every member received a survey about their views on climate change with questions that were not “loaded” and had been tested for both validity and reliability.

For over 15 years the global warmists have become progressively more outspoken with their scare stories, and less careful with facts and science.
But their latest tactics of promoting Extinction Hellions and exploiting a teenage Swedish Doomsayer represent alarmist over-reach.
Ordinary people are becoming suspicious: “If their science is sound, why do they resort to media scare stories, traffic disruption, street rebellions, school truants, religious zealots and academic purging?”
We are close to the peak of this global warming madness. Their models and forecasts have failed and consumers suffer soaring electricity cost and blackouts while tenured academics produce Play-School plans for 100% “Green” power.
Climate sense is finally starting to ooze through the cracks in the stone wall built to keep Skeptics out of the flimsy marquee that shelters the warming nobility.
It is downhill from here for the alarmists and bad news for their academic mercenaries, Hollywood backers, Rebellion puppets, business vested interests and alarmist propaganda machines like Australia’s ABC, UK’s BBC and Guardian, Canada’s CBC and CNN in USA.
They are losing their credibility and their thinking audiences just when they will need them for backpedalling, explanations and apologies.

We don’t need rowdy Extinction Hellions on our streets – we need Education on Extinctions in our science academies, classrooms and media.
Extinctions are natural events that close every chapter of Earth’s history – they remove species that can’t cope with competition or change. Better adapted species take their place.
The rocks are Earth’s archives, recording past climates, extinctions, ice ages, droughts, planetary impacts and volcanic activities. There is NOTHING unusual about current conditions or trends except for today’s huge human population. (Dinosaurs also were very numerous and successful, but only remnants of their line remain today.)
There are at least 17 major extinctions recorded in Earth’s archives. They are revealed by discontinuities in surface outcrops, and in drill logs and core samples taken from deep drilling, sea sediment sampling, lake strata, tree rings, stalactite rings and ice cores.
There is zero evidence in Earth’s archives of an extinction event caused by high levels of carbon dioxide or by gradual global warming. In fact we see the reverse – warm eras like the modern warming are followed closely by higher levels of carbon dioxide, which encourages plants and supports abundant life on Earth. Past extinctions were caused by meteor impacts, earth movements, geomagnetic reversals, volcanism, tidal waves and changing sea levels. Most eras are closed by life-extinguishing ice ages.
Increasing ice is the big thing we have to fear. This is always followed by declining levels of the gases of life (carbon dioxide and water vapour) in the atmosphere. This twin disaster will herald widespread starvation of all plants and animals on Earth.
The planet’s archives will then record one more Extinction Event.

Instead of cutting forests and burning dung and charcoal, shouldn’t Africa have cheap electricity?
By Duggan Flanakin
China, India, Vietnam and other nations are using more and more oil, natural gas and coal every year to electrify and modernize their nations, create jobs, and improve their people’s health, living standards and life spans. Why in this day and age are the World Bank and other international institutions demanding widespread use of charcoal for heating and cooking in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)?
During the recent 2019 “climate week,” the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change touted increased reliance on biomass – which already comprises 60% of European “renewable” energy – as a tool in fighting climate change and stabilizing Earth’s never-stable climate.
(Europe’s “renewable” energy includes England’s Drax Power Plant, which is fueled by wood from millions of trees from thousands of acres of American and Canadian forest habitats. The trees are turned into wood pellets, which are hauled by truck to coastal ports and transported to North Yorkshire on oil-fueled cargo ships. From there the pellets are taken by train to the Drax Power Plant and burned in place of coal, to generate electricity – so that the UK can “meet its renewable fuel targets,” even though the overall process generates more carbon dioxide than coal or gas plants on a total life-cycle basis, and the trees are cut and burned much faster than new ones can grow. This is hardly sustainable.)
The Dogwood Alliance objected to the IPCC report, claiming that biomass (largely charcoal) contributes to deforestation.  Dogwood’s arguments reflect the views of Norimitsu Onishi, whose 2016 New York Times article pointed out that burning charcoal not only poses human health concerns, but also constitutes a massive threat to the environment and numerous plant and animal species whose habitats are being destroyed by people using their trees to make charcoal.
The UN Environment Programme predicts that Africa’s demand for charcoal – currently 23 million tons a year – is likely to double or triple by 2050. Africa’s charcoal production doubled in the past two decades and now accounts for more than 60% of the world’s total, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Rapid urbanization increased demand for charcoal, the preferred way to cook in SSA cities.
Onishi acknowledged that charcoal is cleaner and easier to use than firewood, and cheaper and more readily available in much of Africa than gas or electricity.  As a result, 80% of SSA families use charcoal as their primary energy source.
The World Health Organization reports that worldwide over 4.3 million people a year die prematurely from illnesses attributable to household air pollution resulting from burning charcoal and other solid fuels in open fires and leaky stoves. That’s more deaths than from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.
The WHO also noted that the lack of access to electricity for at least 1.2 billion people around the world exposes families to very high levels of fine particulate matter and other toxic materials in smoke – and to many intestinal diseases from spoiled food and unsafe drinking water. Lack of electricity also results in other health risks, such as burns, injuries and poisonings.
The lack of plentiful, reliable, affordable electricity also restricts opportunities to read and study at night, enjoy access to computers and the internet, engage in small crafts and trades, develop larger businesses and industries, create jobs, build modern homes, hospitals, schools and infrastructure, and take other steps that greatly improve people’s living standards, health and nutrition.
Why, in heaven’s name, more than century after affordable electricity began to transform Western society, is over half of Africa still not connected to any electric grid? Can any American, European, Australian or Canadian imagine life without abundant, reliable, affordable, 24/7/365 electricity?
The World Bank points out that SSA’s household electrification rate averaged a mere 42% in 2016 – with Rwanda at 80% and Guinea-Bissau at an abysmal 30% – leaving hundreds of millions of Africans with no electricity or only very limited, totally unpredictable access to this vital energy source.
ZimbabweSituation.com says three factors hinder demand for electric power in much of Africa.  First, many firms and households that are already connected to the grid in SSA face regular blackouts, due to insufficient electricity and poor grid reliability. That means continued reliance on charcoal, forcing connected households and businesses to pay for two energy sources.
Next, where electricity bills take up a large share of household income, access to electricity is very low. Countries with poor grid penetration typically use high tariffs to finance infrastructure to improve their electric grids. But high tariffs translate into high energy bills that deter consumers and make it very hard for to launch and sustain businesses that create jobs and enable people to afford electricity.
Third, the cost and complexity of the connection process further hampers electrification. Where generation capacity is insufficient, utilities may delay new connections until infrastructure investments catch up with consumer demand. The Catch-22 is that these administrative barriers, red tape and connection costs drive down demand, postponing electrification almost forever.
In most places, says Patrick Conners, The Energy Guy, wood competes dollar for dollar with natural gas but pollutes much more and requires far more work: hauling and stacking the wood, stoking and tending the fire, and cleaning out the ashes afterward. A modern furnace gives much more uniform heat without the smoke and draft issues, but even these are unavailable and unaffordable in Africa.
African electricity costs and reliability will only come with modernization and expansion of the electric grid. The late Steven Lyazi, who worked with the Congress of Racial Equality Uganda, acknowledged that the availability of solar energy is good news to millions of Africans who rely on firewood, dung and charcoal for cooking. However, he added, solar and wind are at best stopgap solutions on the way to energy security – which UN, World Bank and other policies all but ensure will never arrive.
“Many people,” said Lyazi, “don’t know that Africa has some big dreams.” Just one – the proposed 466-mile Trans East Africa electric railway – would require much more energy than wind and solar can provide. Much of Africa has great potential for nuclear energy, coal, oil and natural gas, he explained – but powerful (largely European) environmentalists (including the World Bank) have opposed funding such projects.
Lyazi, who died in a bus accident in 2017, urged Africans to use their abundant natural resources. He challenged Africans to defy European environmentalists, who have stymied fossil fuel, hydroelectric and nuclear power projects in Africa. He said Uganda and other SSA countries should build natural gas pipelines to power plants, to generate affordable electricity for millions. Today, African oilfields mostly burn and waste the gas, while exporting the oil is mostly exported, benefitting elites while leaving millions energy-deprived, impoverished and desperate.
Why not also build nuclear and coal power plants and hydroelectric projects? Why not indeed? Why should Africans continue to barely survive at the hands of eco-imperialist, neo-colonialist, environmentally destructive organizations policies that ignore the most basic human rights: the rights to energy, modern health and living standards, and decent lives?
As South African nuclear engineer, energy consultant and activist Kelvin Kemm has noted, no single energy source will work for all of Africa. All have shortcomings in various regions, for a wide variety of reasons – except that small pebble bed modular nuclear reactors could probably be employed anywhere.
But Africa, and individual African countries and regions, should be the ones making those decisions – not outsiders, and not based on disinformation, pressure and bullying from those outsiders. They should not be forced to accept biomess energy imposed on them by global eco-imperialists.

 by Viv Forbes, 3 October 2019
Climate alarm has fractured western societies into four main groups – the Silent Majority, the Red Green-ants, the Noisy Street Children, and the Wise Elders.
The Silent Majority do the work of the nation. They pay the nation’s bills and taxes and only make their presence felt at election time. They despise most career politicians but many fear reprisals from Big Government or Big Business should they be seen speaking out. But when sufficiently aroused they toss out the chicken-littles and turn to leaders like Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Boris Johnson.

The Red Green-ants are forever nibbling away at the foundations of free societies. They inflame and exploit naïve crusaders like the Noisy Children. Showing cowardice, avarice or ignorance, many Big Business leaders support them while tax-payer funded media, research and education bureaucracies give overwhelming support. Green-ants hate all individual and property rights that stand in the way of total UN control of western energy, consumers, industry, currency and military. Angela Merkel and the Green New Deal are prominent examples of this powerful group.

See: https://reaction.life/angela-merkels-communist-roots-caused-downfall/
The Noisy Street Children (and too many of their teachers) despise science, engineering, wisdom and experience. They are being manipulated by handlers with a globalist agenda and amplified by fellow travellers with media megaphones. They are likely to morph into tomorrow’s version of Hitler’s Brown Shirts and Mao’s Red Guards both of which supported a green agenda. Neither of these noisy revolutions ended well. Our hope is with the sensible students and teachers who are not clogging the streets and who prefer education to indoctrination.

But not all kids are brainwashed:
https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/09/24/socialism_not_climate_change_is_the_real_threat_141323.html
The Wise Elders have formal education and/or life experience, and the freedom to be outspoken. They are despised by the Noisy Children and denigrated or ignored by the government/green media.
In the face of a looming energy crisis the Silent Majority and the Wise Elders are shattering the idea of a climate alarm consensus.
Firstly, 31,487 of them signed the Oregon Petition which said there was no convincing scientific evidence of a climate catastrophe caused by carbon dioxide:
See: http://www.petitionproject.org/
Secondly, they formed the NIPCC (non-government international panel on climate change):
https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/non-governmental-nipcc-climate-scientists-critique-the-uns-ipcc
Thirdly, about 200 climate realists from 26 countries put their names to the Clexit (Climate Exit) Campaign urging all nations to exit and defund the UN climate activities:
https://clexit.net/about/
http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit-members.pdf
Fourthly, about 650 mature adults have put their names to Australia’s Saltbush Club which encourages all nations to EXIT the Paris Climate Agreement. Some hundreds of others are listed as Silent Saltbush Supporters because they fear reprisals against their career, family or business if their names become public.
https://saltbushclub.com/about/
Finally, even the silent sufferers in the Green EU are revolting, Just last week Europeans initiated and presented a petition to The UN which proclaimed: “There is no Climate emergency”.
This document has quickly attracted support from 500 mature adults from all over the world, not just Europe. It is still growing.
See: https://www.saltbushclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ed-no-climate-emergency.pdf
These lists represent the tip of a huge iceberg of sceptical dissent. Green-red politicians, academia and media have sown the wind – they will reap the whirlwind.

https://clexit.net/2019/10/07/greta-the-marionette/,clexit-admin,Greta the Marionette: A Disturbed Child Cynically Manipulated by Green Zealots,"
Dr. John Happs
In the year 1212 tens of thousands of children from France and Germany set out to re-take Jerusalem from the Muslim inhabitants. According to a 13th century source, the Chronica regia Coloniensis (‘Royal Chronicle of Cologne’):
“Many thousands of boys, ranging in age from six years to full maturity, left the plows or carts they were driving, the flocks which they were pasturing, and anything else which they were doing. This they did despite the wishes of their parents, relatives, and friends who sought to make them draw back. Suddenly one ran after another to take the cross. Thus, by groups of twenty, or fifty, or a hundred, they put up banners and began to journey to Jerusalem.”
Of the two groups that took part in the crusade, the first started from France, led by a peasant boy called Stephen of Cloyes who claimed that Jesus had appeared to him in a dream, urging the crusade. More than 30,000 children believed Stephen and followed him to the Holy Land.
The Children’s Crusade by Gustave Dore: Wikimedia Commons
The second group, led by Nicholas of Cologne, attracted around 50,000 children, travelling across the Alps from Germany into Italy to meet the Pope before moving on towards Jerusalem. Tragically, thousands of those crusading children never returned to their homes with many being captured and sold into slavery.
 https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-important-events/childrens-crusade-thousands-children-march-holy-land-never-return-003044
We now have a climate crusade involving many children from around the world, cheered on by the media, environmental activists and a number of politicians. It is expected that this crusade will not incur any risks and everyone will return home safely to their parents, leaving behind a pile of trash after their march to save the planet.
 https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/09/climate-change-activists-march-in-new-york-city-leave-their-piles-of-trash-for-someone-else-to-clean-up/
Hopefully, no harm will be come to those children apart from having their minds filled with visions of climate catastrophe, fuelled by cynical Green Zealots.
Today’s climate crusade appears to have been catalysed by a preaching 16 year-old Swedish girl called Greta Thunberg. She probably doesn’t know the difference between an isobar and a chocolate bar but she does promise to lead us all out of an imaginary overheating world and into a new utopia where the climate never changes and every day is perfect. All we have to do is ignore what the scientific facts and tens of thousands of scientists say and simply heed her words of wisdom.
Image from Wikipedia
Greta says:
“We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.”
And:
“There are no solutions anywhere in sight.”
I suspect that some really useful solutions have already been offered in classrooms around the world where children are being told that the climate of our planet can be controlled simply by doing the following:
Turn off the light switch when we leave a room; wear extra clothing when its cold so we can turn the heater off; take off our clothes when it is hot so we can turn the air-conditioner down; stop eating meat because fewer cows mean less methane in the atmosphere; recycle everything even though this uses more energy than manufacturing the goods in the first place; produce more inefficient, unreliable wind turbines and solar panels that require 24/7 backup from hydrocarbon fuels and drive up the cost of electricity; compost your food waste; have cold showers instead of hot ones and whatever you do, don’t wash your hair so often.
Apparently the solutions for controlling the climate of the planet are on hand if only we would listen to informed people like Greta and start working through the above checklist.
I doubt that Greta was aware that her much-publicised boat trip on the 5 million USD 20 metre Malizia across the Atlantic Ocean was built for Pierre Casiraghi, the youngest son of Princess Grace Kelly. I doubt that Greta was aware she was sailing in a non-recyclable carbon fibre boat constructed from those dreaded petrochemicals – presumably the ones Greta wants to leave in the ground.
Presumably Malizia was propelled by wind in sails made from nylon, polyester or carbon fibres. Dacron is often the material of choice for mainsails, genoas and jibs. In fact all the fittings on the boat and crew clothing would have been made from hydrocarbons or constructed, using hydrocarbon fuel energy.

I doubt that Greta was aware that the owner of Malizia owns a number of similar yachts and several private jet planes. Apparently two of the crew members had to fly to New York to sail the boat back to Europe and no doubt Greta will be on a flight back home, powered by hydrocarbon fuel of course. Never mind about the big carbon footprint her sailing adventure laid down and never mind the added hypocrisy of all those UN officials flying back and forth to their regular climate meetings with the European Union planning to spend millions more Euros on private jet flights for its top officials.
 https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-plans-to-spend-more-on-private-jets-for-top-officials-ursula-von-der-leyen-jean-claude-juncker-european-commission-climate-change/
This is hypocrisy on steroids but poor Greta hasn’t the maturity or education to see this, although the UN officials and Green Zealots who are exploiting her certainly know this. They also know that few will criticise Greta (poor child) without being seen as bullies.
Brendan O’Neill likens Greta to a cult member with the threat of hellfire and damnation if we don’t atone for our climate sins. He observes:
“One can imagine her in a sparse wooden church in the Plymouth Colony in the 1600s warning parishioners of the hellfire that will rain upon them if they fail to give up their witches.”
He rightly blames the Green Zealots for exploiting this naïve girl:
“What they have done to Ms Thunberg is unforgivable. They have pumped her – and millions of other children – with the politics of fear. They have convinced the next generation that the planet is on the cusp of doom. They have injected dread into the youth.”
 https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/04/22/the-cult-of-greta-thunberg/
Malena Ernman (Greta’s opera singer Mother) and Svante Thunberg (Greta’s actor Father) have written a book: Scener ur hjartat or “Scenes from the heart: Our life for the climate” in which we are told how “Greta was diagnosed as a child with obsessive-compulsive disorder and Asperger’s Syndrome, just like her younger sister Beata.”
 https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41462707-scener-ur-hj-rtat
Her Mother tells us that Greta can see what other people cannot see:
“She can see carbon dioxide with the naked eye. She sees how it flows out of chimneys and changes the atmosphere in a landfill.”
This is no mean feat with only 400 ppm of colourless, odourless carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Presumably Greta would have no trouble tracking those 33 molecules of carbon dioxide mixed in with every 85,800 molecules of other gas molecules that make up air. Who knows, Greta might even be able to isolate and identify the 1 carbon dioxide molecule that comes from human activity from those 85,800.
Not surprisingly, Greta has her followers but who are they? A recent Scott Rasmussen survey across all age ranges answers that question. The survey found that more than 70% of those polled disagreed that the Earth will become uninhabitable with all life on Earth threatened. Only 10% of those polled considered such a scenario as “Very Likely.”
So who makes up the 10% that agree with Greta’s vision of doom?
When younger voters were surveyed, 51% indicated their belief that it is “likely” humanity could be wiped out in the next decade or so.
 https://www.climatedepot.com/2019/09/24/poll-51-of-young-voters-believe-humanity-could-be-wiped-out-within-15-years/
So how does this belief in catastrophic anthropogenic global warming nonsense get into the minds of so many youngsters? We might consider what children are being taught in schools.
At the end of a recent public talk I gave on climate change, a lady stood up and said:
“I am a retired high school science teacher and I can tell you that much of this global warming nonsense is being taught in social studies classes by teachers who spout green activist nonsense and know less science than the kids they are teaching.”
A little harsh perhaps?
Whatever the source, Greta thinks she has a handle on the science, saying:
“For more than 30 years the science has been crystal-clear.”
Presumably Greta is referring to the “crystal-clear science” served up by the political/ideological Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and she is clearly worried about catastrophic global warming, more extreme weather, ecosystems and the bleak future for her generation.
Well here is some good news for Greta.
Sweden (Greta’s home country) is colder now than it has been for the last 9,000 years and there are many peer-reviewed, published papers that testify to this.
 https://notrickszone.com/2019/09/26/protesting-warmth-gretas-home-sweden-is-3c-colder-today-than-nearly-all-of-the-last-9000-years/
Objective, apolitical, unbiased science tells us that uncontaminated satellite data show that lower troposphere temperatures have been stable for more than 18 years. Climate scientist Dr. Richard Keen of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado says:
“Earth has cooled since 1998 in defiance of the predictions by the UN-IPCC… .The global temperature for 2007 was the coldest in a decade and the coldest of the millennium… which is why ‘global warming’ is now called ‘climate change.”
Climate scientist Dr. Don Easterbrook warns:
“That global warming is over, at least for a few decades, might seem to be a relief. However, the bad news is that global cooling is even more harmful to humans than global warming and a cause for even greater concern.”
 https://www.newsmax.com/hostetter/hostetter-global-warming-climate/2010/05/20/id/359624/
Dr. Lucia Liljegren, an atmospheric researcher with the Ames Laboratory at Iowa State University has confirmed that the IPCC computer models have predicted warming when there has been none.
Dr. Mojab Latif, climate modeller and IPCC author told more than 1,500 climate scientists at the UN’s World Climate Conference in Geneva (New Scientist, 9th September, 2009):
“We could be entering one or even two decades of cooler temperatures.”
 https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327254-000-world-will-cool-for-the-next-decade/
Even the IPCC’s alarmist Dr. Kevin Trenberth admitted in a leaked email:
“The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t.”
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/05/22/kevin-trenberth-struggles-mightily-to-explain-the-lack-of-global-warming/
Dr. Khabibullo Abdusamatov, head of the space research facility at the Pulkovo observatory in St. Petersburg warns of low solar activity and global cooling which could continue for 2 or more decades. He states:
“By the mid-21st century the planet will face another Little Ice Age, similar to the Maunder Minimum, because the amount of solar radiation hitting the Earth has been constantly decreasing since the 1990s and will reach its minimum approximately in 2041.”
 https://www.iceagenow.com/Russian_scientist_says_Earth_could_soon_face_new_Ice_Age.htm
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has now acknowledged that there has been no global warming for at least 18 years, despite rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
Someone should tell Greta that even the alarmist IPCC has now reported that the gentle end of 20th century warming has stopped. The IPCC’s Chapter 9 of the WG1 Report discusses the hiatus under Box 9.2: Climate Models and the Hiatus in Global-Mean Surface Warming of the Past 15 Years.
Under Box 9.2 we read:
“Nevertheless, the occurrence of the hiatus in GMST trend during the past 15 years raises the two related questions of what has caused it and whether climate models are able to reproduce it.”
https://judithcurry.com/2013/09/30/ipccs-pause-logic/
Someone should tell Greta that temperature data from Greenland, Antarctica, the Himalayas, New Zealand, Portugal, China, Canada and a host of other countries show there has not been any warming for many years:
 http://notrickszone.com/2018/02/18/greenland-antarctica-and-dozens-of-areas-worldwide-have-not-seen-any-warming-in-60-years-and-more/
It’s such a pity that the Gretas of this world can’t read and understand the 265 peer-reviewed published papers that say the gentle late 20th century warming is not dangerous, unprecedented or globally pervasive. These can be found at:
 https://notrickszone.com/2019/01/31/265-papers-published-since-2017-subvert-the-claim-that-post-1850-warmth-has-been-unusual-or-global/
It’s such a pity that the Gretas of this world can’t read and understand the 100 peer-reviewed published papers that point to the sun as the main driver of climate change:
https://notrickszone.com/100-papers-sun-drives-climate/
Now that we have tried to re-assure all the Gretas of this world that the planet is not about to incinerate us, let’s look at those worries over mass extinctions.
It’s such a pity that all the Gretas aren’t aware that there is no empirical evidence for the hysteria about imminent mass extinction.
Der Spiegel’s Axel Bojanowski notes:
“The IPCC admits that there is no evidence climate change has led to even a single species becoming extinct thus far. At most, the draft report says, climate change may have played a role in the disappearance of a few amphibians, freshwater fish and mollusks. Yet even the icons of catastrophic global warming, the polar bears, are doing surprisingly well.”
 https://www.climatedepot.com/2019/05/22/submitted-written-congressional-testimony-of-marc-morano-examining-un-species-climate-report-un-report-is-authoritative-propaganda-house-natural-resources-committee/
Additionally, Dr. Philip Stott, Professor of Biogeography at the University of London, has dismissed alarmist claims about current extinction due to (imaginary) global warming. He said:
“The earth has gone through many periods of major extinctions, some much bigger in size than even being contemplated today.”
And:
“Change is necessary to keep up with change in nature itself. In other words, change is the essence. And the idea that we can keep all species that now exist would be anti-evolutionary, anti-nature and anti the very nature of the earth in which we live.”
 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/05/23/hearing-on-the-un-biodiversity-report/
The most recent IPCC report (AR5) now admits that there is no evidence to show that climate change has led to even a single species becoming extinct thus far. In fact the IPCC now doubts its own computer simulations for species extinctions, saying:
“There is very little confidence that models currently predict extinction risk accurately.”
 https://www.climatedepot.com/2014/03/27/the-un-ipcc-admits-there-is-very-little-confidence-that-models-currently-predict-extinction-risk-accurately/
Dr. Diana Fisher and Dr. Simon Blomberg compiled a list of all mammals declared extinct since the 16th century or which were identified as being missing in scientific papers. They reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society:
“We identified 187 mammal species that have been missing since 1500. In the complete data-set, 67 species that were once missing have been rediscovered.”
And:
“Species presumed to be extinct are often rediscovered. For example, 89 Australian vascular plants were rediscovered between 1981 and 2001, and rediscovery was the reason for disqualification of 13 mammals from a list of 144 candidate extinct species analysed in 1999.”
http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/278/1708/1090
When it comes to mass extinctions, natural catastrophes bring these about with spectacular success. In fact 99% of species that have lived on Earth are now extinct because of massive natural disasters. The main ones are identified as the Ordovician-Silurian extinction (445 million years ago); the late Devonian extinction (370 million years ago); the Permian-Triassic extinction (250 million years ago); the Triassic-Jurassic extinction (200 million years ago) and the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction (66 million years ago).
 https://www.ranker.com/list/earth_s-big-five-mass-extinction-events/analise.dubner
The triggers for these mass extinctions have been asteroid or comet strike and/or the eruption of super-volcanoes, followed by dramatic global cooling as debris thrown into the atmosphere blocked out radiation from the sun for a significant period of time.
Now that we have re-assured all the Gretas that the planet is not about to burn up and there is no prospect of a planetary mass extinction, let’s look at their pessimism about the future.
It’s such a pity that the Gretas of this world aren’t aware that by almost every measure, life is much better today than at any other time in history and is continuing to improve.
How are we doing regarding child mortality?
Only 100 years ago every 3rd child died before the age of five:

In 2017 child mortality was down to 40%. This is ten times lower than it was 200 years ago.
How are we doing regarding life expectancy?
Life expectancy 200 years ago ranged on average between 20 and 30 years. Today, life expectancy has surged, averaging 80 years in the UK and over 80 years in Japan.

How are we doing regarding nourishment?
The share of the population that is undernourished continues to fall:

How are we doing regarding getting inexpensive, reliable energy to everyone?
Access to inexpensive, reliable hydrocarbon energy is essential for economic growth and the well-being of nations. Global primary energy consumption has increased, lifting more people out of poverty:

How are we doing regarding air pollution?
Death rates from outdoor ozone, particulate matter and indoor fuel burning continue to fall:

How are we doing regarding oil spills?
It’s commonly thought that, as oil shipments increase around the world, oil spills will increase. The evidence shows otherwise:

How are we doing regarding getting improved water resources to everyone?
The number of people with access to improved water resources also continues to grow:

How are we doing regarding the reduction of extreme poverty?
Extreme poverty has been falling steadily worldwide:

How are we doing regarding the reduction of child labour?
Child labour has been falling steadily worldwide:

How are we doing regarding global conflicts?
The world is far more peaceful today than at any other time:

How are we doing regarding getting education to everyone?
The world population of 15 year olds with at least a basic education has increased dramatically:

How are we doing regarding the greening of the Earth?
Very well it turns out. Dr Zaichun Zhu, from Peking University in China and lead author of a new study, reports that:
“The most comprehensive modelling of remote sensing data so far shows the area on Earth covered by plants in this time has increased by 18 million square kilometres – about 2.5 times the size of the Australian continent – largely due to the fertilising effect of carbon dioxide (CO2).”

Greta, I suggest that you and your well-heeled hypocritical promoters visit a few shanty towns in Africa and tell the people there why they can’t have access to decent air-conditioned housing, inexpensive, reliable electricity, cars and all the trappings of civilization that you have enjoyed for so long.
Earth to Greta: Your head is being filled with alarmist nonsense and you are being manipulated for political/ideological reasons by United Nations personnel and green activists.
There is zero evidence to show that the planet is experiencing unusual warming or more extreme weather and be assured, we are not facing even a minor extinction.
Life has never been better Greta and the future looks great for your generation as you can see from real-world evidence. We can thank coal, oil and gas for giving us inexpensive, high-density reliable energy that has powered our civilization, made us healthier, provided us with more food, improved our standard of living in every way and continues to lift more and more people out of poverty.
Of course life on our planet could get even better – if we actually had some real global warming and quite a bit more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

There are now many frightened school children and quite a few worried parents because of what is taught in some classrooms and what they hear about impending climate-induced doom. We also have personal attacks on those scientists who oppose, with facts, the promoters of climate Armageddon.

Some scientists have lost their jobs because they dared to speak out in defence of common sense and a lack of empirical evidence to show that our trivial emissions of invisible, non-toxic, life-giving carbon dioxide threaten life on Earth.
We have escalating power prices and deaths from fuel-poverty because of the headlong rush into inefficient, unreliable wind and solar power sources.
Turbines blight the landscape, killing birds and bats by the thousands. Solar and wind projects drive up power costs, penalising the poor whilst having zero effect on global climate.
https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2019/09/wind-energy-and-the-extinction-of-eagles/
So where has this madness come from and why does it prevail?
It’s likely that decision makers, such as politicians and disseminators of (usually bad) news, such as journalists, listen to dire predictions about climate change that have no empirical evidence to support them. Such predictions come from those who have political or financial vested interests in promoting the catastrophic global warming meme. Some politicians actually believe (or their party insists they believe) the nonsense about dramatic sea level rise, ice sheet melting, ocean acidification, the death of coral reefs and a host of related and imaginary dilemmas.
It’s also likely that some people believe in those dire climate predictions, not because they are based on reliable empirical evidence. Rather they are told that outputs from computer models tell them so.
The problem essentially comes from some in the climate research establishment who have been tapping into the generous funding that has gone into climate research and computer modeling over the last three decades. Much of that money has come from governments (taxpayers) where some politicians, promising to deliver us from all evil, actually believe the nonsense about catastrophic anthropogenic global warming even though the alarmism has never come from real world evidence but from those unvalidated, unreliable computer models.
Such belief persists when even the alarmist Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) admitted that:
“In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” 
Third Assessment Report (2001), Section 14.2.2.2, page 774.
Climate computer programs, and there are many of them, are very complex. They require millions of lines of code in vain efforts to model all the factors that influence the Earth’s climate even though it is likely there are many factors yet to be identified. Of those factors that are known, many are poorly understood.
The UN’s political/ideological IPCC has predicted from models that, should anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions continue at the current rate, (they contribute a mere 3% to the atmosphere’s trivial 400 ppm carbon dioxide) by the year 2100, we will see a global average surface air temperature increase of around 3ºC.
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00223/full
Of course alarmist computer projections are usually published with no indication of possible errors. As Smith (2002) reminds us:
“Even in high school physics, we learn that an answer without “error bars” is no answer at all.”
http://potiphar.jongarvey.co.uk/2019/09/08/error-propagation-in-climate-models/
Future climate aside, computer-driven predictions of weather only a few days ahead can be problematic as Senior Forecaster Gordon Banks, from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology frankly stated:
“The atmosphere is very complex. Our models are having trouble doing any forecasts beyond about 7 days.“ (ABC Radio, 4th January, 2011)
Such intellectual honesty is refreshing but seems to be lacking amongst many climate modellers.
Even short-term weather forecasts can differ markedly depending on the models used and their inputs. We might expect that, in the days before super-computers, differences in weather forecasts for the same period would be inevitable. The various weather forecasts for D-Day, the allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) in June, 1944 provided notable examples.
Potential landing dates for the Normandy invasion were few since a full moon was needed to facilitate the landing of gliders, men and equipment. Critically, only a 3-day window was available.
English forecasters said to expect stormy weather on the 5th June with a break on June 6th whereas US forecasters predicted clear sunny skies over the English Channel on the 5th June. German forecasters predicted continuing bad weather with rough seas and gale-force winds expected to continue unabated until at least the middle of June. Consequently, most German commanders were confident that an allied invasion would not take place during the month of June.
Field Marshall Erwin Rommel left the coastal defenses and went home to celebrate his wife’s birthday on the 6th June.
The invasion took place on Tuesday, 6th June 1944 with the English forecast proving to be correct.

There is no doubt that computing power has grown dramatically in the last few decades yet long-term weather forecasting still proves to be difficult with so many quickly-changing variables involved. Weather forecasters are aware of this problem yet they come under increasing pressure from those who sail, fly, farm and vacation. Everyone wants to know what the weather will be like at a particular destination on some future date and forecasters know they will not always get their long-term forecast right. They also know that, due to the complexity of rapidly-changing weather systems, there will be occasions when they will be spectacularly wrong.

If weather forecasting for the next week or two is difficult, then imagine the difficulty (or impossibility) of making climate predictions into the distant future. Of course this has never deterred the climate alarmists from convincing politicians and media reporters that their computers are totally reliable, putting out forecasts of rising global temperatures with any number of dire consequences for the planet.
The fact that none of their computer-driven predictions about global temperature has ever been correct doesn’t seem to trouble them. They simply move on to their next dire warning for the future (“It’s worse than we thought.”) knowing it will be believed by those politicians who want to believe and those scientists who know that continuing the alarmism will keep their research funds flowing.
Computer-generated climate predictions have been consistently wrong and have resulted in trillions of taxpayer dollars being wasted on climate mitigation schemes that never had any prospect of having the slightest impact on global climate.
In 2016 climate scientist Dr. John Christy testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology, commenting on the reliability of climate models. He compared the average of 102 climate models with observations from the more reliable satellite and weather balloon measurements and concluded:
“These models failed at the simple test of telling us ‘what’ has already happened, and thus would not be in a position to give us a confident answer to ‘what’ may happen in the future and ‘why.’ As such, they would be of highly questionable value in determining policy that should depend on a very confident understanding of how the climate system works.”

Dr. David Henderson and Dr. Charles Hooper from the Hoover Institution at Stanford University pointed out that:
“The ultimate test for a climate model is the accuracy of its predictions. But the models predicted that there would be much greater warming between 1998 and 2014 than actually happened. If the models were doing a good job, their predictions would cluster symmetrically around the actual measured temperatures. That was not the case here… “
https://www.hoover.org/research/flawed-climate-models
Dr. Myles Allen, Professor of Geosystem Science at the University of Oxford said:
“We haven’t seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models. We haven’t seen that in the observations.”
https://www.thegwpf.com/we-we-wrong-climate-scientists-concede/
The IPCC’s Dr. Ben Santer admitted:
“In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble. “
https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2973
No surprise there.
Despite the huge amounts of money still pouring into computing power, models cannot predict global temperatures over the next few years let alone the distant future. As Dr. Bjorn Stevens, from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology bluntly points out:
“The computational power of computers has risen many millions of dollars, but the prediction of global warming is as imprecise as ever.”
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/04/03/why-climate-predictions-are-so-difficult/
There is no doubt that the “Pause” in global warming is real and computer models predictions of dramatically increased temperatures have proved to be hopelessly wrong. The bottom line is this: If you don’t understand something and you can’t explain your observations, you can’t possibly model it.
Even those factors that are known to influence climate are modelled differently by different groups, as are their perceived impact. This is known as “Parametrization.” We might more accurately call them “fudge factors” and as climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry observes:
“Often, different parameterizations deliver drastically divergent results.”
https://judithcurry.com/2019/03/30/why-climate-predictions-are-so-difficult/
Dr. Will Happer, Professor of atmospheric physics at Princeton University reflected:
“So, if they want to show that the earth’s temperature at the end of the century will be two degrees centigrade higher than it is now, they put in the numbers that produce that result. That’s not science. That’s science fiction.”
https://www.climatedepot.com/2018/02/05/princeton-physicist-predicting-climate-temperatures-isnt-science-its-science-fiction/
If alarmist modellers continue to assume, for political/ideological reasons, that anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions will lead to global warming and this becomes a dominant computer input, little wonder that predictions will continue to be wrong. As climate scientist Dr. Roy Spencer explains, the modellers have a fixation on carbon dioxide:
“Importantly, we don’t understand natural climate variations, and the models don’t produce it, so CO2 is the only source of warming in today’s state-of-the-art models.”
http://www.drroyspencer.com/2019/02/new-santer-study-97-consensus-is-now-99-99997/
Former Virginia State Climatologist Dr. Patrick Michaels, agrees:
“The computer models are making systematic, dramatic errors because they are “parameterized” (fudged). We put in code steps that give us what we think it ‘should’ be. The models were ‘tuned.’ We forced the computer models to say, aha! human influence. The models “tell us what we wanted to see. The models have been tuned to give an anticipated, acceptable range of results.”
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/07/02/climate-models-are-fudged-says-climatologist-video/
Again, Dr. Judith Curry was more forthright, saying of some alarmists:
“The scientists were contracted to be “narrowly focused” on man’s impact and thus ended up ignoring what may be the most important factors, such as solar and oceanic cycles.”
https://notrickszone.com/2019/05/24/climatologist-dr-judith-curry-climate-scientists-apocalyptic-predictions-depend-on-unrealistic-climate-model-simulations/
Computer modellers essentially play down or omit factors such as clouds, air-pressure changes, plate tectonics, aerosols, natural oscillations, ozone, solar radiation, ice and snow albedo, cosmic rays, orbital dynamics, volatile organic compounds, evaporation, vegetation, multi-decadal variability, geothermal heat, and precipitation. An even more fundamental problem with climate models rests on a poor understanding about the coupling of two chaotic fluids – the oceans and the atmosphere.
Modellers ignore evidence that shows, when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and global temperature do track closely, it is temperature that precedes carbon dioxide levels. Rather they have a political/ideological need to link climate change to human activity whereas there is no empirical evidence for this assertion.
A critical component of any climate model is climate sensitivity, defined as the increase, in global temperature should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide be doubled.
IPCC scientists claimed that climate sensitivity lies between 1 and 6ºC with a mean estimate of 3.1ºC as a result of feedbacks from a variety of poorly understood factors.
Climate scientists Dr. Thorsten Mauritsen from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and Dr. Robert Pincus from the University of Colorado calculated a median climate sensitivity value of 1.5 ºC.
https://niclewis.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/lewis_and_curry_jcli-d-17-0667_accepted.pdf
Dr. Boris Smirnov, author of 20 physics textbooks has calculated climate sensitivity from anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide as being negligible.
https://notrickszone.com/2018/06/04/atomic-physicist-human-co2-emissions-have-an-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity-of-a-not-important-0-02-k/
Additionally, there are at least 85 peer-reviewed, published papers that say climate sensitivity is extremely low. These can be located at:
https://notrickszone.com/50-papers-low-sensitivity/
The major drivers of global climate are more likely the sun and the oceans, with the role of carbon dioxide being deliberately exaggerated by the IPCC for its own political/ideological purposes, commonly known as “The Cause.”
https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1807/1807.03976.pdf
The abysmal track record of computer models is seen in two significant failures:
1. No models predicted the pause in warming over the last 20 years despite atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increasing.
2. Models predicted an upper troposphere “hotspot” that is non-existent.
There are other problems linked with temperature trends from the 19th century.
Computer models cannot account for the almost identical temperature increases between 1855-1880, 1910-1950 and 1980-2000:

Computer models cannot show that the 1855-1880 warming phase was due to natural processes whilst the late 20th century warming was anthropogenic in origin, as claimed by alarmists.
Models cannot explain the cooling periods between 1880-1910 and 1950-1980 when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increased.
If climate models don’t get basic predictions correct, why would anyone trust their predictions about dramatically rising temperatures and the resulting consequences? Marine biologist Dr. Walter Starck highlights the difference between computer model predictions and reality:
“A significant factor in the growing detachment of environmental science from empirical reality has been the rise in popularity of computer modelling and a decline in real-world observation. The latter tends to be uncomfortable to obtain, the results are often messy, frequently don’t support the desired narrative and present a risk of independent examination. By contrast, computer modelling can be done in comfort during office hours, presents an aura of advanced expertise and mathematical certainty, can be “adjusted “to give a desired result generally inaccessible to independent examination.”
https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2019/09/reef-alarmists-find-what-they-need-to-find/
Dr. Mototaka Nakamura is a computer modeller and an expert on cloud dynamics and atmospheric-ocean interactions. In his book: “Confessions of a climate scientist: the global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis.” Nakamura makes clear that:
“The models just become useless pieces of junk or worse (worse in a sense that they can produce gravely misleading output) when they are used for climate forecasting.”
And:
“These models completely lack some critically important climate processes and feedbacks, and represent some other critically important climate processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to the extent that makes these models totally useless for any meaningful climate prediction.”
https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2019/09/19/canadians-bamboozled-by-meaningless-climate-models/
Perhaps NASA climate scientist Dr. Duane Thresher has suggested good reasons why climate modellers persist even though they know their models simply don’t deliver:
“Predicting climate decades or even just years into the future is a lie, albeit a useful one for publication and funding.”
Gettyimages
NASA has acknowledged that climate models do not have the ability to accurately model clouds and that this is a major problem.
https://notrickszone.com/2019/08/29/nasa-we-cant-model-clouds-so-climate-models-are-100-times-less-accurate-than-needed-for-projections/
More than 500 prominent scientists have sent a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urging him to de-politicise climate discussions. They point out that UN alarmism is based on unreliable climate modeling:
“The general circulation models of climate on which international policy is at present founded are unfit for their purpose. Therefore it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models.”
https://www.climatedepot.com/2019/09/24/no-climate-emergency-mit-climate-expert-500-prominent-global-experts-write-in-letter-to-un/
Dr. Julia Slingo, Chief Scientist at the UK Met Office (from 2009 to 2016) stated that predictions would not get much better until they had super-computers that were 1,000 times more powerful than the ones they had. She said:
“In terms of computing power, it’s proving totally inadequate. With climate models we know how to make them much better to provide much more information at the local level… we know how to do that, but we don’t have the computing power to deliver it.“
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/03/15/if-you-cant-explain-it-you-cant-model-it/
We don’t need a super-computer to predict that giving carbon-dioxide obsessed gamers faster computers will only result in them giving us the wrong prediction sooner.

https://clexit.net/2019/10/05/electricity-in-australia-from-success-to-failure/,clexit-admin,Electricity in Australia – Switching from Success to Failure,"
By Viv Forbes, 23 September 2019
Our grandfathers built a low-cost reliable decentralised electricity supply for all states of Australia based mainly on black and brown coal-fields – Blair Athol, Callide, Ipswich, Sydney/Newcastle, Yallourn, Leigh Creek and Collie.
Then our fathers built the mighty Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric scheme which provided water to irrigate the inland while generating electricity to help pay for it.
Then in the years up to 1980, huge new coal-fired power plants were constructed in each State. And we discovered oil and gas in Roma, Bass Strait, Barrow Island, Timor Sea, and in coal and shale in many places.
Coal and hydro gave Australia reliable low-cost electricity that was the envy of the world and supported primary, secondary and tertiary industries.
We irrigated crops, electrified cities, powered railways and mines, refined metals and petroleum and processed milk, wool, cotton, grains, meat and fruit. Factories made Victa mowers, Southern Cross windmills and diesel engines. Holden/Ford/Toyota and Mitsubishi all produced cars in Australia and we made 9 brands of tractors. The Ipswich railway workshops produced locomotives and rolling stock, and Lithgow produced small arms. We canned Golden Circle pineapples, Ardmona stone fruits, Rosella jams and made Bully Beef, tomato sauce and Vegemite.
Australia once valued decentralisation and it served us well in electricity supply. Electricity generation and distribution was left in the hands of state-based engineers and entrepreneurs, and competitive state governments strove to ensure their states had the most reliable low-cost electricity. In those days a state “Co-ordinator General” was charged with predicting demand for electricity and then ensuring that power stations were built in the right place at the right time. The distant Federal Government largely confined itself to defence, foreign affairs, immigration and quarantine (with increasing meddling into wage setting, welfare and devaluation of the currency).
All that changed with the UN-initiated climate war on coal and gas which drove a campaign of tax-delay-and-destroy hydro-carbon energy.
Canberra became the epi-centre of the zero-emissions religion, and energy management and policy became centralised. Green energy was mollycoddled with subsidies, mandates and propaganda, and electricity supply was polluted by a rash of intermittent wind and solar plants with no backups. These caused such variability and unreliability in electricity supply that the successful state-based decentralised electricity networks were replaced by a costly interconnected Eastern States grid. Transmission costs rose sharply because of guaranteed returns on inflated capital for interstate, undersea and the scattered wind-solar connections. Electricity costs soared, reliability suffered and Australian industry closed or moved to Asia.
There is only one way out of this mess – we must retrace the way we got in.
Firstly, any operator wishing to connect to the grid must demonstrate its ability to supply 24/7 power with its own generators, batteries, standby generators or contractual arrangements. Businesses, towns and communities should be free to operate “off-grid” at their own cost and risk.
Secondly, Canberra must withdraw from electricity taxation, subsidies, regulation and control. This means no “Renewable” Energy Targets, no “Clean” Energy Targets, no Paris Accord, no emissions targets, no carbon taxes, no subsidies or mandates for wind/solar energy or batteries and abolition of all federal prohibitions on nuclear power. States which shut or destroy their coal/gas generators must live with the consequences. The states must take back responsibility for all regulations imposed on electricity supply, with goals to maximise reliability and minimise costs. They will see the results as residents and businesses migrate to states with low-cost reliable energy.
The interstate electricity grid is of value and should be retained but removed from federal management and control. Its inflated capital should be written down greatly and States and private operators should own and control it with a regulator setting maximum transmission charges. Europe copes with several countries buying and selling electricity across borders – surely Australian states can do the same? (The Australian interstate highway system is largely state-owned but copes with public roads, toll roads, urban roads, local roads and private roads of greatly varying quality and capacity.)
And, if Canberra truly believes the “Zero Emissions” mantra chanted by rowdy school kids let’s use ACT as a pilot plant and insist that all ACT homes and businesses live without subsidies from tax payers or consumers and without generating or importing any energy from coal, diesel, petrol or gas.

Zero Emissions in Green Victoria: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4hiXfQhlLY
“The Paris Agreement cannot do much — just as the Rio and Kyoto pacts before it mostly failed — because in essence this approach requires rich countries to promise future economic hardship to achieve very little. Indeed, the real problem is that most of the 21st-century emissions are not being emitted by the rich world: if every single rich country stopped all CO2 emissions today and for the rest of the century — no plane trips, no meat consumption, no petrol-powered cars, no heating or cooling with fossil fuels, no artificial fertiliser — the difference would be just 0.4C by the end of the century.”

AS THE LATEST U.N. climate summit begins in New York, a new, high-level global network of 500 prominent climate scientists and professionals has submitted a declaration that there is no “climate emergency”.
The group has sent a European Climate Declaration with a registered letter to António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Professor Guus Berkhout of The Netherlands, who organized the Declaration, said: “So popular is the Declaration with scientists and researchers worldwide that signatories are flooding in not only from within Europe but also from other countries such as the United States and Canada, Australia and New Zealand.”
The group’s letter warns the U.N. that “the general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is at present founded are unfit for their purpose”.
The Declaration adds that the models, which have predicted far more warming than they should (see diagram), “are not remotely plausible as policy tools”, in that “they … exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2” and “ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial”.
The “climate emergency” that never was: Global warming predicted by climate models (purple and red cursors) is three times warming expected on the basis of officially-estimated manmade influences on climate (orange cursor) and four times observed warming (green cursor).
The letter invites the Secretary-General to work with the global network to organize a constructive, high-level meeting between world-class scientists on both sides of the climate debate in early 2020.

https://clexit.net/2018/10/13/nipcc-end-global-war-fossil-fuel/,clexit-admin,International Panel Calls for End to Global War on Fossil Fuels,"
OCTOBER 5, 2018 – More than 100 leading scholars from 12 countries have issued a report contending “the global war on fossil fuels … was never founded on sound science or economics” and urging the world’s policymakers to “acknowledge this truth and end that war.”

The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an independent organization founded in 2003 to fact-check the work of the United Nations on the issue of climate change, today released the  Summary for Policymakers [PDF] of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels. The 27-page Summary provides an early look at a 1,000-page report expected to be released on December 4 at a climate science symposium during the United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP-24) in Katowice, Poland.
In the new NIPCC report, 117 scientists, economists, and other experts address and refute the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assertions that the impacts of climate change on human well-being and the natural environment justify dramatic reductions in the use of fossil fuels. The Summary provides more than 100 references to peer-reviewed literature, while the full report provides nearly 3,000 such references.

For more information about the Summary for Policymakers, NIPCC, and The Heartland Institute – and to talk to authors or editors of this report – contact Director of Communications Jim Lakely at jlakely@heartland.org or 312/731-9364 (cell).
Among the findings reported in the Summary for Policymakers:


Fossil fuels deliver affordable, plentiful, and reliable energy that is closely associated with key measures of human development and human welfare. There is a strong positive relationship between low energy prices and economic prosperity. Economic prosperity in turn is crucial to human health and welfare. Wind and solar power are incapable of delivering the affordable, plentiful, and reliable energy that is delivered by fossil fuels.




Fossil fuels require the development of substantially less surface area than renewable energy sources, rescuing precious wildlife habitat from development. The power density of fossil fuels enables humanity to meet its need for energy, food, and natural resources while using less surface space, rescuing precious wildlife habitat from development. In 2010, fossil fuels utilized roughly the same surface area as devoted to renewable energy sources yet delivered 110 times as much power.




The environmental and human welfare impacts of fossil fuels are overwhelmingly positive. Sixteen of 25 identified impacts of fossil fuels are net positive. Eight are uncertain, only one is net negative. Some of the identified impacts include agriculture, air quality, extreme weather events, human health, and human mortality.




Reducing fossil fuel use to achieve dramatic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions would inflict tremendous economic hardship. Reducing greenhouse gases to 90 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 would require a 96% reduction in world GDP, reducing per-capita GDP to $1,200 from $30,600 now forecast. Per-capita income would be at about the level it was in the United States and Western Europe in about 1820 or 1830, before the Industrial Revolution.


Scientists and experts will be in Katowice, Poland the week of December 4 to publicly release the full volume of  Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels. Credentialed media are invited to attend the December 4 symposium to learn more about the report and question some of the scientists who agree with its findings. Details on where and when that symposium will be held are coming soon.

The Bolin-Palme treason against Science, the IPCC and Paris illusions and a Clexit solution
By Nils-Axel Mörner
President of the Independent Committee on Geoethics Head of Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics at Stockholm University (1991-2005)
Real science advances via questioning and accumulation of new observational facts. Far back in time, we left dogmatism behind. If Earth’s evolution goes forward via gradualism and catastrophism, science per se, rather advances via sudden new concepts (individual “aha” or “eureka” experiences), observational facts or experiment results. It follows the path: observation – interpretation – conclusion. In the modern new media world, fake news and falsified science may spread rapidly. This is utilized by lobbyist. The boundary between realism and falsified “facts” (fake news) becomes invisible.
It all goes back to the early 70s. The Swedish meteorologist Bert Bolin proposed the cause-and-consequence chain of increased CO2, increasing global temperature, melting glaciers and rising sea level. In 1973, the first fuel crisis happened. Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister and old school friend to Bolin immediately saw new possibilities in a strong argument for leaving oil dependence and rapidly building up our nuclear power industry (“if we in 1990 do not have at least 24 nuclear power plants, it will not survive as an industrial nation”). Already in 1975, the fear of a future increase in atmospheric CO2 content was stated in the Swedish governmental declaration.
Palme realized that he would not be able to control science, so he proposed the establishment of a new intergovernmental body within the United Nation to handle the question. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland grasped the message, and put it in focus in the Brundtland Report of 1988. IPCC was born and Bolin became its first chairman with a basic mission: “to document the anthropogenic global warming”; i.e. the goal was set before the project started. The Sun was purposely left outside “because this is a project in meteorology and oceanography”, he said.

by Bernard Beauzamy
Chairman and CEO
SCM SA
August 6th, 2018
Global Warming has more or less disappeared from international preoccupations, since Donald Trump was elected as President of the US: he withdrew from the Paris agreements, signed after COP21, and after that, a large majority of countries declared “just forget everything”. CO2 emissions keep increasing, both in industrial countries and in countries under development, coal is back everywhere, including in Germany.
In the US, even the theory of global warming has been criticized: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was subject to a subpoena from the US Senate, asking them to work correctly, publish their data and arguments. We do not know if they complied: when people are not used to such habits, it is hard to adopt them.
In France, conversely, nobody took into account the changes in the US and there was no official question about the IPCC’s orientations: the theory of “Global Warming” is still accepted by our governments and by our media. The “Carbon Tax” is one of the key measures proposed by Emmanuel Macron as a presidential candidate, and the French Minister of Environment, Nicolas Hulot (a former journalist) still continues with his “energy transition” (which means, for him, abandon nuclear and develop solar and wind). In France, a vast majority of young people is now convinced that CO2 is a poison! Clearly, the “Paris Agreement” has been detrimental for France, not only economically, but scientifically speaking.
This state of things is not satisfactory to me; I should now take opportunity of this political quietness to develop a more rational approach to these questions.

The first methodological mistake, made by IPCC and by NOAA, is to ask for a “global” temperature, which does not make sense. Let us recall briefly that a temperature describes the movement of molecules; one cannot make the average between the temperature of one km3 of air, land, water, because they do not have the same mass per unit of volume. So, what we need is local measurements, starting as early as possible: we will see if, at some places, temperatures really increase. Such measurements often do exist, for 100 years and more, in US and in Europe. We need to publish the data as they are (and not under the form of “anomalies” with respect to a given year, as we see today).
SCM has done this work for a dozen of countries, six to ten stations in each. See http://www.donnees-climat.info/
The data do not show any warming at all. This work has to be extended to more countries and updated every year.
Two years later, we do not wish to modify the conclusions of our “White Paper”, published in 2015-2016, http://scmsa.eu/rechauff0.htm
“SCM conclusions about global warming are very simple and derive from all the studies we performed: at all places, at all times, the Earth’s climate has been changing, and there is absolutely no fact which might indicate that the present variations are more significant than in the past. Conversely, when measurements exist, they show that these variations are more modest than in the past (example: see level: increase of 1 mm per year today, several centimeters per year 20 000 years ago).”
The second task we might perform if people leave us a little peace of mind is the update of factual data. During many years, we have been subject to a constant flow of contradictory information: the ice at the poles melt/do not melt, polar bears are disappearing/increasing, and so on. The natural variability of phenomena is totally ignored by ecologists: when they see something, no matter what it is, they do not enquire about the past, they immediately declare that this is wrong and human responsibility.
We leave the conclusion to Roger Vercel, a French writer, 1938, in his book:
“A l’assaut des Pôles” (conquest of the poles) :
“Precisely, something extraordinary is happening. At the same time as the French Empire disappears, many icefields broke down and disappeared. During the years 1816 and 1817, icebergs drift, as far as the 40th parallel, at the latitude of Toledo and Napoli! Some icebergs, height 60m, are seen everywhere in the Atlantic: these are pieces of the icefields which were around the North Pole. And William Scoresby, a well-known English captain for whale hunting, writes to Sir Joseph Banks, one of Cook’s companions and himself polar explorer, that, for two years, he has not seen any ice on the coasts of Greenland, between the 74th and 75th degree of latitude. Such an opportunity to reach the Pole, along the Greenland coast, might not happen again so soon”.
We wonder with great satisfaction, in France nowadays, what would be the reaction of the media and of the politicians if anyone could see an iceberg near Portugal! Our “sustainable development”, national cause, would be declared in danger. Hot baths would be limited to one every three months; cars would be replaced by horses.
Where the 19th century saw conquest opportunities, our century sees a danger.

Controlling Climate and Global Wealth Redistribution – a costly agenda indeed!
2015 was a very big year for the global problem solvers at the UN. In September Australia’s former Foreign minister, Julie Bishop, signed the 2030  Sustainable Development Goals agenda, and in December the UN conducted the Paris climate change conference, which was later signed by Australia’s Environment Minister, Greg Hunt. Earlier, in July the same year, Australia participated in the  Addis Ababa Action Agenda to discuss ways of financing the UN’s exceedingly costly agenda.
The first part of this agenda, namely, controlling the climate, is extremely costly in itself, and the folks at the UN tell us they need much more of our money to turn down the heat. But they also need more of our money to  pay the ‘climate debt’ to compensate socialist and theocratic countries, which seem to be selectively targeted by our ‘damaging’ CO2 emissions, or so the story goes.
However, the really big dollars are needed to implement Julie Bishop’s  2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. For this agenda the UN needs a further  $6 trillion annually so we can all be compelled to manage our properties and lifestyles correctly and meet the UN’s ‘sustainability’ requirements. And under  SDG 4.7 the UN seeks to teach our children, through global citizenship education, that only the UN can ‘solve’ problems which the UN defines as ‘global’ problems. So called ‘climate change’ is ‘global problem’  SDG 13. The $6 trillion figure is expected to blow out considerably as fixing the climate and ensuring the sustainability of the earth, and educating children to believe all this, is a costly business indeed. No wonder virtually  all government departments are devoted to helping the UN.
United Nations Announces 2030 Agenda and Climate Change Agreement are Part of Their Global Wealth Redistribution Agenda or ‘New World Order’ (NIEO)
 On 20thJuly 2016 the UN reported that the three 2015 global agreements,  the 2030 SDG agenda, the Paris climate change conference, and the  Addis Ababa Action agenda, are all part of (see A/71/168) their long term new world order agenda, as initiated by the 1974 Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order (NIEO) (see A/RES/S-6/3201). According to the Report of the Secretary General of the United Nations in July 2016, the 2030 Agenda and the Paris climate agreement are intended to address “inequities in the international system” in line with the requirements of the NIEO.
Moving Ahead in 2018 and Controlling Borders, Migration, and the Media – our politicians helping the UN with their global goals
 Under SDG 10.7, the UN’s  Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was born, and accepted by deposed Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. For the moment at least, it has been rejected by Peter Dutton. It was finalised in July 2018, and will be adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, on 10-11 December 2018 and will be followed by the UNs proposed “2035 agenda for facilitating human mobility.” In the  Migration Compact the folks at the UN are asking our politicians to transfer even more power to them to enable them to generously control our borders for us, and  even control our media. No use wasting money ‘educating’ our children after all, if the media are still telling the truth! And of course, the Global Compact will also seek ‘solutions’ for those displaced from their country because of ‘climate change’.
Julie Bishop’s 2030 Agenda and Malcolm Turnbull’s ‘Environment Pact‘ to Lead to Irreversible UN Controlled Global Law
Most recently the Turnbull government voted to continue to surrender Australian environmental laws to the UN with the  Global Pact for the Environment, which, together with the 2030 Agenda signed by former foreign Minister Bishop, are said to constitute the  pillars of global environmental governance:
“The Global Pact for Environment seeks to create a legal text that, together with the Sustainable Development Objectives adopted at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2015, represents the pillars of global environmental governance… … .In order that this pact becomes reality, it is necessary to fight against climate and environmental insecurity, to cooperate in achieving world environmental law”
 The Global Pact for the Environment is intended to “codify the principles enshrined in the Rio Declaration” and create a “legally binding international instrument under the United Nations… ..to solidify the environmental rule of law around the world and to achieve the  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”
Trouble is,  Article 17 of the Pact introduces the principle of ‘non-regression’, henceforth making it illegal to make any changes which would reduce environmental protections. This includes climate change legislation which would be locked in. And our politicians support this, although the details are still being negotiated and  will be finalised next year.
To the UN they may well be ‘pillars of global environmental governance’. But if our elected representatives in Australia are unanimous about anything, it is the ‘need’ to avoid making this an election issue, and prevent the people from having any democratic vote on these pillars.

by Bob Beatty, Brisbane, Australia
Australia should CLEXIT the Paris accord while the opportunity is still open to us. It is an evil attempt to coerce a free people into an undemocratic collective, otherwise described as a World Government.
Nothing could be better designed to result in widespread anarchy than this proposal. The United Nations must be widely condemned for instigating such a dangerous waste of scarce human resources.
“Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.”
Never has this old idiom been more appropriate than when applied to the fake science of Anthropogenic Global Warming.
The AGW doctrine can only lead to a dangerously weak Australian economy. Australia should support US leadership in this regard, and leave the “Paris Accord” as a matter of urgency, before it does more to undermine our natural energy and pastoral advantages.
“Forests of Wind Turbines are giving useful Wind Power a Bad Name.”
One of the insidious side effects of this AGW scam is the building of inefficient, intrusive wind turbines across wide areas of our land. These blights on the landscape (which produce intermittent unreliable power) give wind power a bad name. As a result, we may eventually “throw the baby out with the bath water”.
It should be remembered that wind power pumped the North Sea out of the Netherlands, it pumps bore water at remote sites, and it powered the ships that discovered and settled Australia.
Technical advances in wind sail technology have provided craft competing in the America’s Cup which travel at speeds up to 2.2 times faster than the wind.
Other wind inspired technology development with which I have been associated, shows wind can be used to drought proof large inland regions, and provide despatchable electric power. See https://principia-scientific.org/wind-into-wine/
The conclusion we can draw from these experiences is that wind associated with water can be a very beneficial association, but wind imposed on Australian base load power supplies is a hugely destructive exercise which can only be justified with large publicly funded subsidies. These policies are a direct result of our “Paris/UN” inspired political collaboration which we must effectively exit as a matter of urgency.

He is very active in the Brexit campaign. http://leavemeansleave.eu
The UK’s political class is being dragged reluctantly towards taking Britain out the EU as the majority of the electorate instructed them to do in the 2016 Brexit referendum.
People power is also asserting itself on climate policy as voters wake up to the facts:

So-called “renewable energy” is expensive and unreliable.
Carbon taxes are unpopular and damage economies.
The largest countries such as the USA, China, India and Russia are not committing to significant real emissions reduction.
There is no convincing evidence that reducing emissions will make a measurable reduction to global surface temperature (even if that was a worthwhile goal).

Researcher Bjorn Lomborg recently published a paper in which he estimates that even using the IPCC’s own inflated formulas that relate global temperatures to atmospheric CO2, economy-crippling reductions in emissions might reduce surface temperature by an unmeasurable 0.02o C to 0.05o C by the year 2100. Meanwhile these emission-reduction rules are killing the economy and inflating electricity prices. Plain common sense tells us that these policies are wasting resources and money.

Moreover, the science is not settled. At the recent Porto Climate Conference, presentations were made by experts on diverse subjects including:

CO2 sensitivity (low),
sea level changes (1.1mm/year globally),
the insignificance of bovine flatulence,
the possibility that it is atmospheric mass which affects surface temperature rather than the percentages of ‘greenhouse gases’ in the atmosphere,
the tragic loss of life in the Grenfell tower inferno which was caused by EU regulations driven by “climate-scare”.

http://portoconference2017.org
In addition, climate policies tied to foreign aid are forcing African people to continue cooking over charcoal and dung because electrical power generation on a large scale is deemed “undesirable”. And while boosting the use of biomass may help “green energy” statistics, it also shortens lives and reduces the ability of African societies to add value to the raw materials they produce. There are also knock-on effects which are driving mass migration.
Climate change is not the problem – climate policy is! We urge all Governments to exit their destructive climate policies.

We did elect Trump to get us out of the Paris Agreement; we did our Clexit, we are trying to hold on to it.  One biggest problem, in the fight against CO2 alarmism is the huge number of Luke-Warmers that say they are on our side. Promoting a CO2 sensitivity that is almost 2 degrees supports the idea that CO2 has a serious role in temperature regulation.  Water, in all of its states, is abundant and water, ice, and water vapor, is the self correcting force that keeps earth temperature in narrow bounds, much more narrow bounds during the recent ten thousand year Holocene.  Climate changes in natural cycles and man does not cause them.

It is clear that the push to meet the Paris carbon dioxide emission targets is leading to higher power costs, and hence prices, and unreliable supply.
It is also a fact that the predictions of the warmists have not happened.
The IPCC scientific reports are stated in possibilities, yet the guidance for policy makers is written as certainty. A farce.
I hope the new leadership of the Australian Government has the courage to guide our country in a rational manner on this subject as Angus Taylor seems keen to do, and abandons the Paris Treaty.

CLEXIT: Canada Must Get Out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
By Dr. Timothy Ball
I am proud to be the Canadian representative for the climate exit (CLEXIT) movement. Canada has more culpability than any other nation in creating and perpetuating the deception. It is not hyperbole to say that Canada was central to creating and mobilizing the false claim of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). The idea that humans were causing runaway global warming originated with the Club of Rome. Formed in 1968 by David Rockefeller, it expanded on the Malthusian idea that the population would outgrow the food supply. The expansion was that world population would outgrow all resources. They made three major assumptions.

The demand for resources would increase every year because the population is increasing every year.
Developed nations increase the demand by using resources at a much greater rate than developing nations.
More nations are changing from developing to developed and accelerating demand.

They produced a few books and reports to substantiate the claims about population and demand. Paul Ehrlich’s 1968 The Population Bomb garnered enormous attention. Less well read but still influential was the 1972 book Limits to Growth by Meadows et al. It used a very primitive computer program that started with two components. The known volume of a resource and the current rate of use. Then, using a simple linear trend, it projected the point at which the resource would run out. It also projected the point at which the volume of the resource use peaked. Another book published in 1977, Ecoscience, Population, Resources, and Environment, influenced policy for a long time because of Paul Ehrlich’s co-author John Holdren. He later became Science Advisor in the Obama White House.

All of this activity developed around an important paradigm shift. These are major changes that occur when a society completely reconsiders the way they see the world and themselves. The two most important in the latter half of the 20th century were feminism and environmentalism. Both were necessary changes, and both went through the same sequence as all shifts. This point is important because anyone who dared to question the deception that humans were causing global warming was accused of not caring about the environment.
A paradigm shift begins, like all things, with an idea. You can call it a hypothesis, a speculation, a ‘what if,’ but it is an idea that asks people to think differently. They don’t occur very often partly because, as philosopher A.N. Whitehead said,
It takes a very unusual mind to undertake analysis of the obvious.
Many ideas are proposed, but few catch on because people are generally afraid of change. They know change occurs, but they also know there are always winners and losers. Since every idea is new, they lack the information and ability to decide. It is simpler to assume they will lose, and it is safer to maintain the status quo.
However, certain ideas are attractive to people who see the potential for power and wealth or both. This was the case with environmentalism. A small group seized the idea of environmentalism and immediately took the moral high ground. Only they care about the Earth, the children, and their future. Most people realized it made sense not to soil your nest but were afraid of the change. How far would or should we go? Since they knew little, it was easy for the power group to marginalize any who dared to question. I recall questions from the media prefaced with the idea that I was “giving comfort” to the polluters. This troubled me until I realized that giving false information and misleading the people was more problematic. Once the public learned that they suffered for change and made sacrifices on false information, it would give greater comfort to polluters.
If the idea has basic merit, as was the case with environmentalism, a majority of the people will adjust and accommodate. They are still unclear about the limits to the idea and its application. Those are identified by the people who started the idea and their disciples. When negative impacts, such as loss of jobs or economic downturn, appear their reaction will define the limit. They either acknowledge that it is a limit, or they become more strident and unreasonable. That is the stage we are at with environmentalism.
The claim that the world was overpopulated was false but was now established as a threat. It fits into the environmentalist paradigm shift because more people could do more damage. The question was what to do about it. There were a very strong anti-capitalism and anti-development agenda behind the idea and therefore the responses.
The overarching environmental theme provided a background to the ideas about overpopulation and exhaustion of resources of the Club of Rome (COR) and culminated in what they called The First Global Revolution set out in a book of the same name. Published in 1991, it was a follow-up and expansion on The Limits to Growth. Here is a quote that typifies the approach and the sentiment.
The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.
At this point, the challenge is to convert ideas to action. It is where most ideas founder. The AGW idea didn’t founder because, unfortunately, a Canadian and member of COR, Maurice Strong, became the pivotal person with the skills to make it happen. 
In 2001, Neil Hrab, a Canadian who spent much time monitoring and reporting on Strong wrote, 
Mainly using his (Strong) prodigious skills as a networker. Over a lifetime of mixing private sector career success with stints in government and international groups…
It began in the 1977 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment Stockholm Conference. Hrab quotes from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists:
The three specific goals set out by the Secretary General of the Conference, Maurice F. Strong, at its first plenary session—a Declaration on the human environment, an Action Plan, and an organizational structure supported by a World Environment Fund—were all adopted by the Conference.
He also noted:
What’s truly alarming about Maurice Strong is his actual record. Strong’s persistent calls for an international mobilization to combat environmental calamities, even when they are exaggerated (population growth) or scientifically unproven (global warming), have set the world’s environmental agenda.
We know how Strong, as a member of the COR, took the ideas and translated them into policy. Elaine Dewar, an investigative journalist, and another Canadian planned to write a book praising Canadian environmentalists. Her research showed that all the people on the list were more corrupt than the people they were attacking. Dewar wrote a book titled Cloak of Green with at least 20 % on Strong that included details on five days with him at UN headquarters.
After those days with Strong at the UN Dewar concluded,
Strong was using the U.N. as a platform to sell a global environment crisis and the Global Governance Agenda.
The overall aim was exploitation of environmentalism, using the secondary issue of global warming. Strong knew that the best way to achieve his goal was through the bureaucrats at the UN and the bureaucrats at every National Weather Office in every UN member nation. He knew what US social commentator Mary McCarthy warned.
Bureaucracy, the rule of no one, is becoming the modern form of despotism.
To McCarthy it was a threat, to Strong it was the potential for total, unaccountable control. He set up the entire COR objective under the organization he created called the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). The overall control of politics and science is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1
The IPCC was critical to creating the science needed to ‘prove’ human CO2 was causing global warming. It was easily achieved by the definition given it by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that limited them to only human causes of climate change. It was at this juncture another Canadian became directly involved. The founding meeting of the IPCC occurred in Villach Austria in 1985 and was chaired by Canadian scientists Gordon McBean. Later McBean became an Assistant Deputy Minister at Environment Canada (EC). In that role, he supervised and directed the department to convince politicians of the legitimacy and accuracy of the IPCC science.
Under McBean, EC became increasingly committed to the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) of the IPCC sending large delegations to their meetings and assigning increasing funding to climate change research. They did this at the expense of maintaining legislated services. Budget overruns drew the attention of the Canadian Auditor General (AG) and activities to increase other sources of funding all drew public attention. For example, from 1997 to 2005 the AG reported EC spent $6.8 billion on climate change, with no results. To pay for this, they diverted funds from other legislated activities. They closed stations and replaced many with Automatic Weather Observing Stations (AWOS). These were so bad that NavCanada, an agency set up to run the airports including the weather stations refused to accept them. It triggered an inquiry by BC Senator Pat Carney that confirmed the problem.
Much of the money EC wasted was on computer models studying AGW that produced terrible results. The EC computer model was one of dozens used in the ensemble of models that the IPCC used to make their projections. Ken Gregory of the Friends of Science group showed that the Canadian model produced the most inaccurate projections of all the models in the ensemble (Figure 2).
Figure 2
The result of all this waste and misdirection is that Canada has fewer weather stations than it did in the 1960s. The weather forecast accuracy has not noticeably improved, especially for severe weather. They continue to waste money on propaganda and attendance at the IPCC meetings – they invariably have the largest delegations at the annual Conference of the Parties meetings (Figure 1). It is time to severely limit all national weather agencies, including EC, to only data collection agencies. All weather forecasting should be done by private agencies, so they will only succeed based on the quality and accuracy of their work. No government agency should be involved in research because the potential for political bias or influence is very high.
The program to create and push the deception that human CO2 was causing global warming was primarily the brainchild and successful because of Canadian Maurice Strong. He applied it in complete form when, in 1992 he became Chairman of Ontario Hydro, the government agency that controlled all energy production in the Province. It destroyed the economy of Ontario taking it from the best performer of all Canadian provinces to one of the poorest.
People are still paying for the damage he did and will for years to come. Fortunately, Ontario voters became additionally angry about this when the Federal government of Justin Trudeau proposed a carbon tax. Now there is open revolt against the carbon tax from major Provincial governments.
In addition to Alberta, the provinces of Saskatchewan and Ontario in mid-July announced an alliance against the carbon tax, which they believe is harmful to the economy. Ontario — Canada’s richest and most populous province — elected a climate-sceptic prime minister in June, who is working to dismantle climate change policies.
Ontario elected a new government and among the first actions Premier Doug Ford took was to seek retirement of the Chairman of the Board of Hydro One (the new name for Ontario Hydro) and ask for the resignations of all Board members. It is a step in the right direction.
Politicians still lack the knowledge about the bad science created principally by Canadians to deceive the world on AGW. They, like the US Senate who rejected voting on the original Kyoto Protocol 95-0 because it damaged the economy and would make virtually no change to global temperatures, are comfortable with the economic argument. Even if you accept the bad science, the cost of reducing global temperature by controlling CO2 is not tenable. They are still afraid of attacks from the eco-bullies. However, a majority are prepared to take an economic stand.
Bjorn Lomborg puts in even more stark terms.
The climate impact of all Paris INDC promises is minuscule: if we measure the impact of every nation fulfilling every promise by 2030, the total temperature reduction will be 0.048°C (0.086°F) by 2100. (His emphasis).
Even if we assume that these promises would be extended for another 70 years, there is still little impact: if every nation fulfills every promise by 2030 and continues to fulfill these promises faithfully until the end of the century, and there is no ‘CO₂ leakage’ to non-committed nations, the entirety of the Paris promises will reduce temperature rises by just 0.17°C (0.306°F) by 2100. 
The bureaucrats at Environment Canada became a major force nationally and internationally in promoting and perpetuating the deception. The government of Canada must use them to take the lead in a return to sanity. It is time to shut them down and CLEXIT from the fiasco, deception, and devastating costs in lost opportunities. It is guaranteed to create bad science when you have scientific bureaucrats. If the evidence shows what thy told politicians were the case, they are not going to risk their job by admitting they got it wrong. As Upton Sinclair said,
It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!
The only role of EC should involve as much data collection as possible made available to anybody who needs it.

Germany’s Energiewende – Lessons for Australia from Germany
In March 2017, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy published a brochure announcing that the Energiewende, its renewable energy revolution, was ‘a success story’.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The Energiewende (Grand Plan) has the goal of making Germany independent of fossil fuels in the long term. Coal, oil and gas were to be phased out, allowing drastic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. However, these goals have not even begun to be achieved.
The Energiewende was only driven forward in the electricity sector, which, accounts for only one-fifth of energy consumption. There were hardly any successes in the heating/cooling and transport sectors.
And so carbon dioxide emissions in Germany have been rising since 2009, even though well over a hundred billion euros have been spent on the expansion of solar and wind energy over the same period. The financial obligations undertaken in the process will continue to burden taxpayers for another two decades and will end up costing German consumers a total sum of around 550 billion euros.
Despite this enormous effort, security of supply is increasingly under threat. At the same time, people and the biosphere are suffering; wildlife protection has become subordinated to climate mitigation, even though the possibility of achieving the goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions is becoming increasingly distant and the measures for the energy transition seem to become more and more questionable from a constitutional point of view.
800 regional associations in Germany commissioned a report on the achievements of the Grand Plan, supported by 24 German experts in all relevant fields.
“In this review we would like to inform a public debate and set out a reasonable course for energy policy in Germany.”
It details stark lessons for Australia. They have produced a very clear readable summary of all aspects of the German electricity disaster.

From: https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/19/paris-climate-agreement-un-pushes-fast-track-ratif/
By Valerie Richardson – The Washington Times – Tuesday, July 19, 2016 
The United Nations has issued a plea for nations to fast-track ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement as some countries are backtracking on support for the deal’s sweeping restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged nations to attend a “special event” Thursday where they may deposit their “instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to the Paris Agreement on climate change.”
“I urge you to accelerate your country’s domestic process for ratification of the Agreement this year,” Mr. Ban said in a statement.

His push for rapid ratification comes amid the increasingly chilly reception for the agreement, adopted by 195 parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, by nations concerned about the impact of the carbon restrictions.
The change of heart even has a name: “Clexit,” short for “climate exit,” a take-off on “Brexit,” the successful June 23 British vote to leave the European Union.
The most dramatic repudiation was from Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, elected in November, who said Monday that he “will not honor” the proposed restrictions on emissions. He called them stupid and cited his country’s need for greater economic development and industrialization.
Developed nations “were enjoying the booming [economy] and flooding the air with contaminants. Now that they are rich because of coal and industrialization, we are being asked to cut emission and limit our activities,” Mr. Duterte said in the Philippine Star.
Meanwhile, U.N. special envoy for climate change Mary Robinson decried Monday what she described as recent efforts by Germany and Britain to support the fossil fuel industry despite their previous support for the agreement.
The British government “introduced new tax breaks for oil and gas in 2015 that will cost U.K. taxpayer billions between 2015 and 2020, and, at the same time, they’ve cut support for renewables and for energy efficiency,” Ms. Robinson told The Guardian newspaper.
“It’s regrettable. That’s not in the spirit [of Paris],” she said. “In many ways, the U.K. was a real leader, and hopefully the U.K. will become again a real leader. But it’s not at the moment.”
Marc Morano, who runs the skeptics’ website Climate Depot, said Tuesday that the cold feet on global warming shows that some countries are realizing the international climate agreement is “not in their best interests.”
“More and more nations are realizing that the U.N. climate treaty is nothing more than an effort to empower the U.N. and attack national sovereignty while doing absolutely nothing for the climate,” said Mr. Morano, who debuted his film “Climate Hustle” during the negotiations in Paris.
He said that the “time has come for a U.S.-led ‘Clexit’ from … the climate treaty.”
President Obama has positioned himself as a strong champion of the accord, which is viewed as a cornerstone of his policy legacy as he prepares to leave office in January.
Under the Paris Agreement, 177 nations and the European Union agreed to set nonbinding limits on their carbon output in an effort to keep global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius.
Since then, 19 countries have ratified the agreement, which goes into effect 30 days after ratification by 55 nations responsible for 55 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
The Obama administration is expected to follow with an executive order before the end of the year, despite objections from Republicans who argue that the agreement is a treaty and therefore must be ratified by the Senate.
The clock is ticking: Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said he will “cancel” the agreement if elected in November.
The website Climate Analytics estimates that 51 countries accounting for 53.28 percent of global emissions are expected to ratify the agreement by Dec. 31, which would fall short of placing the accord into effect.
In Australia, climate skeptics launched what they dubbed the “Clexit” movement after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull participated in a ceremonial signing of the agreement April 22 at U.N. headquarters in New York City.
Signers from 175 nations participated in the ceremony, including U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry.
Mr. Ban said an accelerated ratification for the agreement would “create incentives for early implementation of nationally determined contributions and build support within markets and societies for increased climate ambition.”
“As Ban Ki-moon’s tenure as U.N. secretary-general draws to a close, he is no doubt thinking about his legacy, how history will remember him,” said Eric Worrall in a Monday post on the skeptics’ website Watts Up With That.
“Given the accelerating collapse of political climate enthusiasm across the world, my prediction is Ban Ki-moon will be remembered as the U.N. Secretary General who presided over the downfall of the green movement,” Mr. Worrall said.

Watching Weather Waves, but Missing Climate Tides.
By Viv Forbes, 17 July 2018

The climate alarm media, the bureaucracy and the Green Energy industry follow an agenda which is served by inflating any short-term weather event into a climate calamity. They should take a long-term view.
Earth’s climate is never still – it is always changing, with long-term trends, medium-term reversals and minor oscillations. Humanity is best served by those who use good science to study geology, astronomy and climate history searching for clues to climate drivers and the underlying natural cycles and trends hidden in short-term weather fluctuations.
For the last 10,000 years Earth has basked in the Holocene Interglacial which is the latest of many warm cycles within the Pleistocene Ice Age. There are small warm and cool cycles within the Holocene. Today we enjoy the Modern Warm Cycle (which started about calendar 1900) following the Little Ice Age which bottomed in about 1750.
What does the future hold? The past gives clues to the future.

In every warm era, glaciers retreat, ice sheets melt and sea levels rise. Coastal land, ports and settlements are lost under the rising seas but tundra, grasslands and forests expand. Some corals manage to grow as fast as the seas rise, but others are drowned in deep water. The warmth drives more carbon dioxide from the seas, plants thrive, deserts shrink and humans are well fed.
Then solar intensity wanes, solar orbits change, less solar energy is received by the big northern lands, and the warm Earth radiates more heat to space. It starts cooling.
As Earth enters a cold era, not all of the winter snow melts over summer. The extra snow reflects more solar radiation, leading to even colder winters. The snow-line and the tree-line fluctuate lower, mountain passes are closed, and advancing glaciers threaten mountain villages. Sea ice expands, ice sheets grow, lakes and rivers are frozen, sea levels drop and coral reefs are stranded above the water line. The cooling seas absorb life-giving carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and crops fail; deserts expand, humans suffer poverty and famine, settlements are abandoned, armies march, empires fall and some species disappear.
This has happened many times before and will probably happen again.
But there are clues to the next big phase for Earth’s climate.
Earth has two natural global thermometers which can reveal short and long term trends – the advance and retreat of glaciers, and the rise and fall of sea level.
If glaciers are growing and ice sheets are advancing and getting thicker, it indicates that average global temperature is falling.
Glaciologists have drilled and analysed many of today’s glaciers. They have been surprised to discover that, outside of Antarctica and Greenland, no glacial ice older than 4,000 years has been found. For example, the Fremont Glacier in Wyoming half-way towards the Equator is only a few hundred years old.
Naturally some of these new glaciers can show melting and retreat during long spells of warm weather, but the mere existence of glaciers today where none existed at the peak of the Holocene warming over 3,000 years ago confirms what other studies show – Earth is gradually cooling towards the next Glacial Cycle.
Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) – Temperature Reconstruction – “Falling for 3000 Years” From “The Inconvenient Skeptic” p 115 by John Kehr 2011, http://theinconvenientskeptic.com/
The second natural thermometer is the changing sea level caused by fluctuations in the volume of ice and snow trapped on land, and by the expansion or contraction in the volume of sea water as it warms or cools. Coastal and near-shore locations show much evidence of past and recent sea level changes. In warm eras, glaciers and ice sheets melt, sea water expands, sea levels rise and offshore coral reefs become submerged and drown. Then as peak warming is passed, ice starts to accumulate on land, cooling sea water contracts and sea
levels fall.
Even a moderate cooling event such as the Little Ice Age was sufficient to cause lowering of sea level and stranding of port cities and beaches.

Earth’s natural thermometers are now flashing an amber warning. The long-term trends point to growing glaciers and falling sea level. These warn us that the warm moist bountiful Holocene Era is past its peak. The next chapter in Earth’s History will be a long, hungry, ice-bound era. Only humans who are good at hunting and gathering or have easy access to nuclear power or carbon energy will survive.
Temperature Reconstructions using deep sea sediment cores. (Raymo, 2005) From “The Inconvenient Skeptic” 2011 p42, by John Kehr http://theinconvenientskeptic.com/
People who try to create a “Climate Crisis” out of extreme weather events or short-term climate fluctuations (such as today’s Modern Warm Cycle) are like Lord Nelson – their telescope is applied to the blind eye. They point to the choppy waves from summer storms behind the ship, but fail to see the blizzard approaching on the horizon ahead.

Al Gore was right in one thing – warm cycles coincide with high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The warmth drove CO2 into the atmosphere, and then the cooling oceans removed it again. Carbon dioxide variations are the result, not the cause, of climate changes.
But never once, over eleven warm cycles covering the last million years, have those high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide prevented the onset of the next glacial cycle.
“Carbon Dioxide
Causes Global Warming
Like Wet Roads
Cause Rain.”
Trying to remove or limit atmospheric carbon dioxide is a futile and costly gesture. Even if it were to succeed, by removing plant food from the atmosphere, it would increase the misery of the approaching cold, hungry era.
We may still have warm decades or even centuries ahead. But even when there is a heatwave in autumn, the winter still comes.

Fall is Fading . . . .
And Winter? Winter is Coming!”

No Turbines Turning
At first light this morning (14th July), at our home in Southern Queensland, there was frost on the grass and the chook water was frozen. There was not a breath of wind to turn a turbine, and not a ray of sunshine struck our solar panels.
But at the flick of a switch our stove, electric jug and heaters were energised.
What supplied the power – the old reliables of course – coal, gas and hydro.

https://clexit.net/2018/07/13/paris-accord-based-on-fraud/,clexit-admin,Paris Accord Based on Fraud,"
By Brendan Godwin
The Paris Accord is based on fraud. Carbon Dioxide or CO2 is essential for all life on earth. Without it we are all extinct. There is nothing unusual happing with the globe’s temperatures. No unusual warming. Our interglacial warm period peaked 8,000 years ago and we are cooling. We’ve come to the end of this interglacial and are about to enter the next ice age. Humans can do nothing to stop that. The globe has no temperature control knob, it is impossible for humans to control the globe’s temperature. CO2 does not produce warming. There’s not enough of it to do anything. It is warming that produces CO2. It is impossible for the cause to be the effect. CO2 has lagged temperature by 1,000 years for the past 1 mil years and it has never stopped the earth from entering an ice age, even when it was 4,000 ppm. CO2 is the gas of life. We need more not less of it and we should be regulating for more not less emissions. It is needed to grow our food crops.
Paris is based on IPCC reports. The IPCC rely on their GCM models. None of the models rely on past climate history but rather a mathematical theory based on refuted, negated, fake and fraudulent science. They all incorporate:

A “human fingerprint” or THS (Tropical Hot Spot) on the earth’s climate that doesn’t exist. IPCC’s AR2 report was fraudulently altered to remove scientific reports that were negative of their GHE definition;
Lewis Fry Richardson’s flawed atmospheric model equation;
Michael Mann’s fraudulent hockey stick graph in AR3;
Arrhenius’ flawed hypothesis of the greenhouse effect; Arrhenius invented heat from nothing.
The multiplier effect of water vapor feedback. The flawed CO2 increases water vapor hypothesis based on Arrhenius and the Charney report; From observations, water vapor is decreasing.
A corrupted peer review process.

Then back all this up by fraudulently altering the data to support the failed models that can’t even predict the last 30 years of hindsight.
The money wasted on Paris will do absolutely nothing to the globe’s temperatures and is a waste. Paris is economic vandalism disguised as environmentalism. It is the political agenda of the communist movement. A wealth redistribution scheme to get rich countries to give away money to poor countries with the end goal to destroy capitalism.
The problem with Turnbull is that he only listens to one side of the science, the side that suits him. There are 32,000 real scientists in the NIPCC who dissent from the IPCC. Politicians need to listen to the real science, not the fraudulent science. During the last ice age CO2 levels dropped to 180 ppm. Plants don’t grow with CO2 at 150 ppm or less. That’s our food crops. If we lower CO2 will face human extinction. It is the interglacial warm period that is causing CO2 to be released from the oceans. Only 3% of annual emissions are from humans. We need more not less to starve off human extinction in the next ice age that is about to hit us.

Tony Abbott is right – Australia should quit the Paris Climate Treaty.
China, India, Russia, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia will ignore Paris. USA has already quit and Japan even withdrew from the Kyoto Treaty. Germany will fail to meet its obligations and Poland will not try very hard. France relies heavily on nuclear power and naturally supports imposing Paris handicaps on competitors.
And most of the rest of the world are just hanging in there hoping for a flood of cash from the climate compensation fund or from selling phony carbon credits.
Australia has huge coal, gas, oil and uranium resources. To export these, while we hobble our industries with windmill power, is insane.

A Corollary of the Principle of Uniformitarianism
By Howard Dewhirst, Geologist
This document aims to contextualise the scientific debate concerning Climate Change (CC) and Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW). Examining Earth history, it is indisputable that CC has been operating for many hundreds of millions of years, in cycles that span many different time-scales (millennial-plus to decadal), all without human influence. Understanding the causative factors in past CC provides a solid basis for framing the present debate. AGW is a notion which says that human activities, notably the addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, are causing an increase in the global heat budget. That higher-energy state of Earth’s environment it is argued sets the stage for damaging CC effects. Political and economic decisions have been influenced by this claim. Some of those decisions harm efforts to better the health and welfare of the world’s population, including both the poorest and those who are better off. If the CC and AGW arguments are incorrectly based, as we outline here, there is a need to re-consider those decisions.
CC in Earth History

Paleo-temperature (of atmosphere and ocean) is taken as a proxy indicator of climate, since climate is a complex concept that includes precipitation amounts and patterns, wind, etc whose history and future cannot be extracted or classified in a satisfactory way
Earth’s equatorial region has had a consistent temperature during the climate swings over hundreds of millions of years, but the polar areas have varied, thus altering the pole-to-equator gradient of heat energy, which is the principal driver of climate on the planet
Causes of CC (changes in temperature gradients) are dominated by orbital and solar effects, with added signals from volcanoes (both dust and chemicals), tectonics and plate motions, and biological feedbacks
Oceans (which cover ~70% of the planet) are the main heat reservoir, but with patterns of warmer and colder water distributions that reveal decadal and longer cyclicity that is not understood

Global Warming 



Earth’s temperature has been generally rising since the end of the last ice age, with an apparent acceleration during the last century, but not since
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have also been rising more uniformly, now reaching 410ppm or 0.04% of atmosphere
CO2 has been identified as a ‘greenhouse gas’, based on an argument that it traps and reflects heat
The physics of CO2 heat retention are over-stated, as only a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelengths of heat energies) can be captured by this molecule
Because CO2 concentration is rising and is implicated in global warming, and because CO2 is a by-product of combustion, energy sources from fossil fuels have been demonised – via social and political suppression of their use, and a push towards 100% renewable energy
There are three key challenges to the idea that CO2 is the primary cause of GW:

   Long-term records of CO2 and temperature show good correlation, but the CO2 concentrations lag behind temperature increases by thousands of years. Thus, CO2 increase is the consequence of rising ocean temperature, not the cause
   Numerical models of climate systems, which involve simplifying assumptions and methods that are associated with serious artefacts, consistently fail to ‘predict’ the known past temperature patterns. Such models cannot justify the suppression of hydrocarbon fuels.
   Average temperatures are no longer increasing despite the inexorable rise of CO2





Human activities are not the driver of global warming (or cooling). Earth’s systems are governed by processes that operate over a wide range of time- and length-scales, many of which far exceed the usual scope of human perceptions. The demonization of carbon is scientifically unjustified.

PRESS RELEASE
The Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council in its Comment Calls on President Trump and EPA to Repeal and Not Replace the Clean Power Plan(CPP). 
CHECC CPP ANPRM Replacement Comment Overview FINAL 022718 PDF
 Key Comment Conclusions*: 


CO2 is a Beneficial Gas, not a Pollutant. As a result, the Social Cost of Carbon is Negative since CO2 is so very critical to plant growth and therefore human life.


The 2009 Endangerment Finding must be reconsidered and rescinded/vacated. Thus, the CPP would not be replaced.


All future Federal, State and private sector decisions regarding the Nation’s electric power grid must focus solely on minimizing consumer electricity prices as well as maximizing Grid Reliability and Resilience. No consumer electricity price increases should be permitted by regulators that result from increased Renewables/Energy Storage Grid penetration.


The Current Reconsideration of future vehicle MPG Standards must treat CO2 reduction as a cost, not a benefit, so that only consumer preferences matter, not climate change issues. Currently, with low gasoline price expectations, most consumers prefer trucks & SUVs.


*Based on the Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council (CHECC) Comment in response to EPA’s ANPRM CPP Replacement
CHECC CPP ANPRM Replacement Comment FINAL to EPA 022618 (1)
Filed February 26, 2018

March 24, 2018
The Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council (CHECC) announces that on February 26, 2018 it filed a Comment in response to EPA’s Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) Clean Power Plan (CPP) Replacement. (see 
CHECC CPP ANPRM Replacement Comment FINAL to EPA 022618 (1) ) 
This Comment provided EPA and the Trump Administration with Legal, Climate Science and Energy Economic analysis findings, each robustly supporting the conclusion that EPA should Repeal and Not Replace the Clean Power Plan.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the Legal Analysis: The CPP should not be replaced with anything at all until a lawful, scientifically robust, highly influential scientific assessment (HISA)-compliant positive endangerment finding has been made. The 2009 EF analysis process was fundamentally flawed requiring that it must be rescinded and reconsidered.
Based on the Climate Science Analysis: The scientific basis for the 2009 Endangerment Analysis has been invalidated – in fact, by two separate and distinct analyses. Hence, a GHG endangerment reconsideration is highly unlikely to yield a new endangerment finding. And, thus CPP replacement would have no legal basis and then should not be replaced.

Based on the Energy Economic Analysis: The current Federal, State and private sector policies that are now increasing the fraction of electricity generation from Intermittent Renewables must be stopped/reversed in order to avoid/mitigate very severe micro and macroeconomic impacts and National Security ramifications involving skyrocketing electricity prices as well as dramatically reduced power grid reliability and resilience. The climate science findings suggest that taking such action will have no impact on the climate.

Legal Findings
The legal analysis contained in the Comment is written to satisfy lawyers conversant in “Administrative Law,” but the bottom line is that the 2009 Endangerment Finding, upon which all current CO2 regulation is predicated, was rammed through EPA and the courts and shown in the Comment to have not been carried out consistent with statute law.
 The 2009 Endangerment Finding did not comply with the requirements for highly influential scientific assessments (HISA), and Obama’s endangerment finding supporting the CPP is demonstrated to be grossly deficient. In short, the CO2 Endangerment Finding must be reconsidered because the 2009 finding was not made consistent with easy to understand statute law – a point made to EPA by its Inspector General but ignored by EPA and both the D.C. and Supreme Courts.
The only lawful way to regulate GHG emissions is to prepare a proper, HISA-compliant positive endangerment finding. Until that has been completed, and a lawfully conducted and scientifically robust positive finding returned, the CPP should not be replaced with any regulation at all.
Climate Science Findings
 New research findings now make it all but certain that CO2 is not a pollutant but rather a beneficial gas that should not be regulated. This is because at this point, there is no statistically valid proof that past increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have caused what have been officially reported as rising, or even record setting, temperatures.
 Moreover, new research findings demonstrate that adjustments by government agencies to the Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST) data render that data totally inconsistent with many other published and credible temperature data sets and therefore totally useless for any policy analysis purpose.
Adjustments over time to previously reported official data that imparted an ever-steeper upward trend in the data by removing the natural cyclical temperature patterns previously present in the data. These adjustments have deprived the GAST data from NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU of the credibility required for policymaking or climate modeling. This is particularly true when such data are relied on to drive trillions of dollars in expenditures. 
Finally, it is therefore inescapable that: if the official GAST data from NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU are invalid, then both the ‘basic physical understanding’ of climate and the associated climate models will also be invalid – resulting in tens of billions in wasted climate research funding.
The CHECC Comment also referenced two recent letters to the EPA Administrator from over 85 highly credentialed scientists. They stated as follows: “We the undersigned are individuals who have technical skills and knowledge relevant to climate science and the GHG Endangerment Finding. We each are convinced that the 2009 GHG Endangerment Finding is fundamentally flawed and that an honest, unbiased reconsideration is in order.”
The Comment’s science findings section also presents rebuttals of ten typical climate change alarmists’ claims. The authors of these rebuttals are all recognized experts in the relevant scientific fields. The rebuttals demonstrate the falsity of all ten of the claims merely by citing the most credible empirical data on the topic. The ten now rebutted alarmist claims are as follows:

Heat Waves are increasing at an alarming rate and heat kills.
Global warming is causing more hurricanes and stronger hurricanes.
Global warming is causing more and stronger tornadoes.
Global warming is increasing the magnitude and frequency of droughts and floods.
Global Warming has increased U.S. Wildfires.
Global warming is causing snow to disappear.
Global warming is resulting in rising sea levels as seen in both tide gauge and satellite technology.
Arctic, Antarctic and Greenland ice loss is accelerating due to global warming.
Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are causing ocean acidification, which is catastrophically harming marine life. 
Carbon pollution is a health hazard.

This parade of horrible calamities that the 2009 Endangerment Finding predicts and that a vast program of regulation seeks to prevent have been comprehensively and conclusively refuted by empirical data. The 2009 Endangerment Finding should be rescinded and the Clean Power Plan replaced with nothing at all.
Energy Economic Findings
 The Energy Economic Argument for rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding is that the CPP should not be replaced with anything because increasing the Fraction of Electricity Generation from Intermittent Renewables causes Enormous Consumer Electricity Price Increases and Serious Negative Macroeconomic Impacts. Real world examples in the Comment demonstrate that jurisdictions that have succeeded in increasing the percent of electricity from renewables validate the proposition that the more their power grid relied on renewables, the higher the electricity price -with price increases accelerating as the percent of electricity from renewables gets higher than 20% or so. 
These real world case studies are corroborated by a September 2017 study by IHS Markit, titled  Ensuring Resilient and Efficient Electricity Generation: The Value of the Current Diverse U.S. Power Supply Portfolio  which analyzed the economic effects of state and federal energy policies that are driving electric utilities away from coal, nuclear and hydroelectric and towards renewables and natural gas. Such policies are forecast by IHS Markit to lead to a tripling of the current roughly 7% reliance on wind, solar and other intermittent resources, with natural gas-fired resources supplying the majority of generation. (This assumption now appears optimistic for NG penetration; that is, current trends would favor higher renewable penetration.)
The Study’s Findings are that current policy driven market distortions will lead to the: U.S. power grid becoming less cost-effective, less reliable and less resilient, … Id. at p. 4 (Emphasis added). The study forecasts that these policies will cause a 27% increase in the retail price of electricity.
The following economic impacts of these policies were forecast: 
The 27% retail power price increase associated with the less efficient diversity case causes a decline of real US GDP of 0.8%, equal to $158 billion (2016 chain-weighted dollars). 
Labor market impacts of the less efficient diversity case involve a reduction of 1 million jobs. 
A less efficient diversity case reduces real disposable income per household by about $845 (2016 dollars) annually, equal to 0.76% of the 2016 average household disposable income.” 
Id. at p. 5. (Emphasis added).
It should be noted that the Study’s projected 27% increase in average retail power prices is predicated on the wind and solar renewables share rising by three-fold from 7% to “only” about 21%. The case studies discussed in the Comment make very clear the enormous increases in power prices that would result as policy makers attempt to move the renewables grid penetration higher than that. Moreover, the study found that policies that promote increased use of wind and solar would likely result in little to no reduction in the level of electric sector CO2 emissions. 
 Based on these Energy Economic findings, the CPP should not be replaced with anything because increasing the fraction of electricity generation from Intermittent Renewables will cause (1) enormous consumer electricity price increases, (2) the Grid to become even less reliable and less resilient, and (3) even more serious negative micro and macroeconomic impacts – but would have zero impact on the climate. Based on the Comment’s reported science findings, this would be true whether or not the CPP Replacement managed to significantly reduce U.S. CO2 emissions from any and all sources.

[This English version authorised by Patrick Moore.]

“Arguably, the former environmental activist Patrick Moore is difficult to overcome” – Source: Martin U. K. Lengemann
Patrick Moore once helped to found Greenpeace. Today, the ecologist considers the organization an unscientific lobby group. He has a provocative message: carbon dioxide is not poison. It is good for life on the planet.
The week was not bad for the climate protection movement. France’s head of state Emmanuel Macron had summoned the Climate Chancellor Angela Merkel to the summit in Paris and or emerged with the rank of European “Climate President”. And his plan worked out: UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged that he no longer supports fossil fuels because this would amount to an “investment in destruction”. The World Bank announced that it would stop promoting oil and gas production from 2019 onwards.
With so much international involvement in the fight against CO2, the Greens in Paris missed senior German officials. Merkel was represented by Barbara Hendricks (SPD). From the perspective of green climate politician Annalena Baerbock, the Federal Minister for the Environment only completed an “unmotivated courtesy visit”.
Baerbock’s indignation would certainly have been even greater if she had known which alternative program numerous members of the Bundestag of the Union (CDU) and the FDP had preferred to the Paris climate summit. They had followed the invitation of the Federal Association “Liberaler Mittelstand” to a parliamentary breakfast.
There, Canadian Patrick Moore, one of the founding fathers of Greenpeace, presented his view on climate change, CO2 emissions and energy policy, which – if true – would undermine the foundations of official energy and climate policies. For years, Moore has been one of the archenemies of the world’s largest environmental organization, which he had once brought to the baptism. For today’s activist generation he is the fallen angel of environmental protection.
Carbon dioxide increase did not increase temperature
Nuclear power, genetically modified food, forest conservation, chemicals use, climate change – in almost every major environmental issue Moore represents a view that directly contradicts the Greenpeace policy. In doing so, Moore studied biology, biochemistry and forestry, a doctorate in ecology, and was for years the only trained scientist in the Greenpeace leadership.

German carbon dioxide emissions are rather low by international standards – Source: Infographic The World
Good argument is difficult to master. His quarrels with Greenpeace often end at a high level at a stalemate, statement against statement. Everyone claims that his view of things is the truth. This is how it was when Moore presented diagrams of global temperatures and CO2 concentrations of the last 500 million years to a parliamentary breakfast of about 30 members of the Bundestag.
In another chart, the curves derived from the ice cores of the Russian Antarctic station Vostok, provided no evidence, according to Moore, that the CO2 content in the atmosphere had raised the temperature. On the contrary, he explained to the perplexed MPs: “The CO2 value follows the change in temperature, not the other way around.”
Moore does not deny that the CO2 concentration has risen sharply since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Nor does he shake the fact of global warming. Only he claims that one has nothing to do with the other. The curves of shark attacks and ice-cream consumption also showed a strong correlation, he reveals. “Correlation does not prove causation.”
The Sun’s activity affects the world climate
According to Moore, there are many complex factors that change the climate. Solar activity is part of it, cloud formation and much more. When the earth’s temperature rises, the oceans “emit” more CO2. A rise in carbon dioxide would be the consequence, not the cause of global warming. The basic assumption of many climate scientists that carbon dioxide is the main trigger of global warming is a “hypothesis” for Moore, nothing more.
“There is no definitive scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is responsible for the slight warming of the global climate that has occurred in the last 300 years – since the Little Ice Age,” says Moore. “Such a proof would have been documented – that’s not the case.”
The objection that 97 percent of all climate scientists attribute CO2 to the role of the greenhouse gas does not impress Moore. He refers to a booklet from 1931. The title: “100 authors against Einstein”. With great numerical superiority, scientists attacked the theory of relativity that a young patent attorney named Albert Einstein had published a few years earlier.
Einstein responded as relaxed as Moore today: “If I was wrong, it would be sufficient for a single author to refute me.” the IPCC of the United Nations, the ultimate judge in matters of climate change, certainly does not impress Moore.
Climate council focuses on human influence
His skepticism derives from the statutes of the IPCC: The committee has the mission to explicitly investigate only the human impact on climate change. For the study of the natural causes of climate change, therefore, the IPCC lacks any mandate. This leads to a conflict of interest: If the UN body finds no human cause of global warming, it loses its right to exist.
In any case, because of its composition, the IPCC does not enjoy the confidence of the former Greenpeace chief. The IPCC was founded by the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). According to Moore, “people who care about the weather forecast for the next week” and environmentalists “who focus on daily politics”. That does not indicate competence for the evaluation of the ages of the Earth.
“Why does no one ask geologists, paleontologists, astrophysicists?” After all, the IPCC always expresses only a “concern” about climate change in its progress reports, Moore states. “Greenpeace always makes a disaster out of it”.  Since leaving Greenpeace in 1986, Moore repeatedly accuses the environmental organization of unscientific alarmism.

When Greenpeace was planning a worldwide campaign against the use of chlorine in the 1980s, Moore’s loyalty ended. Chlorine is the eleventh most common element in the earth’s crust, the most important element for public health in human history, and the raw material for countless medicines.
He does not want to force environmental protection at the expense of people. In the environmental organizations, however, the belief has spread that humans are the enemies of the Earth, which he could not support. Moore withdrew himself after 15 years in the Greenpeace peak body. He first became a salmon farmer and then an independent environmental consultant.
He also accepted positions from the nuclear industry and forestry companies in Asia and North America, but he still does not sacrifice his environmental credentials. Although 70, Moore does not expect his crusade against environmental fear mongering is coming to an end anytime soon.
Without CO2, our earth would have long been a dead planet
It annoys him that CO2, the basic building block of all life on earth, is denounced by climate protectors to school classes as a “poison”. Without the gas, Moore said, “our Earth would be a dead planet.”
In the Bundestag he projected graphs on the wall, showing that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been steadily reduced for 150 million years by natural deposition on the seabed and in the earth’s crust.
In primeval times, the amount of carbon dioxide was ten times higher than today’s levels – at the same time there was an explosion of flora and fauna. “Even today, the plants would like to have more CO2,” says Moore, pointing out that “every professional greenhouse farmer fertilizes his plants with CO2 input.”
Concentration approached dangerously low levels
The real drama is not the warming, but the decay of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. From more than 4600 parts per million (ppm) it had dropped to barely 180 ppm during the last glaciation. “This is only 30 ppm above the level at which plants begin to die,” says Moore. This was only 18,000 years ago, a geological blink of an eye. It is largely due to the burning of fossil fuels by humans, that the CO2 content has increased again to about 400 ppm today.
If man were to support natural CO2 reduction and ban fossil fuels, “life on earth would be over in less than two million years,” claims Moore. “The fact is that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been dropping to a dangerously low level for a very long time”.
“Human combustion of fossil carbon sources helps restore a balance to the global carbon cycle,” says Moore. More carbon dioxide would contribute to more plant growth, more trees and larger food harvests.
Climate goals risk Germany’s prosperity

Germany is missing its climate goals by miles. From an economic point of view, it is impossible to live up to the promises made by the government for CO2 reduction by 2030. This results from a calculation from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  If the analysis of the former Greenpeace leader is correct, it would undermine the basis of an energy policy that derives its legitimacy from mainstream climate science. A layman may wish for open discussion in the face of such a fundamental dispute. But such a serious discussion is not expected in today’s political climate.
The climate “scientists” had already declared their knowledge before the summit in Paris was completed: The climate debate is finished. A dictum that makes Moore quite certain that “in the best scientific tradition, skepticism is almost mandatory.”

Solar power only works while the sun shines – it is part-time power.
Wind power only works when suitable winds blows – also part-time power.
Batteries only work when charged – part-time power again.
Hydro fails in droughts – more part-time power.
And using full-time power like gas to fill the inevitable supply gaps from part-time power forces backup gas to operate like part-time power.
Moreover, on sunny windy days, wind and solar generators spew out electricity at little extra cost. These erratic surges of part-time power drive short-term electricity prices so low that even low-cost full-time producers like coal cannot operate profitably at those times. They are throttled back and forced to operate as yet another part-time power plant.
24/7 electricity users such as hospitals, trains, factories, refineries, fuel and water pumps, cash registers, infrastructure and mines cannot operate on part-time electricity.
Moreover, every part-time power producer (using sun, wind, batteries, hydro, gas or coal) consumes money full-time for operations, standby, maintenance and replacement. Each also has to fund its own specialised generators, transmission lines, access roads and workforce. Electricity becomes both unreliable and expensive, and consumers suffer.
Using taxes, subsidies, dictates and mandates to replace a full-time power producer like coal with up to five part-time power producers only makes sense in the part-time minds that inhabit Greentopia.
Canberra cannot improve any of this with more laws and regulations – they must REPEAL all the legislation, regulations, subsidies and taxes that created the mess in the first place. State governments too should repeal their silly energy laws, and stop shutting and destroying power stations. More laws and regulations can only make things worse.

Canberra, with its “zero emissions” target, yearns to be Australia’s greenest address.
Good. Let’s use them as a full-blown test of “zero emissions” before we all jump over that cliff.
Canberra passes thousands of laws for us. If their zero emissions dream is fair dinkum, they need to pass just three laws for themselves.
First, ban all petrol, diesel and gas-powered trucks, cars, boats, generators and aeroplanes from Canberra. That should remove emissions from their atmosphere, food from their supermarkets, and leave their roads free for pedestrians and bicycles. Idle airport runways would be ideal sites for solar panels and wind turbines.
Second, prohibit the importation of electricity generated by coal or gas – they can demonstrate how to survive on wind, solar, hydro, batteries and fire-wood. They should work at home using bees-wax candles on cloudy windless days.
Third, introduce a CCT (Canberra-carbon-tax) whereby all carbon dioxide emitted elsewhere in the production and transport of imported cement, steel, aluminium, bitumen, timber, vehicles, bicycles, solar panels, wind turbines, fire wood and food is charged to ACT end users.
If people flock into emissions-free Canberra we know that this is the way for Australia. But if there is a mass exodus, it will signal that the policy is a failure.
Let’s test the convictions of Canberrans.

Once upon a time Australia was attractive to processing, refining and manufacturing industries using our abundant mineral and food resources, our reliable low-cost coal-fired electricity and a workforce trained in technical skills.
No longer.
Australia used to have 11 oil refineries, spread around the country. There are just 4 left, all over fifty years old, and all in danger of closing down. Green barriers to oil exploration have forced most of them to rely on costly imported crude oil.
We buy our jet fuel from North Asia and have just 19 days supply of aviation fuel in the country. Australia’s diesel supplies sometimes fall to just 13 days of consumption.
Now, for the first time in at least 60 years Australia no longer produces motor vehicles.
China and India have about 430 coal power plants under construction but Australia has not built a single coal-fired power station for seven years – some politicians even rejoice when they manage to close and demolish one.
Brisbane’s new trains are being made in India, Victa mowers are made in China and most coastal shipping died decades ago. Steel works and refineries producing aluminium, copper and zinc are under stress. All these industries are being pushed overseas by costly unreliable electricity and other government barriers and burdens.
Red-green policies being pushed by all major parties are making Australia more dependent on bolted-down industries such as mining and farming that can’t be sent overseas because their basic resources are here. And green opposition to nuclear power increases Aussie reliance on coal.
A century ago Australians relied on wool, wheat, gold, silver, copper, lead-zinc, butter, beef and timber – all products of bolted-down industries.
Red-green policies are pushing us back to those days. Politicians need to remember Newton’s Law of Bureaucracy – whenever the government tries to use the force of law to achieve economic goals the long term results will be equal and opposite to those intended.
So in the long run, red-green energy and environmental policies will make us more dependent on the bolted-down industries they now attack – mining, farming, forestry and fishing.

Open Letter to Honorable Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23, Frank Bainimarama
Nils-Axel Mörner and Pamela Matlack-Klein
Mr. President,
The community assembled at the COP23 meeting in Bonn badly wants temperature to rise according to models proposed (but never verified, rather seriously contradicted) and sea level changes that may pose serious flooding threats to low lying coasts provided sea level would suddenly start to rise at rates never recorded before (which would violate physical laws as well as accumulated scientific knowledge over centuries).
We have been in your lovely country and undertaken a detailed sea level analysis, which beyond doubts indicates that sea level is not at all in a rising mode, but has remained perfectly stable over the last 50-70 years. Hence all threats of an approaching general sea level flooding is totally unfounded.
Whatever economy, politics and project agendas may want to put in the centre, the true scientific community must insist that only facts as revealed in nature itself and in laboratory experiments can provide trustworthy results.
These are the facts:

Sea level has remained virtually at the present level over the last 200 years
In the last 50-70 years sea level has remained perfectly stable in Fiji
This stability is indicated by the growth of corals (stopped to grow vertically, and forced to grow laterally into microatolls) – and corals do not lie

Questions for Jacinda [Ardern, leader of New Zealand’s Labour Party], the Greens and any other political zealots talking about reduction of “carbon” emissions, by which I guess they mean the trace gas carbon dioxide (CO2) that currently, at 400 ppm represents 0.04% of Earth’s atmosphere from all sources, natural and human-induced.
How do they propose to deal with (a) human emissions of CO2 when each of us exhale, estimated at around an average of 1 kg per day; (b), emissions from volcanoes both above and below the oceans: (c), emissions from sedimentary basins; the combination of which of which greatly exceed CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels in our cars and elsewhere, and from flatulent animals?
And what allowance will they make for the extent to which CO2 as nature’s fertiliser has greened the Earth by an observed 14% since 1979 when satellites gave us the ability to see and measure such changes. For New Zealand alone, an increase of 300 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere is estimated to increase our pasture production by some 30 per cent, and raise our pastoral sector earnings from their current $28 billion by $8 billion, without taking into account similar productivity gains in horticulture and viticulture.
While they’re at at, will one of them quote just one scientific paper, prepared in the recognised scientific method that proves that emissions of CO2 can or do cause variations in the global climate beyond the range of historically recorded observations. No one, anywhere in the world has yet done so.

By Jim Rust.
Many climate alarmists claim 97 percent or more climate scientists state carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is causing global warming. I tell them it is not worth discussing this issue. Anyone can create useless statistics to support their arguments. Simply interview people who agree with you.
If you go back to the 1600s, I could say 100 percent of scientists said the earth was the center of the universe and the sun revolved around the earth. Galileo Galilei dissented from this theory and was tried for heresy by the Catholic Church. In order to save his life, on June 22, 1633, Galileo Galilei recanted his published theory that stated the sun was the center of the world and the earth was not. Galileo lived in house arrest the rest of his life.
This shows the argument of force using claims of majority thinking are worthless and should not be used in debates about global warming (climate change). Similarly, “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.” – Albert Einstein quotes from BrainyQuote.com.

Last Thursday, President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord, which the Obama administration initially agreed to in 2015. Environmental activists are lambasting his decision, but should they?
In his new book, Clexit for a Brighter Future: The Case for Withdrawing from the United Nations’ Climate Treaties, energy expert Donn Dears explains why the answer is a resounding “No!”
The purpose of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to “achieve … stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Dears describes the impossibility of cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions enough to slow or stop climate change.
The international environmental left is living in a fantasy world, and the United States should leave them there by withdrawing from the UNFCCC, a 1992 treaty with a clear “clexit” clause. The treaty was based on the theory that human emissions of CO2 cause global warming. Since that theory falls apart under scrutiny, Dears concludes, “The UNFCCC treaty is, essentially, a fraud.”
Clexit, a follow-up to Dears’ Nothing to Fear, succinctly and systematically explains, with ample facts and sound logic, why participating in a failed treaty is immoral and economically disastrous.

https://clexit.net/2017/06/01/dear-mr-president-please-exit-paris/,clexit-admin,Dear Mr. President: Please Exit Paris,"
From Paul K. Driessen and Mark J. Carr.
Dear Mr. President: Please Exit Paris 
Are you are still wondering whether to Exit Paris? Overseas and US officials, environmentalists and bureaucrats urge you to Remain. But you promised voters you would Exit. Please keep your promises. 
Exit Paris isn’t about the environment. It’s about letting us utilize our fossil fuel energy to create jobs, rebuild our economy, and Make America Great Again. It’s about avoiding immense transfer payments from the USA to foreign governments, bureaucrats and parties unaccountable to Trump-voting taxpayers. 
Worse, even if the USA Remains, and the repulsive payments flow, Paris offers no help in removing real air pollutants. Carbon dioxide isn’t one of them, by the way: it’s plant food, not poison.
Exit Paris: Business
Some high profile American companies recently signed a note urging Remain. Follow the money. Many leaders of those companies didn’t support your election and voted Hillary. And they expect to get billions from us taxpayers and consumers, for locking up our fossil fuels and switching to renewable energy. 
We who voted Trump, your base, want Exit. Just as you promised. 
Remain, so that we maintain markets for American energy technologies? Some companies will make off like bandits. The rest of us will get skewered. Global buyers of energy systems understand the benefits of America’s world-beating fossil technologies. They understand the life-cycle value of after-sales support poorly delivered by our international competitors. Trust Chinese warranties? We don’t either.

Why ask corporations about Remain or Exit Paris? They pass Remain-driven energy costs on to consumers. Instead, ask consumers about ever-increasing energy bills. You’ll get a different answer. 
Corporations have shareholders in the USA, of course, and some of them elected you. But corporations also have European shareholders. Corporations there must survive political economies aligned with Paris’s unaccountable bureaucratic control of energy, jobs, economic growth and living standards. You have to choose: shareholders, entrepreneurs, consumers and families – or rent seekers and bureaucrats. 
Renewable energy lobbyists, Obama holdovers – and misguided souls in your own administration – say Remain, to keep a seat at the table. That’s nonsense. Businesses were flogged by the past administration and no longer recognize their obligations to shareholders, much less to societies they are supposed to serve with reliable, affordable power that creates and preserves jobs. 
Those companies responded to incentives in a massively hostile American political economy. Those hostilities represent decades-long campaigns by anti-energy groups that got rich while claiming to represent shareholders, and by foreign governments seeking transfer payments. You promised change. 
Exit Paris: Group of Seven
Mr. President, you’ll be pressured mightily at the G7 to Remain Paris. Hugely-invested and conflicted world leaders will give you no peace. Your delegation will hound you. Keep your Exit staff close. Why? 
Because America got snookered into signing the Arctic Council’s May 11, 2017, Fairbanks Declaration. Now the same pro-Remain forces will claim America wants that language. What language? 
Start with Perambulatory Paragraphs 8 & 9: “Reaffirming the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the need for their realization by 2030.” And this: “U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 13.a: Implement the commitment undertaken by developed country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible.”
They want to take our money, while they shackle our economy. But there’s more. 
Paragraph 31 (p. 6): “…we welcome the updated assessment of Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic, note with concern its findings, and adopt its recommendations.…The Arctic states, permanent participants, and observers to the Arctic Council, should individually and collectively lead global efforts for an early, ambitious, and full implementation of the Paris COP21 Agreement….”
Your State Department Obama-carry-overs slipped this one past their boss, Secretary Tillerson – and you, by extension. This is where the real art of the deal comes in. Take a leadership role and terminate this. Don’t get sandbagged. Don’t sandbag the people who voted for you. Resist the pressures you’ll face in Sicily. Anything but Exit Paris undermines your credibility and betrays voter trust and America’s future. 
Exit Paris: Diplomacy
One reason cited to Remain Paris and Remain UNFCCC and their climate treaties is to “avoid diplomatic blowback.” There certainly will be that, but it’s a cost far more easily borne than the sum of what we paid yesterday and will be told we must pay tomorrow in lost energy, jobs and money. Follow the money: 
Emerging nations want the USA to Remain because they expect billions in cash from us every year – plus free technology transfers – at US corporate, taxpayer and consumer expense. Advanced countries want us to Remain because we will inadvertently fund and sign onto programs that they use to seize ever-greater bureaucratic control over energy, resources, jobs and living standards, within their own borders and ours. 
The Chinese want us to Remain because it protects access to our market for energy technologies. Do you believe Chinese press releases and speeches that claim they are switching massively to renewable energy? Neither do we. But we see them building more coal-fired power plants in China, Africa and elsewhere. 
Europeans want us to Remain in Paris to ensure that our fossil fuels, energy prices, economy, jobs, living standards and ability to compete globally are as shackled by climate insanity as theirs already are. 
Some say Remain Paris for a seat at the table. Will the planet otherwise forget American leadership? Better that the deal crumbles without us making huge transfer payments and shackling our economy. Even better is that you lead America and the world back from the climate hysteria precipice. 
Anti-America, anti-energy forces unite at the UN and its UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Its director, Ambassador Espinosa of Mexico, spoke recently at Georgetown University – to advocate greater bureaucratic control over energy, natural resources, jobs, living standards and human lives. The past administration was in lock-step with this. You should absolutely be against every part of it. 
Exit Paris: Science
Paris is a horrible idea, since unassailable empirical evidence demonstrates that: Carbon dioxide makes plants grow faster and better. Atmospheric CO2 levels trail rather than lead warming. Water vapor is a much more potent greenhouse gas. Thanks to carbon dioxide, agricultural productivity has increased over recent decades by over $3.2 trillion. Scientists project up to $10 trillion more in improved crop yields over the coming decades. 
Climate science is absolutely not settled. Smart scientists who support you prove there’s no credible path to climate cataclysm due to fossil fuel use and CO2 increases. Doomsayers have gotten rich by peddling false, alarmist, anti-scientific claims, while the rest of us have suffered. This must not continue. 
To support Exit Paris, you should reverse the absurd, scientifically unsupportable claim that carbon dioxide “endangers” our welfare. Doing that will substantially remove the ability of subsequent administrations to restore policies that demonize fossil fuels and CO2. Many of the policies addressed and corrected by your recent environmental Executive Order are vulnerable until the endangerment finding disappears. Much of the mischief and job killing of the last eight years can be laid at that doorstep. 
Exit Paris, because even outgoing EPA officials admit it will not noticeably affect Earth’s temperature. 
Exit Paris: US Politics
Paris intentionally provides for ever-tightening restrictions on American citizens and businesses – thus far with no vote by us or the Senate. Who rewrote our Constitution to allow a president, in his final days in office, to impose such a far reaching treaty on us without our advice, consent, approval or vote? 
If you need Exit support of fellow elected officials or a constitutional avenue, submit Remain Paris to the Senate. The measure will crash on that rocky shore, giving you all the support you need to Exit Paris. 
Your voters heard you promise to Exit Paris. The support you still enjoy from your voters is because we see that you are keeping your promises. Keep this one, too, Mr. President. 
Please Exit Paris. Those who voted for you will remember and approve. Those who detest and resist you will still detest and resist you if you Remain. 
Thank you for considering our heartfelt analysis. 
Sincerely, 
Paul K. Driessen and Mark J. Carr

The Senators warn that, “Because of existing provisions within the Clean Air Act and others embedded in the Paris Agreement, remaining in it would subject the United States to significant litigation risk that could upend your Administration’s ability to fulfill its goal of rescinding the Clean Power Plan.  Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to make a clean break from the Paris Agreement.”
“Leading environmental attorneys have been candid that they intend to use the Paris Agreement and the existing endangerment finding to force EPA to regulate under Section 115 of the Clean Air Act.”
Today the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a prohibition on the President’s ban on travel from nations he considers terrorist risks.  The federal judiciary has proven its willingness to thwart the President’s executive authority with a heavy hand.
Making a “clean break” from the Paris Agreement is the sure-fire way to prevent the courts from doing the same to thwart the President’s energy policy.

https://clexit.net/2017/05/25/nix-paris-agreement/,clexit-admin,The Case for Nixing the Paris Agreement,"
By William Happer
The United States should withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. For too long, well-meaning policymakers have been misled by propaganda, masquerading as science, that more atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) will harm the planet. Paris represents the culmination of this campaign. The pact extends into perpetuity, its very terms dispensing with the value of the supposedly previous “seat at the table.” For this and many other reasons, the time to withdraw is now.
Real pollutants from fossil fuel combustion, such as oxides of sulfur, nitrogen and fly ash, are rightly controlled, and by cost-effective technology. But more CO2 is not a pollutant but is a benefit to humanity. The “social cost of carbon,” aka CO2, is negative. It is immoral to prevent developing countries from using reliable, inexpensive fossil fuels to escape centuries of poverty.
Most developing countries have offered no plans to limit CO2 emissions any time soon, rhetoric about Paris’ universal inclusivity notwithstanding. Without their cooperation, stabilizing atmospheric levels of CO2 is not possible, nor would this stop climate change if it could be done. Climate has been changing since the Earth was formed — some 4.5 billion years ago — according to geological evidence. Climate changes on every time scale — decades, centuries, millennia and even longer periods.

The climate of Greenland really was warm enough for farming around the year 1100, and the Little Ice Age really did drive Norse settlers out of Greenland by the year 1500. Like these changes, the very minor warming we have had over the past few centuries is mostly from non-human causes.
Each human exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day from simply being alive. Living creatures, humans, animals and plants are largely made of carbon. Carbon dioxide is essential to the growth of plants. By the standards of geological history, plants have been coping with a CO2 famine for several tens of millions of years. Satellites already show dramatic greening of the Earth as CO2 levels begin recovery toward their historical norms. These were measured in thousands of parts per million (ppm), not today’s puny 400 ppm.
CO2 is indeed a greenhouse gas, but much less important than the major greenhouse gas, water vapor (H2O) and clouds. Observations show that doubling CO2 will warm the Earth’s surface by around 1 degree Celsius. At the current rate of increase of CO2, it will take more than a century to double. Twice as much CO2 and a modest 1 degree Celsius warming would benefit the world in many ways, extending growing seasons for agriculture, increasing crop yields, and lessening human mortality, which increases in cold weather. And modest warming means that there will also be no dangerous increase in sea levels.
Climate policy, however, poses a grave threat. Yes, those who engineered the Paris Agreement will be upset if the United States withdraws. Withdrawal will also outrage the many who profit from climate alarmism. But remaining in the Paris Agreement will not sit well with many of those who voted for Mr. Trump in part because of his campaign promises to withdraw from the agreement. These voters rightly perceived that the agreement would benefit a privileged international elite, at the expense of the common people of the United States and of the rest of the world.
We should learn from this experience. After withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the United States should commission a national red-team/blue-team review of the basic science of climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) might have played this important role, but its leadership was quickly captured by political operatives, determined to support climate alarmism, even when this was at odds with the findings of honest scientists who wrote technical parts of IPCC reports.
“Heretical,” off-message science has been ruthlessly suppressed to reassure policymakers that they had the backing of “97 percent” of the scientific establishment. It is time to do an honest job on the science of climate.
Regarding policy, Americans never felt compelled to sign up for international folly in the past. We should once again show leadership and walk away from the Paris Agreement.

By Viv Forbes, Secretary of the Clexit Coalition
The Clexit Coalition today called on President Trump to keep his election promise to withdraw from the Paris Climate Treaty and stop US payments to all UN global warming programs.
The Clexit (ClimateExit) Coalition, comprising over 175 representatives from 25 countries, aims to prevent ratification or local enforcement of the UN Paris climate treaty.
See: http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit-members.pdf
The Secretary of Clexit, Mr Viv Forbes of Australia, said that all nations will suffer from the destructive energy policies being promoted in the UN’s war on cheap, reliable hydro-carbon fuels and the backbone industries that rely on them – mining and smelting, farming, fishing, forestry, processing and manufacturing.

He was supported by Professor Will Happer, Professor of Physics at Princeton University who said today:
“Americans never felt compelled to sign up to international folly in the past. I hope the United States once again shows the common sense of its people and walks away from the Paris Agreement.”
Dr Willie Soon of Clexit USA, an astro-physicist and climate author, added:
“There is no free energy in the real world. All world leaders, not only President Trump, should stop promoting the empty game of energy poverty and deaths.”
Dr Tim Ball, the Regional Director of Clexit Canada, said:
“President Trump knows he must keep the promises made at his public rallies. For example, he made the commitment to get out of Paris in his Harrisburg Pennsylvania speech:
https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4667776/president-trump-remarks-harrisburg-pennsylvania
“This includes deals like the one-sided Paris Climate Accord, where the United States pays billions of dollars while China, Russia and India have contributed nothing and will contribute nothing.”
Mr Forbes said that the war on natural hydro-carbon fuels is denying the poorest people and nations of the world the chance of better paying jobs, cheaper energy and more abundant food.
“There is no justification for the War on carbon dioxide – CO2 does not drive global temperature and Earth’s climate cannot be tweaked by erecting windmills or putting taxes on carbon dioxide. CO2 is naturally sequestered by oceans and the biosphere. Burning natural hydrocarbons merely recycles Earth’s carbonaceous nutrients vital to all life – already world food production and global forests have benefitted from the small increases in carbon dioxide plant food in Earth’s atmosphere.
See: World forests just grew 9%:
http://mailchi.mp/thegwpf/good-news-planet-earth-covered-in-much-more-forest-than-thought
“President Trump promised to exit the Paris Treaty, but he also needs to de-fund and exit all UN climate control bureaucracies.
“Tom Harris of the Canadian-based International Climate Science Coalition has said that the President needs to dig up the roots of Paris – the UN Framework on Climate Change signed by President H. W. Bush and others in Rio in 1992.
See: http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/08/killing-the-paris-agreement-is-not-enough/
“The root mass of every weed is as big as its branches. Everyone knows that pruning weeds just encourages more growth from the energised roots. All people who value freedom and prosperity must eradicate the UN Climate weeds, roots and all.

“Clexit members around the world look to President Trump to add his weight to the growing momentum to withdraw from the Paris Climate Treaty and the Rio UN FCCC, and to de-fund all bodies responsible for planting these climate industry weeds.”
(Apologies to those who may oppose other policies of Donald Trump, but on climate and energy he is spot on and deserves support.)

https://clexit.net/2016/11/04/grasslands/,clexit-admin,The Battle for our Grasslands and Livestock,"
By Viv Forbes, Albrecht Glatzle and others
Grasslands and arable land cover just 10% of Earth’s surface but (with the oceans) they produce all of our food and fibre. But the productivity and health of our grasslands, farms and livestock are under threat from global warming alarmists and green preservationists.
We are afflicted by climate crazies and methane madness. It is poor public policy that condones restrictions on grazing operations, or taxes on grazing animals, based on disputed theories that claim that bodily emissions from farm animals will cause dangerous global warming.
New Zealand was the first cattle country to propose a “livestock fart tax”. Four hundred farmers then drove 20 tractors to the Parliament in Wellington waving placards and banners saying “STOP THE FART TAX”. The proposal was laughed out of Parliament. But the war on farmers and livestock continues.

Permission is given to reproduce this cartoon providing the source (www.clexit.net) is credited.

Ruminants such as sheep, cattle and goats cannot make long-term additions to the gases in the atmosphere – they just recycle atmospheric carbon and nitrogen nutrients in a cycle-of-life that has operated for millennia.
Grazing ruminant animals with their emission products have always been part of healthy grasslands. Only when large numbers of animals are fed artificially and confined on the one patch of land do pollution problems appear.
Many otherwise genuine environmentalists are assisting the destruction of grasslands with their native pastures and endangered grass birds. Blinded by their love for the trees, they neglect the grasses, legumes, herbs and livestock that provide their food. In Australia they pass laws to protect weedy eucalypts invading the grasslands but ignore the valuable and declining Mitchell grass that once dominated Australia’s treeless plains.
Grasslands are also under threat from cultivation for biofuel crops, from subsidised carbon credit forests and from the remorseless encroachment of fire-prone government reserves and pest havens.
Trying to control atmospheric carbon-bearing gases with taxes is futile and anti-life. Even if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere doubled, or more, the climate effect if any, is probably beneficial (warmer at night and near the poles and with more moisture in the atmosphere). More importantly, all life on Earth already benefits from the additional CO2 plant nutrient in the atmosphere, and would benefit even more were CO2 levels to double.
Nitrogen is the most abundant natural gas in the atmosphere, inhaled in every breath and an essential component of all protein. Grazing livestock merely recycle a few compounds of nitrogen, all of which either return to the atmosphere or provide valuable nitrogen fertilisers for the plants they graze on.
We also have the modern methane madness. Mobs of grazing ruminants have been roaming the grasslands since cave-man days. Methane has also been seeping from marshes, bubbling out of oceans, leaking from coal seams and oil seeps and being released in huge quantities from volcanoes. So what more can a few domestic cows and sheep do to affect this? Methane from domestic ruminants is a non-problem.
It is a foolish and costly fantasy to believe that Earth’s climate can be controlled by passing laws, imposing taxes, attempting to manipulate the bodily emissions of farm animals or trying to prevent farmers from clearing woody weeds invading their pastures.

by Terence Cardwell
http://blackjay.net/?p=365
This is NOT a once off event- it will happen again in the not too distant future and continue to do so.
Why? Because of the continual instability created in the grid system by the constantly changing wind generators and the reliance of power from Victoria, who have to continually get them out of their insane situation.
Any change in power generation from the wind generators has to be compensated for and chased by thermal power generation units which decreases their efficiency substantially and more than obviates any gain from wind generators. These severe load changes can create a power wave within the grid system that causes instability as the thermal units try to match the wind generators’ severe load changes.
Because the winds were so severe the wind generators would already have been non-operative and locked. So that 40% of the power was already out of service before the blackout. If the wind generators were allowed to operate in such severe winds they would have torn themselves apart.
So YES the wind generators DID cause the blackout by increasing the load substantially on the Victoria to S.A. interconnector.

It is the first time in the history of power generation in Australia that transmission towers have fallen over and we have seen far more severe weather than the S.A. storm. (I have personally operated units in such weather with no blackouts or instability in the grid system even though we lost two units. One of them being mine. The unit transformer was hit by a 20ft sheet of roofing aluminium torn of in the storm.)
Even though the towers had collapsed the grid system should not have gone out because the line protections covering those towers would have tripped within 6 cycles i.e. one tenth of a second, isolating them from the grid and protecting the rest of the grid system.
The hypocrisy of the South Australian Government is unbelievable. Because they had knocked down their black bituminous coal fired thermal power stations they had insufficient power. So then they had to import it from Victoria through the state interconnector which was never intended for that purpose. When the interconnector exceeded its maximum load capacity, it tripped, as it was supposed to do.
Guess where the imported power is generated? Yes Victoria—but where? The brown coal fired thermal power stations that have a thermal efficiency half of that of the black coal fired power stations that South Australia decommissioned to pander to the Greens.
The average price for electricity in South Australia with its 40% renewable energy is over $300 per megawatt hour. The average cost of electricity in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania is around $80.00 per megawatt hour.
To those gullible people who are so passionate about  ‘clean energy’ you can expect similar prices in the other states should they adopt South Australia’s renewable energy program.
Terry Cardwell worked for 25 years for the Electricity Commission of NSW working, commissioning and operating the various power units. His last commission was at the Munmorah Power Station near Newcastle, with four, very large, 350 MW power generating units. He blogs at http://terrycardwellsblog.blogspot.com.au/

By Daniel W. Nebert.
Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. — John Adams, December 1770; in “Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials”
By Daniel W. Nebert
Concerned about “global warming” and “climate change,” the European Union has been far ahead of the United States in solar- and wind-energy development. But — economically — how have they fared? The answer is: Not so well. In fact, not good at all.
Denmark has been the EU leader in renewable energy. In 2012, the Danish Parliament agreed politically to 50 percent of energy consumption from wind power by 2020, 84 percent by 2035.
The Danish government has now completely changed its mind. In recent months, it decided to abandon plans to build five offshore wind power farms — to be functional by 2020. Denmark realized its green policies have become too expensive to maintain.
Danish consumers and companies pay the highest electricity prices within the EU, according to Eur electric, the European Electricity Association. In 2014, 66 percent of an average Danish electricity bill went to taxes and fees; 18 percent went to transportation, and only 15 percent for the electricity itself. (Germany was second highest, with 52 percent in electricity taxes.) The Danish climate minister recently stated: “We can’t accept this, as the private sector and households are paying far too much. Denmark’s renewable policy has turned out to be too expensive.”
It has become obvious that all the green energy plans mandated to reduce EU emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) will not achieve substantial reductions. In some cases, the actions are actually making matters worse.
A serious examination of successful and failed introductions of technology… might teach us some lessons.

For example, in spite of the combined EU governments’ spending over the past decade — more than 1 trillion euros of taxpayer money on “Green Subsidies” — CO2 emissions in the EU have actually risen. In 2015, CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion increased by 0.7 percent, compared with 2014. In Germany alone, CO2 emissions increased by an estimated 10 million tons from 2014 to 2015, a setback to that nation’s claims of “climate leadership.”
According to the Institute of German Business, the cost of Germany’s once highly publicized Energiewende (its transition to green energy) will increase — in 2016 alone, another 31 billion euros (or $35 billion in U.S. dollars). This will further weigh down the already sputtering German economy.
Last year, Germany actually paid wind farms $548 million to close down to prevent damage to the nation’s electricity grid. Germany’s wind and solar power systems, at unpredictable times, had provided too much power, which then damaged the grid and made the system more vulnerable to blackouts.
RWE AG (founded in 1898 as Rhine-Westfalia Electricity plant, in Essen) is the second largest electricity producer in Germany. Over the past decade it has invested heavily in renewable energy. That company is now g oing bankrupt, showing 45 billion euros in long-term liabilities. This has resulted in rating agencies dropping RWE bonds to just above the “Junk” level.
Part of the reason for “Brexit” in the U.K. has to do with citizens’ concerns about fiscal responsibil ity. Indeed, in order to work on balancing the budget, the new Prime Minister Theresa May has disbanded the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Similar governmental actions have recently occurred in Australia. It has become obvious that green energy cannot be sustained without long-term government subsidies. Renewable energy costs in this sense can be thought of as a regressive tax, felt most by society’s poorest. And the poorest countries.
Agriculturists are aware that plants today are 25-percent “carbon-starved”; the plants would benefit from several times more atmospheric CO2 than what now exists. Climatologists dispute that CO2 is correlated with global warming. Realistically, the goals of attempting to decarbonize the world are without precedent in human history and must be examined closely. And rationally.
A serious examination of successful and failed introductions of technology over the past 200 years might teach us some lessons. Perhaps Americans, especially Oregonians, should think more seriously about the consequences of our government’s actions.

CLEXIT is an international organization for the exit of climate agreements with respect to CO2 emission (i.e. for an abandoning of ratification of the COP25 agreement).
The Clexit Coalition:
www.clexit.net
http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit-members.pdf
Swedish CLEXIT is a regional branch of the CLEXIT Coalition.
Its goals and intensions are – as intended – somewhat country specific.
We realize:

that CO2 is “the gas of life” and hence beneficial for plant growth (by no means is it a “pollutant”).
that CO2 plays a very small to insignificant role in climate change (when we consider observational facts and physical laws instead of models that do not even agree with measured facts).
that climate change is predominantly driven by the Sun, its emission of luminosity and solar wind, and the filtering and amplification of this emission within the terrestrial physical processes.

We claim no relations to:

the Donald Trump organization, though they, too, do not agree with the IPCC and COP25 concept of an anthropogenic (CO2) global warming.

We urge:

that the CO2 hysteria will come to an immediate end, so that we can return to work for real problems in the real world.
that the COP25 agreement should be re-assessed in the light of real scientific facts.
that our national environmental goals and efforts will re-direct the focus on real problems (which, indeed, are both serious and large) instead of misusing all attention on an imagined CO2-hysteria.
that international efforts will re-focus its attention back to poverty and inequality instead of climate change.

These are the working frames of “Swedish CLEXIT” as proposed by is its regional director Nils-Axel Mörner on September 25, 2016.

The Clexit Coalition has called on the Australian Government to conduct a plebiscite on whether Australia should withdraw from the Paris Climate Treaty.
The Clexit (ClimateExit) Coalition, now comprising over 175 representatives from 25 countries, was launched in London last week. It aims to prevent ratification or local enforcement of the UN Paris climate treaty.
The Australian Secretary of Clexit, Mr Viv Forbes, said that Australia is particularly vulnerable to the destructive energy policies being promoted in the UN’s war on carbon fuels.
“Australia is a huge continent in a far corner of the world, suffering from what that great historian Geoffrey Blainey called ‘The Tyranny of Distance’.
“Since the days of the gold rush and the wool boom, we have always relied on production, transport, processing and export from our remote mines and farms to distant markets – gold and silver, wool and wheat, lead and zinc, butter and cheese, copper and aluminium, beef and lamb, iron ore and coking coal, timber and fruit, natural gas and thermal coal, cement and steel. These widely scattered industries and the factories and refineries dependent on them rely heavily on two things – efficient transport and reliable low-cost electricity.
“Two insane energy policies threaten them – “carbon-free transport” and “wind/solar power”.
“How do green dreamers plan to power the bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, railways, road trains, trucks, tractors, draglines, dozers and pumps on wind/solar power? “Carbon-free transport” would be the economic equivalent of returning to the costly and unreliable days of windmills, bullock teams, draught horses, sulkies and sailing ships.
“The same applies to “renewable energy” which is unreliable, intermittent and costly. Without nuclear or new hydro-power, there is Buckley’s chance that carbon-free energy can supply low-cost reliable electricity for Australian mines, farms, trains, planes, cities, refineries and heavy industry.
“Before subjecting Australia to these disastrous energy policies, Australians should be given a choice. If we deserve a Plebiscite on gay marriage, which affects a minority of people, we certainly need a Paris Plebiscite before the futile war on carbon fuels destroys our backbone industries and their jobs.
“With hostility to the Paris Treaty in Poland, doubts in France Britain and America, hesitation by the EU, pretend-participation by China and India, and real opposition in the new Australian parliament, Aussies should pause.
“Let’s see evidence, a real debate, and a vote.”

For at least a decade we have been told by the UN/IPCC, by most government media and officials, by many politicians, and by the Green “charities” and their media friends that “the science is settled”. We are lectured by Hollywood stars, failed politicians and billionaire speculators that anyone who opposes the World War on Carbon Dioxide is ignorant, mischievous or supporting some hidden vested interest. We endure calls for an end to free speech for climate sceptics, smearing with derogatory terms like “denier”, and even aggressive punishments like dismissal and legal action against sceptics for speaking out. The new low is the use of anti-racketeer legislation against sceptics:
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/08/29/rico-charges-against-climate-deniers-a-case-of-goose-and-gander/
We notice the sudden and unexplained denial of pre-booked sceptic conference facilities and the steadfast refusal of alarmists to debate facts and issues.
Why are they so afraid of words? Surely this is a sign that their facts are shonky and their arguments are feeble? They fear they are losing the confidence of the public.

The tide is turning, and informed opposition is growing. It is time for the thinking media to give sceptical evidence and conclusions a fair go in the court of public opinion.
In a short time with no costly international meetings and very little publicity, Clexit has gathered the support of over 115 members in 20 countries. Please look at the list of Foundation Members and countries:
http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit-members.pdf
Look at the skills, qualifications, experience and wisdom of our founding members; and the many other well-qualified dissenters listed at the end. The science is not settled.
This global warming alarm started with UN sponsored groups such as the IPCC. But Clexit has members who were official IPCC reviewers but they dissented from the final public IPCC reports which were prepared by political appointees.
The climate alarm rests totally on computerised models of atmospheric physics. But Clexit has highly qualified meteorologists, physicists, astro-physicists, radiation experts, climate modellers and long-range forecasters who reject the science, maths, assumptions and forecasts of the greenhouse-driven computer models.
We are told that Earth’s climate is controlled by the gradual increase of a tiny trace of one colourless gas in the atmosphere. But Clexit has specialists who can show that the warm and cold currents in the deep and extensive oceans, the variable water vapour in the atmosphere and Earth’s changing cover of ice, snow and clouds have far more effect on weather and climate than carbon dioxide.
We are told that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. But Clexit has organic chemists, biologists, physicians, naturalists, graziers, foresters and farmers who know that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is very beneficial for Earth’s biosphere – deserts are contracting, bush and forests are expanding, and crop yields are up.
We are told that sea levels are rising alarmingly. But Clexit has experts on sea level history and measurement who can prove that there is nothing unusual or alarming about current fluctuations in sea levels.
We are told that today’s climate is extreme and unusual. But Clexit has geologists and geographers who have studied eons of climate history via ice cores, stratigraphy, paleontology, deep-sea drilling, historical records, glaciers, ice sheets and landscapes and who say that climate change is normal and today’s climate is not extreme or unusual.
We are told to fear the coming global warming. But Clexit has geologists and researchers who have studied the cycles of the ice ages and the climate effects of the Milankovitch cycles in Earth’s orbit – obliquity, eccentricity and precession. They say we have passed the peak of this modern warm era and the long-term trend is now towards global cooling. We will still have short-term periods of hot and extreme weather, and some heat records may still be broken, but the 1,000 year climate averages are trending down towards the next glacial epoch of the Pleistocene Ice Age.
We are told that global warming threatens human health, and even our survival as a species, but Clexit has medical researchers who point to evidence that exposure to cold remains up to twenty times more lethal than exposure to heat. And Clexit has farmers who know that global cooling will slash food production, quickly causing hunger and starvation.
We are told repeatedly that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed by dangers that change annually – rising seas, river sediments, warm seas, ocean acidity, fertiliser run-off, coal port development, over-fishing or marauding star-fish. But Clexit has qualified members who have studied oceanography and ancient and modern corals and report that the Reef is healthy, and corals have survived far more dramatic changes in sea levels and climate in the past.
Solar cycles get no consideration in the IPCC climate models but Clexit has astro-physicists and long range weather forecasters who have demonstrated that solar and lunar cycles have big effects on Earth’s climate and weather cycles. In addition, while billions of dollars are spent fruitlessly on failed climate models and endless climate conferences, little is known about the strings of undersea volcanoes or how much geothermal heat is released from Earth’s molten interior during orogenic upheavals.
We are told that we must embrace zero-emission green energy. But Clexit has power engineers and logistics experts who say that wind and solar power cannot run modern industrial societies, modern transport or big cities except by installing massive overcapacity and gigantic transmission webs at exorbitant costs. 100% wind/solar is a recipe for blackouts and starvation. Clexit also has naturalists and conservationists who see more harm than good in extensive wind, solar and bio-fuel developments.
Finally, we are told that to save the world we need to hand powerful taxing and regulating powers to unelected officials of the United Nations. But Clexit has politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen, columnists, lawyers, army officers and bloggers who see that this political agenda will destroy the freedoms we cherish.
Many Clexit members have held very senior positions in research, industry or academia but no longer have sensitive positions, careers or incomes to protect, so are free to express honest opinions, which they have done by supporting “Clexit”.
We ask the media to give our soundly-based dissenting conclusions a fair hearing – there are two sides to most stories, but only one side is being aired.
The Clexit initiative was launched with no budget, promises or funds. So, unlike the alarmists with an agenda, those receiving rivers of government funds and those posing as tax-exempt charities, we cannot afford massive advertising costs.
We hope, in the interests of fair play, you see fit to give our valid concerns some space in the free media.
Note: The first informal meeting of many Clexit members will take place in London on Sept 8/9, 2016 at this conference (whose first booked venue had to be changed because of controversy and opposition):

The Clexit Founding Statement
If the Paris climate accord is ratified, or enforced locally by compliant governments, it will strangle the leading economies of the world with pointless carbon taxes and costly climate and energy policies, all with no sound basis in evidence or science. These destructive policies are already killing real industry while enriching the huge artificial and parasitical climate-change industry that thrives on bureaucracy, mis-directed government research, law books of costly regulations, never-ending conferences and subsidies for promoters of the failing technologies of renewable energy.
And all the time, government media and their allies dominate the political debate by trumpeting forecasts of doom, endlessly repeating the “right” messages, and making sure that dissident views are censored or ridiculed without right of recourse.
For the EU, their heavily subsidised wind and solar power will always deliver intermittent and erratic supply at great cost. This will produce periodic surges of oversupply which destabilise the grid and temporarily depress electricity prices, leading to losses and closures of reliable generators. At other times (and every still night), wind and sun will produce minimal or zero power, causing very high electricity prices and increasing the chances of brownouts and blackouts. To avoid blackouts governments and/or consumers are forced to fund diesel, gas or coal plants to remain on standby or as spinning reserves until needed. Funding these subsidies for renewables and the backups needed for them is producing crippling electricity prices (doubled in the past decade). It is also harming consumers (especially the poor) and causing financial crises for those governments who try to shield some businesses and consumers from the real energy costs.
Aluminium smelters and steel works have already closed or relocated to countries not mesmerised by the climate scam. Other industries will follow. Poland is resisting these suicidal industrial policies, and even Germany is recognising the danger by introducing subsidies to keep its industrial base.
Just one long cold European winter, with a few heavy snowfalls and a succession of still, frosty nights will produce the blackouts which will shock Europe into energy reality and bring the Paris energy follies to an end. In the last such winter, thousands of people died in Britain from cold as they could not afford home heating.
Some politicians and promoters in the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) think they can profit from the Paris accord. They hope to continue gaming the system by selling carbon credits of doubtful authenticity on an already corrupt market, and demanding climate reparations and technology transfers from the West, while remaining free to build their own clean modern and efficient coal/gas/nuclear/hydro energy grid. Their reliable low-cost power is already attracting electricity-intensive industries fleeing from the soaring power costs in the West. However, they forget that if Western energy stupidity provokes a world financial crisis, the global economy will slump and all nations will suffer.
Some of the biggest supporters of the Paris accord are small oceanic nations seeking welfare through handouts to save them from baseless predictions of rising sea levels, even though actual changes in sea levels are tiny and not unusual.
The fact is that sea level rise in Tuvalu has been effectively zero since accurate measurements commenced in 1993, on tide gauges set up by the Australian government: http://www.bom.gov.au/ntc/IDO70056/IDO70056SLI.pdf

These climate handouts will cease suddenly as energy reality bites and many current politicians in the West are thrown out of office. When this happens, the shock of losing easy money will damage these island nations far more than the gently oscillating oceans. They do have real problems needing attention, but rising seas is not one of them.
The EU is a driving force promoting green energy, environmental extremism, world carbon taxes and global control by unelected bureaucrats. Brexit was Britain’s answer to the growing over-reach of EU bureaucracies. Clexit is our answer to the push for global control through climate hysteria.
The Clexit Campaign aims to prevent ratification or local enforcement of the UN climate treaty. Nations should not tolerate UN and EU bureaucrats manipulating science in order to justify their dreams to redistribute wealth and revert to the central planning that enslaved and impoverished the old command economies.
This vicious and relentless war on carbon dioxide will be seen by future generations as the most misguided mass delusion that the world has ever seen.
Carbon dioxide is NOT a dangerous pollutant – it is a natural, non-toxic and beneficial gas which feeds all life on earth. Its increasing concentration is improving the environment, not harming it.
Carbon dioxide is also an insignificant player in global warming. Its so-called “greenhouse effect” is far smaller than that of atmospheric water vapour and, because this effect declines logarithmically as carbon dioxide levels rise, most of its small impact on surface temperature is already exhausted.
Carbon dioxide was unable to prevent the cyclic repetition of the Pleistocene Ice Ages or the Little Ice Age, and there was no human industry to create the warm climate optima of Egyptian, Minoan, Roman or Medieval times (the Earth was generally warmer than today at these past peaks). Man-made carbon dioxide did not cause the heat waves of the 1930’s or the fears of global cooling in the 1970’s. It plays no part in creating our short term weather. It does not drive ocean currents, El Nino, the Milankovitch cycles, the sun spot cycles or the eras of volcanism.
In the big climate picture, carbon dioxide hardly registers except in discredited UN/IPCC computer models.
Global warming has occurred naturally many times in the past and is not to be feared – it is not controlled by carbon dioxide or humans.
More carbon dioxide is already greening the planet as it has done in the past. Warming oceans always expel more moisture and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and these two gases-of-life always encourage plant growth and produce a verdant globe.
It was the cold, dry ice ages that created frigid deserts, life-smothering ice sheets, retreating oceans and massive losses for all life forms. Cold oceans also drain the atmosphere of carbon dioxide thus creating starvation stress for all plants. A warm globe always supports more life. The human race, the forests and the coral reefs have far more to fear from global cooling.
The world must abandon this suicidal Global Warming crusade. Man does not and cannot control the climate. Climate and weather are always changing, but apart from cyclic spikes of El Nino warming, there has been no measurable warming for twenty years.
It would be far better to spend some of the trillions being spent on the climate crusade to ensure that our infrastructure can cope with whatever weather extremes do occur; or tackling some real world problems such as terrorism, displaced people, water supply, urban air and water pollution, garbage and landfill.
If the UN/EU persists in this climate madness, the rest of the world must support Clexit.
Neither national, state or local governments should support, sign, enforce or waste public funds on any of the job-killing climate agreements, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, Habitat 3 or any other foreign agendas transferring real power and wealth from elected nationals to unelected international bureaucracies.

Summary Statement by Viv Forbes, Founding Secretary of Clexit

A new international organisation aims to prevent ratification of the costly and dangerous Paris global warming treaty which is being promoted by the EU and the present US administration.
“CLEXIT” (CLimate Exit) was inspired by the Brexit decision of the British people to withdraw from the increasingly dictatorial grasp of the EU bureaucracy.
Without any publicity or serious recruiting, Clexit has attracted over 60 well-informed science, business and economic leaders from 16 countries. (At 16 Sept 2016 Clexit had over 170 members from 25 countries).
The secretary of Clexit, Mr Viv Forbes from Australia, said that widespread enforcement of the Paris climate treaty would be a global tragedy.
“For the EU and the rest of the Western world, ratification and enforcement of the Paris Treaty (and all the other associated decrees and Agendas) would herald the end of low-cost hydrocarbon transport and electricity, and the exit of their manufacturing, processing and refining industries to countries with low-cost energy.
“For developing countries, the Paris Treaty would deny them the benefits of reliable low-cost hydrocarbon energy, compelling them to rely on biomass heating and costly weather-dependent and unreliable power supplies, thus prolonging and increasing their dependency on international handouts. They will soon resent being told to remain forever in an energy-deprived wind/solar/wood/bicycle economy.
“Perhaps the most insidious feature of the UN climate plan is the “Green Climate Fund”. Under this scheme, selected nations (“The rich”) are marked to pour billions of dollars into a green slush fund. The funds will then be used to bribe other countries (“developing and emerging nations”) into adopting silly green energy policies.
“Naturally some smart politicians and speculators in the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and in the small island nations, understand that they can profit from the Paris Treaty by gaming the rules on things like carbon credits, or milking the green fund for “climate compensation” or “green energy technology”. This will only work for a while, and when the handouts stop, the re-adjustment to reality will be very painful.
“This UN-driven war on carbon energy has already caused massive losses and dislocation of western industry. If allowed to continue as envisaged by the Paris Treaty, this economic recession will become a world-wide depression, and all nations will suffer.
“We must stop this futile waste of community savings; cease the destruction and dislocation of human industry; stop killing rare bats and birds with wind turbine blades and solar/thermal sizzlers; stop pelletising trees and shipping them across the world to feed power stations designed to burn coal; stop converting food to motor vehicle fuel; and stop the clearing of bush and forests for biofuel cultivation and plantations.”
“Carbon dioxide does not control the climate. It is an essential plant food and more carbon dioxide will produce more plant growth and a greener globe.”
