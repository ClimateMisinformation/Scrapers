"When webbing first appeared on the cotoneaster that scrambles up the side of my neighbours’ garage wall it was easy to mistake it for the work of spiders, but there were no orb weavers in residence. During the past six weeks, sheets of grey silk have spun out to veil two-thirds of the shrub. The creators of this premature Halloween decor are tiny brown ochre-coloured caterpillars, the larval stage of the hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella). They are predominantly associated with their namesake, but can be found on other members of the rose family and are considered a minor fruit crop pest as they occasionally attack damsons and blackthorns. The young larvae are leaf miners. Where they have burrowed into fresh tissue, the glossy green leaves are marked with pale beige meandering trails. As they mature, they graze the surface, leaving the foliage shrivelled and brown. Some sprays have been completely defoliated, clusters of scarlet berries clinging to the naked branches. The plant should recover, though the damage inflicted may affect the development of new shoots.  I was surprised when, at the end of August, adults began appearing among the crisscrossed threads. At first glance the slender-winged, 15mm-long insects appeared relatively nondescript, but closer inspection revealed that their silvery-white forewings were beautifully marked with two broad, irregular, reddish-brown crossbands, interspersed with blotches and pinprick spots. The trailing edges of both the fore- and hindwings were delicately fringed, like the trim on a 1920s flapper dress. The hawthorn moth is widespread in central and southern Europe, but in Great Britain it is rarely found north of Yorkshire. Across much of its range the species is bivoltine, producing two broods in a season. In Great Britain there is typically only one flight per year, with adults on the wing from mid-June to late July. The life cycle takes around 12 months, so infestations are usually noticed in the spring when the overwintered larvae emerge and begin feeding communally beneath their protective homespun shroud. Climate change is altering the reproductive phenology of many organisms; it seems likely that the unusually warm temperatures we experienced this summer have resulted in this unexpected second generation."
"Building walls on the seafloor may become the next frontier of climate science, as engineers seek novel ways to hold back the sea level rises predicted to result from global warming. By erecting barriers of rock and sand, researchers believe they could halt the slide of undersea glaciers as they disintegrate into the deep. It would be a drastic endeavour but could buy some time if climate change takes hold, according to a new paper published on Thursday in the Cryosphere journal, from the European Geosciences Union. Though the notion may sound far-fetched, the design would be relatively straightforward. “We are imagining very simple structures, simply piles of gravel or sand on the ocean floor,” said Michael Wolovick, a researcher at the department of geosciences at Princeton University in the US who described the plans as “within the order of magnitude of plausible human achievements”. The structures would not just be aimed at holding back the melting glaciers, but at preventing warmer water from reaching the bases of the glaciers under the sea. New research is now being undertaken by scientists showing how the effects of the warmer water around the world, as the oceans warm, may be the leading cause of underwater melting of the glaciers. Wolovick and his fellow researchers ran computer models to check on the likely impacts of the structures they believe would be needed, taking as their starting point the Thwaites glacier in Antarctica, which at 80-100km is one of the widest glaciers in the world. They found that creating a structure of isolated columns or mounds on the sea floor, each about 300 metres high, would require between 0.1 and 1.5 cubic km of aggregate material. This would make such a project similar to the amount of material excavated to form Dubai’s Palm Islands, which took 0.3 cubic km of sand and rock, or the Suez canal, which required the excavation of roughly one cubic km. Building a structure of this kind would have about a 30% probability of preventing a runaway collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet, according to the models. Using more complex designs that would be harder to accomplish in the harsh conditions on the sea bottom in the south polar regions, a small underwater wall could be built, which they calculate would have a 70% chance of succeeding in blocking half the warm water from reaching the ice shelf. Glaciers melting under rising temperatures at the poles have the potential to discharge vast amounts of fresh water into the oceans, sending sea levels rising faster than they have for millennia. The Thwaites glacier alone, an ice stream the size of Britain and likely to be the biggest single source of future sea level rises, could trigger the melting of enough water to raise global sea levels by three metres. Many of these glaciers extend far under the sea, and scientists have begun to explore their subsea melting as well as the easier-to-measure reductions in the or visible parts. The undersea research vessel now known as Boaty McBoatface after its much larger relative was named the Sir David Attenborough is to be deployed at the Thwaites glacier for just this purpose. Building undersea walls could be accomplished by similar vessels but would have to be precisely positioned and strong enough to withstand the immense pressure of the ice. The authors hope that by creating their experimental models they can foster future research into the engineering needed to bring about such projects, which would take many years or decades to be worked out and implemented. Geo-engineering solutions such as this one should not deter the world from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Wolovick said. “The more carbon we emit, the less likely it becomes that the ice sheets will survive in the long term at anything close to their present volume,” he said. The forthcoming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to warn afresh of the potential for sea level rises to inundate low-lying areas if warming is not held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels."
"Last week, California Governor Jerry Brown signed State Senator and US Senate candidate Kevin de León’s SB 100, which mandates that the state obtain all of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. That in itself was a big deal, but Brown didn’t stop there; he also issued an executive order calling for the entire California economy to become carbon-neutral by 2045. That’s a huge deal. In order to stay below the Paris climate threshold of 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, humanity must become carbon-neutral by around 2060 or 2070. If California can meet Brown’s target, it will be providing the rest of the world a blueprint for meeting the Paris target. As the world’s fifth-largest economy, California can provide a powerful roadmap for others to follow.  Brown’s executive order directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to work with relevant state agencies to develop a framework for implementation and accounting of progress toward statewide carbon neutrality. While state agencies can figure out a plan to achieve carbon neutrality, the state legislature will have to pass laws to implement that plan. California has been all-in on tackling climate change, as its carbon cap and trade system and SB 100 illustrate, but Californians will have to keep electing climate realists to state office in order to make the dream of carbon neutrality a reality. SB 100 tackles the electricity sector, but because California has long been transitioning toward clean energy, electricity now only accounts for 16% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the biggest chunk at 41%. Brown has been pushing for a transition to electric cars, signing another executive order earlier this year setting a goal of 5m EVs on the road by 2030, and several bills last week to help expand their use. While California has the most EVs on the road today (both total and per capita) of any state, they still only account for 5% of new car sales, with 380,000 sold so far. Accelerating that transition toward EVs is crucial for meeting the carbon neutrality goal, and it’s the main reason why California is fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze fuel efficiency standards and take away the state’s ability to set its own. The industrial sector accounts for another 23% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. About half of that comes from the petroleum industry – predominantly from drilling for oil and natural gas, as well as oil refining. California is the fourth-largest oil producing state. The Trump administration wants to increase that number and is contemplating opening 1.6 million acres in California held by the Bureau of Land Management to fracking and oil drilling. But a wiser future president could revoke those drilling leases on federal lands, and California could ban drilling and fracking on state lands. That’s a bridge too far for Jerry Brown, and protesters have been criticizing him for it, but it’s easy to imagine a future governor taking this step. Agriculture and forestry account for another 8% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. The state is already launching a Healthy Soils Initiative to increase carbon sequestration via farming. For example, one pilot project is monitoring how much carbon will be stored by clover planted between trees at an almond orchard. The University of California at Davis is also conducting experiments to evaluate how changing livestock feed can reduce methane emissions from cattle. Another 7% comes from the residential sector, most of which is due to burning natural gas for heating and cooking. But stoves, hot water heaters, and heating units can be replaced by electric appliances powered by California’s increasingly carbon-free energy. Last week, Brown also signed a bill directing CARB to study ways of cutting carbon pollution from residential and commercial buildings. In short, there are a lot of feasible ways that California can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and approach carbon neutrality. The plan will may also include some degree of carbon offsetting and carbon capture and sequestration to get the state’s emissions down to (or below) zero by 2045. It’s a daunting but achievable goal. In contrast, the Trump administration has been doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution for the sake of industry profits. In its latest polluting move, the Trump EPA plans to scrap two regulations aimed at reducing methane pollution from oil and gas wells. According to EPA’s own analysis, repealing a regulation requiring that oil and gas wells be monitored for methane leaks every six months will add 8.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent to the atmosphere over a six-year period. It will save the oil and gas industry, whose annual profits exceed $100bn, $75m per year. That’s the equivalent carbon pollution of adding more than 300,000 cars on the road in order to give the oil & gas industry a 0.07% revenue boost. Levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, are already rising. The Trump EPA wants to further loosen rules on leaks and releases by the oil and gas industry.https://t.co/O2kfhELrA3 pic.twitter.com/wmXqDyzgjg It’s hard to imagine a starker contrast. The Trump administration is making America the stupidest country in the world on climate change, while the Democrats running California are creating a roadmap to show the world how to meet the Paris climate target. And the GOP is running away from California and toward Trump. We’re launching our own damn satellite! https://t.co/3NQhPKYtmv #GCAS2018 🌎🛰️ pic.twitter.com/I5616pJODy"
"California is set to launch a satellite to track greenhouse gases, as former US Secretary of State John Kerry and island nation leaders warned that the world is far off course to avoid the worst effects of rising temperatures. Gov. Jerry Brown announced plans for the satellite on the last day of a climate change summit hosted by San Francisco, in a final rebuke to President Donald Trump’s denial of man-made warming. “With science still under attack,” Brown said “we’re going to launch our own satellite, our own damn satellite, to figure out where the pollution is.” Brown said the satellite will help pinpoint the source of planet-warming emissions. California will team up with Planet Labs, a company run by ex-Nasa scientists. The data collected, including on carbon dioxide emissions and methane leaks from oil and gas operations, could be made public as part of a partnership with the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund. The new project comes as Trump has proposed slashing Nasa climate research mission budgets. It is one of dozens of commitments of mixed significance unveiled by states, cities and businesses at the event. Despite the optimism on show at the summit, Kerry said climate efforts must ramp up. “I am going to tell the truth, and the truth is we are not anywhere near where we need to be with respect to the overall challenge of climate change,” said Kerry, who worked to secure the 2015 global Paris climate agreement under former president Barack Obama. Kerry blasted Donald Trump for deciding to leave that deal, calling it “one of the single greatest acts of irresponsibility by a president of the United States anywhere at any time.” Leaders of the countries already suffering most from sea-level rise and ocean acidification echoed Kerry’s concerns, saying that international action is slowing. “The world has lost, all of us have lost, momentum since Paris in 2015. Although the rate of increase has slowed, we’ve not yet peaked our global emissions. But we must do so by 2020. We really cannot afford to wait any longer,” said Mia Mottley, prime minister of the Caribbean island nation of Barbados. Mottley’s country is in the direct path of hurricanes that are growing in strength and may narrowly avoid a more direct hit from tropical storm Isaac this week. The world is set to watch temperatures rise 3C above pre-industrial levels by the time a child born today is old, Mottley said, even if countries adhere to the goals they said. Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, said countries need to speed their work. “We all know that the levels of ambition in our national plans need to be ramped up because we are not on track to meet the targets of the Paris agreement,” Bainimarama said. Former US vice-president Al Gore struck a more positive tone. “We must do it. We can do it. I’m convinced ever more because of the success of this summit here in San Francisco that we will do it,” he said, reminding that the US has not technically left the Paris deal yet and that a new president could re-enter. The warnings were at odds with the overall atmosphere of the summit. On the eve of the gathering, California governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that would make the state’s electricity supply carbon-free by 2045. A separate executive order by Brown is more sweeping, committing to net zero emissions across the entire California economy, also by 2045. Other cities and regions from around the world have followed this with various pledges, with New York City promising $4bn to renewable energy and clean water and cities including Los Angeles, Tokyo, Honolulu, Oslo and Greater Manchester pledging to build energy efficient buildings or deploy fleets of electric buses. A group of 29 philanthropists committed $4bn over five years to combat climate change, the largest such investment of its kind, while companies such as Ikea, Walmart and Unilever promised to reduce emissions through measures such as electrified trucks for deliveries and action to prevent deforestation in the tropics. Jonathan Pershing, the State Department’s climate negotiator under Obama, said the summit brings hope to the climate cause. “The story here is optimistic. The question here is does the optimism translate, and can this message get out globally,” Pershing said. “There is a good broad cross-section of people from around the world, but it’s just a few thousand people, and it’s a problem that’s going to require engagement by millions.”"
"Senior climate scientists say that the world’s carbon sinks could be facing a grave threat from a wholly unexpected source: the EU’s renewable energy directive. The climate law could suck in as much imported wood as Europe harvests each year because it will count energy created from the burning of whole trees as “carbon neutral”, according to several academics including a former vice-chair of the UN IPCC.  Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is now a climate sciences professor at Université Catholique de Louvain, said the risk of the directive encouraging tree clearances and the destruction of global carbon sinks was now “extremely high”. “This amounts to sawing off the branch on which humanity sits,” he told the Guardian. Indonesia and Brazil were among 27 countries which pledged “to increase the use of wood … to generate energy as part of efforts to counter climate change” at the Bonn climate summit last year. Without additional conservation measures, “the directive in its present form will create a large demand for wood that will contribute to destroying those forests,” van Ypersele said. “It is a catastrophe in the making.” The EU’s thinking has been that carbon neutrality can be achieved by planting new saplings that eventually compensate for the carbon released by the burning of trees for energy. But the saplings’ growth can takes decades or centuries. By 2050, replacing fossil fuels with wood will likely result in two- to three times more carbon in the atmosphere per gigajoule of final energy, the paper says. Nino Aveni, a spokesman for the Bioenergy Europe trade association, argued that new saplings could reabsorb the CO2 emitted by fully grown burned trees within “years to decades”. “Sustainability criteria are a guarantee that existing forest protection measures are applied to wood used for bioenergy production,” he said. “EU member states have already strong forest policies in place.” An EU official confirmed that the new analysis was accurate – and said that if anything, it underestimated the scale of the problem. The directive “really will [spark] a race to the bottom because there is no inherent limit to the potential over-harvesting,” the source said. “There is a high risk that it will involve the possibility of increasing emissions with no possibility of any greenhouse gas savings at all.” The magnitude of the problem – which eminent academics last year described as “a critical flaw” in EU climate policy – was not understood within the EU, the source claimed. “Partly that is because of wishful thinking,” the official said. “Partly it is so fundamentally wrong that most people would not believe it could be as wrong as it is.”"
"America’s governors, mayors and CEOs are forging ahead with climate change initiatives despite the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and commitment to reviving the coal industry. But a report published today sets out a roadmap that could quicken that pace and cut carbon emissions to 24% below 2005 levels by 2025 in the absence of federal leadership.  Many US states, cities and businesses have rallied around the Paris commitments since Donald Trump pulled out from the agreement in June 2017. The America’s Pledge on Climate initiative was set up the same year by the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and the California governor, Jerry Brown, to map “bottom up” US climate action. The US is already almost halfway to meeting its 2025 Paris Agreement emissions goal of 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The report claims existing commitments and policies will drive US emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2025 – around two-thirds of the original Paris goal. It also sets out 10 climate action strategies – across most major economic sectors including electricity, transportation and buildings – that, if implemented broadly, could lower emissions to 21% . Broader engagement and collaboration could bring this figure to 24%, the report suggests. Strategies include setting and implementing more stringent renewable energy procurement policies, accelerating the phase-out of super-polluting refrigerant gases, and mapping and repairing methane leaks from natural gas pipelines. Researchers at the University of Maryland and the Rocky Mountain Institute, an independent thinktank, surveyed all 50 states, the largest 285 cities (100,000-plus population) and a cross section of businesses to map climate actions nationwide. Those committed to the Paris Agreement represent over half the US population (173 million people), over half the US economy ($11.4tn) and over 35% of nationwide greenhouse gas emissions. Paul Bodnar, managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute and a co-author of the report, told the Guardian: “There have been growing coalitions in the US – cities working together, states working together, businesses working together. What’s changed in the last year and what’s new is this cross-cutting perspective. When states pass laws that help cities’ [emissions] strategies, or when states’ renewable portfolio standards are designed to help businesses – that’s really where we’re seeing really interesting, high-impact results.” The report, launched on the eve of Governor Brown’s Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco this week, showcases examples of states, cities and businesses pioneering climate change initiatives. Arkansas is the only state in the south-east with energy efficiency resource standards (EERS), which require electric and natural gas utilities to propose and administer energy efficiency programs. Since 2009, strategies ranging from customer outreach to new technology have supported these programs, resulting in megawatt-hour savings enough to power 28,000 homes for a year. Los Angeles’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, was the driving force behind BlueLA, the city’s first all-electric car share program designed to serve low-income residents. Stations are located in LA’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods and the program is expected to take 1,000 vehicles off the road by 2020. BlueLA also employs community members to lead on education and outreach. New Jersey’s largest utility, Public Service Electric & Gas used methane leak data collected by EDF and Google Street View vehicles equipped with leak detection sensors, leading to a 83% reduction in leakages. Brown signed a bill this week pledging that the state will obtain 100% of its power from clean sources by 2045. California is the second US state to do so, following Hawaii’s pledge in 2015. The report comes in the same week that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released proposals to ease monitoring of methane gas leaks. These would unpick the raft of rules introduced under the Obama administration in 2016 to monitor methane leaks because of their negative contribution to climate change. Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and vice-chair of America’s Pledge, acknowledged that the bottom up approach “has no sanctions or penalties” but that it represented “a coalition of entities that have the capacity to make a difference”. "
"Companies including Facebook, Google and Microsoft have failed to distance themselves from a lobby group’s proposal to fight any effort by the EU to set more ambitious climate change goals. A leaked document shows that BusinessEurope, Europe’s biggest business lobbying group, will urge members to oppose any moves by the European Commission to ratchet up the bloc’s 2030 targets for clean energy, carbon cuts and energy efficiency. The commission is considering whether to set more ambitious goals in November after a key international science panel report on meeting tougher global warming targets is published in October, and before a UN climate summit in December. But, at meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, BusinessEurope will ask big companies to agree a “line to take” on the prospect of steeper carbon cuts. If the commission’s measures have teeth, the group’s “advocacy and communication strategy” recommends companies agree to fight them. “To oppose the new increase of ambition, using the usual arguments of global playing field, we cannot compensate for others, etc,” the document said. If the commission opts for warm words and a political statement rather than a material ratcheting up of the targets, the group suggests it should react by being “rather positive”. BusinessEurope’s members include household names in the energy and technology sectors, many of which have spoken of the need for strong action on climate change. When contacted by the Guardian to ask if they agreed or disagreed with the lobby group’s suggested opposition, UK business trade body the CBI, German conglomerate Siemens, French energy firms Engie and EDF Energy, and Japanese multinational Hitachi all failed to distance themselves from the proposal. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft, all of which source renewable energy and have stressed the importance of cutting emissions, also failed to comment on where they stood on the proposal. A CBI spokesperson said the group “has always been supportive of the ambitious and challenging climate targets set by the EU and the UK”. BusinessEurope said the meeting was a starting point to discuss what its position should be. Kate Blagojevic, head of climate and energy at Greenpeace, which obtained the leaked document, said: “This powerful industry lobby is busy plotting behind the scenes to derail further action from the EU ahead of a major climate summit.” Blagojevic said she was surprised companies appeared willing to go along with the proposal and urged them to “reject this cynical plan and use Wednesday’s meeting to stop it in its tracks”. EU energy chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, said in August that the commission was weighing up whether or not to increase the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 2030 from 40% to 45%. The plan has the support of the commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who has said that he shared Cañete’s conclusions on the carbon target. “This summer’s droughts are a stark reminder – not only for farmers – of just how important that work is to safeguard the future for generations of Europeans. We cannot turn a blind eye to the challenge in front of our noses,” Juncker said this month."
"Australia remains on track to miss its Paris climate targets as carbon emissions continue to soar, according to new data. The figures from NDEVR Environmental for the year up to the end of June 2018 show the country’s emissions were again the highest on record when unreliable data from the land use and forestry sectors was excluded. It is the third consecutive year for record-breaking emissions. NDEVR replicates the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR figures have been within 1% of the official figures when eventually released. The government has yet to publish any emissions data for 2018. Its last update was for the year to December 2017, which it published in May and showed Australia’s emissions continue to soar. NDEVR’s report projects Australia will miss its Paris targets by about a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide if emissions continue on their current trajectory. It projects that emissions, excluding land use, will be 558m tonnes, the highest since records began in 2002. It finds that transport emissions were the highest on record in the final quarter of the 2018 financial year and continue to rise. NDEVR said this was due to the rapid increase in the use of diesel fuel in both passenger cars and heavy transport. Emissions from stationary energy and fugitive emissions continue to trend upwards. The rise in stationary emissions is mostly attributable to energy industries excluding electricity generation NDEVR’s report projects a drop in emissions from the electricity sector for the final quarter of the 2018 financial year because of a reduction in total electricity generation in the national electricity market states and an increase in generation from renewables. But Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR Environmental, said Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris targets. “Tracking the Paris trend line, they’re still heading north and missing Paris by a long way and our 2050 two-degree target by an even greater margin,” he said. “The data’s telling us clearly again that we’re not on a trajectory to meet our targets, there’s no effective policy to meet our targets, but we’re still hearing commentary from the government that we’re on track to meet our targets.”"

"Jerry Brown, California’s governor, has accused Donald Trump of “gross ignorance” over climate change as he made his most sweeping actions yet to rid the world’s fifth largest economy of fossil fuels.  Brown not only signed a bill that calls for 100% of the state’s electricity to come from carbon-free sources by 2045 but also penned an executive order demanding that California completely eliminate net emissions across its economy, including transport and agriculture, by the same year. The order, which cites “historic droughts, devastating storms, torrential storms, extreme heat … and threats to human health”, requires California pull more greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it puts in by 2046, using vegetation and new technologies. Brown told the Guardian that California was taking the lead globally in confronting an issue that’s an “existential challenge” to the planet and claimed that Trump was the main obstacle to further progress. “I don’t believe Trump represents the present but he has the power, he has the Republicans hook, line and sinker,” he said. “His unabashed acolytes will follow him over the cliff. Gross ignorance is dangerous. The battle is with Trump – that’s the number one fight. But once he’s out of there, dealing with climate change will still be a fight.” The Trump administration has sought to dismantle emissions rules for coal-fired power plants and loosen fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, targeting California’s ability to set stricter vehicle regulations than the rest of the country. Brown has set a target of 5m electric cars on California’s roads but said “at the rate we’re going they will be made by Chinese companies and that will principally be the fault of Donald Trump. The American auto industry is on the chopping block at at the moment he is chopping it into oblivion.” The vision of carbon neutrality and the banishment of fossil fuels set out by Brown has taken aback even some environmentalists in a state that is a major oil and gas producer, as well as the nation’s agricultural heavyweight. California will look to soak up carbon through expanded forests, at a time when enormous wildfires are a growing blight on the state, or inject carbon underground or in algal blooms – a technological challenge that has yet to be proven at scale. “Places like Sweden and Costa Rica have had those kind of pledges but California is the fifth largest economy in the world,” said Nigel Purvis, who oversaw environmental diplomacy at the state department under the Clinton and George W Bush administrations. “This is historic. It’s a really major step. Jerry Brown has been one of America’s great climate leaders.” Now entering the twilight of his second spell as governor, Brown has forged a reputation for environmentalism, bringing in one of the first ever tax incentives for rooftop solar during his first period as the state’s chief executive, which ran from 1975 to 1983. His second stint as governor, which began in 2011, has seen Brown throw himself at the issue of climate change, overseeing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels during a period of strong economic growth by implementing a carbon-trading scheme that recently expanded in scope to help prevent deforestation overseas. Latterly, his tenure has brought him into diametric opposition to Trump. Brown has compared the president’s climate policies to falling off the top of the Empire State Building and said California will “launch its own damn satellite” if Trump hobbles Nasa’s climate research. “He has pushed back the shallow narrative that you can’t grow the economy while cutting carbon pollution,” said Benjamin Houlton, director of the University of California Davis John Muir Institute of the Environment. “He’s shown that’s false. He’s set a model that can transform other countries.” Brown has been assailed on the right by Republicans, who have claimed his targets are unfeasible and will raise the cost of electricity in the state, as well as some on the left who complain that he has been too willing to appease around oil and gas companies and has failed to phase out drilling in California. Last week, Brown’s move to stop the Trump administration attempts to allow drilling off California’s coast was dismissed as “pure theater” by May Boeve, executive director of climate campaign group 350.org. “The governor says ‘not here, not now’, but he’s permitted more than 20,000 new oil and gas wells up and down California during his tenure,” she added. Further concerns have been raised over the stubbornly poor air quality in parts of the state, a problem that’s a particular burden for communities of colour that live near highways and industrial facilities such as oil refineries. “The critical question now is whether the transition to 100% renewable energy will be a just transition that benefits everyone, especially workers and communities most impacted by pollution and climate change,” said Miya Yoshitani, executive director of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, which is based in the Bay Area. Brown himself has echoed the desire for a quickening of pace given the threats California faces – a recent report found the state is set for a major increase in temperatures and sea level, thousands of extra deaths and the loss of two-thirds of its beaches by the end of this century. This urgency will be spelled out in a major climate summit held in San Francisco this week, as mayors, business leaders and activists from around the world assemble in what will be the largest, and last, gathering on the issue hosted by Brown before he retires to the family ranch. “Transformation is not for wimps,” he said. “Yes it’s difficult but we are moving at a pace greater than any country. Is it too slow? Yes, but we’re doing everything we can. “My legacy is restoring my great-grandfather’s ranch. In 10 years there will be a whole new grid, a whole new political class. The whole idea of a legacy is a canard.”"
"Australian companies should be doing more to disclose risks to their business from climate change, according to a report by the corporate regulator Asic. The review, published on Thursday, examined climate risk disclosures by 60 companies in the ASX 300, in 25 recent initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses, and across 15,000 annual reports.  Of the 60 companies, Asic found 17% identified climate change as a material risk to their business. The regulator said that while most ASX 100 companies had considered the potential risks posed to them by climate change at least to some extent, the practice of disclosing these risks to investors was “considerably fragmented, with information provided to the market in differing forms across a wide range of means of disclosure”. “In some cases, the review found climate risk disclosures to be far too general, and of limited use to investors,” Asic said in a statement. The review found few listed companies outside of the ASX 200 were disclosing climate risks to their investors. Discussion of climate change in annual reports had also gone backwards, particularly for companies outside the ASX 100. It found the percentage of annual reports of all listed companies that contained climate change-related content had fallen from 22% in 2011 to 14% in 2017. “Climate change is a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries,” the Asic commissioner John Price said. “Directors and officers of listed companies need to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks (including climate risk) that may affect the company’s business – for better or for worse.” He said climate change disclosure practices were still evolving and Asic would “monitor market practice as it continues to evolve and develop in this area”. But financial analysts said the report highlights problems with Australia’s generic risk disclosure laws for companies and the understanding of how they apply to climate change. “It shows there’s a difference between what Asic says the laws say and what companies are doing,” said Will van de Pol, a campaigner at Market Forces. “It’s clear from this report and our financial research that many Australian companies are not meeting their legal requirements. “It means that investors are being left in the dark about the risk to the companies that they own from climate change.” He said it was up to investors to demand detailed risk disclosure from companies and for the regulator to take action against companies that failed to meet disclosure requirements. Dan Gocher, director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the results in the review suggested mandatory reporting of climate risks might need to be considered. “In the absence of that, this is the result,” he said. “It points to a systemic issue. Without mandatory reporting from Asic it will require a cultural change.” He said investors should be taking action against companies that weren’t making progress. “We’re suggesting they used the tools that they’ve got and the only ones are voting against directors and voting against remuneration,” he said."
"“It all starts as a bit of a fairytale,” the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, told a room full of renewable energy types in Canberra this week. “Once upon a time there was an independent review into the national energy market.” Finkel did conduct that review at the behest of Malcolm Turnbull and the states when the objective was to fix the problems that have cascaded through the energy market since Tony Abbott opposed Labor’s carbon price to win an election.  The chief scientist proposed a clean energy target as the fix. Abbott and the deep feelings brigade inside the Coalition didn’t like it. It wouldn’t fly, so Turnbull and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, retreated and regrouped. They then got officials to produce the national energy guarantee, hoping that would work, given the Neg mechanism dealt with both reliability and emissions reduction, and that might subdue some of the conservative opposition. But the deep feelings brigade didn’t like that either, and we all saw what happened next. Now let’s make our way back to Finkel, talking to mildly punch-drunk renewable energy types, in a small function room in the parliament this week. Once Finkel moves on from being chief scientist, someone should give him a diplomatic posting, because he has been stoic in the face of a rolling cluster cuss, fronting up with a placid expression and some polite words of encouragement at every stage of the derangement in an effort to endorse the government’s underlying objective, which is to fix a serious problem. Finkel was polite again this week, given the absurdity of being in a room with a new federal energy minister lacking any riding instructions to say anything apart from exchanging pleasantries; still no solution to an important problem; and the prime minister who asked him to help fix the mess now in exile in New York, out of office, and messing with the minds of the people who deposed him. The chief scientist was talking about hydrogen at an annual showcase organised by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. He’s put together a strategy for energy ministers on hydrogen in the event that our elected representatives are still capable of serving the national interest. Dare to dream, Alan. Go, you good thing. Finkel spoke about the excitement that was building in energy circles about the potential for hydrogen to be “the last piece of the jigsaw” in the inexorable energy transition. He spoke about Japan, a country that was “determined to decarbonise, unlike some other countries …” – a droll little aside that returned a sardonic laugh in the room – “and meet its 2030 commitments”. Japan, like Australia, was a fossil-fuel heavy economy, but lacked some of the natural advantages of a country like Australia, with its abundant sunshine, and thin population. Japan, Finkel said, “was crying out for a zero-emissions alternative” and Australia had an opportunity to “capture the export market” and develop domestic opportunities as well. A moment had arrived, in other words, in Australia’s national story. But to make this all happen, government would need to step up to the plate. Finkel told the room he’d given a presentation to energy ministers at the last Coag energy council meeting – the one that kept the Neg alive but put it on life support. They were enthusiastic, he said. “Ministers, asking for a strategy,” Finkel said, deadpan, again, to a ripple of sardonic laughter in the room. “Think about this, a great thing.” Finkel’s gentle homily gives you some insight into the resting disposition around Australia’s energy sector, which you might describe as gallows humour. The Coalition has plunged the country into an almighty mess, and there is no obvious way the mess can be fixed. It really is dire. Because of the civil war inside the Coalition that has delivered three party leaders in two terms, the Morrison government has parked the medium-term approach to solving the problems, which a sector such as energy, with generation assets with 30-year operating lives, requires. Morrison and the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, are currently fixated on conjuring up a short-term fix they can offer voters before the election – a noticeable reduction in power prices – never mind the obvious point that having a medium term roadmap would help deliver your short-term objective. Then there’s the climate imperative. The government can’t talk about emissions reduction except to offer a talking point that Australia will meet its Paris climate commitments “in a canter”. This is nonsense, because there are no policies to deliver the commitment. As the conservative MP Craig Kelly asked in a meeting of the backbench energy committee this week – what am I supposed to say when people ask me how we’ll meet the Paris target? Good question Craig. Very acute. The government is being hit with precisely that question, because it’s the obvious question to ask, and the answer appears to be “technology” (not clear what technology or why anyone would invest in it, given the cluster cuss); “the emissions reduction fund” (which is a creaking vestige of Abbott-era pretend climate action policies that the government chose not to top up in last year’s budget, and Josh Frydenberg, the new treasurer, is giving no commitment to funding in the future); and the vibe. Right at the moment, the Morrison government has nothing to say to voters on emissions reduction. Unless this changes, this will be the first time in my reporting lifetime where a party of government goes to an election minus a concrete emissions reduction policy. Even Abbott, who campaigned on revoking Labor’s policy, coughed up a fig leaf called Direct Action. Perhaps the new environment minister, Melissa Price, will have the wit to conjure up an emissions reduction policy that doesn’t actually reduce emissions, to give Morrison something to say when he has to face the voters, but I’m not hopeful, because the Neg was a policy that in practice would have reduced emissions in the electricity sector by 2% between 2012 and 2030, and the feelings brigade couldn’t even stomach that. So where does this leave us? Of course voters care about lower prices, and many would rank lowering their power bills well ahead of emissions reduction. But the omission on cutting pollution, if it persists, won’t be cost-free for the Coalition. The country is in the grip of a crippling drought. When the country was last in the grip of a crippling drought, and the Coalition was in a weak political position, on the brink of losing an election, John Howard (that would be the same prime minister who refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol) supported an emissions trading scheme because it became politically impossible to do anything else. The data tells us emissions are rising, and basic logic tells you they will go on rising as long as there’s no plan to curb them. Some long-term survey research released this week also suggests two things: Australians are more worried about climate change than they were 12 months ago, and regional voters – the ones the Morrison government is currently most worried about leaking to populist political disrupters or community-minded independents – are less inclined than they once were to consider climate science a hoax. Call me crazy, but I think the government might need a plan."
"California’s status as a progressive bastion on climate change action has been challenged by activists who attempted to barricade the way to a major summit in San Francisco and decried the oil and gas drilling they say is blighting the health of low-income and minority communities.  The Global Climate Action Summit is acting as a rallying point for cities, businesses and regions from around the world to outline plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The event has been hosted by Jerry Brown, the governor of California who has been lauded as a progressive climate leader and bulwark against the Trump administration. But community representatives claim Brown has largely abandoned certain neighborhoods to pollution from oil and gas drilling operations. California’s Central Valley has some of the worst air quality in the country. Across the US, sicknesses linked to air and water pollution are disproportionately felt by people of color, who are far more likely to live near power plants, landfills and other toxic sites. “Jerry Brown needs to stop oil drilling expansion and if he doesn’t do that, what kind of leader is he?” said Alicia Rivera, a community activist in Wilmington, a district of Los Angeles with six oil refineries, several chemical plants, scrap yards and hundreds of oil wells. “He has failed in a big way.” Several thousand protesters marched through San Francisco on Thursday before attempting to block the entrance to the summit, where mayors, prime ministers, executives from companies such as McDonald’s and celebrities including Alec Baldwin were gathering. Activists chanted “Tell Jerry Brown to keep it in the ground” and held signs reading “Don’t drill” and “We’re drowning”. There were scuffles as police attempted to remove several protesters who chained themselves to the gates of the conference building in downtown San Francisco. Inside the venue, protesters interrupted a speech by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, by chanting: “Our air is not for sale.” Brown’s critics claim California’s cap-and-trade emissions system, which allows major polluters to trade emissions allowances and offsets, is overly generous to fossil fuel interests. They have also attacked the governor for allowing more than 20,000 drilling operations during his tenure, as well as for an alleged conflict of interest in which his sister, Kathleen Brown, sits on the board of Sempra Energy. Sempra owns the Aliso Canyon gas facility near Los Angeles which suffered a major leak in 2015, releasing more than 100,000 metric tons of natural gas before it was finally plugged. “It is appalling that Governor Brown would celebrate himself as a climate leader while he sentences my community to suffer from severe breathing problems, rare cancers, nosebleeds and rashes,” said Jane Fowler, a resident of the Porter Ranch area, near the site of the leak. “There isn’t any reason why he shouldn’t shut Aliso Canyon down now.” The discontent highlights deep-seated inequities in housing and health exposed by climate change even in places considered progressive on the issue. This week, Brown signaled the end of unabated fossil fuel use in California, signing a bill to bring about 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 and an executive order that would bring emissions to zero across all sectors, including transport and agriculture, by the same year. These commitments, some of the most ambitious in the world, come at a time when the Trump administration is dismantling pollution rules for coal-fired power plants, cars and trucks. “I’m tremendously supportive of leaders today who are moving as fast and far as they think they can,” said Gina McCarthy, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama. “A leader like Jerry Brown has gone so far so we shouldn’t make it about him, we should make it about the issue.”"
"At last, protest marches against global warming, the most relevant issue of our time (Report, 8 September). I am over 90 years old and cannot join one but wish I could. All other questions fade into second place: Brexit, the gap between rich and poor, even the wars of the Middle East. We are not even reaching the 2% per annum target and even 0.2% would be too high.

"Climate change is making people hungry – with nearly 100 million people across the world needing humanitarian food aid because of climate shocks last year – and a growing number of people are malnourished across the Pacific, a new United Nations report says. Last week, the Pacific Islands Forum stated formally that climate change represented the “single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific” – a declaration Australia ultimately signed but had spent much of the forum attempting to undermine.  Worldwide, the number of undernourished people has been rising since 2014, reaching 821 million last year – or one in nine people across the globe – the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report found. The number of hungry people globally has returned to levels of nearly a decade ago, and nearly one in four (22.2%) children aged under five are stunted through malnutrition. Low- and middle-income countries were especially acutely affected by more frequent climate extremes and natural disasters. Africa remains the region where malnourishment is most common at 20.4% of the population. But “Oceania” – broadly synonymous with the Pacific region but excluding Australia and New Zealand – is the only region in the world where the rate of undernourishment has increased over the past 12 years, to 7%. Nutrition in Pacific countries is very sensitive to climate extremes. Worldwide, five of the 15 countries considered the most vulnerable to natural hazards are Pacific small island developing states. Vanuatu is ranked as the world’s most vulnerable. Recurring climate shocks such as drought, delayed monsoons, tropical cyclones and floods – and with insufficient recovery time between disasters – have undermined food security across the Pacific, increased dependence on food aid, and weakened the nutrition of those who live there. “In some Pacific small island developing states (Sids), the recurrence of climate shocks that impact on national/local food production, coupled with insufficient recovery time, undermines food security and nutrition in the longer term,” the FAO report said. “This is seen in reduced agricultural and fisheries productivity, increased reliance on short-term humanitarian food assistance, gradual erosion of traditional food systems and intensified permanent shifts away from diversified, healthy traditional diets to greater exposure to imported processed foods often high in salt, sugar and fat.” In 2015 Vanuatu was devastated by the category 5 Cyclone Pam, which destroyed reefs, fishing boats and food crops. This was followed by a severe El-Niño-induced drought that further exacerbated food insecurity and led to widespread water scarcity. A teacher on Emae Island, in Vanuatu’s Shepherd Islands, said the cyclone harmed food availability, water security and education for months afterwards. “After Cyclone Pam, the water that belongs to you and me was not very good,” the teacher said. “I had to stop class sometimes – half days – and then we’d eat all together. Sometimes we tell the children not to come to school tomorrow because we don’t have enough food.” In Timor-Leste households affected by drought limit the amount of food they eat, by limiting their portions, reducing the number of meals they eat each day, or selling household assets for food. And in Papua New Guinea, 45% of children are stunted by malnutrition, and more than 15% are wasted, one of the highest rates in the world. Oxfam Australia’s food, climate and humanitarian spokesman, Dr Simon Bradshaw, said the UN report found climate extremes “left 94.9 million people having to rely on humanitarian aid to feed themselves”. “A hot world is a hungry world,” he said. “The cost of failing to act on climate change is being measured in devastating food crises, and more and more people going undernourished.” Bradshaw said Australia’s failure to curb its climate pollution was contributing to increasing global hunger “and inflicting pain and hardship on the world’s most vulnerable communities”. “Resolving conflict and war, tackling the drivers of inequality and poverty, and fighting the causes of climate change are crucial in the global effort to reduce hunger – and Australia has a role to play in each of these areas.”"
"Hurricane Florence is set to bring 50% more rainfall to the US east coast due to human-induced climate change, according to a landmark forecast that has outlined the influence of warming temperatures upon the looming storm. An attribution study by scientists ahead of Florence’s landfall, expected in North Carolina on Thursday, found that the storm will be about 50 miles (80km) larger in diameter than it would be if human activity had not warmed the planet. The hurricane is expected to bring about 50% more precipitation, delivering as much as 20in (51cm) of rainfall in coastal areas, due to climate change. The forecast was completed by researchers at Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “Dangerous climate change is here, it’s not a problem for future generations,” said Michael Wehner, staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “These risks have been permanently increased and we have to accept that fact.” Previous attribution studies have looked at the impact of climate change on hurricanes after the storms occur, such as Hurricane Harvey, which researchers said had three times more rainfall than it would have done without global warming when it crunched into Texas last year. But this is the first such attribution made before a storm actually reaches the shoreline. “We are now confident enough to make forecasts rather than hindcasts,” said Wehner. Scientists were previously reluctant to link individual storms, wildfires or heatwaves to the background trend of climate change. However, the field of attribution science has advanced rapidly, to the point where researchers now feel able to ascertain a level of influence before a disaster even unfolds. “The idea we can’t attribute individual events to climate change is out of date, it’s just no longer true,” said Wehner. “We’ve reached the point where we can say this confidently.” Climate change fuels hurricanes by increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and heightening the warmth of the oceans. Several storms that form in the Atlantic have intensified to unusual strength in recent years, as part of a trend that scientists say is consistent with a warming world. Hurricane Florence peaked as a category four hurricane, threatening winds of 130mph, although it has since weakened slightly. It is still expected to bring a storm surge of up to 13ft (4 metres), plus waves, at the North Carolina coast on Thursday before slowing down and dumping a huge amount of rain, triggering damaging flooding further inland. More than a million people have been told to flee coastal areas, with states of emergency declared in North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Maryland and Washington DC. The National Hurricane Center has called Florence a “storm of a lifetime”. The tempest is expected to have a wide impact, reaching deep into North Carolina. Elvia Walkingstick, a teacher, said even her community in Cherokee, near the Tennessee border, was making preparations for the storm. “There’s a very real possibility it could be that bad, so we will wait to see what happens,” she said. “We are bracing for climate change because we are on the front lines, we are living it. “It’s ignorant and suicidal not to think of climate change as a reality . We’d be dumb to think it isn’t true. Ignorance isn’t an excuse any more.”"
"Global warming means truly global warming. The atmosphere, the oceans, and the ground are all warming. As a result, ice is melting, seas are rising, storms are getting more severe, and droughts are getting worse. But these things are not happening in isolation. The tricky thing about the climate is that things are connected all across the globe. And those connections are revealing changes that may not be obvious at first glance. One such change was exposed in a recent paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters by a team of top scientists from China and Brazil, an instructive video is available here. The scientists focused their study on the Amazon rainforest. There, the year is broken into “wet” and “dry” seasons. The researchers wanted to know how rainfall has changed during the wet seasons over the past few decades.  What they found was astonishing – the rain in this tropical rainforest has increased 180–600 mm (7–24 inches). They learned about the increase in wet-season rainfall by reviewing old weather data – information from rain gauges for example. They also used satellite measurements to complement the rain gauge readings. The trend they found was clear – the rains are increasing. So, any good scientist wants to know why. Why are the rains increasing? What is the main cause? By using the results of state-of-the-art climate calculations, the authors showed that the temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are primarily responsible. The Pacific Ocean water temperature plays a smaller role. This study is really important for a few reasons. First, the Amazon is important for the entire globe’s climate. The rainforest provides about 20% of the Earth’s freshwater. There is a tremendous amount of evaporation from the rainforest into the air. This evaporated water is carried to other parts of the planet where it falls as rain. We call the evaporation/precipitation process a “hydrologic cycle.” This cycle refers to the movement of water throughout the planet; the Amazon is an important engine for the cycle. But the importance of the Amazon is broader than just water. The growth and decay of wood and plant growth there means the Amazon absorbs and emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. Think of the rainforest like the lungs of the planet. They help the planet breathe. The Amazon rainforest also helps transfer heat throughout the Earth’s climate. Energy moves from one location to another with help of processes (such as evaporation and condensation) that originate in the Amazon. In these ways, the Amazon connects far-flung parts of the planet together. What happens in one region like the Pacific Ocean affects the climate elsewhere like the Atlantic Ocean. The way the climate interacts between to distant locations is called “teleconnections.” And the Amazon is a great teleconnector for the planet. Previous researchers who have looked at the Amazon and its changing precipitation have found that the southern part of the rainforest has experienced a long-term increase in rainfall. Researchers have also found changes to the monsoon cycles that affect the rainforest. But with most of these studies looking at the southern Amazon, very little was known about the northern region. What was happening there? Also, most of the early studies looked at changes to rain during the dry season. The authors of this new study wanted to focus on the wet seasons. The authors used six different methods to look at the data. Three methods were based on actual rainfall measurements. Three additional methods were based on a technique called climate reanalysis – essentially combining measurements and climate calculations. The image below, which is from the paper, shows results for the six methods. The blue regions indicate places where the rainfall is increasing. Areas in orange/red correspond to decreasing rainfall. The results correspond to December through May and the trends are based on 1979–2015. The general results are the same, regardless of which of the six methods are used. In particular, in the black box (upper left image), the six methods give very similar results. It doesn’t matter whose inputs are used; the rainfall there is increasing. Only one of the methods (MERRA2) results in some portions of the region with a reversed trend. Next, the authors used their computer calculations to determine what was causing these blue and red patterns. They found that the culprit is the Atlantic Ocean. There has been a very strong warming in the Atlantic, especially off the coast of South America. The warming oceans supercharge the evaporation of ocean water into the atmosphere and change both the amount of water and the amount of energy in the atmosphere. This warming in the Atlantic is responsible for about half of the wet-season precipitation changes in the Amazonian rainforest. What I liked about this study is that the authors have identified another trend in how we feel climate change. We humans are generally interested in things that affect us. An abstract warming world may not lead us to think about consequences to climate change (other than temperature). But in reality, the whole world is connected. What happens to the temperature in one location can affect other aspects of the climate on the other side of the globe. These teleconnections and their changes resulting from human-caused warming are fascinating."
"Political and business leaders gathering in San Francisco for a major climate change summit have committed to moving towards what was once a fantastical thought – the demise of the internal combustion engine in cars, trucks and other vehicles. A group of 26 city, business and regional or state leaders, representing 122 million people around the world, have used the Global Climate Action Summit to call for carmakers to quicken the pace of electric vehicle rollout. Twelve cities, including Santa Monica, Tokyo and Greater Manchester, have pledged to deploy only zero emission buses from 2025.  This follows a move by 19 US cities and counties to increase the number of electric vehicles in their own fleets and promises by businesses such as Ikea, which plans to make its home deliveries emissions-free, to shift away from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. “This demand added together really gives auto companies the message that they need to signal the endgame for the internal combustion engine,” said Helen Clarkson, chief executive of the Climate Group, which is behind the zero-emission vehicle challenge. “When you see cities making these sort of commitments, it creates a new normal in the market. Transport is a bit behind on the curve of the energy transformation but we are really seeing things move now.” The electrification of transport is particularly challenging in the US, where transport is now the largest contributor of greenhouse gases, eclipsing energy, and drivers have opted for larger cars amid low fuel prices. The Trump administration is also in the process of weakening fuel efficiency standards that would push carmakers to expanding their electric vehicle fleets. But mayors at the climate summit - convened by California’s governor, Jerry Brown, who has himself set a target of 5m electric vehicles on the state’s roads – have said they can look to bypass the federal government and help the US catch up to the likes of India, China and the Netherlands, which have all committed to phasing out carbon-polluting cars at some stage. “The clean transportation revolution is now staring us in the face,” said Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles. Garcetti was one of 35 mayors of California cities to write to state regulators last month to demand 100% zero-emission buses by 2040. “Cities are where it is at. It’s more important who is in this house [in reference to San Francisco city hall, where he was speaking] than the White House. We need more zero-emissions cars, trash trucks, buses, whatever.” Nearly 200,000 electric vehicles were sold in the US last year, although relative sales lag behind many other countries, with analysts blaming lack of marketing by large auto firms, cultural attachment to large cars and anxiety over driving range. It is expected that several US cities and states will use the climate summit to pledge an expansion of electric recharge points. Erik Solheim, the UN’s environment chief, said that half of vehicles bought in his native Norway are now electric or hybrid due to a change to tax incentives and allowing electric vehicles to drive in dedicated bus lanes. “With political leadership, it can change a lot faster than people think,” he said. “In Norway you see Nissan Leafs everywhere now. Every city and state should look to see what they can do on this.” Elected officials in the US are not going as far as naming an end date for carbon-emitting vehicles, but advocates for electric vehicles hope even the more modest commitments will provide the momentum to radically change the face of car fleets, thereby helping avoid dangerous climate change and lessen the health impacts of air pollution near roads. “Transportation for a long time has been the lost stepchild because everyone has focused on electricity,” said Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at Ceres. “But we are now seeing electric vehicles becoming cost competitive right at the point of sale due to improvements in battery technology. “There is a gap in awareness and education in the US but once that is bridged, things will change. This is the beginning of the end for the internal combustion engine. Soon, it won’t make sense for automakers to be producing cars on different platforms.”"
"Tree-planting, restoring wetlands and using chemicals to take carbon dioxide from the air will all be needed to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gases in line with government plans, scientists have said. If these measures are taken urgently, they could make enough of a contribution to make the UK “net zero” in terms of carbon emissions by 2050. However, a major programme to bring them into effect would be needed as a matter of urgency.  “We will need to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as well as work on ways to stop emitting so much in the first place,” said Nilay Shah, head of chemical engineering at Imperial College London, and a member of the working group on the report. “The very first thing we need to do is go to a very low number on emissions by 2050. If we work very hard on decarbonising energy and emissions from building and transport and industry, we can bring down emissions to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) by 2050 compared with 450 MtCO2e today.” That remaining 130m tonnes “is very difficult to get rid of”, said Shah, partly as it comes from activities such as agriculture and aviation, which are hard to decarbonise. This left a gap which could only be filled by removing greenhouse gases from the air. In a joint report on greenhouse gas removal, the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering found that increasing the amount of forested land in the UK to 5% of land area could play a major role as trees act as a carbon sink. At the same time, farmers could be encouraged through incentives or subsidies to use their land to store carbon through better farming methods. Restoring natural features such as wetlands and marshes would also store more carbon. Construction companies should also be given incentives to use wood, which is a natural store of carbon, and cement can be manufactured with waste carbon dioxide to offset the emissions from its production. However, while these measures together would account for about a quarter of the carbon reductions needed, technology to remove carbon from the air would also be required, the scientists said. Some of this could be done by capturing carbon emissions at source, such as at power plants. Using bioenergy, such as wood, plants and waste, while capturing the resulting carbon dioxide is technically possible and should be pursued, the scientists urged. But they said other methods, such as direct air capture, would also be needed. Direct air capture usually involves chemical processes called “scrubbing”, which means using compounds that react with carbon dioxide in the air to form new chemicals that can be safely disposed of, locking in the carbon. While scrubbing is commonly used to clean up other emissions, such as coal-plant emissions containing sulphur, using it to remove carbon from the air is difficult and can be costly. The report found that economically encouraging the use of direct air capture would require a price to be put on carbon dioxide, probably of as much as $100 a tonne. Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, called the report “crucially important” for the UK’s low-carbon future. “It shows the UK can take its carbon emissions down to net zero by around mid-century and can do so affordably,” he said. “If anything, it has over-estimated the amount of negative emissions the UK will need, and yet still concludes that we can deliver.” He pointed ahead to a major report coming from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change next month, which is expected to find that the world must achieve net zero emissions by 2050 to meet the Paris agreement targets. After that report, the UK’s statutory government advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, will issue formal advice on how the UK can meet such a target. Black said: “This report, showing it is possible [to achieve net zero emissions], could not have come at a more opportune time.” Direct air capture of carbon dioxide is different from the forms of carbon capture and storage (CCS) attached to power plants, which have been targeted in the past. For most of the past decade, the UK was pursuing carbon capture and storage technologies focused on taking carbon emissions from fossil fuel power plants and storing them under the North Sea, with several companies working on the technology. However, the previous government pulled the plug on those plans and the UK no longer has any pilot projects for CCS from power plants, though other countries have moved ahead with pioneering projects. Shah said CCS for power plants would also be needed, in addition to direct air capture, if the UK is to continue to use fossil fuels. Such plants could all share the same transport and storage infrastructure, bringing down costs."
"There is no such thing as a category 6 hurricane or tropical storm – yet. The highest level – the top of the scale for the most powerful, most devastating hurricane or tropical storm capable of destroying entire cities like New Orleans or New York – is a category 5 storm. Meteorologists and scientists never imagined that there would be a need for a category 6 storm, with winds that exceed 200 miles per hour on a sustained basis, sweeping away everything in its path. Until now, such a storm wasn’t possible, so there was no need for a new category above category 5. Right now, however, there is anywhere from 5 to 8% more water vapor circulating throughout the atmosphere than there was a generation ago. This, combined with warmer temperatures that are driving water up from the deep ocean in places where hurricanes typically form, has created the potential for superstorms that we haven’t seen before – and aren’t really prepared for. This combination of warmer oceans and more water in the earth’s atmosphere – whipsawed by sustained periods of drier and wetter conditions in regions of the world that create superstorms – is now starting to create storms with conditions that look precisely what a category 6 hurricane would look like. No one in America has ever experienced the wrath and fury of a category 6 hurricane, which now genuinely seems possible and realistic. We’ve been lucky. Unofficial category 6 hurricanes have appeared in other parts of the world, and we’re seeing much stronger storms on a regular basis. It’s only a matter of time before one hits the US. When it does, it will come as quite a shock. The devastation we saw in 2017 in Houston, several Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico may actually pale in comparison. Jeff Masters, one of the most respected meteorologists in America, has begun to wonder publicly about the potential for a category 6 hurricane. He launched a lively debate among his colleagues with a provocative post in July of 2016 on the Weather Underground – a thought-provoking piece that prompted the Weather Channel and others to weigh in with their thoughts and theories as well. “A ‘black swan’ hurricane – a storm so extreme and wholly unprecedented that no one could have expected it – hit the Lesser Antilles Islands in October 1780,” Masters wrote to open the post. “Deservedly called The Great Hurricane of 1780, no Atlantic hurricane in history has matched its death toll of 22,000. So intense were the winds of the Great Hurricane that it peeled the bark off of trees – something only EF5 tornadoes with winds in excess of 200mph have been known to do.” Masters then made the startling claim that such a “black swan” hurricane was not only possible now but almost certain to occur more than once. He said that such storms should more properly be called “grey swan” hurricanes because the emerging science clearly showed that such “bark-stripping” mega-storms are nearly certain to start appearing. “Hurricanes even more extreme than the Great Hurricane of 1780 can occur in a warming climate, and can be anticipated by combining physical knowledge with historical data,” wrote Masters, who once flew into the strongest hurricane at the time as one of Noaa’s “Hurricane Hunters” in the 1980s. “Such storms, which have never occurred in the historical record, can be referred to as ‘grey swan’ hurricanes.” Masters based his bold prediction on research by two of the best hurricane scientists in the world – Kerry Emanuel of MIT and Ning Lin of Princeton – who published the most detailed hurricane model in history in August 2015. Emanuel and Lin’s hurricane model was embedded within six different worldwide climate models routinely run by supercomputers. “The term ‘black swan’ is a metaphor for a high-consequence event that comes as a surprise. Some high-consequence events that are unobserved and unanticipated may nevertheless be predictable,” they wrote in Nature Climate Change. “Such events may be referred to as ‘grey swans’ (or, sometimes, ‘perfect storms’). Unlike truly unpredicted and unavoidable black swans, which can be dealt with only by fast reaction and recovery, grey swans – although also novel and outside experience – can be better foreseen and systematically prepared for.” Lin and Emanuel said their research showed that not only were grey swan hurricanes now likely to occur, one such devastating hurricane would almost certainly hit the Persian Gulf region – a place where tropical cyclones have never even been seen in history. They identified a “potentially large risk in the Persian Gulf, where tropical cyclones have never been recorded, and larger-than-expected threats in Cairns, Australia, and Tampa, Florida”. Emanuel and Lin showed that the risk of such extreme grey swan hurricanes in Tampa, Cairns, and the Persian Gulf increased by up to a factor of 14 over time as Earth’s climate changed. In the event of such a storm, city officials may have no idea what they truly face. At least one city planning document (from 2010) anticipated that a category 5 hurricane could cause 2,000 deaths and $250bn in damage. But it could be far worse. “A storm surge of 5 meters is about 17 feet, which would put most of Tampa underwater, even before the sea level rises there,” Emanuel told reporters. “Tampa needs to have a good evacuation plan, and I don’t know if they’re really that aware of the risks they actually face.” A city like Dubai is even more unprepared, Emanuel said. Dubai, and the rest of the Persian Gulf, has never seen a hurricane in recorded history. Any hurricane, of any magnitude, would be an unprecedented event. But his models say that one is likely to occur there at some point. “Dubai is a city that’s undergone a really rapid expansion in recent years, and people who have been building it up have been completely unaware that that city might someday have a severe hurricane,” Emanuel said. “Now they may want to think about elevating buildings or houses, or building a seawall to somehow protect them, just in case.” Following Masters’s provocative post, many of his meteorologist colleagues weighed in. The Weather Channel predicted that a category 6 hurricane, and a change in the scale to accommodate it, may be on its way. “Jeff Masters got the entire weather community thinking: could there be a Category Six hurricane?” Brian Donegan wrote on the network’s site. “Last year, Hurricane Patricia reached maximum sustained winds of 215mph in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.” A fellow meteorologist, Paul Huttner, said Patricia makes it all but certain that we’ll see category 6 hurricanes. “Many meteorological observers [were] stunned at how rapidly Patricia blew up from tropical storm to one of the strongest category 5 hurricanes on earth in just 24 hours,” Huttner wrote for Minnesota Public Radio. Whether we call them category 6 hurricanes – or simply category 5 hurricanes with really fast, violent winds that are up to 60mph above the upper end of the current scale that can appear literally overnight over warm oceans – we need to be ready for these superstorms capable of taking out cities like Dubai or Tampa. They are here, right now. The devastation we saw in Houston, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in the fall of 2017 is a clear warning. We ignore the implications at our peril.

"Global hunger has reverted to levels last seen a decade ago, wiping out progress on improving people’s access to food and leaving one in nine people undernourished last year, with extreme weather a leading cause, the UN has warned. Hunger afflicted 821 million people last year, the third annual rise since 2015, with most regions of Africa and much of South America showing worsening signs of food shortages and malnutrition. More than half a billion of the world’s hungry live in Asia.  The reversal of progress made in slowing malnutrition in the first half of this decade has caused serious concern among international agencies. Climate shocks, such as droughts and floods, were identified by the UN as “among the key drivers” for the rise in 2017, along with conflict and economic slowdowns. Nearly 100 million people were left dependent on humanitarian aid during the year. The UN report covers last year, and does not take account of 2018’s extreme weather which has brought heatwaves and high temperatures to much of the northern hemisphere, accompanied by droughts in some parts of the globe and floods in others. However, the changing climatic trends are likely to spell trouble for years ahead. Robin Willoughby, head of food and climate policy at Oxfam GB, said the last few months were likely to have made the situation even worse, and called on governments to commit funds to help poor countries adapt to the effects of global warming. “The extreme weather we have seen this year is likely to have exacerbated the crisis,” he said. “A hotter world is proving to be a hungrier world.” According to the report, there are more undernourished people in areas of the world that are highly exposed to extremes of climate. The authors note that there have been more frequent spells of extreme heat in the last five years, and that the nature of rainfall is changing in some areas, with rainy seasons starting earlier or later. Staple crops such as wheat, rice and maize are particularly at risk from climate extremes. “It is shocking that, after a prolonged decline, this is the third consecutive year of rising hunger,” said Willoughby. “The inescapable fact is that climate change is now leaving people around the world without enough to eat.” Adapting to climate change can be a matter of switching to less thirsty crops in some areas, and selectively breeding varieties for drought-resistance, or diversifying crops and using natural methods to make the best use of rainfall. Giving farmers access to transport to take their produce to market, and modern technology, such as weather forecasting communications, can also help. The UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018 report, released on Tuesday, is the joint work of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organisation. The heads of the agencies combined to warn of a worsening future, if action is not taken to help people adapt to climate change. “If we are to achieve a world without hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030 [as the sustainable development goals state] it is imperative that we accelerate and scale up actions to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people’s livelihoods in response to climate variability and extremes,” they wrote in the foreword to the report. Cindy Holleman, a senior economist at the FAO and editor of the report, said: “What is alarming about this analysis is that climate variability and climate extremes now are contributing to the rise in hunger. Not just emergency levels of hunger, but chronic hunger. “We see this report as an early warning call that we need to accelerate and scale up climate resilience especially in countries in Africa and Latin America that are most vulnerable.”  She added: “This is the beginning of a very serious situation. We have a target to end hunger by 2030, and we are not going to do that unless we are going to tackle new challenges and the new challenges are climate extremes and variability.”  The analysis also showed that one in eight of the world’s adults – 672 million people – are now obese. This is increasingly regarded as a form of malnutrition associated with poverty, as poor people often lack access to good quality food. Other effects of malnutrition noted include 151 million children under five too short for their age owing to malnutrition, a fall from the 165 million recorded in 2012, with Asia accounting for 55% of the total. One in three women of reproductive age around the world have anaemia, which can also affect the development of their children, and only 40% of babies are breastfed exclusively to six months."
"Scott Morrison says the South Australian Liberal senator Lucy Gichuhi has told him she was not bullied by anyone in Canberra during the government’s leadership crisis, and he says no names of any perpetrators have been provided to him. While Gichuhi suggested clearly last week that she had been bullied – a suggestion that was validated implicitly by the minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, who said government MPs had been intimidated – Morrison told the ABC on Tuesday night the South Australian senator “told me very plainly that she was not bullied by anybody here in Canberra” during the leadership contest.  The prime minister met Gichuhi privately after she signalled she was prepared to name names with the protection of parliamentary privilege. Gichuhi confirmed the conversation earlier on Tuesday, and said Morrison had “taken up the issue”. Regarding bullying in my political career: Yesterday I had a discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Prime Minister has taken up the issue. #auspol We must live and work in a way that respects and enhances ALL freedoms of ALL Australians. Australia says NO to bullying and intimidation. #auspol Morrison said politics was a very “torrid” business and his inquiries to date had not yielded evidence of “gender-specific actions” in relation to what some people would characterise as “very intense lobbying which is fairly normal in the political process, albeit not edifying”. He acknowledged there were some issues relating “to the party divisions and how things are dealt with there” but gave no detail. The prime minister also said he would not support quotas being adopted in the Liberal party to boost female representation in parliament – an idea that has been floated by the Liberals Sussan Ley and Craig Laundy. He said that determination was “a matter for the organisational wing of the Liberal party but [quotas are] never something I have supported”. Even though there is ample evidence that quotas boost the level of female representation both in public and corporate life, Morrison said: “I don’t believe quotas are the way you remove obstacles.” He said he was focused on removing obstacles to women getting preselected. “It’s a matter of supporting women throughout the preselection process, to identify, encourage, support and recruit and then to support them through that process, and then when they get into parliament ensure they’re getting the support they need to do the job,” he said. Morrison was also pressed again to explain why Malcolm Turnbull was no longer the prime minister, given that he was a strong defender of the government’s record, and argued that he didn’t actively seek the top job. The prime minister has tried to move the questioning on from the leadership implosion and on Tuesday night said the government was focused on the future. He said the government had been preoccupied with managing things but further explanation was now required. “What’s important in politics is that people also understand the why’s behind the what.” Even though opinion polls suggest Australian voters are disconcerted by yet another leadership coup, and the Coalition would lose any election held today, the prime minister suggested voters were “disappointed” but used to the turbulence. “I think, sadly, over the last 10 years there have been too many of these changes, on both sides of politics and, I don’t think Australians are as shocked by these things as they used to be,” Morrison said. “They are disappointed.” He struggled to explain the government’s position on climate and energy policy. Asked what the government’s climate policy was, Morrison replied: “Reducing emissions by 26%.” Asked to nominate a policy to drive the emissions reduction, Morrison identified the emissions reduction fund, which was not given any additional funding in the last budget. He suggested further measures would be forthcoming but gave no detail. Morrison declared the government had not changed its emissions reduction policy but the government on Monday took a decision to dump the national energy guarantee, a policy that would have imposed an emissions reduction target for the electricity sector of 26% by 2030. The prime minister has said since taking the top job that Australia will not dump the Paris climate commitment to reduce emissions across the economy by 26%. But in ditching the Neg the government has removed a concrete policy roadmap to drive the emissions reduction. The government does not have policies to drive emissions reduction in sectors of the economy where emissions are now rising. The Energy Security Board has predicted that emissions in the electricity sector will be 24% lower by 2021 courtesy of a big build of renewable energy pulled through by the renewable energy target, which is also contributing to lower wholesale prices. But the ESB has said electricity will not reach a 26% reduction in the absence of the Neg. Even if the the ESB projections are wrong, and the electricity sector managed to reduce emissions by 26% with no policy to drive that result, the Paris target Australia has signed up to applies across the economy, not just to the electricity sector, and the government’s own data shows emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising."
"More voters in the electorate of the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, support an emissions reduction target for electricity and a higher national target than the Paris commitment than oppose those positions. A ReachTel poll of 690 residents across the federal electorate of Hume, which reaches from Boorowa in the southern tablelands of New South Wales to Camden on Sydney’s southern fringe, was commissioned by the Australia Institute. It found the sample was divided over a range of climate and energy questions, but more people supported stronger action on emissions reduction than opposed it.  Asked whether the government’s Paris target of 26% to 28% should be increased “so Australia reduces emissions faster, decreased so Australia does less, or kept the same” – 42.3% said increased, 29.4% said kept the same, and 22.5% said reduced. Asked whether the now dumped national energy guarantee should include an emissions reduction target, 47.8% said yes, and 39.3% said no. There was also local opposition to coal, with 63.7% of the sample either supporting or strongly supporting a moratorium on building new coal mines, while 67.4% supported the Morrison government reviewing the Adani coal mine’s environmental approval. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said the poll results suggested voters in rural electorates, “just like the population overall, are not enamoured with coal and they want more action on climate change, not less”. Taylor confirmed in question time on Tuesday that the Morrison government would not replace the renewable energy target with an alternative policy after it wound down in 2020. Taylor confirmed there would be no policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector during an answer to the Greens MP Adam Bandt in question time on Tuesday. Bandt asked whether the RET could be extended beyond 2020 given there was currently no policy mechanism to replace it, and the lack of settled policy could threaten investment in low-emissions technology. The energy minister flatly rejected the idea. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything.” Taylor said there was no need to focus on emissions reduction, because emissions in electricity would fall by 26% “without additional intervention” – a declaration that contradicts advice from the Energy Security Board. The Coalition’s plan to 2030 was to replace the RET with the national energy guarantee, which imposed an emissions reduction target for electricity. But Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the Neg as one of his last acts in the prime ministership, and the policy has now been junked officially by the cabinet under Scott Morrison’s leadership. Bandt later declared the Liberals were “openly boasting that they have no renewable energy policy”. He said the RET needed to be extended beyond 2020 “to avoid a valley of death for renewable energy”. “Over 2018 and 2019, new renewables are going up in Australia at record rates. This is in large part due to the RET, which even the Energy Security Board and Reserve Bank have said is a big driver of future power bill cuts,” Bandt said. “But the RET runs out in 2020 and now the minister has confirmed that there’s no renewables policy to take its place. If the RET isn’t extended, there’s a real risk that the next government will not be able to implement a new policy in time to avoid an investment drought.” Labor also jumped on Taylor’s declaration. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, branded Taylor the minister “for higher power prices and anti-renewables”. .@AngusTaylorMP in #qt ""the (RET) target reaches a peak in 2020 and we will not be replacing that with anything."" Extraordinarily confirmation the Liberals will have no energy policy! He's the Minister for higher power prices and anti-renewables #auspol"
"One day in 1961, an American economist named Daniel Ellsberg stumbled across a piece of paper with apocalyptic implications. Ellsberg, who was advising the US government on its secret nuclear war plans, had discovered a document that contained an official estimate of the death toll in a preemptive “first strike” on China and the Soviet Union: 300 million in those countries, and double that globally. Ellsberg was troubled that such a plan existed; years later, he tried to leak the details of nuclear annihilation to the public. Although his attempt failed, Ellsberg would become famous instead for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers – the US government’s secret history of its military intervention in Vietnam.  America’s amoral military planning during the Cold War echoes the hubris exhibited by another cast of characters gambling with the fate of humanity. Recently, secret documents have been unearthed detailing what the energy industry knew about the links between their products and global warming. But, unlike the government’s nuclear plans, what the industry detailed was put into action. In the 1980s, oil companies like Exxon and Shell carried out internal assessments of the carbon dioxide released by fossil fuels, and forecast the planetary consequences of these emissions. In 1982, for example, Exxon predicted that by about 2060, CO2 levels would reach around 560 parts per million – double the preindustrial level – and that this would push the planet’s average temperatures up by about 2°C over then-current levels (and even more compared to pre-industrial levels). Later that decade, in 1988, an internal report by Shell projected similar effects but also found that CO2 could double even earlier, by 2030. Privately, these companies did not dispute the links between their products, global warming, and ecological calamity. On the contrary, their research confirmed the connections. Shell’s assessment foresaw a one-meter sea-level rise, and noted that warming could also fuel disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, resulting in a worldwide rise in sea level of “five to six meters.” That would be enough to inundate entire low-lying countries. Shell’s analysts also warned of the “disappearance of specific ecosystems or habitat destruction,” predicted an increase in “runoff, destructive floods, and inundation of low-lying farmland,” and said that “new sources of freshwater would be required” to compensate for changes in precipitation. Global changes in air temperature would also “drastically change the way people live and work.” All told, Shell concluded, “the changes may be the greatest in recorded history.” For its part, Exxon warned of “potentially catastrophic events that must be considered.” Like Shell’s experts, Exxon’s scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like. Looking on the bright side, the company expressed its confidence that “this problem is not as significant to mankind as a nuclear holocaust or world famine.” The documents make for frightening reading. And the effect is all the more chilling in view of the oil giants’ refusal to warn the public about the damage that their own researchers predicted. Shell’s report, marked “confidential,” was first disclosed by a Dutch news organization earlier this year. Exxon’s study was not intended for external distribution, either; it was leaked in 2015. Nor did the companies ever take responsibility for their products. In Shell’s study, the firm argued that the “main burden” of addressing climate change rests not with the energy industry, but with governments and consumers. That argument might have made sense if oil executives, including those from Exxon and Shell, had not later lied about climate change and actively prevented governments from enacting clean-energy policies. Although the details of global warming were foreign to most people in the 1980s, among the few who had a better idea than most were the companies contributing the most to it. Despite scientific uncertainties, the bottom line was this: oil firms recognized that their products added CO2 to the atmosphere, understood that this would lead to warming, and calculated the likely consequences. And then they chose to accept those risks on our behalf, at our expense, and without our knowledge. The catastrophic nuclear war plans that Ellsberg saw in the 1960s were a Sword of Damocles that fortunately never fell. But the oil industry’s secret climate change predictions are becoming reality, and not by accident. Fossil-fuel producers willfully drove us toward the grim future they feared by promoting their products, lying about the effects, and aggressively defending their share of the energy market. As the world warms, the building blocks of our planet – its ice sheets, forests, and atmospheric and ocean currents – are being altered beyond repair. Who has the right to foresee such damage and then choose to fulfill the prophecy? Although war planners and fossil-fuel companies had the arrogance to decide what level of devastation was appropriate for humanity, only Big Oil had the temerity to follow through. That, of course, is one time too many. Benjamin Franta, a former research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is a doctoral candidate at Stanford University, where his research focuses on the history of climate science and politics. An earlier version of this piece, entitled “Global Warming’s Paper Trail”, was published on Sept. 12, 2018 by Project Syndicate."
"High up on a melting Greenland glacier, at the end of this summer from climate hell, two young women shout a poem above the roar of the wind. Aka Niviana, grew up on the northern coast of Greenland; as its ice inexorably thaws, her traditional way of life disappears. And the water that melts off that ice sheet is drowning the home of Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner and everyone else in her home nation, the Marshall Islands of the Pacific. One poet watches her heritage turn to water; the other watches that same water sweep up the beaches of her country and into the houses of her friends. The destruction of one’s homeland is the inevitable destruction of the other’s. I’ve spent 30 years thinking about climate change – talking with scientists, economists and politicians about emission rates and carbon taxes and treaties. But the hardest idea to get across is also the simplest: we live on a planet, and that planet is breaking. Poets, it turns out, can deliver that message. But they don’t watch impassively. Both are climate activists, and both have raised their voices in service of their homelands. Jetnil-Kijiner, 30, has been at it for years – she’s performed her work before the United Nations General Assembly and the Vatican. Niviana is newer to activism – just 23, she recited a poem at a recent Copenhagen climate protest, where she met a well-known glaciologist, Jason Box, and he, in turn, organised the complicated logistics of this glacier expedition. We’ve come with a video crew to the remote fjords of southern Greenland. After two days travelling by boat, we’ve unloaded our gear on the rocks at the foot of the rapidly dwindling glacier, and hauled it up to a base camp nestled on red granite bedrock next to a cascade fed by thundering meltwater. Now, in a cold wind next to a gaping crevasse, the two women are performing the words they’ve spent weeks writing. Jason Box says there’s no doubt they’re both correct: all told, Greenland has enough water frozen on its rocky mantle to raise the sea by seven metres. After 25 years of field work on the great ice sheet, he understands its significance like few others: right now, there’s no place on earth contributing more to the rise of the oceans. Eventually the even-vaster Antarctic will produce more water, but for now the Arctic is melting much faster (while we were camped on the glacier news reports said that sea ice north of the island – “the oldest, solidest ice in the Arctic” – had melted in this year’s freakish heat). “We called this ‘Eagle Glacier’ because of its shape when we first came here five years ago,” Box said, “but now the head and the wings of the bird have melted away. I don’t know what we should call it now, but the eagle is dead.” It’s not, of course, as if global warming is some mysterious, uncontrollable force: it comes from a particular way of life, a way of life which has left some people rich and an increasing number in desperate straits. These poets can’t avoid the politics: their stanzas indict the civilisations which – long before we worried about climate change – blew up Bikini Atoll in the Marshalls and polluted Greenland’s ice sheet with nuclear waste. Hearing the roll call of giant cities in the poem seems odd at first, on this remote glacier thousands of miles from the nearest traffic jam. But that’s the point. There is no distance any more: the isolation that once protected places like Greenland or Micronesia no longer offers any buffer. The carbon that the rich pour into the air traps heat in the atmosphere we all share. That heat comes north and south, where it melts the world’s great storehouses of ice; in turn the oceans that lap at every continent rise. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner literally stands with two feet planted on the ice that will submerge her country. This science is uncontroversial. But science alone can’t make change, because it appeals only to the hemisphere of the brain that values logic and reason. We’re also creatures of emotion, intuition, spark – which is perhaps why we should mount more poetry expeditions, put more musicians on dying reefs, make sure that novelists can feel the licking heat of wildfire. Alun Hubbard, a Welsh glaciologist who was carrying huge loads of supplies up the glacier to build base camp, remembered his first visits to thawing Greenland. “It’s just gobsmacking looking at the trauma of the landscape. I just couldn’t register the scale of how the icesheet had changed in my head.” But artists can register those thoughts, and turn them into images that potentially unite us. And that unity is precisely what’s required, because otherwise inertia – and the political power of the fossil fuel companies – seems destined to slow our transition to renewable energy. Slow it enough that the ancient ways of life that gave rise to these young women will warp and then disappear. Slow it enough that everyone everywhere will feel the pain their communities are already feeling. These poets are up on the ice hoping that they can somehow rouse more of the world to action.  The very same beasts That now decide Who should live And who should die … We demand that the world see beyond SUVs, ACs, their pre-package convenience Their oil-slicked dreams, beyond the belief That tomorrow will never happen And yet there’s a generosity to their witness – a recognition that whoever started the trouble, we’re now in it together. Let me bring my home to yours Let’s watch as Miami, New York, Shanghai, Amsterdam, London Rio de Janeiro and Osaka Try to breathe underwater … None of us is immune. Life in all forms demands The same respect we all give to money … So each and every one of us Has to decide If we Will Rise • Bill McKibben wrote the first book about climate change, The End of Nature, in 1989, and co-founded 350.org, which has become the planet’s largest grassroots climate campaign.

"We want Guardian supporters to help us better understand the changes taking place in the natural world, and how we might combat the demise of some of the plants and creatures with whom we share the planet. Which local species of fauna and flora are disappearing from your local area? What is being done to preserve and protect them – and with how much success? Perhaps you work in conservation and would like to tell us about the work you’re doing, or are simply a nature enthusiast who cares about protecting a particular species. In this month’s episode, our panel will be responding to your questions on this subject, so we’d love you to get in touch, wherever you are in the world. Guardian columnist George Monbiot recently wrote about the demise of many aspects of the natural world, citing a UN report that our use of natural resources has tripled in 40 years. The great expansion of mining, logging, meat production and industrial fishing is cleansing the planet of its wild places and natural wonders. What economists proclaim as progress, ecologists recognise as ruin. “Walking in the countryside or snorkelling in the sea”, he says, “is now as painful to me as an art lover would find visits to a gallery, if on every occasion another old master had been cut from its frame.”  The reaction to this piece and others by Monbiot demonstrates that this is a subject close to our readers’ hearts. But then, it always has been: the Guardian’s century-old column Country Diary, which looks at natural history and the countryside, has been a readers’ favourite since it began. We have also looked at the uncertain fate of the much-loved puffin in places such as Scotland, Norway and Iceland. And even the impact of Brexit on seabirds and dolphins. We are committed to quality environment coverage, but with each generation, another aspect of our environment is lost, and preserving what came before becomes even more difficult. In Trump’s America, a commitment to protecting endangered animals has been caught in the crosshairs of a drive by the president to increase industry – a move which many have described as short-term thinking at its worst. In his opinion piece on the topic, Andrew Rosenberg says: “Wolves, bears, sage grouse: these are animals of incredible beauty that enrich our ecological landscape. But other, less charismatic species, like burying beetles and freshwater mussels, are at risk too – all because their presence is inconvenient for some economic activities. Unfortunately, species are not just ‘nice to have’. They are part of living, breathing ecosystems.” There is a slowly increasing awareness of the impact of human behaviour on the natural world. For some species, it sadly is too late to take action, and for others – endangered or at risk of becoming so – there is a lot of work to be done. Please do get in touch, wherever you are in the world: we would like to hear your questions, views and experiences. To get involved, send an email to weneedtotalkabout@theguardian.com, including your question or comment, your name, and a phone number so we can call you to make a recording.

"A growing number of Australians are concerned about the impact of climate change, and more than half of a survey of 1,756 voters believe the Morrison government needs to stay in the Paris agreement, despite Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US. A study tracking voter sentiment for more than a decade, funded first by the Climate Institute and now by the Australia Institute, finds 73% (up from 66% in 2017) of respondents concerned about climate change, and a clear majority, 68%, believes the government should set domestic targets to comply with our Paris commitments.  An increased 67% want coal-fired power to be phased out within 20 years, up from 61% in 2017. The findings suggest the Morrison government is politically vulnerable on climate change at the next federal election. The prime minister has declared Australia will not pull out of Paris but also abandoned the national energy guarantee that imposed an emissions reduction target on the electricity sector. The former prime minister Tony Abbott on Tuesday reignited his push to scrap subsidies for renewable energy, taking on the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, at his first meeting of the government’s backbench energy and environment committee. Another outspoken conservative, Craig Kelly, also asked how he was meant to respond to questions about the government’s commitment to staying in the Paris climate agreement when it was completely unclear how the Paris commitments would be met. With a drought crippling swathes of regional Australia, a majority of voters (67%) in the bush believe the government is not doing enough to prepare for or adapt to the impacts of global warming. This compares to 56% of capital city residents. There has also been a shift in the attitudes of people voting for the National party and for One Nation. While those voters are still more likely than others to think the impact of climate change is being exaggerated, the number of people agreeing with that statement has dropped to 20%, down from 32% in 2017, for Nationals voters, and to 22%, down from 28%, for One Nation voters. With the Bureau of Meteorology predicting that southern and south-eastern parts of the country could face an early summer heatwave after experiencing the 12th driest winter on record, public concern is escalating about heatwaves and water shortages. When asked about the specific impacts of climate change, the top three issues Australians expressed concern about were droughts (78%, up four points in a year), the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef (77%, up four points) and bushfires (76%, up five points). More than half the sample, 53%, think governments are not doing enough to deal with climate change threats – a perception reinforced by a decade of partisan warfare on the issue. On energy, 55% of the sample blame power companies for high electricity prices, with 52% pointing the finger at privatisation, 41% identifying poor policy making and 29% renewable energy sources. More than half the sample feels the government should invest in renewable energy generation and storage, with only 7% favouring government investment in coal, oil and gas. The sample is divided over who should pay the costs of climate action, with 38% saying big polluters, 21% saying taxpayers and 10% saying the people facing climate change impacts. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said: “The public want lower power prices and action on climate change. “The good news is the economics of renewables means they can have both. The results of the research make clear any party that fails to address both price and emissions will be punished at the ballot box.” The former Liberal party leader and Australian National University professor John Hewson said the research indicated Australians were prepared to support “far more ambitious climate and energy policies than governments of either persuasion have delivered”."
"Emissions reduction targets, even relatively ambitious ones, will not drive up power prices for Australian consumers, according to new research from the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. While the Morrison government has abandoned the national energy guarantee because conservatives complain that emissions reduction policies drive up power prices, the new research finds that critique is misguided. Power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios modelled by Frontier Economics – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%. The research says the price reductions would vary state-by-state, but business as usual would result in an average saving of 18.5%. Under the 26% scenario – which is the government’s now abandoned electricity target – the average saving would be 20.8%; under the 45% scenario, which is Labor’s target, the average saving would be 18.3%; and under the 65% scenario, the average saving would be 15.0%. The savings are forecast by taking the residential retail price for 2030 for Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, and creating an average. The modelling shows the benefits for households would increase if the government allowed emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries to be part of the emissions reduction effort, rather than excluding them, as was proposed under the now defunct Neg. The chief executive of Acoss, Cassandra Goldie, told Guardian Australia the Frontier modelling made it clear that a variety of emissions reduction policies – the Neg, a clean energy target or an emissions intensity scheme “with the right settings” – could drive more rapid emissions reductions in the electricity sector and contribute to lower power bills. “The idea that we need to choose between cheaper energy prices and limiting global warming is misleading and short-sighted, and does a huge disservice to our community, especially to people on low incomes,” Goldie said. “People on low incomes are the most vulnerable to both escalating electricity prices and the effects of global warming. We must tackle both. Both are a social justice issue.” The Neg, which would have imposed a 26% emissions reduction target on the electricity sector by 2030, has been shelved because the Coalition’s internal fight over emissions reduction got tangled up in the leadership war that resulted in Malcolm Turnbull being deposed and Scott Morrison taking over as leader. Since junking the Neg, the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, has recommitted the government to pursuing heavy-handed interventions in the energy market worked up in the last days of the Turnbull government, including “last resort” divestiture powers to break up power companies if they engage in price gouging, and default pricing for consumers. Taylor, who Morrison has dubbed the minister for lowering power prices, is also working up fresh options to take to cabinet. The Greens are calling on the Coalition and Labor to allow the existing renewable energy target to be extended for the life of the next parliament. The Greens climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said rolling over the RET would allow “the renewables boom to continue while the climate and energy policy impasse is resolved after the next election”. Bandt said the big build of renewable energy coming into the national electricity market courtesy of the RET was playing a significant role in driving down power prices, but the scheme wound down from 2020, and there was no clear sense of how the current energy policy deadlock would be resolved. The latest renewable energy index compiled by Green Energy Markets has confirmed analysis by the Energy Security Board that wholesale electricity prices are on the way down because of an addition of 7,200 megawatts of extra large-scale supply from renewable energy. “Our preference is to increase and extend the RET until 2030, but an interim measure to 2022 is needed to avoid an investment freeze in renewable energy,” Bandt said. “If the RET isn’t extended, there’s a real risk that the next government will not be able to implement a new policy in time to avoid an investment drought.”"
"When the coastal town of Wrightsville Beach, which buffers nearby Wilmington from the open ocean, began to come back to life on Wednesday after Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina, many people returning home were surprisingly relieved. Despite Florence roaring ashore in this exact spot last Friday and now causing catastrophic flooding inland, the hurricane had not destroyed the beach, as many had expected.   That could be because the US army corps of engineers and the state and local government this winter spent more than $9m dumping sand onto the beach to build it up, in a precarious and controversial effort to hold back nature. The corps has done this every four years for more than 30 years – and is now approaching a spending cap for the project. Maintaining beaches this way, through what is called “renourishment”, will soon be more complicated than just finding funding, however. Sea levels will rise up to several feet by 2100, and tougher hurricanes are likely to form in a warmer ocean, whirling in and repeatedly beating against the coast. With Wrightsville Beach, the city of Wilmington and the wider Carolinas suffering one of the region’s worst storms of all time, expensive, human-bolstered beaches like this one won’t work, ultimately. That will be a problem, not just on the eastern seaboard, but everywhere with a beach. Rising oceans could also destroy two-thirds of southern California’s beaches by the end of the century, experts predict. Some scientists have begun to argue for a retreat from the shore, after relentless development, but are emphatically shot down, particularly after a disaster. On Wednesday, visiting the storm zone, Donald Trump was upbeat about recovery from the hurricane. But scientists are alarmed. “Within a decade or two or three, it depends on where you are, we’re looking for a time when beach nourishment doesn’t work, so what do we do next?” asked Orrin Pilkey, an emeritus geology professor and coastal expert at Duke University. “Nobody, I don’t think, is thinking about how, when sea level rises, beach nourishment will be out of the question, will be economically impossible.” The corps remakes beaches that are eroding from waves in an attempt to brace against major storms. It is hard to immediately determine how much sand survived after a storm. A beach can flatten out and look normal but have lost significant mass. The corps is assessing the damages, but the Wrightsville Beach town manager, Tim Owens, said the area was lucky the storm landed where it did and wasn’t more intense and that renourishment “did what it was supposed to do, kept the water from overwashing and taking over property and infrastructure”. While the replenished beach seemed to help, Owens said “all bets are off when you have a category 4 storm or 5 storm.” Florence landed as a category 1 but easily could have slammed into North Carolina with higher winds. Asked about Pilkey’s retreat proposal, however, Owens quickly interjected. “It won’t happen. It just won’t happen until it’s absolutely necessary … I won’t have to worry about it. It will be after my lifetime,” he said. Typically, the US government pays for 65% of storm protection projects on public beaches. In Wrightsville Beach, the state and the town together pay the other 35%, with the town using revenues from a tax on room rentals. Sometimes after a disaster, the federal government pays to make a beach whole again. Owens said Wrightsville Beach may inquire about a touch-up following the hurricane. Natalie English, the president of the Wilmington chamber of commerce, said the projects are a way of life on the coast, where tourism is a significant part of the economy. “I think there’s been a lot of claims that beaches have been obliterated in North Carolina, English said. “I think it’s best that people understand that’s not the case. We will have a strong robust tourism economy again. We will be right back where we were.” Erin Carey, the coastal coordinator for the North Carolina chapter of the environmental group the Sierra Club, lives about a mile and a half from Wrightsville Beach and was at headquarters in Raleigh earlier this week after evacuating. Carey said: “When people fall in love with a place like they do with Wrightsville Beach, it will take an act of God or nature – maybe not even that – to pull them away.” Because North Carolina has a law prohibiting more invasive seawalls, renourishment is seen as the main option for protecting development along the ocean. State lawmakers in 2012 also barred state agencies from considering long-term predictions of sea level rise.  North Carolina has about 320 miles of shoreline, with around half owned publicly and half privately, said Andrew Coburn, the associate director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina. Most developed coastline has been supplemented with extra sand in many states, he said. Coburn said the effectiveness is unproven.  “The bottom line is we just do not have any evidence that spending that much money nourishing shorelines is even close to worth it,” Coburn said.   If the government is always willing to step in and recreate a beach, people will keep buying and building in vulnerable places, he warned. “We are artificially changing shorelines and trying to make shorelines do what we want them to do,” Coburn said. “The problem is they’re going to do what they’re going to do.” David Cignotti, who was mayor of Wrightsville Beach until the end of 2013, said beach towns are stashing away money in case the federal government ever stops paying for restoration. “These beaches are used by people from all over the country … To me it’s worth it, ” he said. Cignotti, who acknowledges climate change, favors stronger federal restrictions on development. “It would be good to see our government not be one of only a couple in world that’s in denial this is happening,” Cignotti said."
"Scientists warn that human-induced climate change is responsible for an increase in the number and severity of storms – such as Hurricane Florence, which has engulfed the Carolinas in the last week. But many who weathered the tempest, deep in Trump country, don’t believe global warming fueled it and don’t think humans are the problem – or the solution.  As the world’s oceans warm at a faster rate, hurricanes become more likely, and there has been an increase in storms since the start of the 20th century. Experts warn more numerous and even more ferocious hurricanes are on the way, and the US government is not addressing the central issue even as America’s coasts get battered and inland areas inundated. But based on the evidence in North Carolina on Wednesday, the random man and woman in the street is still not convinced about the science – even those who have faced two major storms in two years. “We live on the coast. It’s cyclical,” said Bob Slattery. “We may get two or three in a year, then go four or five years with nothing,” he added. Slattery, 74, and his wife Gerda, 73, were sitting in the pretty downtown area of Fayetteville on Wednesday. The couple live six miles south-west of Fayetteville and weren’t hit too badly by the storm, but much of the city was, as the Cape Fear river reached record flood levels, spilling over its banks into neighborhoods and roads. While miles of North Carolina is inundated, downtown Fayettevillehad been fortunate enough to avoid flooding this week, although locals said a wine bar roof had partly caved in. “There’s a group of people that want to control things, and they’re using climate change to control things, and they want to put a tax on things,” Bob Slattery said. There is scant evidence for a shady group using the concept of climate change to control and tax society – but it appears there is wider support for the theory in these parts. “That’s our opinion,” Gerda Slattery said. “And many other people I speak to think that, too,” Bob Slattery said. Florence hit North Carolina just two years after Hurricane Matthew blew through the state. Matthew set a slew of unwanted flooding records in October 2016 and at the time was described as a “once in a 500 year event”. But just 23 months later, Florence has shattered that prediction, surpassing Matthew’s flooding totals and in many places having a worse impact. Despite the proximity of the storms, and expert views, some believe the science is overblown and it’s no more than natural global rhythms. “It comes down to cyclical climate change,” said Matthew Coe. “I don’t think we play as big a factor in climate change as people say we do – when you think of the fact that the sea level rises naturally anyways.” Coe 37, originally from Florida, is studying for an associate’s degree, alongside working at a downtown Fayetteville cafe. He lost power for three days after Florence roared in. “Mother Nature is its own entity,” he said. “Whatever happens, it’ll fix itself eventually.” He pointed out that there had been fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature before, and predicted there could be another “ice age” which would correct the current trajectory of the climate. “I think everything is hyped up a bit,” he said. In his opinion, there are “scientists on both sides” of the climate change argument. There is actually a 97% expert consensus among climate scientists that humans are responsible for global warming, although Coe and the Slatterys are far from alone in their beliefs: a 2016 Pew Research Center study found that 51% of Americans do not believe global climate change is due to human activity. Donald Trump is among the 51% – or at least was in 2015. That year he wrote in his book Crippled America that climate change was not human-caused, although he did not explain the reasoning behind his belief. During the 2016 presidential election, he called it a Chinese hoax. On Wednesday he was in North Carolina and South Carolina, promising “100% support” to displaced residents and those with flooded neighborhoods and power outages, but not mentioning measures to deal with climate change, different impacts on rich and poor, or coastal over-development. Further along Hay Street, the thoroughfare through downtown Fayetteville, the retired air force member Andre Altman was sitting in the Huske Hardware House bar. “Ask Mother Nature,” said Altman, 57. He echoed Coe’s belief that Earth’s capricious matriarch could be responsible for climate change and the ensuing increase in the number and force of storms. “Really the Earth goes through cycles. So it’s just we’re on that particular cycle where we’re grabbing more storms,” Altman said. “Back in the industrial age we were burning coal and it didn’t get hotter then.” Despite his belief that climate change was mostly a natural phenomenon, Altman accepted some of the science that said man was also to blame. He recycles, he said, but believes his own actions are likely to have little impact. “I try to worry about what I can affect. If I could actually do something about it, I would,” Altman said. “But I’m not in politics.”"

"Australia’s commitment to global development has improved over the past year, driven by strong trade, education and finance outreach to the developing world, but it has been criticised for its poor action on the environment and climate change. The Centre for Global Development annually ranks 27 wealthy countries on their commitment to development across the policy areas of aid, finance, technology, environment, trade, security and migration.  The Commitment to Development Index is dominated by Scandinavian countries – which fill the top three spots – and European countries, which complete the top 12. The world’s biggest economy, the US, is at number 23 on the list: it has the worst aid and finance ranking of the assessed countries. Australia trails New Zealand (13th), in 14th position overall, with a jump of four spots on last year. Australia and New Zealand are the highest ranked non-European nations on the index. Report author, Ian Mitchell, said: “Australia’s trade policies are among the most development-friendly and the foreign aid it gives is high quality. But if Australia wants to become a development leader, it needs to increase the quantity of aid, and tackle environmental issues and focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” The report said that, on the environment, Australia was a laggard. “Its low rank is largely due to its poor performance curbing climate change. It has very low gasoline taxes (only the United States and Canada have lower), high fossil fuel production and the highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita of all [index] countries, although it has also had among the steepest emissions reductions over the past 10 years. “Australia is also the third-largest tropical timber importer.” Australia has a strong trade rating in the index, ranking third of all countries on that policy, with low tariffs and agricultural subsidies. “It’s a leader in providing equal access to goods from development countries … its barriers to trade in services are also low,” the report said. It also ranks well on migration “in part because of its exceptionally open borders for students from developing countries”. “Its integration policies are also above average. But Australia could improve the number of refugees and asylum seekers it accepts. The proportion of positive asylum decisions is below average and has fallen for the past three years. The number of refugees in Australia is below average relative to population and relative to land area.” The report also said Australia’s treatment of migrants would be improved by ratifying the convention on the treatment of migrant workers and the migration for employment convention. Australia has dedicated just 0.23% of its gross national income towards development assistance, a decrease on 2016, and its smallest contribution in 15 years. Australia’s aid contribution has been falling for half a decade. The UN set out the 0.7% commitment to development spending in 1970, and it has been consistently reaffirmed as a benchmark since. But few countries meet it. “[Australia’s] foreign aid is of good quality, however,” the report found. “Australia spends 70% of its aid bilaterally and 30% multilaterally.” Mitchell told Guardian Australia that the dominance of Scandinavian and European countries was a product of historical commitment, community expectation and conscious government policy. “When you talk to the officials in these countries, they take it competitively, it’s something that has a profile in the public arena, it’s a matter of pride in their public policy.” He said the 0.7% of GNI target for aid spending – when compared with Nato’s declared 2% goal for defence budgets – was a sensible and achievable target. “I think if all the countries got there, the acceleration of development would be substantial, and we’d live in a much more prosperous world, and that would be to the benefit of everybody and every country’s national interest.” But Mitchell said the current global uncertainty – the retreat to economic isolationism through tariffs and trade wars, and the rise of populist nationalism – was a threat to the progress and prosperity of developing countries. “I think the move against migation, against open trade, will damage development. We’ve had a remarkable period of development over the last half a century, with open trade, rising aid levels. And I think that’s in real danger.” The president of the Centre for Global Development, Masood Ahmed, said: “Good development policy is about much more than foreign aid. “While aid is important, policymakers in rich countries need to assess all the ways their choices, from the environment to trade to migration, help or hinder developing countries.”"
"Senior figures representing US states, cities and businesses rebelling against Donald Trump’s denial of climate change are swarming San Francisco this week to proclaim their own efforts to meet US commitments to cut greenhouse gases. The two-day Global Climate Action Summit beginning Thursday will also feature diplomats and mayors from around the world. As well, chief executives of Fortune 500 companies and celebrities ranging from actor Harrison Ford to primatologist Jane Goodall all plan to be there.  Local governments and corporations will announce new goals to boost renewable energy and run more sustainably. America’s Pledge – a group led by California Governor Jerry Brown and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg – will unveil how close the US could come to the climate pollution reductions the Obama administration promised the world in Paris in 2015. Trump pulled out of that accord shortly after he became president in 2017. International climate policy negotiators and environmental advocates will be watching for measurable commitments and for climate-friendly political leaders, especially Brown, to do more than they have in the past, said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. In a little over a year, the US has seen an uptick in devastating hurricanes, record-breaking wildfires and summer heat waves that are likely to become the new normal. “The goal posts have changed. What used to be seen as leadership and was good enough then is just not adequate now,” Morgan said. “What was seen as radical should be common sense. The bar has been lifted.” The world is not on track to prevent catastrophic warming, to keep temperatures from increasing more than 2C (3.6F), Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, said earlier this month. The US vowed to cut its own greenhouse gas levels by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 – but is not on a trajectory to fulfill that promise. At best, the country could make it to 23%, according to an analysis by the economic data firm Rhodium Group. At worst, it might curb emissions only 11%. Those numbers are based on current policies, depending on how much carbon dioxide forests can absorb and on energy prices and the state of the economy. The Trump administration’s rollbacks, including of plans to limit pollution from coal plants and cars, are equal to forfeiting about 1% of reductions, said John Larsen, a director at Rhodium. The reversals could have a bigger stalling effect over time. Most US progress is happening in electricity, which makes up less than one-third of the country’s climate pollution. And that progress could halt in 2030 if nuclear plants shut down and are replaced with natural gas power, according to Rhodium. With the White House absent on climate change, activists say the work of states and cities becomes more critical than ever. “We’re starting to reach a point where there’s widespread realization that the non-federal actors can take us a good part of the way,” said Andrew Light, a climate negotiator under Obama who is now with the World Resources Institute. But, “they can only take us so far unless they’re able to scale up action.” Light said the summit could offer an opportunity for international experts and investors to offer help to US climate advocates. Amir Jina, a post-doctoral scholar at the Climate Impact Lab collaborative group and professor at the University of Chicago, said the last year and a half in the US has been a harbinger for the future of climate change. Hurricanes are likely to become more intense, rapid sea-level rise will exacerbate dangerous storm surge, some regions will see record rainfall, and others will struggle with drought. The world can pay far less now to limit those effects or far more later to adapt to them, Jina said. As temperatures rise, impacts will become more severe, and they will be uneven across the US, Jina and his colleagues’ research shows. Climate change on its current path will be a drag on the economy, slowing gross domestic product 4% or 5% annually, Jina said. If the world limited warming to 2C , as the Paris agreement intends, that number would be closer to 0.5% or 1.5%. “It might seem like a small amount, this is 4% of your income, but because we see this unequal impact, it’s important to think of not what the overall effect is but who is being affected,” Jina said. In some parts of the US, climate change could decrease GDP 20% to 25% below where it would be without the effects of climate change, Jina warned. California, on the front lines of climate change with wildfires, mudslides and a warming, rising ocean, has been a leader in the US environmental movement, but activists are pressuring Brown to do more, such as phase out oil and gas drilling. “The progress that we’ve made in California on renewables is exciting and it’s also nowhere close to enough,” said Miya Yoshitani, executive director at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.  At the same time, even if the Paris agreement is successful, many countries will suffer. The Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles, for example, which is reliant on tourism, is already facing drought, changes in fisheries, dying coral reefs and eroding beaches. “It’s possible island states become economically unviable before they are covered by the ocean,” Ronald Jumeau, ambassador to the UN for the Seychelles, said."
"With record-breaking wildfires carving up the American west this summer, firefighters have become the rarest of civil servants: the kind almost universally lauded as heroes. Reinforcements dropped into California’s firefight from as far away as Australia and American Samoa to bolster strained state and federal crews, reaching a high point of 14,000 firefighters on the ground. Yet other crews have pulled into the fires’ path with a less grandiose purpose: to save only select addresses. These are the private firefighters of the rich or otherwise well-insured: private crews hired by insurance companies to minimize damages and keep policyholders’ homes from going up in smoke.  “This year to date has been busier than any prior years to date,” David Torgerson, the president of the firefighting company Wildfire Defense Systems in Bozeman, Montana, told the Guardian in an email, “and we are expecting to respond to [more] wildfires this year than any prior year.” This year’s wildfire season has produced the largest burn in California’s history and, in the northern part of the state, an awe-inspiring “firenado”. As scientists say that “megafires” are the new normal, climate change capitalism is finding an increasing number of customers. This echoes a global trend: cottage industries have sprung up to serve those who can afford to be a bit more protected and comfortable while the weather grows more cataclysmic. The uber-wealthy have bought estates in New Zealand (to the point that the country is in the midst of passing legislation to stymie foreign buyers) and luxe underground bunkers in Kansas and elsewhere to escape civic or natural collapse. In western states, the wildfire-evacuated masses have huddled in Best Westerns or on gymnasium floors and are often locked in insurance-claim limbo, while the affluent check into five-star luxury hotels – usually reimbursable by their insurance – confident that their homes are being looked after. Ronald DeKoven is a New York attorney, English barrister, and a tech entrepreneur, regularly flying to London or Singapore, where his startup MyLawyer is headquartered. In 2011, he and his wife, Linda, bought an estate with three guesthouses in the center of a 30-acre Napa Valley vineyard. It was meant as a second home, but after falling in love with wine country, the couple moved in permanently. Last year, one of his workers texted to report that a blaze, which would eventually become the catastrophic wine country fire, had started just down the road. Within minutes of the text, he and Linda sped away to a friend’s. “We put our shoes on and grabbed coats and left,” he says. “We probably were the first to leave this area. Given that I’ve practiced law for 50 years, you might say I’m cautious.” An insurance crew showed up to remove any combustibles around the house and spray fire retardant around the property’s edges. Meanwhile, the DeKovens checked in at the tony Clift Hotel in San Francisco. Their insurance company, Pure, explained over the phone to the couple that the company would prepay the hotel bills. After a night at the Clift, the DeKovens moved to Four Seasons hotels in Silicon Valley and then San Francisco for three weeks. “Needless to say the bills were high,” DeKoven says. “It was just paid through Pure.” While many other evacuees were locked in months of bureaucracy with insurance carriers, the DeKovens sailed through the recovery process. When they returned to their stone-and-stucco estate – which escaped the fire – Pure had already filtered the air to get rid of the heavy smoke smell. Pure sent out a team to test for carcinogenic dust in the house, detecting some in the main house’s attic. DeKoven hired their general contractor to vacuum the dust in hazmat suits and replace the insulation – a nearly $50,000 job that Pure prepaid with a check in the mail. “I found it astonishing they would be so focused on our best interest,” DeKoven said. Insurance is a suddenly sexy conversation topic in California, and DeKoven has been handing out his adjusters’ name like some others pass around the name of their skilled masseuse. AIG, the publicly traded insurance carrier, rolled out pre-emptive wildfire protection in 2005 to their Private Client Group, which the company says serves 40% of the Forbes 400 richest Americans. They were followed by competitors in so-called high net-worth insurance – Chubb, Pure and Nationwide Private Client, the types of companies who also typically offer insurance for such rarefied concerns as yachts and employment claims made by domestic help. Such coverage tends to keep out the hoi polloi, costing from thousands to tens of thousands or even six figures in annual premiums. Pure typically offers insurance to homes valued at more than $1m. Insurance crews don’t battle back flames like the government-contracted ones do. Their services happen before and after a fire passes. Generally, when a policy is purchased, a risk assessor surveys the property for fire risks. Clients of some plans receive texts about evacuations and the paths fires are taking. When fires are encroaching, crews stop by to cart away flammable objects or brush from around the house that could catch fire from an ember, and sometimes install temporary sprinklers. They might spray flame retardant around a property’s perimeter, and seal vents to keep out drifting embers and smoke. In more dangerous spots, they might spray a house down with fire-retardant gel and even extinguish a spot fire. To argue against this two-tiered response is to argue against capitalism itself, suggest industry insiders. “Insurance is a capitalist system, by and large, with for-profit companies,” said Amy Bach, the executive director of United Policyholders, a not-for-profit that educates insurance consumers. “So they’re always going to try to compete with each other and offer enhanced value to their higher-end customers who will pay the higher prices.” Yet Bach added a note of regret, saying she would prefer wildfire fighting “not being a class system, where first class gets a full meal, and in coach you get peanuts”. The high-end insurers market to the exceptionalism of their clients – “families who have more to protect,” as Pure’s website reads. Chubb’s site features a 72-year-old named Gerry in Ventura, California, who escaped the Thomas Fire last year, and contrasts his story with the relative misfortune of his neighbors: “Not only was Gerry treated first class every step of the way, as Chubb clients, he says he and his wife were the only two in their development able to rebuild.” Still, insurance-dispatched crews are now trickling down to companies with more middle-class clientele. For instance, for the past two years, USAA, a kind of insurance exchange for members of the military and their families, has offered the service to 1.4m properties in western states. USAA has no home value requirement; they’ll send firefighters out to your “modest cabin”, said a representative. The head of one privately held firefighting company, Wildfire Defense Systems of Bozeman, Montana, argued against charges of elitism. Its president, David Torgerson, said that 90% of the policyholders’ homes are the average local market price, and that despite the exclusive image of private firefighting, the service is also offered by several mainstream insurers. He also said that private firefighting can redound to the public good, as more resources on the ground “contributes to the overall effort”. Crews could theoretically pitch in when called upon by incident command. Even so, when a fire hits, insurance firefighting crews are “treated like civilians, basically”, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for CalFire, the California firefighting agency. They must get permission from the incident command to proceed into evacuation zones or pass roadblocks, and must leave if ordered to. Private crews do not play a role in the official fire response, he wrote in an email: “It is just another external situation that [incident command] has to deal with.” Eliza Kerr has lived on the edge of Yosemite national park for two decades, rock-climbing and leading yoga and backpacking retreats through her not-for-profit, Balanced Rock, when not treating clients with ayurvedic medicine. She’s aware that her love of California’s natural grandeur puts her squarely in the fire zone. Still, she’s betting on the long term. “Yosemite’s been my home for a long time,” she says. “It’s part of the vision.” In fact, she has decided to increase her ties to the area, and is making good on her dream to build a retreat guest residence and a yoga studio amid the scrubby brush overlooking the Merced river. The buildings were in mid-construction when the Ferguson fire evacuation order hit in mid-July. Kerr was away on a surfing trip in Indonesia at the time, but Chubb’s firefighting crew sprayed retardant around the property’s edge, sealed attic vents, and soaked the all-wood deck with water. They called her husband, who was still in California, with daily updates. Though these measures lent her peace of mind, Kerr ultimately thanks official state crews for saving her property. “I want to give huge credit and kudos to the local firefighters,” she said. As she heard it, they intentionally burned off vegetation up to her property line, stopping the incoming fire in its tracks. Her dream of a yoga retreat in the middle of wildfire country is safe – for now."
"The Trump administration moved closer on Tuesday to rolling back Obama-era rules reducing oil and gas industry leaks of methane gas. Methane is one of the most potent agents of climate change. As the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally released its proposed substitute for a 2016 Obama administration rule that aimed to step up detection and elimination of methane leaks at well sites and other oil and gas facilities, it conceded the move “may … degrade air quality and adversely affect health and welfare”. The move is part of a broad Trump administration effort to undo former president Barack Obama’s legacy programs to fight climate change by cutting emissions from oil, gas and coal. The EPA conceded that relaxing the Obama-era rule for methane leaks at oil and gas sites would put another 380,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere by 2025. The amount is roughly equivalent to more than 30m tons of carbon dioxide, another fossil-fuel emission that receives far more attention in efforts to slow climate change. Relaxing federal oversight will save $75m in regulatory costs annually, the agency said. Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a Colorado-based group that represents more than 300 companies, said the proposed changes would make the EPA rule more efficient and workable. The previous rule was “full of red tape”, Sgamma said in an interview. “This rule cleans that up, makes it more practical.” Oil and gas drillers have “a four decade-long trend to reduce emissions”, and the new EPA rules recognize that reality, Sgamma said, adding that she hopes a Department of the Interior rule to be finalized in coming days will show a similar practical streak. The pending rule by the Bureau of Land Management applies to fracking sites on public lands. Environmentalists contend energy companies have already demonstrated they can comply with tougher monitoring and that only poorly operated companies were having trouble with the new requirements. “Once again, the Trump administration is putting the interests of the worst-operated oil and gas companies ahead of the health and welfare of everyday Americans,” said Matt Watson, an associate vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund. On Tuesday, California governor Jerry Browntold a meeting in San Francisco ahead of a climate conference there that Donald Trump’s proposal to increase methane releases is “insane” and “borders on criminality”. “It perhaps is the most obvious and dangerous and irresponsible action by Mr Trump and that’s saying quite a lot,” Brown said. The EPA under Obama completed the existing rule in May 2016 and it took effect that August. Competing court challenges from the oil and gas industry and environmental groups, and EPA moves to freeze part of the Obama rule, have mired implementation. Tuesday’s action opens a 60-day period for public comment ahead of any final decision by the Trump administration."

"United Nations secretary general António Guterres has warned that the world is facing “a direct existential threat” and must rapidly shift from dependence on fossil fuels by 2020 to prevent “runaway climate change”. Guterres called the crisis urgent and decried the lack of global leadership to address global warming.  “Climate change is moving faster than we are,” Guterres said on Monday. “We need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action.” He said people everywhere are experiencing record-breaking temperatures and extreme heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods “are leaving a trail of death and devastation”. As examples, Guterres pointed to Kerala, India’s worst monsoon flooding in recent history, almost 3,000 deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, disappearing Arctic sea ice, some wildfires so big that they send ash around the world, oceans becoming more acidic threatening food chains, and high carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere threatening food security for billions of people. Guterres said scientists have been warning about global warming for decades, but “far too many leaders have refused to listen, far too few have acted with the vision the science demands”. When some 190 nations signed the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change they agreed to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C. “These targets were the bare minimum to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” Guterres said. “But scientists tell us that we are far off track.” “According to a UN study, the commitments made so far by parties to the Paris agreement represent just one-third of what is needed,” the secretary general said. Guterres said the mountain that needs to be climbed is very high but not insurmountable. “We need to rapidly shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels,” he said. “We need to replace them with clean energy from water, wind and sun. We must halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and change the way we farm.” He appealed for leadership “from politicians and leaders, from business and scientists, and from the public everywhere” to break what he called the current “paralysis” and act now. “If we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us,” Guterres warned. The alternative to moving to green energy, he said, “is a dark and dangerous future”. Guterres said that when he addresses world leaders at their annual general assembly gathering in two weeks, he will tell them “that climate change is the great challenge of our time” and what is missing is leadership and a sense of urgency to respond. He said an international meeting in Bangkok that ended on Sunday made some progress on negotiations to help reach an agreement in December in Poland on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris accord “but far from enough”. “Nothing less than our future and the fate of humankind depends on how we rise to the climate challenge,” Guterres said. “Keeping our planet’s warming to well below 2C is essential for global prosperity, people’s wellbeing and the security of nations.” He said that is why he will convoke a climate summit for world leaders in September 2019 “to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda”. Guterres said technology is on the side of those seeking to tackle climate change. He cited the rising use of renewable energy, saying “today, it is competitive with and even cheaper than coal and oil, especially if one factors in the cost of pollution”. And he singled out innovative programs in China, Sweden, Morocco, Scotland and Thailand. Guterres also pointed to other signs of hope including oil-rich Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy and oil-rich Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, moving away from investments in coal, as well as in palm and pulp paper companies because of the forests they destroy."
"When North Carolina got bad news about what its coast could look like thanks to climate change, it chose to ignore it. In 2012, the state now in the path of Hurricane Florence reacted to a prediction by its Coastal Resources Commission that sea levels could rise by 39in over the next century by passing a law that banned policies based on such forecasts. The legislation drew ridicule, including a mocking segment by comedian Stephen Colbert, who said: “If your science gives you a result you don’t like, pass a law saying the result is illegal. Problem solved.” North Carolina has a long, low-lying coastline and is considered one of the US areas most vulnerable to rising sea levels. But dire predictions alarmed coastal developers and their allies, who said they did not believe the rise in sea level would be as bad as the worst models predicted and said such forecasts could unnecessarily hurt property values and drive up insurance costs. As a result, the state’s official policy, rather than adapting to the worst potential effects of climate change, has been to assume it simply won’t be that bad. Instead of forecasts, it has mandated predictions based on historical data on sea level rise. “The science panel used one model, the most extreme in the world,” Pat McElraft, the sponsor of the 2012 bill, said at the time, according to Reuters. “They need to use some science that we can all trust when we start making laws in North Carolina that affect property values on the coast.” The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and allowed to become law by the then governor Bev Perdue, a Democrat who neither signed nor vetoed the bill. The law required the coastal resources commission to put out another study in 2015, looking at expected sea level rise. That report looked only 30 years ahead, rather than a century. It found that the rise in sea level during that time was likely to be roughly 6in to 8in, with higher increases possible in parts of the Outer Banks. Some outside studies have offered more dire warnings. A report last year by the Union of Concerned Scientists said 13 North Carolina communities were likely to be “chronically inundated” with seawater by 2035. The state’s stance has shifted under the current governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat who took office last year. Cooper announced last September that North Carolina would join the US Climate Alliance, a group of states that have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals of the Paris climate accord, even though Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement. “We remain committed to reducing pollution and protecting our environment,” Cooper said. “So much of North Carolina’s economy relies on protecting our treasured natural resources.” But Orrin Pilkey, a retired Duke University coastal geologist, wrote in a recent op-ed in the News & Observer that the state has still failed to take the steps that communities in Virginia and New Jersey have taken, to prepare for rising sea levels. “Instead coastal development flourishes as more beachfront buildings, highways and bridges are built to ease access to our beautiful beaches,” he wrote. “Currently the unspoken plan is to wait until the situation is catastrophic and then respond.” "
"ExxonMobil has joined the oil and gas industry’s flagship climate change project, reversing its decision not to join the alliance four years ago. The company was a notable holdout when the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OCGI) was launched, but will now join European peers BP, Shell and Total in contributing $100m (£75m) to curb the impact of global warming.  The move is the clearest sign yet the US company is taking a more progressive stance on global warming. Exxon, which promoted climate denial for years despite knowing about the risks since 1981, had shifted its tone on climate change under the leadership of Rex Tillerson. But while acknowledging global warming was real and linked to fossil fuel use, Tillerson said fears over climate change were overblown. Darren Woods, who became the chief executive in 2017 when Tillerson became US secretary of state, has taken that shift further. “It will take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society to develop scalable, affordable solutions that will be needed to address the risks of climate change,” he said of the firm’s decision to join the OCGI. Two other US oil companies, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, have also joined the initiative, taking its total climate fund to $1.3bn. The project, which has been derided as “greenwash” by campaigners, previously had 10 members, which represented 20% of global oil and gas production. The new additions have taken that figure to 30%. Exxon’s annual contribution, which works out at $10m a year over a decade, represents just 0.04% of its planned capital expenditure of $25bn in 2018. Greg Muttitt, a campaigner at Oil Change International, said: “It is hardly surprising that ExxonMobil, when faced with lawsuits for lying for decades about what it knew about climate change, should want to join an initiative that claims oil companies care about climate.” Patrick Pouyanné, the chief executive of the French oil and gas company Total, said the new members would give more impact to the industry’s response to climate change. 🇺🇸👍 Happy to welcome @ExxonMobil @Chevron & @OXY_Petroleum into the #OGCI! The 13 members now represent 30% of Oil & Gas production and 20% of primary #energy consumption. The addition of 3 #US companies gives us more impact to lead the industry’s response to #ClimateChange. The announcement of the OCGI’s new members comes weeks before a UN science panel publishes a report on whether the world can meet the Paris climate deal’s tougher global warming target of 1.5C. Separately, Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Opec countries should bring down oil prices, which are hovering at about $80 a barrel. His comment came despite an agreement by the oil cartel to pump more oil in an effort to lower prices. We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!"
"The slogan “Think global, act local”, popular among environmentalists since the 1970s, is apt when applied to the politics of air. While pollution by greenhouse gases, chiefly CO2, requires international action, some emissions can be tackled much closer to home. Evidence about the health impact of the gases and particles produced by road traffic, industry and open fires has developed rapidly since the 1990s. In cities, many of which have experienced rapid growth in traffic, air quality has become a pressing issue. Across the EU, legal limits are regularly breached, and the UK, France and Germany are among six countries facing large fines. Until Michael Gove publishes his environment bill there remains uncertainty over the teeth the watchdog will have when it comes to enforcing the rules after Brexit. But it is not clear whether the genie of public anxiety about toxic air can be pushed back into the bottle. This week saw reports about new research into the amount of particulate matter breathed by children at London schools, and pollutants found in mothers’ placentas. Last month it was revealed that Chinese researchers have linked high levels of air pollution to reduced intelligence.  New clean air zones in London and Birmingham, including charges for the most polluting vehicles, start their rollout next year (two other cities, Southampton and Derby, have been ticked off by the government for missing a deadline for proposals). Such schemes represent a milestone in efforts to limit nitrogen oxide pollution from diesel vehicles after the still-unfolding emissions-cheating scandal. This weekend will see the closure of 50 roads for the capital’s first “car-free day”, an initiative campaigners hope will soon be scaled up to match more ambitious schemes in cities including Brussels and Paris. What happens next depends on public opinion as well as government. Parents are increasingly worried about the health of their children. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, who believes air pollution killed her daughter Ella, wants to argue the case in a new inquest. On the other side of the argument are those concerned about the impact of charges. In Birmingham, these include businesses supplying parts to the local automotive industry. In London, Westminster city council has opposed schemes it says penalise its residents, and last week inflicted a defeat on the mayor in the high court. No politician is likely to forget the saga of the London congestion zone’s western extension, which lasted only a year before being scrapped. The situation is complicated because vehicle emissions and air pollution, while closely linked to congestion, are not the same thing. Urban transport is a political question and dirty air is not the only reason many people would like to see traffic reduced. Others include road safety, noise, and the belief that public transport, bicycles and pedestrians should take priority over private cars – even electric ones. On the other side, many people are attached to their cars and see driving as their right and an economic necessity. Were it not for the obstructive policies pursued by Boris Johnson, London would be further ahead than it is. Birmingham and Manchester are catching up. The obesity crisis as well as air pollution and congestion means the direction of travel – towards healthier and more active lifestyles, and less traffic – should be clear. Per-mile road pricing was looked at by Mr Khan last year and remains under review. Whether by this route or another, cities and their leaders must find a way through."
"The energy minister, Angus Taylor, says the Morrison government will not be replacing the renewable energy target “with anything” after it winds down in 2020. Taylor confirmed there would be no policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector during an answer to the Greens MP Adam Bandt in question time on Tuesday.  Bandt asked whether the RET could be extended beyond 2020 given there was currently no policy mechanism to replace it, and the lack of settled policy could threaten investment in low emissions technology. The energy minister flatly rejected the entreaty. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything.” Taylor indicated there was no need to have a policy because “we know we will reach the 26% emission reduction target without additional intervention”. In a column for the Australian Financial Review, published on Tuesday, Taylor hedged slightly more, declaring “emissions reductions are the least of our problems, with every prospect we will reach the 26% reduction below 2005 levels ahead of schedule and without interventions”. Those declarations from the minister contradict advice from the Energy Security Board. In August, the ESB told federal and state energy ministers that if the national energy guarantee wasn’t implemented, the national electricity market would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. The Coalition’s plan to 2030 was to replace the RET with the national energy guarantee, which imposed an emissions reduction target for electricity. But Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the Neg as one of his last acts in the prime ministership, and the policy has now been junked officially by the cabinet under Scott Morrison’s leadership. Taylor says the Morrison government is now focused exclusively on lowering power prices and will pursue regulatory interventions to achieve that end. But while some government conservatives routinely equate renewables with higher power prices, there is evidence that a big build of renewable capacity contracted through the RET is currently lowering wholesale prices by increasing supply to the market. Last December, the Australian Energy Market Commission predicted wholesale electricity costs would fall in 2018-19 and 2019-20, with a reduction in the order of 12%, due to approximately 5,300 MW of new committed and expected generation entering the national electricity market – the majority of which is renewable generation (4,900 MW). The energy minister has also criticised a proposal by the ALP to adopt an emissions reduction target for electricity of 45%. Taylor told parliament on Tuesday: “The result will be we will all pay more for our electricity”. But new modelling from Frontier Economics undertaken for the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, published by Guardian Australia on Tuesday, indicates otherwise. It predicts power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%. It says that under the Coalition’s now abandoned 26% target, the average saving to households would be 20.8% while under the 45% scenario, which is Labor’s target, the average saving would be 18.3%. The Morrison government says Australia will remain a signatory to the Paris climate agreement but it is unclear how compliance with an economy-wide emissions target can be achieved in the absence of a policy roadmap. Recent polling suggests voters are more worried about climate change than they were 12 months ago. A study tracking voter sentiment for more than a decade, funded first by the Climate Institute and now by the Australia Institute, finds 73% (up from 66% in 2017) of respondents are concerned about climate change, and a clear majority, 68%, believes the government should set domestic targets to comply with our Paris commitments."
"Sylvia Wilson drove around Australia in an electric car. It cost her $150.90. Wilson, 70, a retired farmer from near Biloela in central Queensland, had planned the trip of a lifetime with her husband, Rod. One impulsive evening in mid-2016 they went online and, sight-unseen, bought a Tesla S75 electric car for the journey.  A few months after Rod died last year, Sylvia announced to her family: “I think I’ll do that trip. “Most of them were really keen. A couple of them said ‘you’re mad, you’ll never do it’,” Wilson told Guardian Australia. It took Sylvia 110 days and 20,396km door to door to navigate the Round Australia Electric Vehicle Superhighway – a loop of charging stations. She is the first woman to drive the route and the second person to loop the country in a Tesla. Her daughters, sisters, friends and a daughter-in law – in total seven different women – flew in and out from various points to keep her company along the way. “I had to stick to a schedule because they had to book their flights, so there was no mucking around. I was flying blind to a certain extent. I booked all my accommodation, and that had to be tied in to what the car could do,” Wilson said. Some of the more remote charging stations had never been used until Wilson rolled into town in Bluey, her affectionate name for the Tesla. In the Kimberley, at Fitzroy Crossing, she arrived late on Friday afternoon and discovered the charging station not working. “They found the only electrician in town and he came and did something and it worked,” she said. At the next town over, Halls Creek, the power socket was at a business that was shut. At the local motel she found a 15amp power supply and was able to plug in overnight. “They call it range anxiety. That’s what everyone talks about. It’s totally valid to have that, to be thinking about the next charge, once you’ve got an [electric vehicle]. “But the reality is that if you can see the lights on, or that the kettle works, then you can charge. Even in the remotest places you can still charge the car. In a way there are more places to charge an EV [electric vehicle] than there are a fossil fuel car.” Sylvia recalls the night in mid-2016 when her husband Rod sat down beside her at the computer. By 9pm, they’d bought the Tesla. Three months later, it turned up at their cattle farm, between Biloela and Gladstone, on the back of a truck. “My husband and I, in the old days, disagreed on a lot of things,” Wilson said. “I was the greenie, he was the brownie. As he got older, I must have won I think. He became very concerned about the mess that we’re making of our little globe. “He just started to take on board things like buying an electric car. I live off the grid here [with solar power] and charge the car off grid too. I couldn’t do those things without him wanting to do those things, too. “He never drove it. He had Parkinson’s and he had a few problems because of that. It kind of amazed him that it was electric. “I think he would have been tickled at how successful the trip was.” Having the experience of driving around Australia – and fulfilling the dream she and Rod had planned – was only part of Sylvia’s motivation. “My other purpose was to prove a point,” she said. “These are good cars and you’re not stuck to just going down to the shops.“The concern about the environment was front and centre. These cars are bloody expensive. But once you’ve paid for the car, your running costs are bugger all.” The same trip would have, conservatively and based on city prices, cost more than $3,000 in petrol in a conventional sedan. Charging the car cost $150.90 in total, partly because people often did not want payment. “Motel people and others who just let me charge and said ‘don’t worry about paying, off you go’. They treat it like a laptop or a phone.” Wilson is recognised by 350.org in a report released on Wednesday as one of the “heroes building Australia’s low-carbon economy”. The report recognises investors, business leaders and everyday Australians whose private efforts to reduce carbon emissions are leading the way as the federal government backs away from the Paris agreement targets.The chief execuitve of 350.org Australia, Blair Palese, said people such as Wilson were filling a climate change “leadership void” that had been vacated by politicians."
"“This drought has really hit our family hard,” says Longreach farmer Jody Brown. “Climate change is making the droughts more severe.” Those two sentences are the opening lines to a new advertisement challenging the federal government’s stance on climate change and the drought in Australia’s eastern states. The 30-second ad will begin airing on commercial channels this week and will be beamed into politically important suburban areas of Australia’s three largest capital cities during the NRL grand final on 30 September. The advertisement has been paid for by the Australian Conservation Foundation and features Brown, a sheep and cattle farmer who runs a 45,000 acre property 65km south of Longreach in central west Queensland. Brown is a fourth-generation grazier whose family property has been affected by drought. In the clip, she calls for “politicians to stop dancing around the issue and help us to do something about this”. “We need to stick to the Paris agreement, we need to stop burning coal and we need to commit to more renewable energy,” she says. The campaign comes after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, described the drought as his highest priority but said the conversation about the connection between drought and climate change should be left “for another day”. Last week hundreds of farmers and their supporters rallied outside Parliament House in Canberra demanding action on climate change. Farmers for Climate Action board member and third-generation NSW farmer Peter Holding told the crowd that praying for rain – referencing comments by Morrison earlier this month – “is not going to cut it”. Brown said she had become increasingly disappointed at Canberra’s unwillingness to discuss the current drought in the context of climate change. “I think no matter where you stand or what your perspective is, droughts are part of a climate and you can’t separate those two issues,” she said. “If you’re going to be serious about supporting farmers through drought and adapting to drought-stricken conditions, you need to be talking about climate change.” She said many farmers were already changing their practices to try to adapt to warmer temperatures. “It’s not going to work for everyone but there are some interesting management solutions out there,” she said. “These are the kinds of things I’d like to see governments working on as well.” Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Australia could no longer put off talking about how climate change is making extreme weather events worse. “We are launching this TV ad to try prompt the national discussion our prime minister doesn’t seem to want to have,” she said. “Farmers, along with many others in our community, are on the frontline of climate damage. We must have their backs. Inaction on climate change both here and abroad has real-world implications for the safety and productivity of our country.” A poll published last week showed the Morrison government is politically vulnerable on climate policy, with a growing number of Australians saying they are concerned about climate change and want action. The prime minister has declared Australia will not pull out of Paris but also abandoned the national energy guarantee that imposed an emissions reduction target on the electricity sector. New data published by NDEVR Environmental on Friday shows Australia is on track to miss its Paris targets, and the country’s emissions, excluding land use data, were the highest on record for the third year running."
"Northern hemisphere weather is stealing the limelight right now. Hurricane Florence slammed into the eastern US on Friday as the Philippines and Hong Kong braced for Typhoon Mangkhut. Hurricanes and typhoons are no surprise at this time of year, but what is noticeable is that these tropical storms are not barrelling along as fast as they used to.  Research published in Nature earlier this year showed that the average speed at which tropical storms track has slowed down by 10% since 1949. Over land, speeds have decreased even further; around 30% for western North Pacific storms and 20% for North Atlantic ones. Changes in atmospheric circulation, caused by global warming, are thought to be behind the decrease in pace. Hurricanes that proceed at a trot instead of a canter are not good news. “The slower the storm moves, the more rain falls on the area under it. Inland fresh-water flooding increases and this is the No 1 factor, by far, that causes loss of life associated with hurricanes,” says James Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin. Hurricane Harvey demonstrated this last year when it stalled over Texas, and right now Hurricane Florence appears to be lingering too."
"Australia is lagging behind other developed nations in the race to curb greenhouse gas emissions from transport, according to a new report. The report from the Climate Council, due to be released on Thursday, finds that Australia’s transport-related emissions have continued to rise because of policy inaction.  The nation’s move to electric vehicles has been hampered by a lack of incentives and a lack of mandatory pollution standards for vehicles, which have been implemented in almost all other OECD countries. “We’ve been having a big national debate about electricity sector emissions,” said senior climate and energy solutions analyst Petra Stock, “but [we] really wanted to draw attention to the growing problem of greenhouse gas pollution from the transport sector.” Calling for the government to implement a climate and transport policy plan, the report said Australia ranked behind Russia, Mexico and Indonesia on transport efficiency due to high polluting cars, high car use, a low share of trips taken by public transport, and low capital spending on public transport compared to roads. Transport is the nation’s second largest source of greenhouse gas pollution after electricity, the report says. Transport-related greenhouse gas pollution levels increased by 3.4% in the 12 months to December 2017. Since 1990, they have increased by 62.9%, a higher rate than any other sector. “Australia’s transport emissions or transport greenhouse gas pollution levels have been steadily rising and are projected to continue going up,” the report said.“Factors such as population growth have led to a higher number of cars on the road, while increased demand for freight is also driving up truck emissions.” Other findings included that: Nearly 87% of Australian commuters travel to work by car Transport makes up 18% of all greenhouse gas pollution in Australia (electricity is the largest source at 33%) Road-based transport pollution contributes to a greater proportion of emissions in Australian than the global average Domestic air travel alone makes up 9% of Australian transport emissions Energy policy paralysis continues in Canberra, exacerbated by the Morrison government’s decision to ditch the national energy guarantee. Since 2015, the government has been consulting on mandatory fuel emissions standards, which have been in place for at least a decade in the US, Japan and China. The report said if strict standards were introduced, Australia could prevent up to the equivalent of 65m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. “This is equivalent to the annual emissions from seven Liddell power stations. Urgency is key. Mandatory emissions standards have wider benefits, reducing fuel bills for car owners, saving an estimated $8,500 over a vehicle’s lifetime.” The report said Australian cars pollute more per kilometre than other comparable countries. The lack of mandatory emissions standards was a factor, but so was vehicle size and the purchasing decisions made by individuals, business and government fleet buyers. Stock said the government had already done the work required to “put these greenhouse gas emissions standards in place for vehicles and bring Australia in line with 80% of the global car market”. “But we need to do it as soon as possible because these standards work as people replace their cars over time,” she said. “It takes time for these standards to drive down emissions in the transport sector. So the sooner they are in place, the greater effect they will have on transport pollution.” The report said the adoption of electric vehicles in Australia had been held back by “the lack of policy support or incentives, higher upfront cost, limited choice of available electric vehicles for sale in Australia, and the availability of public vehicle charging infrastructure”. In New Zealand, which has a target of 64,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2021, there were 3,659 new electric cars sold in 2017, compared with only 2,284 in Australia, the report said. It also calls on the government to focus on improving public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure, praising initiatives such as Melbourne’s move to a solar power tram network."
"The world’s first plastic bicycle path made of recycled bottles, cups and packaging has opened in the Netherlands, as part of a pilot that could see similar roads open up across the country. The 30-metre path, made of recycled plastic equivalent to more than 218,000 plastic cups, is expected to be three times as durable as an asphalt alternative.  It also contains sensors to monitor the road’s performance, including its temperature, the number of bikes that pass over it and its ability to cope with the traffic. The prefabricated sections of cycle path are light and hollow making them easy to transport and 70% quicker to install. Cables and utility pipes are able to be easily fitted inside, and the path is designed to drain off rainwater. The joint venture between the Dutch engineers KWS, the oil and gas conglomerate Total, and pipe-makers Wavin, was opened this week in Zwolle, in the north-east of the Netherlands. A second path is to be installed in Giethoorn in Overijssel, and Rotterdam is the city most likely to take up the technology. Its is believed that many of the benefits of the paths will apply to plastic roads. The path’s inventors, Anne Koudstaal and Simon Jorritsma, said: “This first pilot is a big step towards a sustainable and future-proof road made of recycled plastic waste. When we invented the concept, we didn’t know how to build a plastic road, now we know.” Asphalt concrete is responsible for 1.5m tonnes of CO2 emissions a year, equivalent to 2% of global road transport emissions. When first announcing the concept in 2015, Jorritsma said: “You see a bottle; we see a road.” Earlier this year the EU launched an urgent plan to clean up Europe’s act on plastic waste and ensure that every piece of packaging on the continent is reusable or recyclable by 2030. Brussels’ strategy, which followed China’s decision to ban imports of foreign recyclable material, was designed to change minds in Europe, potentially tax damaging behaviour, and modernise plastics production and collection by investing €350m (£310m) in research. Each year, 25m tonnes of plastic waste is generated by Europeans, but less than 30% is collected for recycling. Some doubts have been raised about the plastic path. Harmen Spek, from the anti-plastic lobby group Plastic Soup has warned that small particles of the plastic could find their way into the living environment due to heat, wear and run-off."
"Just a year ago we were dealing with an historically devastating Atlantic hurricane season. It was marked by the strongest hurricane – Irma – ever observed in the open Atlantic, the near total devastation of Puerto Rico by a similarly powerful category 5 monster Maria, and Hurricane Harvey – the worst flooding event in US history. At the time, I commented here and elsewhere about the role climate change had played in amplifying the destructive characteristics of these storms. Not to be outdone, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, initially predicted to be quiet – quelled by an incipient El Niño event and cool, early summer ocean waters – has suddenly erupted. If the current disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico known as “95L” earns the status of tropical storm, the 2018 season will be the second time in recorded history that we’ve seen five tropical storms simultaneously present in the Atlantic basin (the last time was in 1971).  What happened to cause all of this? An early autumn ocean “heat wave” has brought sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic to bathtub-level warmth. Just as summer heat waves on land are greatly increased in frequency and intensity by even modest overall warming, so too are these ocean heat waves becoming more frequent and more extreme as the oceans continue warm. All else being equal, warmer oceans mean more energy to intensify tropical storms and hurricanes. But when it comes to coastal threat, it hardly matters how many tropical storms there are over the course of the season. A single landfalling hurricane can wreak havoc and destruction. Think Katrina in 2005, Irene in 2011, Sandy in 2012, either Harvey or Maria in 2017 and now Florence in 2018. In this sense, the sometimes fractious debate about whether we’ll see more or fewer storms in a warmer world is somewhat misplaced. What matters is that there is a consensus we’ll see stronger and worse flood-producing storms – and, in fact, we’re seeing them already. That brings us to Hurricane Florence: a climatologically-amplified triple threat. First, there is the threat of wind damage. Florence strengthened into a monster category 4 hurricane with 140 mile per hour winds over those very warm western Atlantic waters. Past studies indicate a roughly 7% increase in the peak wind speed of a category 4 storm for each 1C warming of ocean surface temperatures. So the roughly 1.5C warmer-than-normal waters in the subtropical Atlantic where the storm intensified (and keep in mind that “normal” as modernly defined by NOAA as the average during the 1981-2010 period is itself already about 1C warmer than pre-industrial times prior to advent of human-caused greenhouse warming) corresponds to a roughly 11% increase in peak winds. But the destructive potential of a storm goes as the cube of the wind speed. So that 11% increase in wind speed corresponds to a 33% increase in destructive potential. That’s not a subtle effect. Fortunately those winds decreased substantially as the storm approached landfall. But even as a strong, very slowly moving hurricane pounding structures with near 100mph winds for hours on end, Florence is doing considerable damage as it skirts the long Carolina coastline, taking down trees and powerlines and rendering large areas without electricity. That brings us to the second, even greater threat: storm surge. Though the storm weakened as it approached the coast, the storm surge was built up over of a period of several days, including the time during which it existed as a category 4 or strong category 3 storm. That means the catastrophic, roughly-10ft storm surge from Cape Hatteras to Myrtle Beach was baked in well in advance of the landfall of the storm. Don’t forget to add to that the 1ft of sea level rise that has occurred along the south-eastern US coast, mostly due to climate change (there’s a small contribution owing to the geological subsidence of the coast). The wonderful little coastal North Carolina town of New Bern has been particularly hard hit, with the downtown area flooded by the 10ft storm surge and 200 people requiring rescue. It is seemingly prescient that I gave a lecture in New Bern last year, during last year’s storm season, warning about the coastal threat from climate change, in a church that has now been flooded by Florence. Last, but not least, we have the threat of inland flooding. Warmer oceans mean more moisture in the atmosphere. It’s one of the simplest relationships in all of meteorology: for each 1C of warming, there is about 7% more moisture in the air. That means those 1.5C-above-normal ocean temperatures have given the storm about 10% more moisture. All other things being equal, that implies about 10% more rainfall. But that’s not the whole story. What made Harvey a record flooding event last year and makes Florence such a flooding threat now, is the slow-moving nature of the storm. The slower the storm moves, the more rainfall that accumulates in any one location and the more flooding you get. Such was the case with other devastating storms such as Harvey or 2011’s Hurricane Irene that caused historic flooding in my own state of Pennsylvania. Some headlines have reported that Florence is a warning of what is to come. But in reality, it is a warning of what has already arrived. Far worse is to come if we don’t get serious, in a hurry, about acting on climate change. We must transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy even more rapidly, and we must elect politicians who will support such efforts. In the US, there’s an opportunity to do so in less than two months now in the upcoming midterm elections, where we must elect politicians who support enlightened policies on energy and climate, and vote out of office those who don’t.

"One of the ways the British media covers climate change is to treat it as a bit of banter in silly-season items on English wine. This summer’s heatwave was the pretext for an awful lot of these “and finally” moments, in which the tone is unfailingly flippant: never mind the melting Arctic, the shires will take over from Champagne! Well, hoorah for that. Except, of course, the impact of climate changeon wine isn’t quite as straightforward as a few nice summers and guaranteed bumper vintages in Sussex. What the larky local-radio questions about Bordeaux-on-Thames tend to gloss over is that itwon’t necessarily make the UK, or anywhere, a better place to grow wine. Erratic weather, floods, hurricanes, extreme, unseasonal frost and drought: none of these are friends of the winemaker.  Winemakers are attuned to the minutest changes in the weather – differences that they can, literally, taste in their wines. A line-up of past vintages offers a sensorial record of climatic patterns, and the message sent by those bottles has been troubling the world’s winemakers for years. On one level, this is purely a question of quality and style. With grapes accumulating high levels of sugar (and therefore potential alcohol when they ferment) much sooner than they used to, as vintages get hotter – and way before the other elements, the tannins and the polyphenols that give wine its complex flavours, are ready – winemakers have a dilemma. They can either harvest much earlier, sacrificing complexity for acceptable alcohol levels, or produce wines with an undrinkable alcoholic force. With each new record-breaking hot summer and earliest-ever vintage, the long-term viability of whole swathes of the wine world is called into question – grape varieties, the location of vineyards, access to dwindling supplies of water,the ability to produce wines in anything like the same style, quantity and quality. As the great Californian wine producer Randall Grahm put it matter of factly to the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik earlier this year: “It’s everywhere. Burgundy may be fucked. The northern Rhône is partly fucked … the southern Rhône is fucked.” Grahm’s ambitious latest project is near Santa Cruz, an attempt to breed a new grape variety that can cope with the current Californian climate, one capable of being dry farmed (without irrigation) and to withstand heat. This is urgent, serious business in a part of the world where wildfires have destroyed thousands of acres of vineyards, and taken many lives and livelihoods, in the past two years – and where nobody is treating climate change as a funny sign-off on the news. From £6, Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s The vast Torres operation was quick to identify the challenges posed by climate change, investing millions in research into carbon capture, water efficiency and relocation of its vineyards to protect the future of wines such as this ever-green, bargain dry white. From £28, leaandsandeman.co.uk; langhamwine.co.uk There’s no doubt that changes in the English climate so far have been helpful to sparkling winemakers, enabling them to ripen pinot noir, chardonnay and pinot meunier consistently and make such outstandingly balanced nuanced, berry-scented wines as this. £11.99, Waitrose Irrigation of vines has been seen as essential in many warm-climate regions, but as the resource has become increasingly precious, many are looking to dry-farm. This racy, crunchy, redcurrant-tangy red from old cinsault vines in southern Chile is proof of the possibilities. From £12.75, farehamwinecellar.co.uk; ampswinemerchants.co.uk; cambridgwine.com In south Australia, many producers are responding to rising temperatures by switching to grapes of southern-European heritage, leading, in this blend of France’s cabernet and Portugal’s touriga, to a deliciously violet-scented, darkly fruited, chunky red. From £10, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Tesco Port producer Paul Symington spoke gloomily of “the existential threat” posed by climate change to wine production in the Douro Valley at a recent conference, making his family’s glossy and sumptuous Graham’s LBV now officially an endangered species. £19.95, tanners-wines.co.uk As in England, changes in the climate have had some positive effects in cool, northerly Germany, with fewer bad (cold, wet) vintages than in the past. Whether the country will still be capable of producing such intricate, lacy, delicate riesling as this in 2050 is a whole other question, however.

"New petrol and diesel car sales in Europe must be phased out before 2030 if the auto sector is to play its part in holding global warming to the Paris agreement’s 1.5C goal, a new analysis has found. Forecourt plug-in hybrids will also have to disappear by 2035 at the latest, according to analysis by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), commissioned by Greenpeace. Vehicle emissions have barely changed over the last decade and the industry will exhaust its carbon budget within five to 10 years unless there is a radical shift, the DLR scientists say. “Auto CO2-emissions need to peak as soon as possible,” Prof Horst Friedrich, DLR’s director, told the Guardian. “Looking at the dwindling carbon budget it is crucial to push low-emitting cars into the market, the earlier the better, to renew the fleet.” The study warns that “stark measures” would be needed to do this with a 66% chance of meeting the 1.5C goal – including a drop in conventional car sales from around 15m this year to 5m in 2022. Under this scenario, the last vehicle with an internal combustion engine would be sold in 2028 and diesel and petrol powered-cars would be banished from the roads by the mid-2040s. Behavioural change towards walking, cycling and public transport would also be necessary. “It would be much easier to keep a 2C target because there is a higher carbon budget and therefore more time to implement the necessary measures,” Friedrich said. “I estimate it could provide us with up to 10 years more time to prepare much better for the fundamental transformations necessary.” A draft report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes clear that 2C of warming would expose around 10 million more people in coastal areas to floods, storm surges and crop damage than 1.5C would. Global sea levels would also rise by an extra 10cm, heatwaves would be longer, extreme weather events stronger, economic growth lower, while crop yields and water availability would substantially decline. So far, the European commission has proposed a 30% cut in vehicle emissions by 2030, although MEPs are pushing to raise that figure to 45%. The UK government has announced that sales of all new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned by 2040, while some countries including Germany, Ireland, India and the Netherlands have set a more ambitious deadline of 2030. Energy utilities have often led calls for greater ambition and Kristian Ruby, the secretary general of Eurelectric, the power sector trade association, said that the current EU proposal was “not in line with the Paris objectives”. He told the Guardian: “The timeline of a full phase out by 2030 does sound quite ambitious. Car makers are only ramping up now for around 20 new electric models that will come to market next year. But this needs to happen, and faster than currently seen by the European commission. There is no doubt about that.” Some analysts also believe that Europe’s car manufacturers have made no real-world improvement in auto CO2 emissions for five years, because of the “gaming” of emissions tests. A spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said: “It is still hard to predict whether the alternative powertrains will have gained a significantly high market share by 2030. This is dependent on factors that are outside the control of automobile manufacturers, such as the necessary recharging infrastructure being in place as well appropriate incentives.”"
