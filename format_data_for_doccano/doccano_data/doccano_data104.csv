"   On Wednesday a key parliamentary committee in Norway passed a motion that calls on the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund to dump its coal interests. The resulting move by the $900bn ($589bn) Norwegian sovereign wealth fund “will certainly create a wave” of divestments by other funds, says Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative. The shares divested could be worth as much as $5.5bn, says Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. 350.org founder Bill McKibben seems pretty happy: Norway's $900bn fund, that just divested from coal, is in fact the world's largest fund. Like, in the world. The whole planet. Earth. Following a 10-day occupation protest, students at Edinburgh university are celebrating a fresh commitment by the university to divest from three of the world’s biggest fossil fuel producers within six months.  Meanwhile in Canada, a minister has been exposed for delivering a rallying speech to industry oil specialists encouraging tar sands oil extraction. The meeting at the Banff Springs hotel was the annual strategy session of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the main lobby group in Alberta’s tar sands. This week for the second in our series on ‘carbon bombs’, we visited Fort McKay, a town that sits above the Alberta tar sands in Canada, one of the most polluting carbon source sites on the planet. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation does ground-breaking sanitation work in Durban, South Africa, tackling the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis and polio. Yet we revealed this week that the same residents live near a petroleum power plant which they believe is causing huge respiratory problems in the area – and is run by companies funded by Gates. In the US, it’s graduation time and students across the country are receiving their first request to donate to their university. But a growing number are taking a stand and instead donating to a new fund – which the institution will only receive if it divests from fossil fuels. More than 200 alumni, parents and supporters have now donated to the Multi-School Fossil Free Divestment Fund at 21 institutions including Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as Stanford and Syracuse universities, which have already made divestment commitments. They will receive the money upon completion of the divestment process. Meanwhile, the UK’s poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy has curated a series of 20 poems on climate change for Keep it in the Ground. This week saw us publish five more including Last Snowman by Simon Armitage – it satirises our modern day culture as the last snowman drifts away from his Arctic home. What’s the story the top editor at one of the world’s largest newspapers says is most hidden from you? That’s the question Upworthy asked this week in their feature on Keep it in the Ground. Another podcast, another grilling. But this week it’s the turn of Shell chief executive Ban van Beurden. Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger takes him to task on what may be the biggest question of all: why do they still insist on taking vast quantities of fossil fuels out of the ground, even when they accept climate change? Download episode 10 of the biggest story in the world here.  Has your job been affected by climate change? Whether you’re a health or humanitarian worker, city planner or teacher, we want you to tell us how, by submitting your stories or pictures here.  It was great to meet some of you at the Guardian Sustainable Business debate on Tuesday. Economist Nick Stern attacked the mentality of chief executives in oil companies like Shell. “They do not believe the world will be wise enough to follow policies that can hold the world to 2C and are asking us to bet against the world,” he said. Is it possible to get a fossil-fuel-free bank account? What about pensions and building societies? And what happens if the stock market crashes? These were just some of the questions you sent in for our Q&A on personal divestment on Wednesday.  Many of you have told us you want to divest your own money from fossil fuel companies and we hope the Q&A will help you do that – along with the new tool we’ve launched with responsible investment charity ShareAction. Just pop in the name of your pension provider to send them an email requesting a fossil-fuel-free fund. When you receive a response, send it our way and we can help you to decipher it. From a Brazilian climate scientist to a dentist in the Congo, the Keep it in the Ground supporters are a diverse bunch. You can now meet them in this week’s interactive.

"The National Park Service is beginning to excavate the mouth of an unexplored cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and researchers believe it could help broaden our understanding of how the region’s climate has changed over thousands of years. A park service worker found Persistence Cave in 2004 on the grounds of Wind Cave national park, in western South Dakota, but the agency kept it quiet, partly to prevent amateur spelunkers from trying to explore the well-preserved site.  On Monday, a team of scientists led by Eastern Tennessee University professor Jim Mead will begin unearthing the entrance of the cave, hauling out bags of sediment and animal bones to be carefully analyzed. They have already found bones dating back nearly 11,000 years and the remains of at least three species that hadn’t been found in the region before – the pika, pine marten and platygonus, an extinct relative of the modern-day peccary. While it’s always exciting to find an extinct species that once roamed the region, Mead said it’s even more ecologically important to him to discover that an existing animal like the pika once lived there. The rodent-like mammal can still be found in cold, mountainous climates of North America, suggesting the environment of the Black Hills was once quite different, he said. “What has changed to push it into Wyoming but not be in the Black Hills?” The researchers will be studying the newfound fossils alongside those found at the famous Mammoth Site – a well-preserved graveyard of the prehistoric beasts – that was discovered in nearby Hot Springs in the 1970s. They’ll use their findings to map how the region’s climate has changed – the mammoths are believed to have died approximately 26,000 years ago, while the oldest bones found at the mouth of Persistence Cave only date back about 11,000. “In reconstructing the past environments of the Black Hills, it’s nice to have a number of different points,” Mead said. “What we’re trying to do, centered through the Mammoth Site, is to understand essentially the Ice Age environmental change through time.” Because they want to protect the cave and its contents, the park service won’t publicly disclose the exact location of Persistence Cave yet, saying only that the entrance is about one-third of a mile from the known edge of Wind Cave’s tunnel system. The research being conducted by Mead and his team accounts for only half of Persistence Cave’s newfound potential. Once much of the sediment is removed from the cave’s entrance, park service staffers and a team of spelunkers from South Dakota and Colorado will begin to try and explore further. Officials believe it could be very large because of the direction and speed of the wind that blows from its only known entrance. “Something with this kind of potential and blowing this strong, we haven’t found anything like that before (in the park),” said Rod Horrocks, a Wind Cave national park scientist whose assistant discovered Persistence Cave. Horrocks believes Persistence could connect to its famous neighbor, Wind Cave, through a passage that’s inaccessible by humans or is filled with sediment, which might explain why nobody discovered it while exploring Wind Cave over the last century. If the caves are connected, the park service could install an environmental gate that would allow cavers to travel between the caves but keep them closed off most of the time to preserve their natural conditions, Horrocks said. For now, Mead and his team will begin hauling bags and bags of sediment out of the entrance to Persistence – which can currently only accommodate about two people – and sifting through thousands of bones in hopes of stitching together the region’s natural history. “(The cave is) just a warehouse of information,” he said. “I’d be surprised if we don’t have at least 100,000 bones by the time we’re done this summer.”"
"Global warming has not undergone a ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’, according to US government research that undermines one of the key arguments used by sceptics to question climate science. The new study reassessed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (Noaa) temperature record to account for changing methods of measuring the global surface temperature over the past century.  The adjustments to the data were slight, but removed a flattening of the graph this century that has led climate sceptics to claim the rise in global temperatures had stopped. “There is no slowdown in warming, there is no hiatus,” said lead author Dr Tom Karl, who is the director of Noaa’s National Climatic Data Centre. Dr Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and the director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies said: “The fact that such small changes to the analysis make the difference between a hiatus or not merely underlines how fragile a concept it was in the first place.” The results, published on Thursday in the journal Science, showed the rate of warming over the past 15 years (0.116C per decade) was almost exactly the same, in fact slightly higher, as the past five decades (0.113C per decade). In 2013, the UN’s most comprehensive report on climate science made a tentative observation that the years since 1998 had seen a “much smaller increasing trend” than the preceding half century. The results highlighted the inadequacy of using the global mean surface temperature as the primary yardstick for climate change. Karl said: “There’s been a lot of work done trying to understand the so-called hiatus and understand where is this missing heat.” A series of studies have since identified a number of factors, including heat transferred into deep oceans and small volcanic eruptions, that affected the temperature at the surface of the Earth. “Those studies are all quite valid and what they suggest is had those factors not occurred the warming rate would even be greater than what we report,” said Karl. Dr Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the UK’s Met Office, said Noaa’s research was “robust” and mirrored an analysis the British team is conducting on its own surface temperature record. “Their work is consistent with independent work that we’ve done. It’s within our uncertainties. Part of the robustness and reliability of these records is that there are different groups around the world doing this work,” he said. But Stott argued that the term slowdown remained valid because the past 15 years might have been still hotter were it not for natural variations.  In the coming years the world is expected to move out of a period in which the gradient of warming has not slowed even though the temperature has been moderated. This means “we could have 10 or 15 years of very rapid rates of warming,” he said. “Even though the observed estimate is increased, over and above that there is plenty of evidence that the rate of warming is still being depressed,” he said. “The caution is around saying that that is our underlying warming rate, because the climate models are predicting substantially higher rates than that.” Noaa’s historical observations were thrown out by unaccounted-for differences between the measurements taken by ships using buckets and ships using thermometers in their engine in-takes, the increased use of ocean buoys and a large increase in the number of land-based monitoring stations. “Science can only progress based on as much information as we have and what you see today is the most comprehensive assessment we can do based on all the information that’s been collected,” said Karl.  Schmidt called the new observations “state of the art” and said Nasa had been in discussions with Noaa about how to incorporate the findings into their own global temperature record. Prof Michael Mann, whose analysis of the global temperature in the 1990s revolutionised the field, said the work underlined the conclusions of his own recent research.  “They’ve sort of just confirmed what we already knew, there is no true ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ in warming,” he said. “To the extent that the study further drives home the fact ... that global warming continues unabated as we continue to burn fossil fuels and warm the planet, it is nonetheless a useful contribution to the literature.” Bob Ward, policy and communications director at London’s Grantham Research Institute, said the news that warming had been greater than previously thought should cause governments currently meeting in Bonn to act with renewed urgency and lay foundations for a strong agreement at the pivotal climate conference in Paris this December. “The myth of the global warming pause has been heavily promoted by climate change sceptics seeking to undermine the case for strong and urgent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions,” said Ward. Since scientists began to report a slower than expected rate of warming during the last decade, climate sceptics have latched on to the apparent dip in order to question the validity of climate models. Last February, US Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz told CNN: “The last 15 years, there has been no recorded warming. Contrary to all the theories that – that they are expounding, there should have been warming over the last 15 years. It hasn’t happened.”  Cruz’s rival for the Republican nomination, Jeb Bush, was using the pause to argue for inaction as early as 2009. The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), the UK thinktank set up by Nigel Lawson to lobby against action on climate change and which hosts a flat-lining temperature graph on the masthead of its website, was dismissive of the study. Dr David Whitehouse, an astrophysicist and science editor for the GWPF, said: “This is a highly speculative and slight paper that produces a statistically marginal result by cherry-picking time intervals.” He claimed the temperature graph was at odds with those of the Met Office and Nasa, despite both organisations saying the new study’s results were consistent with their data."
"Keep it in the Ground has offered excellent news coverage of indigenous communities in Canada and Australia confronting climate change – but Lachlan Mackinnon’s poem (5 June) ends with a tired Last of the Mohicans vision of a white man appropriating “loincloths”. Could I suggest that, to balance out this primitivist misrepresentation, Carol Ann Duffy approach one of the many excellent Native American poets of California, such as Chumash/Esselen poet and eco-activist Deborah Miranda, for a poem about and embedded in living communities and ecologies, accompanied by an article by or about leading Ojibwe environmental activist Winona LaDuke, who will be in the UK this month as part of the Origins festival. After three years of the Idle No More movement, the Guardian needs to do more to recognise the continuing presence and leadership of indigenous communities in the struggle for the living world.Dr Sophie MayerLecturer in film studies, London"
"The US Environmental Protection Agency has said greenhouse gases from aircraft endanger human health, taking the first step toward regulating emissions from the domestic aviation industry.  The EPA’s finding kicks off a process to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation industry, the latest sector to be regulated under the Clean Air Act after cars, trucks and large stationary sources like power plants.  The finding allows the EPA to implement domestically a global carbon dioxide emissions standard being developed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).  The UN agency is due to release its CO2 standard for comment in February 2016 and adopt it later that year.  The EPA had been under pressure from environmental groups who first petitioned it to regulate aircraft emissions under the Clean Air Act in 2007 and sued it in 2010. A federal court ruled in favor of those green groups in 2012.  Aviation accounted for 11% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector in 2010 in the United States, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.  The airline industry has favoured a global standard over individual national standards since airlines operate all over the world and want to avoid a patchwork of rules and measures, such as taxes, charges and emissions trading programs.  “If you’re a big airline and you’re flying to 100 countries a day, then complying with all those different regimes is an administrative nightmare,” said Paul Steele, the senior vice president at the International Air Transport Association, the main global airline industry group.  But some environmental groups are concerned that the standard being discussed at ICAO will do little to change the status quo since it would only apply to new and newly designed aircraft that will not be in operation for several years.  “The stringency being discussed at ICAO is such that existing aircraft are already meeting the standard they are weighing,” said Sarah Burt, an attorney at Earthjustice, one of several groups that sued the EPA to regulate aircraft.

"When Angela Merkel gathers six other world leaders in a Bavarian castle for G7 talks, they will face a heavy agenda, with 26 hours to cover everything from climate change and foreign trade to plastic waste and female empowerment. During the weekend there will be some opera to lighten the load, performed by a star singer flown in for the occasion, as well as spectacular Alpine scenery to help inspire Merkel and her guests as they try to come up with solutions for some of the world’s most pressing problems in their 1,000-metre-high mountain retreat. More than 17,000 police dotted throughout the surrounding thick forests and below in the valley have the job of protecting the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Canada, Italy and the United States from terrorists – and from the tens of thousands of protesters who are expected to descend on the nearby town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The German chancellor has staunchly rejected claims that, at an estimated €200m (£150m) mostly of taxpayers’ money, Sunday’s summit is too expensive as well as lacking in rationale – since countries such as China and India are not involved – and too elitist, the latter view only enhanced by the choice of the heavily guarded Schloss Elmau castle, 60 miles south of Munich, as the venue. The costs do not include those that the individual leaders will clock up themselves, which in the case of Barack Obama, who is bringing an entourage of 2,000, will be considerable. The protesters in the valley complain that it is an exclusive political club of leading industrial countries, taking place at the expense of those countries who are not invited as well as ordinary citizens. But Merkel defended the encounter. “For us what’s important are the consequences of globalisation both at home and in foreign lands, because it’s a process we’d like to happen in a just fashion,” she said. “The G7 seizes on central challenges that have a global relevance and are important for many people.” The seriousness with which she is taking the meeting is reflected in the visits she has made before the event, to Ottawa, Washington, London, Paris, Rome and Tokyo, to make clear to her counterparts early on what her expectations are. Responsible for preparing the meeting are high-level diplomats known as sherpas (so-called because they guide the leaders to their destinations), scurrying around in last-minute talks trying to hammer out deals on every item, in agreements that will then form communiques. Merkel is only too aware that the results of the gathering have the potential to considerably enhance or sully her legacy. The items on the agenda have been thrashed out behind the scenes over the past 18 months or more in intensive discussions, many of which Merkel attended. Certain topics like climate change, energy and the global economy are considered obvious ones for the G7 to tackle. Others, like the crises in Ukraine, Greece, Syria, sanctions against Russia and even the dramatic events unfolding at Fifa, are so pressing they are unavoidable.  A third category consists of topics that work their way on to the agenda because they are considered particularly important to the current holder of the G7 presidency, in this case Germany and Merkel. In 2015 these include the empowerment of women, health issues such as Ebola, marine pollution, energy efficiency and retail and supply chain standards. “We all recall with horror the events in Bangladesh,” Merkel said this week, in reference to the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza factory near Dhaka in what was the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry, claiming more than 1,000 lives. Another item on the agenda that Merkel has indicated is close to her heart – not just as a politician but also as a former research scientist – is the growth of antimicrobial resistance and how it is hampering the efficacy of antibiotics. Merkel has said in off-the-record briefings with journalists that the issue is crying out for a political solution on a global level, and is therefore perfect for the G7. Closely linked to that is the issue of how to tackle the next health epidemic, drawing on the lessons learned from Ebola and Sars and focusing on the growing threat of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). The world’s leading experts on these topics, handpicked by Bill Gates at the request of Merkel, were invited for talks with her in Berlin in the weeks leading up to the summit.  Based on their recommendations, Germany will propose that other G7 leaders sign up to plans to radically reform the World Health Organisationto make it better able to respond to health crises, including the establishment of an emergency medical reserve corps that could rapidly respond to future epidemics. “This is a crucial conference for the future of global health,” said Jeremy Farrar, professor of tropical medicine at Oxford University and the director of the Wellcome Trust, who was involved in the pre-summit talks with Merkel. “This is the first time this issue has been at this level of prominence, and it’s largely thanks to Angela Merkel who has really pushed for it and has put her reputation on the line by doing so.” But where Merkel’s reputation will arguably be most at stake and where the summit’s biggest sticking point is likely to lie is on climate change and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, an area where, despite past pledges, very little progress has been made since 2008. Ideally this G7 will pave the way for a global climate agreement to be reached at the UN climate conference scheduled for December in Paris.  But with the US unclear on its stance and Canada and Japan blocking the long-term goal to decarbonise global energy systems, probably no issue is as controversial as this one. Germany, with its a reputation as a worldwide pioneer in tackling the energiewende, or switch to renewables, and having in Merkel a leader who has not only served as environment minister but, due to her background as a physicist, is known to thoroughly understand the issues, could give new dynamism to the debate. However, Greenpeace said Germany could find itself in the embarrassing position of not fulfilling its own target of reducing greenhouse gas by 40% by 2020. Its huge dependence on coal, and the strong opposition to change from both the coal industry and trade unions, makes the prospect of a phase-out difficult, though environmentalists are holding out hope that Merkel might yet intervene before the summit. “Merkel has chosen to put this topic high on the agenda of an international meeting, but without making a clear commitment to this domestically she risks losing her reputation as a climate chancellor,” Martin Kaiser, head of international climate politics at Greenpeace, told the Guardian. Meanwhile, as the tough negotiating proceeds within the castle walls, the spouses will be provided with their own programme of entertainment. As is traditional, Merkel’s chemistry professor husband, Joachim Sauer, will take on the role of host to the wives of Shinzō Abe of Japan, Stephen Harper of Canada and the European Council president Donald Tusk. He is to lead a sightseeing tour of the region, including the nearby Linderhof palace of the 18th-century “Mad King” Ludwig II of Bavaria, and to a lecture on nanotechnology by the Munich professor Wolfgang Heckl. The spouses will also be invited to a musical evening in Schloss Elmau on Sunday when, at the request of Merkel and Sauer, both opera fanatics, the star soprano Waltraud Meier will perform lieder by Richards Strauss and Wagner. Overshadowing the event is the absence of Russia. Putin was refused an invitation over the annexation of the Crimea, prompting the meeting’s name change from G8 to G7.  The scandal surrounding Germany’s intelligence service, the BND, amid claims it spied on EU officials and companies on behalf of the US National Security Agency, has also threatened to sour relations between Merkel and Obama. Possibly to ease the tension, both leaders are due to meet for bilateral talks over beer and pretzels on Sunday morning, before the summit. Merkel has said the NSA row will not be on the agenda. The nearby village of Krün will host the leaders, prefacing their discussions with a performance by a brass oompah band and dancers in lederhosen and dirndls, in what the mayor has promised will be a “beer garden atmosphere”. After that it will be off up to Elmau, where a landing pad for six helicopters has been built at the back of the hotel, which has variously served as a spa resort for Wehrmacht soldiers and a post-war recuperation site for Holocaust survivors. There, among the 300 staff on duty, will be Michelin-starred chefs on alert round the clock to feed leaders as they negotiate well into the night. “Considering we only have 24 hours and also need to sleep a little bit in between, it is, I believe, an ambitious agenda,” Merkel told a gathering of foreign journalists this week. “I’m looking forward to some intensive and very friendly discussions.” The G7 club grew out of a meeting between French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who first met for a quiet fireside chat outside Paris. Now in its 41st year, the event has evolved beyond recognition. Topics for discussion at this year’s summit, which will cost an estimated €150m to €200m, include the global economy – and such matters as TTIP, the free trade agreement between the United States and Europe, the CETA agreement with Canada, and agreements between the United States and Pacific partners, including Japan) – development issues; climate change (with particular focus on the UN climate conference in Paris in December that aims to see an agreement on ensuring global warming does not exceed two degrees); global health, including the fight against antibiotic resistance, neglected tropical diseases in the light of the recent Ebola epidemic and reform of the WHO; female empowerment in the developing world, particularly professional training; and retail and supply chain standards. Part of the 26-hour-long gathering will include time spent in “outreach meetings” with guests mainly from Africa, including the presidents of Nigeria, Liberia, Senegal, Ethiopia, Tunisia and Iraq. The main topics of conversation will be the fight against terrorism and, thereafter, health and development goals beyond 2015. Also invited to these discussions are the UN secretary general, the chief of the World Bank, and representatives from the World Trade Organisation, WorldWork, the IMF and the OECD."
"Two hundred and fifty years ago this month, a young Scottish engineer took a Sunday walk across Glasgow Green – and changed the world. Thanks to the idea dreamed up by James Watt that Sunday in May 1765, human beings became masters of power generation and so transformed our planet. At the time, Watt was merely fixated with the problems posed by the primitive and inefficient steam engines that were then being used to pump water from mines, and had already made several futile attempts to improve them. Then, on his Sunday walk, the idea for a new device – which he later called the separate condenser – popped into his mind.  It was a notion that would have stunning consequences. The separate condenser changed the steam engine from a crude and inefficient machine into one that became the mainstay of the industrial revolution. Britain was transformed from an agricultural country into a nation of manufacturers. Today, many scientists believe the processes unleashed by Watt have begun to alter the physical makeup of our planet. After two-and-a-half centuries of spewing out carbon dioxide from plants and factories built in the wake of his condenser’s invention, the atmosphere and crust of the Earth are beginning to be transformed. Watt truly changed the world, it seems. Indeed, that walk on Glasgow Green remains “one of the best recorded, and most repeated, eureka moments since Archimedes leaped out of his bathtub”, according to William Rosen in his book The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention, published in 2010. In 1765, Watt – then an instrument-maker based at Glasgow University – was working on a Newcomen pump, a state-of-the-art device in which steam pushed a piston through a cylinder. Water was then sprayed into the cylinder, cooling it and causing the steam to condense, creating a vacuum behind the piston that sucked it back into its original position. More steam was pumped in and the piston was pushed forward again. It was a very powerful process but also a very inefficient one. Constantly heating and then cooling the engine’s huge cylinder required huge amounts of heat and coal. Steam engines like these had only limited usefulness. Then Watt set off on his walk. When he was halfway across the green, the idea of a separate condenser came into his mind. Such a device would, he realised, create a vacuum that would help suck in the engine’s piston but still allow its main cylinder to operate at a constant temperature. “I had not walked further than the golf-house when the whole thing was arranged in my mind,” he later recalled. Watt would have gone to work straight away but was constrained by the dictates of the Scottish sabbath. He quickly made a model of his device, nevertheless, and this is now displayed in the Science Museum in London. Four years later, he patented the condenser – and triggered the industrial revolution. “Watt’s condenser tripled the efficiency of the steam engine and that meant that mill or mine owners got three times more mechanical work for every tonne of coal they had to buy,” says Colin McInnes, professor of engineering science at Glasgow University. “It meant that Britain’s coal stocks had been effectively trebled. He made a tremendous difference to the rate at which industry spread through Britain and subsequently the rest of the world.” Until Watt, human enterprise was constrained by the process of photosynthesis, says McInnes. “In other words, we had to rely on natural living sources for the power we needed to run our factories or plants: fast-flowing water or horses or burning wood. By making the steam efficient, Watt changed all that. He gave us the means to exploit energy-dense fossil fuels in an effective manner. It changed the world and ended the era of renewable energy.” This point is backed up by Ben Russell, curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum, and author of James Watt: Making the World Anew, published last year. “Before Watt, industry had to rely on water power, and there was a strict limit to the number of factories you could build on the banks of fast-flowing rivers,” he says. “After Watt invented the separate condenser, you could build highly efficient factories almost anywhere you wanted. It made it possible to build plants that were driven by cheap, relatively easy sources: coal and steam. The cotton industry was transformed. So was brewing. And mining. Watt brought wide acceptance of steam as a power source.” Within a few decades of Watt’s breakthrough, networks of factories and mines, linked by railways, were spreading across the country, triggering a national frenzy for fossil fuels that has since become a global obsession. Steam power no longer dominates global industry but our reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas still lingers – with growing impacts on the planet. Indeed, the Nobel-prizewinning chemist Paul Crutzen now argues that the greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels have brought about such profound changes that we must accept the world has entered a new epoch. He calls it the “anthropocene”. According to Crutzen and many other scientists, the planet is no longer being shaped primarily by natural processes but by ones set loose by human beings. We are raising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, scarring the planet’s surface in our search for coal and metals, cutting down forests to make way for factories and homes, and acidifying the oceans. Humans have become planet changers. As to the event that triggered this onslaught, there are few better candidates than Watt’s stroll across Glasgow Green 250 years ago – though for such a momentous event, it is still afforded remarkably little recognition. Indeed, it was only relatively recently, in the 1980s, that Glasgow’s councillors decided to install a small boulder in what is Glasgow’s oldest park, with a simple inscription: “Near this spot in 1765, James Watt conceived the idea for the separate condenser for the steam engine.” By contrast, a few metres away, a 40-metre obelisk dedicated to Horatio Nelson was erected in 1806, only a year after his death at Trafalgar. Thus a remote battle was celebrated with a grandiose monument while an invention that gave birth to the industrial revolution and changed the world had to wait almost two centuries for recognition – in the form of a small stone. On the other hand, Watt’s striking achievement will be recognised on 5 June, when Glasgow University stages a seminar, The Invention that Changed the World, focusing on Watt and his revolutionary separate condenser, as part of the Glasgow Science Festival. “Watt was a real product of the enlightenment,” says the seminar’s organiser Lesley Richmond, deputy director of Glasgow University’s archives. “He was self taught, yet went on to work at Glasgow University at a time when Adam Smith and Joseph Black were teaching there. “He was far more than just the inventor of the separate condenser, though that was the device that was to have the greatest impact. He also invented a machine for copying documents, for example – an early photocopier, in effect. “And there is so much we can still learn about him. Many of his devices and papers have still to be properly archived and studied. In 2019, we will mark the bicentenary of Watt’s death. By then, we want to have all his work in digital form. Then we will get a real chance to appreciate his fantastic achievements.”"
"Eighty British companies, including two of the big six energy companies and high street names John Lewis and Tesco, have called on David Cameron to take stronger action on climate change both at home and abroad. Such action could create jobs and boost the UK’s competitiveness, but failure to address climate change could put economic prosperity at risk, the signatories warn in a letter to the prime minister.  The intervention comes as nearly 200 countries are meeting in Bonn to thrash out a draft climate text ahead of a crunch summit in Paris later this year, and just two days after the G7 agreed to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century. The letter is also signed by Sky, Ikea, Coca-Cola, Kingfisher, Unilever and Thames Water, and asks Cameron to seek a “strong climate deal” in Paris that would avoid dangerous global warming.  The businesses, who say they want the UK economy to be energy efficient and low carbon, also call on the prime minister to make sure the the UK sets an ambitious carbon target at home for the early 2030s. Cameron had to personally intervene during the last parliament to agree the last carbon target, for 2023-2027, after George Osborne and other ministers had opposed it. “We look forward to continuing to work with your government to deliver a cleaner, greener and more prosperous Britain,” says the letter, which was published in the FT on Wednesday. David Nussbaum, WWF UK’s chief executive, said: “As we approach international climate talks, Britain should be a global champion for change, but a lack of consistent long-term policies sends a confusing message to business and undermines our attractiveness to investors. The prime minister should send a clear message that the only way forward is a green economy, and support forward-looking firms that want to build a clean economy.” Today’s letter is the latest in a string of interventions by businesses over the UN climate talks, and follows a letter by big oil and gas companies including BP, Shell and Total last week calling for carbon pricing to help cut emissions. The UK’s next carbon target, known as the fifth carbon budget, will cover the period 2028-2032, and is the next step forward in the UK’s legally-set target of cutting emissions 80% by 2050 from 1990 levels. The government’s climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, are expected to publish their recommendations for the target by the end of 2015.

"As humans emit more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the Earth continues to warm. When I use the term “warm”, I mean there is an increase in thermal energy (heat) contained in the oceans and atmosphere of this planet. We can measure warming by measuring temperatures; however, obtaining an accurate reading of the Earth’s temperature is complicated. Temperatures change with seasons, with locations, and there are natural long term variations that move heat around. So, we don’t expect temperatures just to continue increasing at all locations and at all times. We do expect the long term trend to be upwards, however, and that is what we’ve observed.  But if you follow the conversation about global warming, and particularly if you listen to cable news or online bloggers, you might have heard that there has been a hiatus or a halt to global warming. I’ve written before on this site that there is no halt, there never has been one. However there has been a vigorous debate about whether the increase in lower atmosphere temperatures has slowed down.  A new paper, “Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus” just published today in Science deals with this issue. In particular, the lead researcher Dr. Thomas Karl and his colleagues investigate the quality of the near-surface temperature records and ask whether they really show a slowdown. The scientists make a number of improvements upon existing information. First, they focus on ocean surface temperature measurements from floating buoys and from ship-board sensors. We know that temperatures measured by ship sensors are often warmer than temperatures measured by buoys, in part because of the heat generated by the ship engine. A more thorough accounting of this effect has been implemented in the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature data set version 4. This accounting is utilized in the paper. Second, there has been a historical change in how ships measure surface temperatures. Decades ago, temperatures were mainly measured by insulated buckets. Around the time of World War 2, there was a change from insulated buckets to temperature sensors contained within ship hulls. The ship hull sensors recorded warmer water temperatures compared to the bucket method. A more thorough handling of the changes from buckets to ship hull sensors was also included in the new paper. Finally, the new study used more recent estimates of the land temperatures. The new estimates combine multiple temperature databases into a single integrated whole.  The end result is that the temperature trends over the past 17 or so years has continued to increase with no halt. In fact, it has increased at approximately the same rate as it had for the prior five decades. But the authors went further by trying to cherry-pick the start and end dates. For instance, they stacked the cards against themselves by purposefully picking a very hot year to start the analysis and a cool year to terminate the study (1998 and 2012, respectively). Even this cherry-picked duration showed a warming trend. Furthermore, the warming trend was significant. I asked lead author Dr. Karl for his comments on the significance of the paper and he told me,  Considering all the short-term factors identified by the scientific community that acted to slow the rate of global warming over the past two decades (volcanoes, ocean heat uptake, solar decreases, predominance of La Niñas, etc.) it is likely the temperature increase would have accelerated in comparison to the late 20th Century increases. Once these factors play out, and they may have already, global temperatures could rise more rapidly than what we have seen so far. So what does this all mean? Well we knew the globe was warming. The best evidence has always been by measuring the enormous amount of heat going into the oceans. But what this new paper shows is that the warming in the recent years has not stopped and has not even slowed down.  With 2015 so far running hotter than any year on record, and with May temperatures expected to be in the 0.79–0.84°C anomaly range, it becomes increasingly likely that we will set another all-time record this year. With hope, this will end the discussion of the so-called “pause” or “hiatus,” which never existed in the first place."
"At yesterday’s summit in Bavaria, the G7 leading industrial nations agreed to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century. It’s easy to be cynical about these things, but these official goals really matter. And one big reason is this: in the absence of intergovernmental action, we are hopelessly ill-equipped to deal with this problem as individuals.  In fact, if a cabal of evil psychologists had gathered in a secret undersea base to concoct a crisis humanity would be hopelessly ill-equipped to address, they couldn’t have done better than climate change. We’ve evolved to respond more vigorously to threats that are immediate and easy to picture mentally, rather than those that are distant and abstract; we’re more sensitive to intentional threats from specific humans, rather than unintentional ones resulting from collective action; we’re terrible at making small sacrifices in the present to avoid vast ones in future; our attention is seized by phenomena that change daily, rather than those that ratchet up gradually over years. And should it dawn on us that our behaviours don’t match our beliefs – that we’re not doing our bit to save the planet, even though we think we should – we find it far easier to adjust the belief (downgrading the importance of climate change) than the behaviour (flying less, having fewer children). In one strikingly depressing scene in his recent book Don’t Even Think About It, climate change activist George Marshall interviews the Nobel prizewinning psychologist Daniel Kahneman, the leading scholar of cognitive biases, and tries to nudge him into saying that understanding our brains’ limitations will, at the very least, make it easier to overcome them. “I’m not very optimistic about that,” Kahneman replies, despondently sipping tomato soup. “No amount of psychological awareness will overcome people’s reluctance to lower their standard of living. So that’s my bottom line: there is not much hope. I’m thoroughly pessimistic. I’m sorry.” The pessimism of experts provides yet another reason to pay attention to something else, anything else, instead of climate change: why choose to spend your days feeling relentlessly depressed? Then there’s the problem the scientist and filmmaker Randy Olson has called “the great unmentionable”, which is that climate change is incredibly boring. “I dare you to find any major programme studying public attitudes toward climate”, he told the New York Times, “and willing to call it what it is … [which is] quite possibly the most boring subject the science world has ever had to present to the public.” It feels shameful to admit that I agree, as if calling something uninteresting is to say that it’s also unimportant. In fact, though, the opposite is true: the most important challenges are frequently the least interesting, because they involve the slow workings of complex impersonal systems, rather than stories of individual humans. Even once you grasp that people in general are terrible at responding to a threat such as climate change, though, there’s another hurdle: it remains much harder to accept how far you’re prone to such psychological pitfalls yourself. (This bias against perceiving your own bias has its own label: the bias blind spot.) It’s easy enough for any of us who aren’t climate-change deniers to engage in armchair psychoanalysis of them: they’re mired in denial and defence mechanisms, busily constructing online communities of like-minded people to help shield themselves from guilt, from accepting the need for personal sacrifices, or from contemplating their mortality. It’s much more difficult to accept that, in a subtler sense, you might be a climate change denier yourself. But the drive to eliminate cognitive dissonance – to rid yourself of the discomfort that comes from holding contradictory beliefs, or failing to act in accordance with your beliefs – is an awesomely powerful thing. People who become parents, for instance, actually seem to start taking climate change a little less seriously, according to Marshall’s evidence. You might think having children would elicit greater concern for the welfare of future generations – but what wins out, apparently, is the desire not to feel guilty about the environmental impact of procreation. Equally tricksy is “moral licensing”, the phenomenon whereby performing a virtuous action provides you with a self-righteous inner glow, leaving you feeling justified in performing some less virtuous action – even if the damaging impact of the latter far outweighs the benefits of the former. This is surely endemic in “ethical living”: if you feel so good about yourself for recycling paper that you take an additional long-haul flight each year, your commitment to the environment has straightforwardly made matters worse. As a journalist, it’s troubling to speculate how much journalism on climate change has a moral-licensing effect on the journalists involved: will writing this piece make me feel as if I’ve done my bit? Marshall makes a resolute effort to end his book on an upbeat note. We must change the narrative, he explains, framing the crisis as one happening here and now, not in the future, and to humans, not polar bears. He visits American mega-churches and suggests we learn lessons from US religion, which manages to connect with the reverence that millions of people feel for certain “sacred values”; climate campaigners should talk in these terms as much as in the language of rational trade-offs and the risk of future destruction. And we must be as stringent in questioning our own assumptions, and scrutinising our own propensity to bias, as those of others. (Committed environmentalists might start by closely examining their motives for rejecting potential technological solutions.) Personally I lean more towards Kahneman’s pessimism. Yet the same self-questioning stance surely demands that I acknowledge even pessimism has its selfish payoffs: if there’s nothing to be done, I might as well not bother trying to do anything. Despair can be a kind of denialism, too."
"California lawmakers have passed a dozen ambitious environmental and energy bills setting high goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and petroleum use, and creating new standards for energy efficiency. Dubbed the California climate leadership package, the 12 bills represent a Democratic-driven push in the Senate to advance an agenda of technological innovation and conservation that was put into play by an executive order by California Governor Jerry Brown in April. The package will next move to the assembly for debate. One of the cornerstones of the program is SB 350, which calls for a “50-50-50” reduction in major areas of climate concern. It mandates a 50% reduction in petroleum use by vehicles by 2030, the equivalent of removing 36m cars and trucks from the road.  It also calls for 50% of the state’s electricity supply to be derived from renewable resources by that date, and 50% better energy efficiency in buildings through retrofits and upgrades.  “California has demonstrated our global climate leadership over the last decade,” said Senate president Kevin de Leon after the passage of SB 350. “These policies will further cement our leadership, further strengthen our economy and protect the health of our communities.” Another cornerstone of the legislative package is SB 32, which continues executive orders first made by then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2005 and later passed by the legislature in California’s groundbreaking 2006 climate change law, which created cap-and-trade emissions requirements for large industrial polluters like oil refineries and power companies.  SB 32 increases those pollution reduction goals – specifically from manmade greenhouse gases, requiring the state to reduce emissions to 40% below its 1990 levels by 2030, and then increasing that to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.  The bill’s author, Senator Fran Pavley, pointed out that the state was on track to meet the old goals set by the previous bill. Calling the targets “science-based numbers”, she added that the creation of new technologies was key to meeting those objectives. California has long prided itself as a center of invention, and Pavely expressed confidence that the state could find progressive ways to meet the increases. “I bet right now there is some 20-year-old in some parent’s garage coming up with the next new innovation,” she said. SB 350 passed by a 24-14 vote and SB 185 passed by a 22-14 vote along party lines. Other bills in the package included measures to push public pension plans to divest in coal companies, require cities to include climate considerations in their general plans, and a proposal to study atmospheric rivers to increase water supply reliability.  Critics of the legislation, especially SB 350, said the measures would lead to further economic hardship and job loss. The senate Republican caucus opposed many of the bills, calling them unfair to inland parts of the state that rely on traditional industries such as agriculture and trucking, while favoring coastal areas that have more technology-driven economies.  As California has rebounded from the recession, those rural inland areas have seen less job growth and higher unemployment than larger metropolitan areas with more diverse economies. Many voiced concern that the bills would push companies – and work – into other states while overall doing little to impact climate change. “What I see in our emerging economy is coastal-elite winners and the inland rural losers,” said Senate minority leader Bob Huff before voting against SB 350. “The fact is we are using fossil-based fuels to feed the world … when we stop burning fuel, coal for fuel, that doesn’t stop Arizona or Oregon or other states from doing it, or China. And so we have a very lofty and noble goal, but other than feeling good about it, what does it actually accomplish?” De Leon, who represents a district centered in Los Angeles, later called the threat of job losses “scare tactics” and countered. “We can’t be negative Nellies and Debbie downers and doomsday preachers that there is going to be economic peril.” He added that creating jobs was a focus of the legislation, and citied previous actions such as Proposition 39, passed in 2012, which provided funds for green retrofits in schools, and created jobs performing that work.  “You can’t argue with a job that has been created,” he said. “We can put people to work. But everyone has to be on the same page … It has to be done with a sense of intentionality, with a sense of purpose. That’s what we’re about.”"
"Australia has forfeited its position as a global leader on tackling climate change and is now a “free-rider”, a panel led by former secretary general of the United Nations Kofi Annan has said. The Africa Progress Report 2015 disputes claims by the fossil fuel lobby that moving away from carbon would impede economic growth in developing countries. It says high-emitting nations, such as Australia, have stepped back from global discussions in favour of unilateral action.  “Despite the known threats, far too many countries are failing to take decisive action. Several countries including Australia and Canada appear to have withdrawn entirely from constructive international engagement on climate,” the report said. It is particular scathing about the direction in which Australia’s climate change policies are headed. “With one of the world’s highest levels of per capita emissions, Australia has gone from leadership to free-rider status in climate diplomacy. Repeal of the Clean Energy Future Plan effectively abolished carbon pricing. Current policies will result in emissions increasing by about 12-18 per cent above 2000 emissions,” it said. “End the free rides: Australia, Canada, Japan and the Russian Federation should set a clear course for zero emissions by 2050, with deep reductions by 2030. These countries might consider the far higher level of ambition set by Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda.” Lobbying by coal companies is becoming more prominent, the report noted, saying they have been “campaigning vigorously” in Australia. “Continued dependence on coal in power generation is holding back efforts to decarbonise growth,” the report said. “Going to ‘zero coal’ is a global priority.”  Australia was grilled by other delegates at a United Nations conference in Bonn, Germany on Thursday. All delegates, including Australia, were asked about their progress towards a 2020 emissions reduction target, in preparation for the Paris conference on climate change later in December, though Australia received the highest number of questions on how it was progressing. Environment minister Greg Hunt brushed aside the criticism, saying it was part of a regular process. “Each country is asking questions and each country is being asked questions. What we’ve been party to is precisely what the international community should be doing,” he told reporters on Friday. Prime minister Tony Abbott blamed Labor for “talking down” Australia.“Under this government we will meet our target. We will meet our target and it’s a very internationally respectable target,” Abbott told reporters on Friday.  “The difference between this government and our political opponents is that we will meet the target without smashing the economy with a great big new tax on everything.” Greens leader Richard Di Natale said Australia has become a “pariah” on its emissions reductions stance. “How is it that we’re effectively riding on the backs of some of the poorest nations who are in fact doing a great deal when it comes to addressing climate change?” he asked. “Tony Abbott has to decide whether he wants to return to Australia’s proud tradition of working constructively with partners like the US and China on tackling climate change or to continue to act as a wrecker of global cooperation,” shadow environment minister Mark Butler said."

"The global climate agreement being negotiated this year must be worded in such a way that it doesn’t require approval by the US Congress, the French foreign minister said on Monday. Laurent Fabius told African delegates at UN climate talks in Bonn that “we know the politics in the US. Whether we like it or not, if it comes to the Congress, they will refuse.” If negotiators follow his plan, that would exclude an international treaty that has legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions — something some countries still insist on but which would have no chance of being ratified by the Republican-controlled Congress. “We must find a formula which is valuable for everybody and valuable for the US without going to the Congress,” said Fabius, who will host the UN climate summit in Paris in December where the new agreement is supposed to be adopted. Those pushing for a legally binding deal in Paris include the European Union and small island nations who fear being wiped out by rising seas. Amjad Abdulla, a Maldives delegate who is the chief negotiator for the small-island group, said while the group still wants a binding agreement. “I think it’s important that we get everyone on board. We are still looking into options,” he said. One possible outcome in Paris is a deal in which some elements are binding but not the emissions targets set by individual countries. The Obama administration has pledged to reduce US emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The Peruvian environment minister, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, said he was “completely sure that we will have an agreement in Paris”, despite the complex political situation in the US. Jennifer Morgan, a climate policy expert at the World Resources Institute, said it was encouraging that Fabius was raising the legal issue now so it can be dealt with before the Paris conference. “It’s a sign that he’s really pushing countries to come to terms with what the agreement can and cannot be,” she said. Negotiators also need to decide how to differentiate between what rich and poor countries should do to fight climate change, and how to verify that countries are doing what they say they would. The main goal for the two-week session in Bonn that began on Monday is to shorten the sprawling climate change negotiating text. Ahead of the meeting, six European oil and gas companies called for a global price on carbon. In a letter to Fabius and the UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, the chief executives of Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Eni, Total, Statoil and the BG Group said carbon markets should be introduced around the world and eventually linked into an international system. Carbon markets set limits on the pollution a company can release and allow them to trade emission permits using the market to set the price. “Our companies would like to open direct dialogue with the UN and willing governments,” the companies said. Some environmental groups were suspicious of the letter, with Greenpeace calling it a “smokescreen”, and the role carbon markets will play in the Paris agreement is still unclear. “In the long term, they have the wrong business model. And that’s something they have to acknowledge,” said Martin Kaiser, a Greenpeace climate policy expert."

"Thrift grows tenacious at the tide’s reach.What is that reach when the wateris rising, rising?  Our melting, shifting, liquid world won’t waitfor manifesto or mandate, eachwarning a reckoning. Ice in our gin or vodka chirrups and squeaksdissolving in the hot, still airof talking, talking."
"Climate change negotiators meeting in Bonn on Thursday came up with a last-minute compromise that observers hope will put the talks on track for a new global agreement on greenhouse gases. Slow progress was made until the final hours, as nations wrangled over the wording of an 89-page draft text, intending to cut it down to a more manageable size. After two weeks, the text had been cut by just four pages to 85.   But shortly before the talks were scheduled to finish, countries agreed that the co-chairs of the negotiations should be allowed to make their own alterations to the text, and present it to all countries for approval, probably in late July. This should be a quicker process, though there is no guarantee that countries will not try to re-draw the new draft when it becomes available. The talks in Bonn were a staging post on the way to a crunch conference in Paris this December, at which countries are supposed to sign a new global agreement on limiting greenhouse gas emissions, to take effect from 2020 when current emissions commitments run out. Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the US Centre for Energy and Climate Solutions, told the Guardian: “There was little chance the parties themselves were going to be able to whittle down the text to a manageable size. Thankfully, they’ve entrusted the co-chairs to do that so they can get down to the real give-and-take next time. That’s a healthy sign.”   Samantha Smith, leader of the global climate and energy initiative at WWF, said: “Progress in Bonn has been slow, but a bigger concern is the growing gap between what is needed and what is being promised on finance and emissions. While much work remains to close that gap, there is hope that governments are finally committed to take more action on emissions prior to 2020. “All countries have said that more ambitious, immediate emissions cuts are needed: however, that work needs to speed up if we are going to avoid the very worst impacts of climate change.” The Bonn talks are a staging post on the way to a crunch conference in Paris this December, at which governments are hoping to sign a new global pact, to take effect from 2020, when current commitments from developed and large developing countries to limit their emissions are set to expire. Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, a US thinktank, pointed to progress made outside the talks, such as the G7’s vow to decarbonise their economies this century, and commitments by developing countries, cities and businesses on emissions.  “This week, strong signals were sent for ambitious climate action from outside the negotiations, but they did not inspire a faster pace in Bonn. Momentum is growing ahead of the Paris climate talks [but] the modest progress made in Bonn did not match the significant action taking place around the world.” The talks have been mired in discussions ranging from concern over whether rich countries will follow through on their current pledges to provide financial assistance to the poor world, to arcane quibbles over single words in the text. At one point, the discussion was divided over whether to use the terms “differentiated commitments/contributions”, referring to targets on cutting emissions, or the term “commitments/contributions/action”. The former was preferred by China, the latter by the US. The distinction may seem trivial, but it points to some of the entrenched attitudes that have dogged the talks over more than two decades. “Differentiated” comes from a term used in the original UN treaties, as “common but differentiated responsibilities” was used as the way of encoding the fact that all countries, developed and developing, have an interest in alleviating climate change, but that their responsibilities varied based on historical emissions and economic development. China is adamant that the phrase, known as CBDR in the UN jargon, is core to any existing or potential new agreement, but the US – though it accepts the principle – is wary of the phrase because it believes it has been used in the past to draw a clear dividing line between developed and developing countries. These categories are no longer so clear-cut, according to the US, because of the rapid progress of emerging economies. China, for instance, is now the world’s biggest emitter and second biggest economic power. Moving beyond these entrenchments was always going to be a struggle, and the Bonn talks have proved no exception to the routine of long and difficult meetings, bogged down in detail, that have characterised the long-running negotiations. However, some delegates found room for optimism in the fact that, unlike previous meetings, this fortnight’s talks have not been fractious. “There has been no drama, no theatrics,” said Diringer. “The atmosphere has not been like that.” He praised the co-chairs of the talks, who will be key to getting countries together to form an agreement. “The co-chairs have done a very artful job of building trust and that’s paying off. All the issues are still on the table, and there’s enormous work to be done, but there’s a clear plan for moving forward. That’s probably the best we could have hoped for at this stage.” Mohamed Adow, senior climate change adviser at the charity Christian Aid, said that a meeting of key ministers, pegged for late July in Paris, must clear the ground for an agreement.  “The crunch issues that ministers need to work on are ensuring that the Paris deal is funded, that it protects vulnerable communities and it has a mechanism to increase ambition over time. It is vital that when ministers meet in Paris on July 20-21 that they resolve these sticking points so that when formal talks resume in August countries will have no excuses.”"

"Political gridlock over climate change has left the US military exposed to Russia’s superior fleets in the Arctic, flooding in its naval bases and a more unstable world, according to high-ranking former military commanders and security advisors. The comments, published on the Weather Channel on Wednesday, echoed president Barack Obama, who recently lambasted climate sceptic politicians for jeopardising global and national security.  Sherri Goodman, who served as Bill Clinton’s deputy undersecretary of defence and founded the security analysis firm CNA Corporation, said the US climate debate was “stuck in the past” and that climate change was “acting as a threat multiplier in the Arctic”. The Arctic is the most rapidly warming region on Earth and its sea ice has undergone major declines in recent years and decades. Goodman said the intransigence of US politics had left a technology deficit in the far north - a place where the two increasingly tense powers are separated by just 82km. “Right now we have a fleet, a very small fleet of ageing icebreakers. The Russians and other countries have vastly more ice-breaking capability and other capabilities to be present in the Arctic. We will need to have a greater presence in the Arctic of various types,” she said. “We’re still having debates about whether this is happening, as opposed to what we should do about it,” she said. “We need to guard against the failure of imagination when it comes to climate change. Something is going to happen in the future years, and we’re not going to be prepared.” “Literally, the nation’s defence is at stake,” said rear admiral David Titley, former naval oceanography operations command and a professor of meteorology.  “Unfortunately all we have to look at are the events of the day in Crimea and Ukraine and we see that the Russians are making some noises about, ‘well, you know, maybe the Arctic is another place we should compete rather than cooperate’,” he said. Brigadier general Stephen Cheney, CEO of the American Security Project and a foreign affairs advisor to the State Department, said the security concerns extended beyond the Arctic to the very foundation of US military power - its naval bases. “I can start here in the continental United States where we’ve got 30 naval bases both here and overseas. Naval bases by the nature of course are on the coast. Coasts are threatened as the sea level rises, and I can give you two very prominent examples, the Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia, for instance. Eglin Air Force base in Florida, another one, has already flooded in this past year when they had to shut it down for the first time in its history,” he said. But he said the concerns were not limited to the US’s ability to defend itself. Climate change was already causing wars around the world. He gave the example of Tuareg farmers in Mali, displaced by drought and radicalised by conflict, who have destabilised the west African country. “We know climate change caused this,” he said. It was important, said Cheney, that the military recognised its own contribution as the largest polluter in the world’s second highest polluting country. Weaning the defence force off fossil fuels is an active policy that would solve a security and supply problem as well as bring down carbon emissions. “Many conflicts throughout our history have been based on resource competition,” said General Charles Jacoby, who was the commander of the US North Command - the primary line of defence against invasion for the US mainland - until last year. He said that this competition would only intensify in the future, with energy and water supply at the top of the list. Jacoby said climate change was a “legitimate mission that we readily embrace”. He said the military had to be pragmatic and the politicking around climate change, on which the Republican party has grown increasingly extreme, was ultimately irrelevant. “It can be considered a politicised issue. And it can be considered something that one party is more interested in, another party less interested in. I’m a soldier. I’m a requirements guy. I’m a mission accomplishment guy. And so for me, it’s be in favor of what’s happening. And so, I deal with the facts. Whatever the cause, is less relevant to me than the effect,” he said. On Tuesday the Guardian revealed US conservatives had directed $125m toward groups in an effort to seed doubt over the existence of global warming and derail the Obama administration’s climate policies. The Weather Channel also interviewed leading Republicans, who bemoaned the party’s obstructionism. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who governed New Jersey and served as director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under George W Bush, said the Republican stance on climate change was “frustrating and puzzling” citing the GOP’s history of environmental stewardship. “It was Richard Nixon who established the Environmental Protection Agencies. I mean, it’s ours. It’s our issue. It’s conservation. It’s conservative. This is an issue we should be talking about in a rational way. Let’s not politicise it, let’s not demand that everybody be absolutely for or absolutely against climate change,” she said. Henry Paulson, Bush’s treasury secretary, appeared to disagree with Whitman’s assessment of the Republican attitude to climate change. “I think that there are plenty of Republicans that understand that this is a huge problem and we need to deal with it. And there are plenty of Democrats that don’t want to deal with it,” he said. This is despite just five Senate Republicans voting for a measure to recognise the significant contribution of humans to climate change - the bill was defeated. The EPA’s director under the first president Bush, William Reilly, said he was also bemused by his party’s undermining of climate action. But he said he was hopeful of change. “Young people of all stripes including young Republicans are very supportive of both acknowledging that we have a climate problem and humans are contributing to it,” he said."

"The draft decision not to place the Great Barrier Reef on Unesco’s ‘in danger’ list is a coup for Australia. The government has lobbied intensely to avoid the ignominy of a ‘world heritage in danger’ listing that would undermine tourism at a site that attracts two million visitors each year. Having its ability to protect the natural wonder questioned by the UN would have been a further stain on the environmental credibility of a country now viewed in some quarters as a global vandal. It is likely that Unesco’s world heritage committee will adopt the draft – submitted by Unesco adviser, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – when it meets in Bonn in June. The reprieve for Australia comes with strict conditions about the implementation of measures to protect the reef system. But experts have told the Guardian that even though the reef was not officially listed as in danger the threat to its survival remains severe and the measures Unesco required of Australia would be inadequate to save it. In recent years the Unesco committee has notified Australia of its alarm at the continuing impacts on the reef of climate change, water pollution, dredging for port facilities (including the massive expansion at Abbot Point coal port) and fishing. In response to their concerns the Australian government submitted its Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan (LTSP) in March. On Friday the IUCN issued a cautious approval of the plan, noting its “effective implementation ... supported by clear oversight and accountability, research, monitoring and adequate and sustained financing, is essential to respond to the current and potential threats to the property”. The plan rules out the dumping of dredging spoil – which will be dragged from the seabed to create channels for coal transport ships – within the reef’s marine park. But Dr Nick Graham, a reef expert at James Cook University, said there was evidence that dredging alone would damage the reef by stirring up sediment which would settle widely on the reef, causing disease. As the impacts of the planned expansion of the Abbot Point coal port begin to manifest on the coral, he said Unesco may again consider listing the reef as in danger. “Dredging at that sort of scale is not compatible with a healthy reef and it’s not just the dredging, it’s the increased numbers of ships that are going to be moving through the Great Barrier Reef as a result,” Graham said. The primary long-term threat to the Great Barrier Reef, and coral reefs worldwide, is climate change. A major coral bleaching event, associated with increased ocean temperatures, has been underway since the middle of last year and is predicted to continue into next year. In the face of these existential threats to the ecosystem, it is essential that Australia does everything it can to reduce local pressures, including sediment from dredging, said Graham. Mark Eakin, coordinator of the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) Coral Reef Watch programme, said conservation measures in the Australian plan were a step forward. But any plan that enshrined and expedited the extraction and burning of coal would only fuel the greatest threat to the reef. “The Abbot Point expansion with a major increase in coal exports is antithetical to the need to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere,” he said. Hundreds of miles inland from where the reef fringes the Queensland coastline, 27bn tonnes of coal lies beneath the ground in the Galilee Basin. Australia’s right-wing government has pushed hard to open the region up to vast new mines. The expansion of Abbot Point to become the world’s biggest coal port is a key part of leveraging the mineral wealth and revitalising Australia’s flagging mining boom. “I think that the pressure that the original proposal to list it at risk has brought on the Australian government has resulted in some very important changes. The one thing that’s unfortunate that it hasn’t done is to influence their current major push to extract and export as much coal as possible,” said Eakin. Despite the shortcomings of the plan, campaigners and experts expressed relief that the Unesco committee had not formally listed the site as ‘in danger’. Graham said he didn’t think such a move would have helped the conservation of the reef. Campaigners were similarly cautious about calling for a listing. “We never called for an ‘in danger’ listing as we want it protected and if it had been on the danger list it might have led to complacency,” said Felicity Wishart, reef campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society. WWF-Australia chief executive Dermot O’Gorman said: “Unesco has made the right decision. The future world heritage status of the reef should rightly be determined based on the actual condition of its precious corals and marine life – as assessed by scientists.” Greenpeace campaigner Shani Tager said, however, that the organisation had hoped the reef would be listed as in danger because it would send an even stronger message to the government. Experts and campaigners agreed that the key detail of the Unesco draft decision was the acknowledgement of serious ongoing decline to the reef system and the strict continued monitoring demanded by the committee. Tager said: “I think we’re seeing that Unesco is very concerned about the future of the reef. The Long Term Sustainability Plan is not enough as we don’t think you can have a safe expansion of coal ports in particular. Unesco has recognised the difficulties of the reef and the continued monitoring of it is good news.” PollutionRun-off from agricultural fertilisers and manure have raised nutrient levels in the southern two-thirds of the marine park to dangerous concentrations that disrupt the ecosystem’s ability to take up nutrients. The Australian government’s plan aims for an 80% reduction in run-off pollution by 2025. Experts have said the lag between improved practices and environmental benefits is likely to mean that the nutrient cycle will continue to be affected for some decades. Climate ChangeWarming driven by greenhouse gas emissions is heating up the seas around Australia. 15 of the 20 warmest years on record have been recorded in the past 20 years. In the summer of 2012/13 the hottest sea surface temperatures for the Australian region were recorded. By 2100, average sea temperatures off north-eastern Australia could be 2.5% warmer than at present. Corals subjected to sharp increases in temperature are at risk of bleaching and death. Coal and shippingThe reef’s region is already highly industrialised. Between 2011 and 2013 ports within or adjacent to the region accounted for 76% of the total through output for all Queensland ports – most of this traffic was related to the coal industry. High concentrations of coal dust have been detected in the park. Between 2001 and 2013, 28m cubic metres of dredge material were dumped in the Great Barrier Reef world heritage site. The expansion of the Abbot Point port will require large-scale dredging that will now be dumped onshore. FishingFishing has been well controlled by the Park Authority, with an outstanding 30% of the site protected by a no-take zone. However the IUCN noted continuing concern over some residual impacts. These include the accidental capture through entanglement of turtles, dolphins and dugongs in commercial fishing nets."

"Roads have twisted in the heat. Hospitals are overwhelmed by thousands of dehydrated people, the poor, the elderly and children among the worst hit. Urgent instructions to wear wide-brimmed hats and light-coloured cotton clothes, use umbrellas and drink lots of fluid have been issued by the government. India is struggling to cope with one of the deadliest heatwaves to hit the subcontinent. And its attempt to do so is raising a question for the whole planet – how can humans cope with the kinds of temperatures that scientists fear may become ever more common? In only 10 days, the death toll is reported to have reached around 1,800, a 20-year high. The brunt of the burden has fallen on the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, where 1,300 people have died, the highest loss of life due to heat the state has known, according to officials. By comparison, 447 people in the state died from the heat last year. The blistering temperatures may, mercifully, be about to break, as there are signs that the longed-for monsoon may be arriving in the form of showers and thunderstorms in the south. But as temperatures neared 50C in recent weeks, leave for doctors has been cancelled and the government has issued warnings for people to stay indoors and stay hydrated. For many, though, that isn’t an option. The greatest loss of life has been among the elderly and the poor, in particular day labourers who have little alternative but to risk their lives in the heat for fear of losing their livelihoods. “People are dying and suffering, and I think it shows us the vulnerability that exists even in an area that is used to very hot weather,” said Peter Stott at the Met Office in Exeter. “It can still have a major impact.” It is hard to say for sure whether any single extreme weather event is a result of manmade climate change, but this is a scenario we should get used to seeing more of, scientists say. As the effects of climate change take hold and global temperatures creep up, extreme heat events will become more common. “Recent research shows that heatwaves are currently five times more frequent than they would be in the absence of human-caused warming, and the chance of any particular heatwave being caused by climate change is 80%,” a spokesperson for Greenpeace said, adding that unless efforts are made to cut carbon emissions, heatwaves are forecast to be 12 times more likely by 2040. These trends will push the capabilities of the human body beyond the limits of the cooling systems it has evolved and raise serious questions about the future of food production and farming. Globally, more than half of all working hours outside the home are spent outdoors, mainly in agriculture. As the heatwave in India shows, those who have to work outside in hot conditions are at the greatest risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. There are reports that construction workers in the Indian city of Gurgaon had no choice but to continue working all last week in temperatures higher than 43C, in order to earn their wage of 200 rupees a day (about £2). “If everybody had the same lifestyle as Europeans and Americans, it wouldn’t be so much of an issue, but most of the food that is generated and grown in south-east Asia, Latin America and parts of Africa comes from small landholders,” said Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London (UCL). “In the south of the US people in air-conditioned tractors are farming vast areas in an industrial way, but most of the world works on smallholders producing enough food to feed themselves and enough surplus to provide food for the local towns and cities.” This problem is exacerbated by the fact that humidity in the areas most affected by climate change poses an insurmountable challenge to the way the human body deals with heat. “Humans can survive for short periods in environments hot enough to cook a steak, as long as the air is dry,” said Matthew Huber of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of New Hampshire, who has studied the extent to which humans might adapt to heat stress as a result of global warming. Those same temperatures in more humid climates would kill us. “Humans have a vast and nearly unique capacity to cool themselves by sweating – but this only works when the air is relatively dry,” he added. In very dry conditions, people can work outside in temperatures of up to 40C. But the safety cutoff drops below 30C when you have very high humidity. To calculate the limits in which it is safe for people to work in extreme heat, scientists rely on a measure of temperature that takes into account both the heat and the humidity. This is known as the wet-bulb globe temperature. At wet-bulb temperatures higher than 35C, human skin can no longer itself cool down through evaporation. The US military suspends training and physical exercise when this temperature exceeds 32C. Peak wet-bulb temperatures measured in the heatwave in India are around 30-31C. “While this value is less than the 35C threshold, that threshold is the value for a healthy, fully hydrated person in the shade who is not engaged in labour,” said Huber, explaining why the heatwave in India has been so lethal. “On the other hand, for poor workers in India, not working can also carry serious consequences.” In recent years, several groups have used this measure to make predictions about what rising temperatures will mean for workers worldwide, and to paint a picture of what global productivity will look like as average temperatures creep up. A recent study published in Nature Climate Change estimates that heat stress has already reduced global labour to 90% of capacity during the hottest months of the year. Under the most dire climate change projections, this could fall as low as 40% by 2200. The regions predicted to be worst affected include India, northern Australia and the south-east of the US. But countries that cannot afford technological adaptations such as air conditioning will be affected the most. “As climate change starts to bite and these heatwaves come, people in poor countries are very vulnerable because they don’t have another source of income,” said Maslin. “So if their crops fail and they are not able to work outside, they don’t have the money to buy food so they starve.” The effects of crop failure are also likely to have global repercussions in terms of food security. In 2009, Maslin was involved in a report published by UCL and medical journal The Lancet on how to manage the health effects of climate change. It said that the biggest threat from climate change was to food and water security. “You have a double whammy: your populations are increasing and the heatwaves are increasing. So the amount of food you can produce is going to decrease and there you have a major crisis,” Maslin said. He pointed to a Russian heatwave in 2010 that affected global wheat prices. Although numbers are hard to pin down, it is forecast that many people will be forced to leave their homes, making climate migration an international issue. About 17 million people were displaced by natural hazards in 2009, and 42 million in 2010, according to a British government report. People who work outside, in extreme cases of climate change, may become seasonal migrant workers, Huber said.  In the short term, policies that could help include instituting international work standards for heat conditions, or even switching to night-time working to reduce exposure. “I predict that access to air conditioning – or an equivalent technology – will become a fundamental right enshrined in international law,” Huber said. Nevertheless, such technological solutions come with their own problems. Relying on air conditioning for survival means that power cuts – which are common during heatwaves – would become life threatening. Much better, scientists say, would be to reduce global warming. The next Lancet commission, a follow-up to the 2009 report, is due next month. “It focuses on cutting emissions and why this is so important for global health,” Maslin said.“The reason is that, as far as economists can see, there is no way of ensuring those people have enough money to be protected from the problem of not being able to grow food.” Stott agreed. Bleak as the picture is, he said: “The key thing is where emissions go. When we think about the future, it’s a very different world depending on what happens to carbon emissions – and there’s still plenty of opportunity to avoid those worst effects. The next few years are crucial. It’s all to play for.” Cooling The body works hard to keep its core temperature at around 37C. As it heats up, blood vessels expand, sending blood to the surface of the skin to cool it down. Sweating increases in an attempt to cool the surface of the skin through evaporation, though high humidity can make this impossible. Heat exhaustion After several days of heat exposure, the body’s attempts to cool itself down begin to take their toll. Lost fluids and salts cause muscles to stop working, leading to cramps and weakness. Reduced blood flow to the brain causes headaches and dizziness. The elderly and people with high blood pressure are most at risk. Heatstroke The body’s cooling system becomes overwhelmed and shuts down, and body temperature can rocket to 41C or more in 10 minutes. Organs can no longer function, and if heatstroke isn’t treated fast, the brain overheats, sometimes leading to death. Sunstroke This is the most common type of heatstroke, caused by the sun shining directly on the head and neck for long periods. • The article was amended on 6 June 2015 to correct the affiliation of academic Matthew Huber."
"BP has threatened to widen a rift between European and US oil companies over how to respond to global warming by urging political leaders to deliver a “substantial” deal at international climate change talks later this year.  Bob Dudley, chief executive of the British oil and gas group, said the United Nations global warming summit in December needed to broker agreements that encourage energy efficiency, renewable power such as wind and the use of gas. Such moves are considered vital if global governments are to succeed in keeping the Earth’s temperatures from rising more than 2C, the internationally agreed threshold to prevent widespread flooding, famine and desertification.  Asked what he wanted to see from the UN conference in Paris, Dudley said: Something substantial needs to be done. We are conscious of that ... we encourage policymakers to move forward on this when they meet in December.” His comments came amid signs of a transatlantic rift in the oil and gas industry over how to tackle global warming. Last week, BP and a group of European oil companies including Shell and Total of France wrote a letter to the Financial Times calling for “widespread and effective” carbon pricing to be part of a Paris deal. But that move was dismissed by John Watson, chief executive of US-based Chevron, who said he had declined to sign the letter and believed that putting a price on carbon emissions was unworkable. “It’s not a policy that is going to be effective because customers want affordable energy. They want low energy prices, not high energy prices,” Watson told an Opec seminar in Vienna last week.  ExxonMobil, the largest stock-listed US oil group, said it was also at odds with the European strategy saying “we are not going to fake it on climate change” by joining a corporate alliance on the environment. The Paris conference hopes to achieve a legally binding and universal government-level agreement on combating climate change. It is meant to take over from the Kyoto Protocol which formally ran out in 2012. Dudley admitted on Wednesday that he had approached American rivals to help to lobby for change. He said some had different views but others were “very, very close” in their assessments about how to react to the problem. The BP boss, who is a US citizen, said it would be wrong to portray a serious split between the oil companies and effectively blamed the coal industry for the difference in approach.  “The coal lobby is very strong in the US and I think American [oil] companies want to keep a low profile compared to us.” He was speaking at the launch of the annual BP Statistical Review of World Energy, which showed growth in global C02 emissions during 2014 slowing to 0.5% compared with a recent average increase of 2%.  Part of the decrease was due to the reduction in the amount of coal burned in China and partly because Beijing is using more renewable energy – hydro-powered electricity in particular.  Dudley said he too wanted to see a growth in low-carbon energy and pointed out that BP had invested up to $10bn in low-carbon initiatives in recent years. “We may do more,” he said. But Dudley said policymakers should do far more to stop people wasting energy and argued that the fossil fuel sector was not necessarily best placed to kickstart a green power revolution.  “I don’t think the world should look on oil and gas companies and say you should go into renewables.” Renewables were the fastest-growing form of energy, accounting for one third of the increase in overall primary energy use during 2014 but they still only accounted for 3% of the world total, according to the BP review. Meanwhile, Spencer Dale, the group chief economist at BP, said the oil and gas industry believed that carbon capture and storage (CCS) was a vital technology to help beat climate change although he admitted there were technical challenges. Dale also questioned whether a major increase in CCS would happen without government backing. “Is there a market failure here that [means] you need some kind of public investment?” he said The BP review showed that the amount of proven oil and gas reserves found by the industry was twice as much as in 1980. The company dismissed the idea that BP might have “stranded assets” which could not be burned if the 2C limit is to stay intact, saying that the major stock-listed companies owned a tiny percentage of the world’s total reserves. Dudley said he expected the price of oil to remain low for a couple of years but said costs and taxes were beginning to come down, which would help the industry. He added: “It is better to plan on [a low price scenario] than hope.”"
"We spoke with young people from around the world about why it’s hard for their peers to care about the environment, how they reconcile their fears about the future, what made them start caring, and the little things that give them hope.  About me: I study international relations. I like photography and eating healthy, although I’m a huge fan of pizza and fries. Why it’s hard to care: It’s the “You Only Live Once” motto. When I was in school, a couple of years ago, I was talking with my classmates about pollution and climate change, and I remember this guy laughing at our conversation and saying something like, “Even if you care, the Earth is going to end anyway.” I was so pissed off. People like that guy are why people don’t dare to actually do something for our world. What gives me hope: As an international relations student, sometimes it is really hard for me to stay hopeful, because I’m always reading about Beijing’s air pollution, Shell in the Arctic, and so on. But what gives me hope is to know that I’m not alone – I mean, there are people, like everyone involved with the Guardian’s Keep It In the Ground campaign, who are working for our planet. We care about the future, we don’t live just for the moment. About me: I live in Edmonton, Alberta, which you could say is the oil capital of Canada. Tipping point: I moved from small town Prince George, British Columbia to Edmonton at 19 to work in the oilfield – I went from working in a deli and a bar to working on a service rig fixing wells. There were times when I felt pride in my work as a roughneck, helping run the country and that. But after a few months I started to really think just how much oil was being pumped at any given moment over the entire world. And how much diesel and gas was being burned just to get more crude out of the ground. It started to seem like a joke: one big crazy circle of oil consumption with no end in sight. To drive down the road and see that every second vehicle was a jacked up diesel truck, to see a pump-jack in every field, to see all the oil refineries and plants, it started to get to me. There is no way we can continue this way of living for much longer, not without destroying the air we breathe and the land we live on. What gives me hope: I try to focus on the growing number of renewable energy sources that are coming into play. If we make renewables more abundant and affordable, our future may look a little less bleak. Who I am: I’m a mechanical engineering student. I enjoy reading and playing football the most. Tipping point: I can’t recall a particular tipping point. I come from a country that relies heavily on fishing to fight malnutrition and starvation of its most vulnerable population. Only this month, dead fish were found on the cities’ shores with traces of tar in them, which poses environmental problems as well as economic ones for the fishermen. And I come from a city that lies below the sea level, and is very fragile in the face of the rare rain – people in some neighbourhoods have been thrown out of their homes because of the water. And the rise in temperatures is very troublesome. Since most of the country is a desert, the sand movements surrounding the city pose a serious risk. The animals (cows and camels mostly) and their owners also suffer greatly from these decreases in rainfall and rises in temperatures. What gives me hope: If anything gives me hope is the work of prominent thinkers like Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky, the Guardian of course, and the NGOs working all over the world pushing politicians and big corporations to make decisions against climate change. Who I am: I’m about to head into university in September to study English literature (assuming my hopes are not crushed by the draconian education system at the last stretch). Why it’s hard to care: For what it’s worth, I think young people are one of the main groups in society that do actually care about climate change, and a lot of the stigma actually comes from the attitude of older generations towards youth. In my own experience, when you talk about climate change and saving the planet, people look at me like I’m a raging communist or a 70s hippie born too late. Tipping point: I always thought as a child that climate change was an issue being solved, and we were all going to be fine. Then, when I was 13, I saw people on the news opposing the construction of wind turbines literally on the horizon of the countryside near their homes/estates, and they won. It was then I realised that people actually opposed not only the existence of climate change but also the methods to stop it. They were blinded by their desire for a beautiful countryside. Who I am: I’m a recent college graduate. I currently work at a carbon management firm. Why it’s hard to care: It boils down to science. Biology, chemistry and physics. I used to hate bio and chem. Now they fascinate me because I’ve realised they make up the world around us as well as us. So people hear “the science behind climate change” and they think, “Yawn”. Those who do look beyond that will immediately feel fear. The science/truth of it all is truly terrifying as it is such an all-encompassing problem that one person couldn’t possibly have any effect on by themselves. I felt a sense of isolation at first, still do, but I’m more driven than I am afraid at this point. What gives me hope: Climate change is beatable. Happiness is a mindset, we construct our own frameworks of preference, and if one day everyone in the wold woke up and said, “I’m going to tackle climate change,” it would get done. Who I am: I’m a masters student in environmental science at Pwani University in Kenya. My interest is mainly on sustainable development. Why it’s hard to care: There is a big knowledge gap on climate change in my country. Our education system only introduces it in high school, in an optional Geography course. The majority of the populace have no idea of its causes, effects and mitigation measures. Unless you choose to pick this course in the tertiary level of education, you will live oblivious of the calamity. My tipping point: Climate change in Kenya is a real issue – we experience a lot of its effects. In my town, the rise of temperatures over the last few years is very evident. The change in temperature means some pests and disease pathogens are spreading to parts where they couldn’t survive before. Many parts of our country experience erratic and excessive rainfall, which causes floods and landslides. Prolonged drought also happens, in areas where we never used to experience it before. Agriculture, which is the backbone of our country’s economy, is facing challenges. What gives me hope: The campaigns worldwide by environmentalists give me hope. Who I am: I am a sophomore environmental science major at Loyola Marymount University. Why it’s hard to care: I have many cousins who have never been camping, who cringe at the idea of spending a day outside the city, and believe that the solution to the climate change crisis is to adopt another planet as our homeland. We protect what we love, and we love what we know. How can the youth be expected to protect the environment if we don’t have the opportunity to experience it or are restricted from learning about it? Tipping point: I remember taking a carbon footprint quiz in high school and believing that, as an avid light switch monitor and recycler, I would have a tiny impact on my world. I was shocked by the results: a population of 7 billion people living like me would require the resources of four planets! I was eco-friendly, by the standards of my carnivorous styrofoam-wielding family, so how could I have such a large footprint? I made the transition to a plant-based diet, edged plastics and disposables out of our home, and got more involved in the environmental justice field. Who I am: I’m a Franco-Brazilian social sciences and communications undergraduate student in Paris. Why it’s hard to care: It is a subject still very restricted to people that have access to higher education and other benefits in life that make them feel more confident about themselves and their power to change things in the world. Tipping point: Being brought up in Rio definitely helped. It’s a place where urban life is completely tangled with nature, and we can see changes really fast: species of animals that are not there anymore, a river that dries up, a beach that has less length of sand, etc. Moving to Paris was also a shock. I never thought about really getting sick with air pollution before, and we do here, all the time. What gives me hope: I like to always think about this as an issue that brings us all together – no matter which country you come from, it touches all of us as human beings living in this planet. Who I am: I am a university student working on my degree in electrical engineering. I grew up on a dairy farm. Why it’s hard to care: For me, if there isn’t someone to be a leader. In one environmental economics class, after a rather depressing yet inspiring lecture on climate deals and the level of economic sacrifices we will need to make, I talked to fellow classmates and was overwhelmed by how many found the lecture really ... boring. Tipping point: I remember it clearly. I was about nine, and my older brother was talking to my father about a report he was doing for one of his high school courses on global warming and the impact it was predicted to have on society. Being a child, I was rather scared by this. I know now that nothing is as black and white as you see it as a child, but as I have grown up I have seen directly the effects of climate change. When I was 16, there were two ‘one hundred’ year floods in my hometown in less than a year.  What gives me hope: I get hope out of contributing to the change, by working my hardest to see it happen. This will quite honestly be the focus of most of my life’s work. Who I am: I’m a Presbyterian ministry intern in Christchurch, New Zealand. Last year the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa divested from fossil fuels ... very exciting moment. Tipping point: Our regional Church council invited me along to speak on writing a submission [to the government that will inform what they bring to the UN Climate Conference in Paris]. I turned up and spoke. Things seemed to be going well and the group were genuinely keen to take action. Then one of the members asked me how I got to the meeting. Did I drive or did I bike? I had to somewhat ashamedly confess that I drove. As I drove home after the meeting, I kept on trying to make excuses as to why I was justified in driving to the meeting. But I couldn’t get over the fact that at my heart I was a hypocrite. I am expecting my government to take radical action; I am expecting those around me to give a damn; but I myself haven’t made the radical change in my life. As yet, I still haven’t – but I can’t ignore my hypocrisy now. Perhaps my greatest motivation is that, as a Christian preacher, I cannot stand in the pulpit preaching “change” with any integrity unless I am willing and have taken steps to make that change! What gives me hope: I appreciated the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground podcast episode on religion. The team were spot on in drawing attention to the various narratives that Christianity tells: narratives about stewardship, sacrifice, justice, salvation, etc. For me I think, the greatest hope is found in the Christian claim that only from death comes new life. Even in the most despairing of situations, there is still hope of change. And my job — our job — as I see it, is to patiently endure and to be that voice of justice, never tiring, until change eventually happens!"
"If the 19th-century epitome of a futile economic transaction was carrying coals to Newcastle, then the 20th century equivalent might have been importing oil to Saudi Arabia. Rarely has a country been so spectacularly well endowed with a resource so fundamental to the functioning of the global economy in a particular era. How striking, therefore, to learn that the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, is predicting that within just 25 years we could no longer need fossil fuels. This, from a representative of a country that has done more than most to block progress in climate negotiations. Of course, this announcement has little, if anything, to do with a newly discovered yearning to save the planet from climate change; it has everything to do with economics. Saudi Arabia finds itself in the fortunate position whereby it can effortlessly switch from dominating the energy market of the 20th century through oil to dominating the 21st century with renewables. Al-Naimi believes that solar power will benefit the economy even more than fossil fuels. The evidence for this is that global investment in renewables jumped 16% in 2014, with solar attracting over half the total funding for the first time, driven by a 80% decline in manufacturing costs for solar in the last six years.  In many countries, oil has led to a crony capitalist culture serving only a powerful elite, crushing the human rights of the majority and devastating local environments. Saudi Arabia’s oil resources have led to global power and influence through its skilful alliance with the US and the creation of Opec. For Nigeria, booming oil resources have instead become a “resource curse” with worse development outcomes than countries with fewer such natural resources. When a political elite becomes so dependent on one crucial industry, it is allowed to exercise excessive power, dominate policy space and suck energy out of other economic sectors. Some commentators have suggested that economies heavily dependent on the finance industry suffer similarly, from what might aptly be described as a finance curse. During a panel session I contributed to in Frankfurt this week, focusing on regulation and consumer protection, I was asked why politicians had failed to regulate financial products and markets adequately. I had to admit that the power of finance has repeatedly left customers exposed to this finance curse. South-west England may have little in common with the deserts of the Middle East, yet we are also well endowed with the energy resources of the future. The sun may shine less brightly but it offers huge potential for electricity generation. Just this week it was announced that the total area covered by solar farms in Devon, Cornwall, Dorset and Somerset has increased by about 1,000% in the past five years. Such farms are contentious of course, but a recent report I commissioned concluded that the region is awash with renewable energy potential, from offshore wind, tidal power and wave power to ground source heat and geothermal – a mix that could generate 103% of the energy needs of the south-west. These resources have the potential to create 122,000 jobs across the region and add more than £4bn a year to the south-west’s economy. Far from being a curse that concentrates power in the hands of an elite, renewables work most effectively when in community ownership. Energiewende (energy transformation) in Germany has shown this to be the case. Here, local ownership of renewables has provided a dramatic economic payback to investing communities. The end game of climate change was always going to be a tussle between the vested interests of the past, using the wealth and power of the fossil fuel era to defend their assets, and the visionary supporters of the new clean energy technologies. The powerhouse states of the fossil era look set to overtake us on the path to a renewable energy future, while we continue to live under a finance curse inflicted on us by a government deeply attached to the finance industry. Saudi Arabia’s motivation may not be protecting the planet from climate change, or indeed improving community control over energy production, but it might just become a useful ally in the transformation towards a new energy era."

"In August, millions of Sprint customers will receive letters from the telecom giant that will look like ordinary pieces of white paper, but will be made from fibers from wheat fields instead of forests.  Sprint is launching a two-month pilot project to test run printing papers made primarily of wheat straw, an agricultural waste that is typically burned. The project is part of the company’s search for an alternative to using paper made of wood, which is the main source of paper material today. Doing so reduces the need for cutting down trees, an important carbon emission absorber, while cutting pollution from burning wheat straw.   “Wheat straw is ready for prime time,” Keanon Swan, manager of strategic partner relationships and postal alliance at Sprint, said during the Sustainable Brands conference in San Diego this week. “Hopefully we will pave the way for creating national demand.” The US is the number one producer and consumer of wood pulp, and the number two producer and consumer of papers and paper products, according to the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization. The pulp and paper industry uses 40% of the trees cut for industrial uses worldwide. The US, China, Japan and Canada are home to over half of the world’s pulp and paper production, collectively churning out 400m tons per year, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which equate the weight to 80 million elephants. While companies are seeing an increasing number of their customer base opting for paperless bills and notices, they still rely heavily on paper to communicate with consumers. In fact, for many companies, paper mailers are more effective at attracting and retaining customers than their online counterparts.  Overall, 60% of the paper used by Sprint is for marketing materials, while about 35% is used for bills and notices for its 55 million customers, said Darren Beck, Sprint’s director of environmental initiatives. The remaining paper is for printers and other office use, he added. Sprint is buying 20 rolls of papers through Prairie Papers, made of 80% wheat straw and 20% wood fiber for its pilot project, which will see it send out about 2.5m notices over August and September, Swan said.  In 2011, Sprint set goals to be met by 2017 for printing paper use, including buying paper with 25% recycled content, reducing paper use by 40% (compared with 2007) and using paper made only from forests that receive sustainable certification from the Forest Stewardship Council. By the end of 2014, 95% of the printing papers used by Sprint came from certified forests and 21% came from recycled sources. These figures exceeded the overall paper reduction goal by reaching 83% by the end of last year, Beck said.  Sprint hopes to receive no customer complaints during the wheat straw trial, such as illegible print or crumbling paper. The wheat straw paper shown by Swan at the conference felt slightly stiffer than conventional paper. The company will decide later which version to continue using.  The project will use wheat straws and paper made in India, but Sprint wants to buy the products from within the US, Swan said. Buying local will reduce the cost and the carbon footprint of shipping paper from the other side of the world. It also will help to recycle agricultural waste from the world’s third largest wheat producing country.  Finding domestic sources could be a challenge, however. Currently there isn’t a pulp mill in the US that process wheat straw for making printing and writing papers, said Nicole Rycroft, executive director of Canada-based Canopy, which is advocating for using alternative, non-wood pulp materials for paper production.  Much of the wheat straw pulping and paper production today takes place in China and India. Dell uses boxes made with 15% wheat straw from a plant in China, for example.  “We are hoping to kickstart domestic production to avoid the carbon impact of importing pulp and to protect domestic forests,” Rycroft said.  Other types of paper products also are made from wheat straw. Kimberly-Clark runs a mill in Alabama that processes wheat straw into pulp for paper towels and toilet paper that will contain 20% wheat straw. The company announced a new line of wheat straw products in April this year, and will initially sell to business customers rather than consumers.  A new pulp plant, set to break ground this summer in Washington State, will process alternative materials including bamboo, miscanthus and wheat straw, for sale to paper-product makers. The Columbia Pulp plant will be able to produce 400 tons per day, a small volume compared to conventional pulp mills, said Mark Lewis, the company’s chief technology officer.   "

"One of the key elements for a global climate deal has been unexpectedly resolved in Bonn, with governments signing off on plans for a UN-backed forest protection scheme. Envoys spoke of their surprise at the agreement, which will see the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (Redd+) programme form part of a Paris pact in December.  “It was successful… we all got a little of what we wanted,” said Ghana negotiator Yaw Osafo, who represented the Africa group at the meeting. A US official in Bonn said the draft text, which will be formally agreed in Paris, was a big moment for efforts to slow deforestation and protect regions holding vast stores of carbon. “It is big. It has been ten years of work. It concludes all of guidance around a really important issue which is how you reduce emissions from forests in developing countries,” she told RTCC, speaking in a background briefing. One major issue was the “non-carbon benefits” generated from protecting forests, said Osafo, which include the protection of indigenous peoples and valuable ecosystems. Many communities have complained of forest carbon initiatives which failed to consult or at worst displaced villages and in some cases did not share revenues with locals. In Africa, where forest degradation is a bigger problem than industrial scale logging, this meant initiatives needed to be better coordinated with local communities, said Osafo. In another well documented case, a Panama forest tribe engaged in a year-long campaign against Redd+, which it said ignored their rights and effectively sold off their traditional lands to outside investors. With Paris looming and pressure mounting for a decision in other venues at the Bonn talks, it appears countries that previously held tough positions backed down for the sake of progress. Norway, the EU and Switzerland had demanded tougher measures to ensure environmental and human rights “safeguards”, and faced a Brazil-Africa coalition resistant to new guidelines. What emerged was a compromise, suggested Gustavo Silva-Chávez from the Washington DC-based Forest Trends NGO, with countries keen to see a full package ready by the end of the week. “In simple terms in the last several years the UN has provided the rules for how to provide a Redd+ mechanism… they have the written guidance,” he said. Even Bolivia, long an opponent of the role of carbon markets in the Redd+ mechanism, agreed not to block a deal which leaves the door open for a variety of funding flows. “Many others told Bolivia – some of us want to use them… maybe not now but we want to keep options open,” added Silva-Chávez. Experts warn the decision leaves plenty of work for negotiating teams and those charged with implementing Redd+ on the ground in the coming months. Deforestation and land degradation is on the rise, and accounts for around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN’s IPCC climate science panel. Tougher safeguards and transparency would generate more confidence from the finance sector, said the US official, with the UN’s Green Climate Fund and World Bank forest carbon fund other potential donors. Ghana estimates it needs half a billion dollars to roll out a full Redd+ programme, said Osafo. Around $4bn of the $100bn pledged at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit was supposed to be directed towards forests, but in reality the figures have been far smaller, he added. Still, the early agreement on forests has boosted confidence in the UN process at a time when the main strand of talks on a global deal appear stuck in an 80-page long quagmire of a text. Often, said Silva-Chávez, this strand of negotiations was used as bargaining chip to call for more progress on finance or make other demands. That didn’t happen when matters came to a crunch. In 2000 the then “Redd” talks led to the collapse of talks in the Hague at the annual UN summit. Since then careful confidence-building measures have developed relationships among envoys. “Most people are foresters and understand issues and appreciate different situations in other countries… it’s not too hard to empathise and try and find ways to accommodate each other,” said Osafo. Better communication and more field visits were key to this result, said the US official, allowing better understanding between countries – which negotiate individually rather than in blocks. “It’s a really important thing we have done… probably made possible because of the tight knit community working on forests and climate,” she said. “A deep base of sharing and knowledge and a lot of trust… that’s what has allowed us to move forward.”"
"Businesses are often urged to adhere to tougher green standards. But on Monday, 16 companies rallied together with investors and NGOs to call for more oversight for palm oil production, which is a huge contributor to deforestation.  Big-name companies such as food and beverage multinational PepsiCo, retail giant Walmart and coffee chain Starbucks, as well as numerous investors and NGOs, signed a letter, released Monday, urging the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to enforce stricter standards.  “As an international certification scheme, the RSPO is uniquely positioned to support, promote, and enforce the widespread uptake of responsible and sustainable production practices across the palm oil industry,” the letter states. “Given current shortcomings of RSPO certification, however, purchasing RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) does not sufficiently address critical sustainability concerns in the palm oil supply chain.”  Palm oil is the cheapest vegetable oil on the market, and is used in approximately 50% of consumer goods from cosmetics to packaged foods. Imports to the United States have jumped 485% in the past decade, and this increased demand has led to the rampant destruction of rainforests and the displacement of local communities to make way for palm oil plantations, primarily in Indonesia and Malaysia. Most worryingly, by razing rainforests to farm the oil, companies are releasing dangerous quantities of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, making palm oil production a big contributor to climate change. According to the letter, the RSPO isn’t doing enough to curb deforestation or to ensure companies are complying with its standards. As a result, those businesses concerned about the environment – as well as their reputations – have been forced to adopt their own sourcing standards. Five of the top 10 corporate purchasers of palm oil – including Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson & Johnson – have gone beyond the RSPO and created their own sourcing policies.  “The RSPO have been left behind,” said Mark Mills, partner at Generation Investment Management, a London-based investment management firm focused on sustainability and a member of UN Principles of Responsible Investment palm oil working group, during a conference call Monday.  In the letter, companies and investors, along with nonprofit sustainability advocacy group Ceres, ask the RSPO to do more to conserve so-called “high carbon stock areas” – typically rainforests that hold large stores of carbon – and protect carbon-rich organic soils known as peatlands.  “Currently, [RSPO] standards do not require its members to protect peatlands as a criteria for producing palm oil sustainably, so we are urging the RSPO to explicitly prohibit the clearing of peatlands as a condition for growers companies to claim that their palm oil has been sustainably produced,” said Lucia von Reusner, shareholder advocate at environmentally responsible mutual fund company Green Century Capital Management, which helped spearhead the letter.  Other actions include reporting on greenhouse gas emissions and reduction targets and ensuring palm oil originates from known sources. “I think it’s important to emphasize that this initiative should be seen less as a criticism than as a constructive attempt to strengthen standards and enforcement,” said Pat Doherty, corporate governance director of New York State Comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli, during the conference call. The Comptroller’s office is the sole trustee of the $177bn New York State Common Retirement Fund, which in recent years has pushed companies in its portfolio to source palm oil more sustainably.  “Considering that RSPO remains in our estimation an indispensable organization, it’s therefore especially important they implement a higher standard of protection of human rights,” he said. RSPO responded to the letter with a press statement: “The RSPO acknowledges the importance of the issues raised by some institutional investors and industry players in the recent letter published by Ceres. It is encouraging to see that more and more actors today are willing to play an active role in moving towards a sustainable palm oil supply chain, and share RSPO’s vision of making sustainable palm oil the norm. We are, and will continue taking all constructive comments on board. We are confident that with a commitment to continuous improvement and with the support of all committed players we will be able to truly achieve our vision of market transformation.”"

"   Natural capital is everything nature provides us for free. It is what our economy is built upon. We add man-made capital in the shape of houses, factories, offices and physical infrastructure, and human capital with our skills, ideas and science. Natural capital should, therefore, be at the heart of economics and economic policy – but it isn’t. As a consequence we abuse nature, drive species to extinction, and destroy ecosystems and habitats without much thought to the consequences. The damage won’t go away; as we wipe out perhaps half the species on the planet this century and induce significant climate change, the economic growth we take for granted will be seriously impaired. Put simply, our disregard for natural capital is unsustainable – it will not be sustained. Just as we try to maintain and enhance our own assets – our houses, cars and our knowledge and skills – so too should the broader economy avoid running down its base of natural capital assets. Some natural assets will be used up – such as the non-renewables like North Sea oil and gas – but even here we should be mindful of compensating future generations for what we will not therefore bequeath to them. The natural assets that really matter are the renewables – the ones nature keeps on providing us for free, forever – provided we don’t deplete them beyond the threshold of sustainable reproduction. We can for example carry on for hundreds of thousands of years harvesting herring from the North Sea, as long as we do not overfish them. The potential value of all those fish forever is enormous. For the economy as a whole, national accounts need to provide for this capital maintenance as a first call on its revenue. If they did, and if we had a proper balance sheet, then the economic growth declared would be the sustainable one. It would be lower, too. Put another way, by not maintaining our assets, we are living beyond our means – let alone also borrowing from the future to finance the deficit, and making future generations pay for our excessive current consumption. A sustainable level of economic growth – driven by all the new technologies that keep coming along – would be lower, but we would nevertheless be better off in the long run. We would not then face the consequences of the loss of so much of our natural environment and climate change. Unlike the climate change problem, natural capital has a big spatial dimension. Climate change is all about a small number of gases in the atmosphere and it does not matter where they are emitted. Natural capital comes at every level, and location matters. It includes the great global biodiversity hotspots, like the Amazon, and it includes everyone’s backyard and every park and garden. Everyone can therefore make a difference to natural capital in ways that they cannot to the climate change problem. Think of some of the things you could do today. If your front garden is paved and concreted over, you could break it up and allow wild flowers to flourish, which in turn would help the bees. So barren is much intensive agricultural land , as it is sprayed with pesticides and herbicides and its soils supplemented with nitrogen fertilisers, that bees often find cities much better habitats than the countryside. You could put away the slug pellets and the weed killer. But the really big gains come from three policy changes, all of which have an impact on the choices we make. The first is compensation: the idea that if damage is done to our natural capital, there must be compensating increases elsewhere. The second is pollution taxes, paying for the damage caused from carbon, pesticides and other emissions. The third is a nature fund, created from the running down of the non-renewables like North Sea oil and gas. As Britain faces a population increase of around10 million in the next couple of decades, and as all the main political parties are committed to building more than 200,000 houses per year, the HS2 high-speed railway which will initially link London and Birmingham, and more airport runways, there is little doubt that the natural environment faces challenges matched only by the devastation caused by the intensification of agriculture encouraged by the Common Agricultural Policy. Natural capital is in for a shock, unless compensating improvements are made. These could be really big – improvements in complete river catchments like the Thames and new marine protected areas. They can be small and local too; every urban citizen could be guaranteed access to a green space within 500m of where they live, addressing not only the space children need to play outdoors, but also the poor air quality that blights our cities. These are parts of the prize of taking natural capital seriously."
"Serbia’s new climate pledge for the coming UN summit in Paris has been hailed by the European commission as an “exemplary” step towards EU accession, even though official figures show that it involves a 15% increase in the country’s emissions by 2030. A Serbian headline pledge to cut emissions 9.8% by 2030 – as measured against 1990 levels – was announced on Thursday at a press conference in Belgrade, with the commission’s vice-president for energy union, Maros Sefcovic.  But according to a Serbian government report for the UNFCCC in April, Serbia’s emissions have already fallen by a quarter since 1990, because of the collapse of heavy industry after the communist era. “Emissions of greenhouse gases in 2013 decreased by 3.5% compared to 2010, and 25.1% in relation to 1990,” the paper says. A 9.8% cut in emissions would thus allow a de facto 15.3% rise.  EU sources confirmed that Serbia’s pledge could be even worse than it appeared, as the 1990 baseline figures counted high-emitting Kosovan coal plants, which will almost certainly not be included in the 2030 statistics. Sefcovic praised Serbia’s offer regardless, and promised strong backing for its bid to join the EU, whose members are committed to a 40% CO2 cut by 2030. “The EU will continue supporting Serbia – on climate and energy as well as in other fields,” he said. “Your success today in adopting Serbia’s INDC is an exemplary step on this path.” The bloc’s controversial climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Canete, also tweeted praise to Belgrade for having shown “leadership in the region” which its neighbours would soon follow. Serbia just adopted climate #INDC (-9.8% by 2030 from 1990).Leadership in the region,neighbours to follow soon #COP21 pic.twitter.com/AQKGvQHmuY ‘The Serbian offer is a joke, but no one’s laughing now that the commission says it is an exemplary step on the path to EU membership,” said Garret Tankosić-Kelly, principal of SEE Change Net, a Bosnian thinktank, focused on sustainable development in the Balkans. “How is the rest of the world supposed to take EU climate promises seriously, when it is demonstrably allowing its candidate countries to cook the books of their climate policies, hoping that no one will notice?” A spokesperson for Canete and Sefcovic declined to comment on the new pledge, saying that the two officials had merely “welcomed the fact that Serbia, being the first country of the region to announce its INDC, has moved forward in the global climate process”.  But other commission sources were less guarded. “This is kind of a fiddle,” one said. “It is actually a very poor announcement and by making it, Serbia is free-riding on the back of countries that are prepared to be much more ambitious.” Ambitious counter-offers from less developed Balkan countries would probably not be triggered by Serbia’s announcement, the source said. “My gut feeling is that they will say: ‘if Serbia has made such a poor pledge, why should we suffer?’,” the source added. Serbia is dependent on coal for around 70% of its energy, and is heavily invested in what campaigners say will be a new wave of coal builds to replace ageing infrastructure. A $600m deal was recently signed with China to build a new 350MW plant in Kostolac."
"It is hard to imagine, but the flash floods and thunderstorms that took more than two dozen lives over the last week in Texas and Oklahoma, and washed away hundreds of homes, could provide good news for drought-stricken California. A developing El Niño weather event in the Pacific Ocean that can be linked to the deadly downpours in Oklahoma and Texas may be getting stronger, meteorologists say. A strong El Niño in the late fall and early winter tends to be associated with wetter winters in California.  “There is evidence, if you look back at past El Niño events,” said Tim DiLiberto, a meteorologist with the NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, “that if you have a strong El Niño, it is usually associated with rainfall in California.” California entered its fourth year of drought this year, with Governor Jerry Brown announcing unprecedented state-imposed water reductions. Texas and Oklahoma, meanwhile, saw a five-year drought come to an end this month with the arrival of thunderstorms, tornadoes and disastrous floods.  DiLiberto warned that “seasonal predictions in general are very difficult”, and described the chances of a stronger El Niño and a wet California winter as “uncertain”, if still “above average”. Californians, though, are eager for good news. The Los Angeles Times invited its readers to look east this week, towards the disaster-stricken areas of Texas and Oklahoma, precisely because of what a strong El Niño might mean for them. “What this exemplifies is something that applies to climate variation in the short and long term,” said Anthony Broccoli, a professor in the department of environmental sciences at Rutgers University. “That one particular pattern may produce weather conditions viewed favorably in one place and less favorably somewhere else.” Broccoli called this a seesaw effect that has long occurred in the US, with mild and dry winters on the west coast sometimes meaning cold and stormy winters on the east coast.  But as the effects of global warming kick in, Broccoli said, evidence shows that already dry areas of the world – like California – will become drier. The warming of the planet was also expected to make rain events heavier, he said, with locations getting greater fractions of their total ratio of rainfall during those heavy precipitations, meaning light or moderate rain events would become rarer. As such events become more usual, the solution to ending extreme weather patterns may not lie in opposite extremes. “The ideal to end a drought are rains that cumulatively amount to a lot and are not quite as intense,” Broccoli said. Heavy and intense rainfall is precisely the kind of phenomenon that caused flash floods in Oklahoma and Texas. Last week, the Weather Channel reported that a river in Blanco, Texas had risen as fast as 17ft in half an hour between Friday and Saturday, with water crushing and stripping the insides of nearby homes. A possible rainier winter in California may carry its own extreme weather events like landslides, Broccoli said. DiLiberto cautioned against perceiving El Niño as the answer to California’s drought problem.  “Any rain will help, but we are starting from a very low point. It will take a pretty substantial amount of rain to remove multiple drought years in just one year,” he said, adding that the volume of rain needed to end the drought would likely have knock-on landslide effects.  Besides, El Niño-enhanced rain would still not help resolve the depleted snowpack in northern California, DiLiberto said. “El Niños don’t mean bad things all the time, but sometimes it’s too much of a good thing,” he said."
"Last week, a paper out of NOAA concluded that contrary to the popular myth, there’s been no pause in global warming. The study made headlines across the world, including widely-read Guardian stories by John Abraham and Karl Mathiesen. In fact, there may have been information overload associated with the paper, but the key points are relatively straightforward and important.  Arguments about short-term temperature changes only deal with the Earth’s surface temperatures, which account for just 1–2% of the overall warming of the planet. More than 90% of that heat goes into the oceans, and as my colleagues and I noted in a paper published 3 years ago, if anything that warming is accelerating, building up heat at a rate faster than 4 atomic bomb detonations per second. If you carefully cherry pick start and end dates, you can find a period around 1998–2012 during which the warming of surface temperatures slowed a bit due to temporary natural cooling factors (like more La Niñas), just like it sped up a bit during the 1990s due to temporary natural warming factors (like more El Niños). But these are just wiggles on top of the long-term human-caused global warming trend. As Michael Mann put it,  there never was any “pause” or “hiatus” in global warming. There is evidence, however, for a modest, temporary slowdown in surface warming through the early part of this decade. This is a tough pill to swallow for those who have misused the short-term slowdown in global surface warming to argue against climate policies, but it’s likely over. 2014 was the hottest year on record, and 2015 looks likely to break the record again. These slowdown-based anti-policy arguments have been made by everyone from Republican presidential candidates to political think tanks to science-denying blogs. It’s a simple argument – if we pretend the surface warming slowdown can continue indefinitely, then global warming is less of a concern and we don’t need policies to stop it. Since we’ve always known the slowdown was temporary, these were never credible arguments, but they nevertheless helped to delay efforts to curb global warming. After the publication of this NOAA paper, and possibly two consecutive record hot years, it seems unlikely that these arguments will be considered credible any longer. Social science research has shown that conspiracy theorists are more likely to reject scientists’ conclusions about climate change. It’s a logical connection – given that 97% of climate scientists and their research agree on human-caused global warming, the easiest way to deny that reality is to accuse all those scientists of being part of a vast conspiracy. Otherwise it’s difficult to justify rejecting the conclusions of 97% of experts. Thus it’s not surprising that those in denial are accusing the NOAA scientists of conspiring to fudge the data to make the slowdown disappear. For example, Anthony Watts, who runs a climate science denial blog, wrote an email to one of the authors of the NOAA paper, telling him, In my last telephone conversation with you, I stated (paraphrasing) that “I believe you folks aren’t doing anything fraudulent, but you are doing what you feel is correct science in what you believe is a correct way”. After seeing the desperate tricks pulled in Karl 2015 to erase “the pause” via data manipulation, I no longer hold that opinion. You needed it to go away, so you prostituted yourselves, perhaps at the direction of higher ups. In fact, accusing the NOAA scientists of fraudulently ‘manipulating data’ for the benefit of the Obama administration was a common theme in the climate science-denying blogosphere. But there’s a glaring flaw in this particular conspiracy theory. This is clear from the bottom frame in this figure in the NOAA paper. According to the raw, unadjusted data, global surface temperatures warmed about 0.9°C from 1880 to 2014. According to the new NOAA analysis, they warmed about 0.8°C during that time. That’s a bit more than in the previous version of NOAA’s data set (0.75°C), but the net effect of these adjustments is to reduce the overall estimated warming as compared to the raw data! Contrary to the conspiracy theories, climate scientists process the raw temperature data for an important reason – to remove biases that don’t represent real temperature changes. The big one in the new NOAA analysis deals with changes in the ways ocean temperatures have been measured. They’ve been measured from water samples in insulated buckets, uninsulated buckets, from valves in ships’ hulls, and from instruments on buoys. As Zeke Hausfather explains, A number of studies have found that buoys tend to measure temperatures that are about 0.12°C colder than is found by ships at the same time and same location. As the number of automated buoy instruments has dramatically expanded in the past two decades, failing to account for the fact that buoys read colder temperatures ended up adding a negative bias in the resulting ocean record. This change is by far the largest single factor responsible for changing global temperatures in the past 17 years compared to temperatures found in the prior NOAA record. While this adjustment happens to have reduced estimates of the 1998–2012 surface warming slowdown, it’s important to account for changes in the way ocean temperatures have been measured. It’s not a conspiracy, it’s science. The latest changes to the NOAA data set were quite small (compare the black and red lines in the top frame of the figure above). As NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt noted at RealClimate, if such minor changes are all it takes to make the so-called ‘hiatus’ go away, then it was really quite fragile to begin with. As were any hiatus-based anti-policy arguments. The bottom line is that the Earth continues to warm dangerously rapidly, and short-term wiggles in global surface temperatures are no reason for complacency. When those who believe otherwise are forced to resort to baseless accusations of fraud and conspiracy theories, it’s time to stop listening to them."
"As architecture design students we are taught to constantly question and reimagine the way things are. We’re taught that the world we live in is not a given. It’s the result of the best efforts our ancestors could muster at that time. If it has flaws, it is up to our generation to pick up where they left off and create the world we want to see for ourselves and our children. I’ve grown to understand that the society and culture I was born into is damaging the planet we live on at a greater scale than ever before. We put profit above people, economy above environment, progress above purpose. As a result, climate change has become the most important issue of our generation. But it’s such a meaty, complex problem that we’re not sure how to approach it. It doesn’t seem to pose an immediate threat to our everyday lives, and most of us assume that there are surely some very clever scientists somewhere who will solve the problem for us. I became curious. If climate change is as big a threat as I’m being told, then my work as a designer and an architect should focus on helping address the issue. I wanted to really understand, in layman terms, what it is that’s causing our climate to warm. Why is a warmer climate dangerous? And how can I make a positive difference? I started by attending classes on sustainable design at my university. I spent a weekend in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to watch former US vice president Al Gore present his famous slide show and explain it in-depth at one of his “climate reality” workshops; I picked up a copy of Naomi Klein’s book This Changes Everything and downloaded as many climate-change related documentaries as I could get my hands on.  So what’s causing our climate to warm? Fossil fuels: two words I’ve grown up hearing a lot. But until recently I couldn’t tell you exactly what a fossil fuel was. I just understood that every year we burn more and more to power our modern economy. It turns out a fossil fuel is simply a fossilised deposit of decayed, combustible plants and animals that has been buried below our earth for millions of years, then turned into coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels releases large quantities of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. We live on a planet of more than 7 billion people. The volume of food and products we consume today is greater than ever before in human history. We’re not really aware of it in our daily lives, but the infrastructure that’s serving our needs, particularly here in the western world, has got completely out of control – often resulting in inexcusable levels of water and air pollution.  We seem to have reached a point where our human actions are creating damage to the environment at a greater rate and scale than most of us can comprehend.  So these very human actions are causing our temperature to rise. Every month we are seeing worse storms, more wildfires and greater droughts than before. The science behind this is lengthy, but if you’re interested take a look at the Guardian’s ultimate climate change FAQ.   As I type these words, São Paulo, Brazil, New York and California are experiencing record levels of drought. In Bangladesh homes are being washed away by record-high water levels and in Greenland and Antarctica huge sheets of ice are breaking off and melting into the sea. These climate impacts aren’t myth. They’re happening right now. Maybe the scariest realisation is that if we continue the way we are going, it is not our planet that will cease to exist but us. Rising sea levels, drought and storms will wipe us out in the hundreds of millions, taking thousands of animal species with us. We are risking everything we have by pursuing our obsessive drive for greater production and consumption at a completely unnecessary scale.  So that’s the reality. Now what? My first reaction was to put my head in the sand. However I refuse to accept the dismal future that lies ahead. As a result of our changing climate, we have a really unique opportunity to build a better future. As humans we’re innovative and adaptive. We’re able to recognise and rectify our mistakes. The theme of prioritising profit above human suffering is not new. Before we exploited fossil fuels to run machines to do work for us we exploited other humans in the form of slavery. Only 200 years ago people argued that slavery was morally acceptable because it provided good, cheap energy that would help boost our global economy. Our forefathers recognised that inequity and changed that. Throughout history we’ve changed legislation, opinion and archaic systems to create a better world to live in. Today, as the most connected generation in history, we have the unique ability to create a future that embraces renewable technology; that democratises the way we produce and consume energy; that encourages sharing and responsible consumerism; and that provides jobs in new sectors focused on sustainable progress. We’ve already seen Elon Musk build a billion-dollar electric car business he claims will be worth as much as Apple in a decade. We’ve seen hundreds of wind farms and solar parks pop up around the world. Costa Rica ran its entire country on renewable energy for 75 days this year by harnessing geothermal and hydroelectric power. The responsibility now falls on our governments and large corporations to make ambitious, meaningful changes.  Large corporations and universities can start by divesting their investments from the fossil fuel industry. We’re already seeing many lead by example but there are so many more who can step up to the mark. As for our world leaders, in December they will come together in Paris to discuss the future of our planet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference. If you’re reading this article, then you have access to the internet. You have the unique ability to voice your opinion. You have the free will and the power to make yourself heard and influence the decisions that will be made on your behalf at that conference. It doesn’t matter what country you live in, what colour your skin is, what gender or sexual orientation you are or what religion you believe in. This affects every human on the planet. We are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the very last to be able to do anything about it.  So stand up, speak out and be part of a generation that is remembered for changing the course of human history to create a better planet to live on. "

"The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has rejected claims by a panel headed by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan that Australia is a “free-rider” on climate change. Australia is one of four major offenders, with Canada, Japan and Russia, who are accused in the Africa Progress Panel’s 2015 report of appearing to have withdrawn from attempts to tackle climate change.  “With one of the world’s highest levels of per capita emissions, Australia has gone from leadership to free-rider status in climate diplomacy,” the report said. It called on the four countries to aim for zero emissions by 2050, with deep reductions by 2030. But Bishop says the claims are “completely false”. “Australia has met its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol first commitment period, unlike other countries,” she said. Australia is on track to source 23.5% of its electricity through renewable energy and has been working on a climate agreement for the Paris summit, she said. The comments follow the environment minister Greg Hunt’s defence of the government’s reputation. “I can say this, that we are deeply and absolutely engaged,” he said at the launch of a tree-planting initiative at Sydney’s Bondi Beach. “There are very few countries that have achieved and beaten their Kyoto 1 targets; there are very few countries that have achieved and will beat their Kyoto 2 targets. “We will be an ambitious and constructive and engaged player in the post-2020 negotiations.” However, at a United Nations climate change conference in Germany, environment groups believe Australia has embarrassed itself by ducking questions. The conference is a forerunner to the all-important Paris meeting in December where countries hope to sign a global agreement on climate action. Several countries questioned the scrapping of the carbon tax and whether the federal government’s $2.55b direct action policy will be enough to meet Australia’s emissions reduction target of 5% by 2020. “We are asking questions of others and they are rightly asking questions of all countries, and so that’s how the process should work,” said Hunt."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is apparently on a mission to terminate the myth that protecting the environment hurts the economy. The actor and former politician is in Australia to promote his new film Terminator Genisys, the first a planned new trilogy for the popular movie franchise.  During his stint as governor of California between 2003 and 2011, Schwarzenegger passed the first emissions trading scheme in the United States. He has said all countries, including Australia, need to lift their game when it comes to tackling climate change. “In order for us to be successful the whole world has to work together ... Australia, Austria, the US – everybody has to work together,” Schwarzenegger told Channel Ten’s The Project on Friday night. “So I am on a mission, I’m on an environmental crusade to go and motivate everyone to go in that direction.” Schwarzenegger said after California introduced tough new environmental laws the state’s economic growth well outpaced the national rate. “The thing that you always hear when you do that is ‘this will hurt the economy’,” he said. “Going green and protecting the environment did not hurt the economy, it’s a bunch of nonsense.”  Australia’s prime minister, Tony Abbott, has consistently criticised the former Labor government’s carbon tax, which has been repealed.  He has called the tax destructive and said his government would “never do anything that damages the economy”. With Australian Associated Press"
"Environmental groups have warned that the first step by the Obama administration to curb rapidly rising carbon pollution from airplanes, expected as early as Friday, may amount to little more than greenwashing. The announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency is eight years in the making and comes in response to lawsuits from environmental groups, and a failed effort by the European Union to tackle greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft, one of the fastest growing sources of carbon emissions.  With Friday’s expected announcement, the EPA will extend regulation of carbon pollution from power plants, cars and trucks, to air planes. The move puts the EPA on pace with the International Civil Aviation Organisation in setting global rules for carbon pollution. But those rules, due to be adopted in February 2016, are unlikely to deliver any significant reductions in carbon pollution, environmental groups said. “It’s not a particularly ambitious action,” said Sarah Burt, a lawyer for Earthjustice which first sued the EPA in 2007 on behalf of the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth, and the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups. “You will get a standard that is not at all ambitious at best and at worst is essentially greenwashing.” The EPA and the White House would not comment on the announcement in advance. The first step of the EPA process begins unfolding on Friday when the agency will formally declare its intent to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions from airplane pollution. The airline industry had fought for years to delay just such a measure – and in 2012 forced the EU to back down on its plans of cutting greenhouse gas emissions on international flights. Obama at the time had sided with the airline industry in its refusal to fall into line with the EU plan.  The new ICAO targets in some ways represent a victory for that stonewalling – buying the airlines time and weakening the rules. The international air authority had struggled for 20 years to deal with climate change. “The EPA has dragged its heels and delayed with its eyes on the international negotiations,” Burt said. “The EPA does not want to go out ahead of the international community.” The international rules are expected to be exceedingly weak, with virtually all of the airplanes flying today making the grade, which means ICAO is unlikely to deliver any real reductions on greenhouse gas emissions. “It is a CO2 standard but everyone already meets the standard so it results not only in no decrease, but also in a net increase when you see how emissions stand,” Burt said. Carbon pollution from airplanes is expected to double by 2020. US airline carriers on their own account for about a quarter of global aviation emissions. A number of developing countries, such as India, are expected to see big increases in air travel over the coming decades."

"Universities approaching the Department of Education about the $4m in government funding available for hosting Bjørn Lomborg’s consensus centre have been told they should talk to Lomborg himself. Since the University of Western Australia pulled out of a $4m deal with the federal government to host the centre, the department had “had some informal approaches from universities who might be interested and suggested to them and Dr Lomborg they might want to talk”, the associate secretary of the department, Robert Griew, told senate estimates on Wednesday night.  Labor senator Kim Carr asked “so if a university wants to take this up they should talk to Dr Lomborg?” “Yes, but of course they could talk to us as well,” Dr Griew replied. Carr, a long-term minister in Labor governments, said he had “never seen anything like this before where the government would hand over $4m ... and hopefully find someone to take it up.” The committee heard the $4m had been found from consolidated revenue in the May 2014 budget, but not announced at that time, and that the education department had first heard about it from the department of prime minister and cabinet.  The department had spoken to Dr Lomborg last July and he advised them “he was in discussion with a number of universities”. Dr Lomborg had been advised to “speak to vice chancellors directly” to find a host institution for the $4m centre. After a backlash from staff and students when Guardian Australia revealed the $4m government deal to host the “Australia Consensus Centre” UWA handed back the funding and dropped its connection with Lomborg. The education minister, Christopher Pyne, vowed to find another university to host the centre and said he was seeking legal advice about a decision by the university to renege on the funding agreement it had signed with the commonwealth. Griew said legal advice had been provided to the minister but no legal action had been taken against UWA. “This is a funding contract, we take that very seriously. The minister wanted to know the entire range of options,” he said. Griew outlined the timeline of talks leading up to the $4m grant to UWA – with discussions between the university and the department beginning in August last year and Pyne deciding the deal should be “taken forward” last November. As previously revealed the deal involved $4m from the government, “in kind” contributions worth $4m from the university and another $5m to be sought from private donations. Lomborg said at the time UWA withdrew from the deal that he remained committed to setting up the Australia consensus centre because his research was “far too important to let fall victim to toxic politics” and “grossly misinformed attacks”. “I am disappointed that the University of Western Australia (UWA) will not be a part of this effort,” he said. “The UWA vice chancellor found himself in an impossible position when the centre was used as a political football. The facts about Australia consensus have been drowned out. “Australia consensus would have put the University of Western Australia at the forefront of global research efforts to improve the use of aid spending. It is deeply disappointing that UWA has lost this opportunity because of toxic politics, ad hominem attacks, and premature judgment. In a statement announcing the withdrawal and emailed to UWA staff and then published online UWA vice chancellor, Paul Johnson, said that strong opposition to the centre had put the university in a difficult position. “Therefore, it is with great regret and disappointment that I have formed the view that the events of the past few weeks places the centre in an untenable position as it lacks the support needed across the university and the broader academic community to meet its contractual obligations and deliver value for money for Australian taxpayers,” he said. Pyne accused the UWA academics of “shouting down” views with which they disagreed. “We are disappointed that the university has indicated it cannot effectively deliver against the contract and is seeking to return $4 million in research funds,” Pyne said after the university’s announcement. “The government is committed to establishing the consensus methodology in Australia and to ensuring a wide range of views on issues are aired publicly. An Australian consensus centre will be established in an alternative location. “It is surprising that individuals at an institution of higher learning claiming to embrace the notion of academic and intellectual freedom would display intolerance and shout down a voice in the debate they simply don’t agree with,” Pyne said through a spokesman."

"A new paper just published in Science Bulletin by Mark Richardson, Zeke Hausfather, Dana Nuccitelli, Ken Rice, and John Abraham shows that mainstream climate models simulate global temperature observations much better than the “irreducibly simple climate model” of Christopher Monckton, Willie Soon, David Legates, and William Briggs. When the Monckton paper was published in the Chinese journal Science Bulletin this January, it was covered by conservative media outlets like the Daily Mail, Breitbart and World Net Daily, which used it to manufacture doubt about the dangers associated with human-caused global warming. The ideologically-appealing but scientifically incorrect message from the paper was essentially, ‘climate models are running hot, the climate is insensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect, and thus future global warming will be minimal and nothing to worry about.’  However, our team identified numerous glaring fundamental errors in the Monckton paper. The first was in the very premise of the paper itself, claiming that global climate models are “running hot.” In reality, as I show in my book Climatology versus Pseudoscience, mainstream climate models have done a good job at projecting the observed changes in the global surface temperature.  While temperature measurements have been toward the lower of the range of model projections in recent years, there’s been a tremendous body of scientific research investigating the various contributors to the slowdown in global surface warming. This research, which was entirely ignored by Monckton and his colleagues, is summarized by Kevin Cowtan in week 5 of the Denial101x course. In fact, ignoring a vast body of important relevant research was a recurring theme throughout the Monckton paper. After they manufactured a problem by exaggerating the discrepancy between mainstream climate model simulations and temperature observations, and ignored the relevant scientific research on that issue, Monckton and colleagues created their own “irreducibly simple climate model” with built-in assumptions based on circuit design rather than the physics of the Earth’s climate system. Here they made two fundamental mistakes. First, they assumed that the Earth’s climate is very stable, and built that assumption into their model. This assumption was based ignoring most of the body of paleoclimate (historical climate change) research showing big past climate change swings influenced by amplifying feedbacks, and by assuming that the Earth’s climate will behave the same as a human-designed electrical circuit with minimal gain and feedbacks. Second, based on that first assumption of a stable climate, their paper claimed “warming is already at equilibrium” and the Earth’s response to an energy imbalance is instantaneous. However, this is obviously wrong because satellites measure a large ongoing global energy imbalance, with a tremendous amount of heat building up in the oceans. As John Abraham explains, The model of Monckton and his colleagues is fatally flawed in that it assumes the Earth responds instantly to changes in heat. We know this isn’t true. The Earth has what’s called thermal inertia. Just like it takes a while for a pot of water to boil, or a Thanksgiving turkey to heat up, the Earth takes a while to absorb heat. If you ignore that, you will be way off in your results. Circular logic was another fundamental flaw in the Monckton et al. paper – they used their simple model, which assumed that the Earth’s climate is stable and hence insensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect, to demonstrate that the climate is insensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect. As you might expect from a simple model based on flawed assumptions, as we show in our paper, it does a poor job in reproducing observed temperature changes. In the figure below, the blue area represents temperature changes simulated by climate models used in the last IPCC report; the red area represents temperature simulations from the Monckton et al. simple model; and the red, blue and black lines show the observed global surface temperature changes. As you can see, the mainstream climate models do a much better job simulating the observational data than the flawed, simple model. Ultimately our paper concludes as follows, The M15 [Monckton et al. (2015)] model performs poorly against observations because its parameters were selected using a logically flawed narrative, rather than physical and mathematical analysis. Observational evidence from palaeoclimate and of ocean heat content measurements directly contradict the values adopted by M15, but are not acknowledged.  Partial use and misinterpretation of the relevant literature may explain many of the differences between statements in M15 and the results of other studies. The authors of M15 cite some studies supporting their estimate of lower climate response, but miss much of the larger body of research that contradicts the claims in M15 …  Their low estimates of future warming are due to assumptions developed using a logically flawed justification narrative rather than physical analysis. The key conclusions are directly contradicted by observations and cannot be considered credible. The paper by Monckton and colleagues was badly flawed and should not have been published, but at least Science Bulletin also published our critique just a few months later. This incident shows that while the peer-review process is necessary, it’s insufficient by itself to filter out all erroneous research. Sometimes bad papers still get published, and when the results of those papers align with the ideological biases of certain media outlets, their faulty conclusions can misinform a large audience. In short, be skeptical of new research, especially if it purports to overturn a large body of scientific evidence, and wait to see if the study withstands subsequent scientific scrutiny. In the case of this paper published by Monckton and colleagues, it did not."
"Growth is good. We need growth for wealth, for jobs, to help the poor – without it society will collapse. Or, at least, that’s the message we’re surrounded by, even though logic tells us growth can’t go on for ever on a planet with finite resources. Growth is so strongly framed as good and necessary that rational or technical arguments – pointing to the damage to our planetary life-support systems, for example – go in one ear and out the other. Such messages are worth examining. So how is growth framed?  The UK economy is performing well. UK growth is solid – Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, speech at the University of Sheffield, 12 March 2015 The predominant frame is simply that growth is good. Most news stories take this for granted and reinforce it with the language they use. Growth attracts positive words like strong, buoyant and good; in its absence look for weak, stagnant and bad. When a frame becomes universally accepted and constantly reinforced, it can be hard to see it. Growth framing is now so inbuilt that, for many people, questioning it has become unthinkable and doing so seems misguided, unrealistic or even deranged. Sainsbury sees ‘green shoots’ of recovery as sales beat forecasts – Financial Times, 17 March 2015 Add to this that growth seems, well, natural. Trees grow, don’t they? The framing of growth as a natural process uses medical metaphors too. People talk about the economy flatlining, as if in a coma. Or take the phrase economic recovery – this subtly equates lack of growth with an illness, something you recover from. If resumption of growth is called a recovery, it’s bound to be good. Isn’t it? I think the biggest task for this government has been about getting the economy moving again – David Cameron, speech at Unilever, 9 January 2015 There’s a widespread feeling that if growth stalls then we need to get the economy going again, but growth isn’t speed.  If the economy is like a factory with GDP measuring the rate of production, then economic growth is acceleration: how fast we’re increasing the speed of the production line. If you stop accelerating, you haven’t slowed down, let alone stalled. Yet curtailing growth is framed in terms of slowing down or even going backwards: no wonder we’re scared away from even thinking about it. We’re wedded to progress, to an underlying human story of expansion without limits. But somewhere deep down we know this story is a trap, containing the seeds of its own – and our – destruction. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet – Agent Smith in sci-fi film The Matrix What about reframing growth as bad? After all, growth can get out of hand: unlimited growth is cancer. What if we called resumption of economic growth a relapse? But this paints humanity as a disease. That’s appalling. We’re not evil; we want to be the heroes of our stories, not the villains. The doom stories underlying so many environmental campaigns have the same problem – we’re the villains. These stories paralyse us. We can flip from doing nothing because there’s no problem to doing nothing because there’s no point. Doom stories are a trap too. So are there any helpful, alternative frames? When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things – 1 Corinthians 13:11 Growth is fine for children, but adults stop growing when they reach maturity. Letting go of growth as we strive for a steady-state world isn’t scary or threatening, it’s growing up. Here’s a powerful story for our times: this is our coming of age, where we leave childhood behind and proceed to an adult future. In this story, what of the business leaders, politicians and economists who are obsessed with endless growth? They’re acting like spoilt children in a playground, who don’t want to hear that playing with matches could burn down the school.  The maturity story can form an emotional frame giving us an orientation and an inspiring sense of purpose. It’s liberating and empowering; it gives us the space, permission and motivation to take a fresh look, to get stuck in and attack the practical issues. Meanwhile humanity – and business – can still grow in experience, sophistication, knowledge, wisdom: the things an individual adult acquires throughout life without getting any taller. Now that would be grown-up growth."
"Rich countries must keep their financial promises to the poor on global warming, or key international climate change negotiations this year risk falling apart, the French foreign minister will warn his counterparts in other developed nations this weekend. The G7 group of industrialised countries are meeting on Sunday and Monday in Germany, and a key subject of the discussions will be the forthcoming UN climate change negotiations, scheduled for a crunch conference in Paris this December, which will determine world governments’ response to the climate crisis for decades to come.  Poor countries want financial assistance from the rich nations – which have, historically, been the most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions – to help them reduce their carbon output, invest in clean technology and adapt to the effects of climate change.  At the last major climate summit, in Copenhagen in 2009, the developing world was promised financial flows of at least $100bn (£65bn) a year by 2020, but in many cases the money has been slow in coming. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who will preside over the Paris talks, said this aid would be the key issue. “The question of financing is, in fact, decisive for reaching an agreement in Paris,” he said. “The promise of Copenhagen must be kept, absolutely – it is the basis of trust, and for many countries it is the condition of reaching agreement. Therefore, it is a priority as president [of the negotiations].” He said that the G7 meeting would be vital in sending a strong signal to developing countries ahead of the Paris talks.  “What the richest countries of the G7 will say is very important in itself and is eagerly awaited by all who are in COP21[as the Paris climate conference is known].  “The G7 allows for real discussion. So we have to be pragmatic, but we also have to fix ambitious objectives.”  At the UN climate conference in Paris this December, world governments are expected to forge a new global deal on climate change, including commitments from both developed and developing countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to take effect from 2020 when current commitments run out. But while countries are still committed to meeting the carbon targets that were set at Copenhagen in 2009, the status of pledges on financial contributions from rich to poor countries is less clear.  Rich nations promised at Copenhagen that, by 2020, investments of at least $100bn a year would be channelled to the developing world, to help cut emissions and adapt to climate change. So far only about half of that target has been met. The issue is muddied by a difference in interpretation among countries over what should be counted as “climate finance” under the Copenhagen agreement.  Some developing countries want all of the $100bn a year to come from the public purse of developed nations. But rich governments are strongly resisting that, insisting instead that private sector finance should form the lion’s share of the total. There was “frequently a lot of confusion on this subject”, said Fabius. “Some developing countries will present commitments [on curbing greenhouse gas emissions] that are partly conditional, ie depending on international financial support.” He made it clear that he wants a deal on the two key areas of the talks – limits on emissions and financing for developing countries – well in advance of the formal start of the negotiations on the last day of November.  The Copenhagen conference descended, in its final hours, into scenes of chaos and vicious recriminations among countries, which overshadowed the advances made there in climate financing and emissions goals.  Fabius is anxious not to repeat that experience, preferring to have the main elements of an agreement set up beforehand. “I don’t believe in the virtue of waiting until the final minute for announcements,” he said. “I believe it is necessary to build trust, to prepare things carefully. To have an agreement [in Paris] we need some sort of financial package.” He added that more money must be directed to helping poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change – this had been, to date, the “poor relation” of climate finance, he said.  For this reason, he is proposing the development in poor countries of an early-warning system on potential weather-related disasters for developing countries, consisting of weather forecasting, priming the emergency services and providing back-up resources for them.  These can be implemented at times of crisis, which are likely to become more frequent as climate change takes hold. Fabius also called for much more investment into the development of renewable energy in the developing world, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular. He said this could enable the continent to bypass the need for fossil fuels. He said the talks in Paris would succeed if governments managed “a solidarity between the industrialised countries and the countries that will suffer the most from climate damage, and that also engage in the effort to limit their emissions”."

"Climate change is the biggest threat to all of civilisation our species has faced since the 80s. Scientists say rising seas will envelope major cities around the world while heatwaves will bring wildfires and torrential rains bring floods. And the global economy is stuffed.  But as if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that climate change might even mess up that most holy of traditions – your weekend.  The world’s most pre-eminent climate scientists have submitted thousands of reports warning of the danger of continuing to spew carbon into the atmosphere. And yet the governments of the world have continued to ignore them. Thankfully, 42 breweries have weighed in to illuminate us about the true scale of the threat – we might actually run out of beer. From California to the Czech Republic, hop production is being hit by rising temperatures and a lack of water. Beer could also start to taste worse, according to the Czechs, but their beer is rubbish anyway. “Changes in climate caused by human activity have the potential to create unprecedented social, economic and environmental challenges,” said a spokesman from Diageo, the company that owns Guinness. Maybe now people will start to listen. The deciding factor in any weekend. Is it going to be parklife or board games? The news is mixed. Across the world, weather extremes are becoming more frequent. So that might mean more scorchers and beach days.  But warmer air also holds more water, says Bob Ward, policy and communications director at London’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. Meaning climate change will also bring more rainfall, “increasing the risk of flooding, both inland from rainfall and along our coasts due to sea level rise”. This all roughly translates to more of everything, except normal. Carbon dioxide doesn’t just heat up the atmosphere, it also turns the ocean into an acidic soup that eats away the shells of much-loved molluscs. The ocean has increased in acidity by 25% since the industrial revolution. If it continues, many shellfish are in danger of disappearing from the fishmonger. In the UK, very little is known about the future of the industry, said Steve Colclough, the director of the marine section of the Institute of Fisheries Management. “This is an extremely difficult subject and nobody has the information,” he said. But if the situation in the US is anything to go by, there’s trouble ahead. In the Pacific northwest, the oyster industry has already lost $110m because of more corrosive water. The world is running out of chocolate. That’s because climate change and crippling poverty are driving Africa’s cocoa farmers to produce other crops. Which is a bit rubbish because your date’s chocolate mousse is set to get a lot pricier. In four decades, the amount of land available for growing cocoa has dropped 40%. In the next 40 years, the temperature in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, where 70% of cocoa is grown, is set to rise by 2C. That’s going to make it too hot and dry for cocoa trees.  We’re already on the way to peak chocolate. By 2020, world cocoa demand is set to outstrip supply by 1m tonnes. That’s 90,909,090,909 Lindt balls. When there are people suffering in poor countries, there’s nothing worse than a hangover. Except maybe a hangover with no coffee. Annoyingly, the coffee growers of flooded Honduras and drought stricken Brazil and all those other places you didn’t know your coffee came from might not be able to get coffee beans to grow in a warmer climate …  The problem has already started to impact you in Vietnam, where farmers have run out of water and stopped sending coffee overseas. Amazingly coffee growers don’t tend to drink much coffee. Maybe because they earn roughly half the price of a cappuccino a day.. You might want to hold on to that middling Châteauneuf-du-Pape you tore the budget supermarket price tag off so your friends thought you bought it at an indy bottle shop – it’s going to become a lot rarer. The traditional wine regions of France, Chile, Australia and California are all going to become too hot to supply your favourite plonk. Thankfully, you probably won’t have to go without. Just realign your snobby wine vernacular. As warm temperatures shift north, so will wine growing regions. So look forward to laying down a nice bottle of Swedish red for your grandchild’s birth wine."

"China’s greenhouse gas emissions will probably peak in 2025, five years earlier than its stated target, a study said on Monday, in a boost for hopes to curb climate change. On current trends, the world’s biggest carbon emitter will discharge 12.5-14bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2025, after which emissions will decline, it said. The work was carried out by two research institutes at the London School of Economics (LSE). “This finding suggests it is increasingly likely that the world will avoid global warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels,” they said in a statement. The average temperature goal, which translates into 3.6F, is the upper limit targeted by the UN, which is seeking to enshrine it in a global accord in December. “Analysing trends in the key emitting sectors, we conclude that China’s greenhouse gas emissions are unlikely to peak as late as 2030, the upper limit set by President Xi Jinping in November 2014, and are much more likely to peak by 2025,” said the paper, co-authored by climate economist Nicholas Stern and analyst Fergus Green. “They could peak even earlier than that.” The report pointed out that Chinese coal consumption fell in 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015, after years of growth that led to severe air pollution in its cities and massive emissions of greenhouse gases. The researchers calculated that China’s coal use has reached a “structural maximum” and should plateau over the next five years, while natural gas use grows rapidly. This was caused by structural changes in the economy as well as government policies targeting more sustainable growth with a reduced environmental impact. United Nations member states are gathered in Bonn until Friday to sculpt a world climate pact they have agreed to ink at the global conference in Paris. The agreement, with the 2C goal in mind, would enter into force in 2020, supported by a register of national greenhouse gas emissions curbs. According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a 2C pathway requires annual greenhouse gas cuts of 40-70% by 2050, compared with levels in 2010 – and to zero or below by 2100. “Whether the world can get onto that pathway (to 2 C) in the decade or more after 2020 depends in significant part on China’s ability to reduce its emissions at a rapid rate post-peak...” said the new paper. Current global emissions are about 50 GtCO2e, about a quarter by China alone, according to Green. The paper said China’s political culture may explain why its government “erred on the side of caution” in stating its objective of peaking emissions around 2030."

"Shell tried to influence the presentation of a climate change programme it was sponsoring at the Science Museum in London, internal documents seen by the Guardian show. The Anglo-Dutch oil group raised concerns with the museum that one part of the project “creates an opportunity for NGOs to talk about some of the issues that concern them around Shell’s operations”. The company also wanted to know whether a particular symposium at the museum was “invite only” – as that would ensure “we do not proactively open up a debate on the topic [of Shell’s operations]”. The concerns are raised in a series of emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and once again raise awkward questions about the influence of fossil fuel companies over Britain’s most valued cultural institutions. “These emails reveal that the Science Museum is a significant cog in Shell’s propaganda machine,” said Chris Garrard, from the anti-oil sponsorship campaign group BP or not BP? Shell is keen to present itself as a responsible company that is trying to tackle climate change but critics say its commitment to tar sands, deep water wells and Arctic exploration are at odds with this stance. The emails, which have all names redacted, follow the decision by the oil company to become a principal sponsor of the Atmosphere, Exploring Climate Science gallery and the extended Climate Changing programme at the Science Museum. The Atmosphere gallery was designed to deepen public understanding of global warming but Shell’s own climate change adviser – former oil trader David Hone – made recommendations on what should be included.  Emails show the close relationship between the Science Museum and Shell with the two discussing how they should react to expected criticism from Greenpeace following a Guardian story in October 2014. In that story, the Science Museum’s former director Chris Rapley criticised Greenpeace’s successful campaign to make Lego drop its partnership with Shell. In another communication with the Science Museum dated 9 December 2014, a Shell staff member gives what they call a “heads up” on a Reuters story reporting that Shell’s Arctic drilling contractor, Noble, has pleaded guilty to eight charges of pollution and poor record keeping. But the most damaging email is dated 8 May 2014 when a Shell employee receives an update from the Science Museum and replies. “Regards the rubbish archive project [an interactive exhibition examining waste in the context of climate change], xxx and I have some concerns on this exhibition particularly as it creates an opportunity for NGOs to talk about some of the issues that concern them around Shell’s operations.”  It goes on: “Could you please share more information with us on the symposium event planned for September? As you know we receive a great deal of interest around our art sponsorships so need to ensure we do not proactively open up a debate on the topic. Will it be an invite only event?” And it ends: “Regarding the gallery update, can I check whether you have touched base with David Hone to see if he would like to participate in the content refresh?” The Science Museum insisted on Sunday that there could be no question of compromise because final editorial control had been retained and judgment exercised by the curator alone. Ian Blatchford, the museum’s director, said: “The Science Museum has a long-standing relationship with Shell, including most recently sponsorship of Atmosphere, our climate science gallery, which provides our visitors with accurate, up-to-date information on what is known, what is uncertain, and what is not known about this important subject.  “The gallery has been hugely popular since it opened four years ago and has now been visited by more than 3 million people. As with all of our exhibitions and galleries, the editorial vision and control sits with our curatorial team.” The Science Museum said it was normal for a sponsor to make suggestions or raise questions but that did not mean action resulted. Blatchford said: “I can confirm that not a single change to an exhibition resulted from these email exchanges.” A Shell spokesperson said her company and the Science Museum had a long-standing relationship, based on shared interests such as the need to inspire young people about science. “Alongside the many other scientists, academics and educators on the advisory panel for Atmosphere, David Hone, Shell’s climate change adviser, has been consulted with regards to gallery content,” the spokesperson said. “We have occasionally made wider suggestions regarding the Climate Changing programme but at all times the Science Museum retained full editorial control over its plans and content.” Garrard said he was concerned that the close relationship between big oil and the Science Museum was set to continue with BP sponsoring a forthcoming exhibition, Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age. A recent book argued that fossil fuel companies were sponsoring the arts around the world on an “epidemic” scale as a cynical PR strategy to improve their reputation."

"A federal appeals court on Tuesday threw out a pair of high-profile lawsuits challenging the Obama administration’s sweeping plan to address climate change, saying it’s too early to challenge a proposed rule that isn’t yet final. The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit is a temporary setback to opponents of the plan, who are expected to renew their legal attack once the regulation is finalized later this year. The lawsuits from a coalition of 15 states and the nation’s largest privately held coal mining company claim the EPA exceeded its authority last year when it proposed the far-reaching plan to curb pollution from the nation’s coal-fired power plants. Opponents had argued that even though the rule is not yet final, they are already facing steep costs to get ready for it. But the appeals court said that has never before been a justification for a court to examine a proposed rule that could still be changed before it becomes a final regulation. “They want us to do something that they candidly acknowledge we have never done before,” wrote Judge Brett Kavanaugh. “We do not have authority to review proposed agency rules.” The court also said public statements by EPA officials about what the rule will do are not considered final agency action. The rule the EPA proposed last year would require states to cut carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. Each state has a customized target and is responsible for drawing up an effective plan to meet its goal. One lawsuit was filed by a coalition of 15 coal-reliant states. The second was from Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp, the nation’s largest privately held coal mining company. Opponents of the plan say it will force coal companies to shut down plants, shed thousands of jobs and drive up electricity prices. They argue that the plan is illegal because the EPA already regulates other power plant pollutants under a different section of the Clean Air Act. They say the law prohibits “double regulation”. The EPA, however, says it has authority for the plan under the Clean Air Act. At issue are dueling provisions added by the House and Senate to the Clean Air Act in 1990. The EPA says it wins under the Senate language, but opponents argue that the House version should prevail. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia are backing the Obama administration plan."
"In any given 24-hour period, the average urban commuter is subjected to hundreds of corporate advertisements. By contrast, it’s easy to make it through the day without hearing a mention of climate change. For all intents and purposes it is invisible in our daily lives, and this invisibility goes a long way towards explaining why the allegedly “defining” challenge of the 21st century barely registers on barometers of popular culture.  Whether it’s the addictive melodrama of long-running TV soap-operas, the swirling churn of “trending” topics on social media, or the glamorous high-definition version of reality refracted to us through the lens of Hollywood cameras, climate change is missing in action.  It was a surprise, then, to find such a high level of chatter about climate change at the glitzy Cannes film festival (not famed for grappling with the world’s biggest questions). The festival concluded with Ice & Sky, a sombre take on the work of the French scientist Claude Lorius, documenting the destruction of Antarctic glaciers. Charlize Theron, discussing the forthcoming remake of dystopian classic Mad Max, commented: “What makes [the film] even scarier is that it is something that is not far off if we don’t pull it together.” And it’s not just the film industry that has been showing some interest. On the small screen, the 20 million fans of fantasy-drama Game of Thrones may ostensibly be watching sword fights and violent vengeance. But they’re also being told a powerful story about impending ecological destruction – at least, according to a researcher at Arizona State University studying how science blogs have responded to the world-conquering series. And on the even-smaller screen, the maddeningly addictive Angry Birds franchise recently announced it would be integrating a climate change angle in September to coincide with the UN’s climate week events. So is popular culture finally embracing the reality of a changing climate? Saci Lloyd, author of The Carbon Diaries, thinks it is. “Climate change is definitely breaking out of the cultural fringes and into mainstream movies and pop. James Cameron has stated that Avatar is a lesson for humankind to stop damaging the environment. Lady Gaga has recently partnered with Vivienne Westwood for the Climate Revolution campaign. And now Pharrell Williams is dropping in on the UN and telling them it’s time to go from climate change to climate action. I don’t think you can go more pop than that.” Climate change has traditionally thrived in rarefied spaces (at least in the western world): the complex knowledge chambers of science; the bureaucratic back-channels of international diplomacy; and the minority-interest meetings of specialist campaigns groups. So climate change finding its way out of the highbrow realm and into popular culture at all is grounds for optimism. But as ever with climate change, the transition is unlikely to be straightforward. Firstly, when compared to other big issues of our time, it’s clear that climate change has one unique and problematic characteristic: there is no outside observer uniquely well positioned to narrate the story. Hollywood celebrities – often fairly – take flak for their advocacy around global poverty or human rights abuses. Because of their privileged positions, they may be challenged on their credibility. But we all have a credibility problem when it comes to climate change – because like it or not, we are all complicit. And some of us are more complicit than others. Mad Max may tell a cautionary tale about a world ravaged by resource wars, but its own carbon footprint must be mind-bogglingly, extravagantly high. Mainstream cultural channels are, currently, unavoidably high-carbon. This doesn’t invalidate Hollywood’s voice on climate change, but it is essentially impossible to make a big budget (aka popular) film in anything approaching a sustainable way. Unsurprisingly, research suggests that people have ambivalent views about the contradictions inherent in “eco-celebrities”. As the British actor Tom Cullen says: “It’s a tricky position I find myself in. I’m a climate change advocate but often find my lifestyle at odds with my views. I juggle my guilt and my career. The actor Mark Ruffalo has a strong voice in climate change awareness but has recently completed a round-the-world press tour for The Avengers, and therein lies a problem. How can our most adored and respected be listened to if they are hypocrites? How can we bring climate change into the pop-culture foreground if we deem their argument as illegitimate?” Of course, you can entertain people on a village green with a local theatre company using solar-powered lights. The concept of entertainment does not start and finish with pyrotechnics and private jets. But if the mainstream is where climate change needs to be, then this is the reality it will have to grapple with – and it is not hard to see where tensions could arise. While TV executives don’t agree on many things, research by the International Broadcasting Trust has found that they are unanimous in their belief that viewers do not want to be lectured.  Nick Comer-Calder, of the Climate Media Net, puts it this way: “Climate change themes need to be embedded in long-running series to make it mainstream – to normalise it. I don’t think it has to be the whole rationale for a plot – but it needs to be firmly woven in. And it is not just about the science or the impacts, its about the whole complex mechanism of tackling climate change in personal, political, and professional life.” It is encouraging that the final spot in Cannes was reserved for an eco-documentary, and positive that a game played by millions worldwide sees a place for climate change in its franchise. But the real challenge is to integrate climate change into the juggernaut of popular culture – not drag it alongside in a special sidecar of its own – and this is a much tougher (although ultimately more meaningful) proposition."
"Claude Lorius sits in crisp linen on the roof terrace of Cannes’s Majestic hotel, white hair whipped under the blustery sun. Behind him lies an infinity pool; beyond that, the ocean, chocka with yachts. Helicopters whirr overhead, flunkies deposit a delicate smoked salmon slider at his side. At 83, it’s his first time in town – he travelled down a couple of days ago from Macon. What does he make of it so far? “I don’t know if I would come here for holidays,” he chuckles. He winches up his eyebrows; nonchalant, a charmer. He is very, very, very French.  Contrary to appearance, this trip is strictly business. Lorius is here to promote a film about his career as a glaciologist, made by Luc Jacquet, who won an Oscar a decade ago for March of the Penguins. Jacquet, 47, swigs espresso next to him, stubbly and bearlike as his subject is tiny and crepuscular. Ice and the Sky is a blockbuster documentary, a 3D epic which closed this year’s festival and explains how Lorius’s work measuring CO2 bubbles in ice (some of it 800,000 years old) put beyond contest man’s role in climate change. It ends with a urgent call-to-arms, a plea to audiences and politicians alike.  That Cannes offered the film such an “amazing window” is, says Jacquet, “a very political symbol”, a sign there’s appetite for mainstream cinema on the subject. Ice and the Sky plays like a hybrid of epic sci-fi like Interstellar and smaller-scale tub-thumping such as An Inconvenient Truth. “I think we can make stories with science itself,” says Jacquet. “For me, science is like a thriller. There is an enigma.” Jacquet gestures to Lorius. “He was like a policeman, in a way.” Lorius chuckles again and shakes his head – no, no, he’s not a policeman.  But he didn’t feel like a detective, uncovering a mystery? Yes, a detective, he concurs. He prefers that term. Jacquet apologies. The pair seem to snuggle closer. Together, says Jacquet, they are like “naughty children”. I’d have imagined a more paternal dynamic, I say, given that he had to direct him so much. Lorius, whose English is better than my French but not quite fluent, takes it literally. “He’s very young to be my father,” he explains. They first met four years ago at a conference, and bonded over shared language to describe long spells working in the Antarctic. “All you see is the horizon,” says Jacquet. “It’s like a balcony overlooking the world.” The hallucinations triggered by 24 hours of darkness, then endless sunshine, are best understood, they say, by those who’ve also experienced them. “It is a warm friendship,” says Jacquet, “and I wanted to place him in the history of science. It was a matter of respect. It was unfair he was not more recognised.” In the film, Lorius appears both in archive footage and as his octogenarian self, standing waist-deep in a symbolically-rising tide wearing a natty blue cagoule, or perched soulfully on a floe. Projected 100ft wide, his craggy features become totemic. “But he is more a visionary scientist than an elder,” says Jacquet. “Some scientists become politicians, but he was always strictly the scientist. I think it’s not his job to talk about it. It is that of journalists and film-makers.” The director feels a moral compulsion to address the subject – to not do so, he says, would be “criminal”. “I could make endless contemplative films about the beauty of nature. But it would not have been right to do so. We have to deal with this; it’s our duty. It’s like the war. You want a quiet life with your family but you have to say: I cannot accept this. You have to get out of a comfortable area and into the political. You must participate in the society in which you live. If we do not … ” Jacquet’s words are drowned out by the clatter of a copter overhead. It doesn’t feel strange, to premiere such a film in a place not known for consciousness of its eco-footprint? Lorius chortles and Jacquet nods. “It is the worst place in the world for living sustainably,” he says. “I don’t want to say you have to stop Cannes. You need brightness and stars and red carpet. We need desire – this is very important. But you can make a big party sustainable easily.” Yet this consumerist impulse is, he thinks, the biggest stumbling block when it comes to exacting bottom-up change. “To sacrifice things is seen as stopping your dream of consumption.” Perhaps sacrifice in general isn’t an aspiration these days? Maybe 23-year-olds just aren’t up for undergoing hardship as Lorius was 50 years ago?  Lorius shakes his head, thinks I’m just being nostalgic. Back then, he says, “there were also people like that. It’s difficult. You are young, you like to be with ladies, but you are in a little cabin with three people; you open the door and it’s minus 40.” The problem, says Jacquet, lies not just with the west, but those areas of the world whose populations have not yet had the chance to self-express. “Poor people still believe that having a TV or a car is the best way to have happiness. If the majority of people could have enough to eat it I think it would be OK. But this imbalance is problematic.”  Even more concerning, he thinks, is the rise of fundamentalism – the idea that faith trumps future concerns. “In the Middle East, humanity has gone back to the past and the darkness. It’s very unpredictable. I’m very worried. I can’t understand how we got in that direction. This power is huge for there is no fear of anything: we believe in God and we are ready to do everything.” The solution, both men think, lies in persuading people that a future engaged with the issue is not one of regression, or even depression. “It’s a matter of philosophy. We have to reinvent something. To say: you don’t have to stop your happiness. We have to be enthusiastic. This is the history of man: you help yourself, you use your own skills, you are creative.” Later that evening, I watch a live video feed of the two men, immaculate in black tie, walking up the red carpet for the film’s official premiere. Trance music blares from big speakers; people scream for Colin Farrell, a few steps behind them. Lorius and Jacquet hold hands for solidarity and stability.  Canal+ stops the older man for a chinwag, and France’s answer to Ryan Seacrest launches in: “There are 24 steps to the Palais and the carpet is 60 metres. How many penguins do you think you could fit on it?” Lorius’s jaw drops. “Am I supposed to do this interview with the music so loud?” He is. He chuckles again. I can’t tell if he actually utters the word “bof” before tottering off. But it certainly seems like it. • Ice and the Sky will be released later this year"
"Australia is dramatically overstating its greenhouse gas forecasts and has done so for years, a new study has found, allowing promised climate targets to be met while the country does very little to actually reduce its emissions. And it warned this continued over-statement was inflating the starting point for the government’s imminent and closely scrutinised pledge on Australia’s greenhouse reductions after 2020 and is likely to attract international attention.  The constant lowering of the estimated greenhouse emission reductions needed to meet Australia’s targets explained why the country was attacked as an international “free rider” by the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and other international observers,and why at the same time it could claim to be meeting agreed reduction goals, the report’s authors said. “The overstatement of national emissions projections has occurred under successive Coalition and Labor governments, which see little political value in updating “business-as-usual” assumptions, instead preferring to keep baselines high and beat expectations,” said the report, by the energy market analyst firm Reputex. Reputex’s chief executive, Hugh Grossman, said the work – updating assumptions in the greenhouse projections about economic growth, electricity demand and trade – showed Australia might still be overstating its emissions by more than 200m tonnes over the next four years, or more than the annual emissions from the entire electricity sector. He said the overstatement meant the Abbott government was likely to come close to meeting its promise to reduce emissions by 5% by 2020, while doing very little. And because any reductions beyond that pledge can be carried over to the next so-called “commitment period” – beyond 2020 – “this is also likely to make whatever we promise to do after 2020 much easier to achieve if we are allowed to get away with it”, he said.  Reputex’s calculated “over-statement” comes on top of the government’s recent publicly announced revision to Australia’s greenhouse gas projections, which showed that the task of reducing emissions by 5% required less than a third of the effort envisaged when both major parties signed up to the 2020 target. In 2012 the promise to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 was calculated to require the cumulative reduction of 755m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In 2014 new government calculations reduced that figure to 421m tonnes. In March that figure was revised again, to 236m tonnes.  But according to Reputex, even the 236m tonnes is a huge overstatement, and the actual greenhouse gas reductions that have to be achieved by government policy could be just 50m tonnes or even less. Reputex warned that Australia should not be allowed to use any overshoot to make its post-2020 task easier, with Grossman warning Australia could be perceived internationally as “bending the rules in it favour”. “The findings suggest that the international community may be right to question Australia’s emissions ambition should future write-downs be ‘pocketed’ as an accounting benefit, rather than be translated into greater post-2020 ambition,” the report said. But this is exactly what Australia has done in the past. In the 1997 Kyoto agreement, having threatened not to sign, Australia managed to get a special dispensation to increase emissions by 8% in the first period – ending in 2012 – and to count changes in land use.  Almost every other country had to reduce emissions over the same period. Because of land use restrictions already in place when the promise was made, the government knew it could easily meet the pledge and Australia was allowed to “carry over” the excess, or overshoot, to the second commitment period – ending in 2020. That “carryover” represents 129m tonnes of abatement, about the same amount that Reputex thinks the government’s Direct Action emissions reduction fund will buy. Reputex also warned that when the government claimed the fund was buying more than 100m tonnes of abatement by 2020, much of this comprised emission reductions that would have occurred anyway – without any government subsidy – and it therefore could not be counted towards the international goals. The report said: “There can be no certainty that the credits awarded to participants always relate to emissions which are genuinely additional to those that would have occurred in the absence of the scheme. Therefore, when estimating the remaining abatement task, care must be taken to differentiate between [credits from the emissions reduction fund] and real emissions reductions relative to government projections.” Reputex said the constant overstatement of emission projections also rendered the government’s promised “safeguard mechanism” ineffective. The “safeguard mechanism” is supposed to stop polluting industry increasing its emissions and undoing the abatement the government buys from the fund. But because the estimates upon which the safeguards are based are likely to be overstated, industry will be able to increase emissions without any penalty. The government is scheduled to release its post-2020 target by July, ahead of the United Nations meeting in Paris in December where it is hoped a new global agreement can be reached."
"This weekend’s G7 will mark the 10th anniversary of the 2005 Gleneagles G8 summit – a moment that, in retrospect, seems to belong to another age, when progress was possible on a whole different scale.  Back then, more than a dozen countries committed to timetables for spending 0.7% of national income on aid; a landmark deal on multilateral debt relief was secured; a “development round” for trade still seemed possible.  Today, by contrast, it feels as if we’re fiddling around on the edges – look, for instance, at the dim prospects for the finance for development summit in Addis Ababa in July. What’s gone wrong? It’s partly the continuing fallout of the financial crisis, of course; partly the rise of a more multipolar world and its accompanying “G-zero” dynamic. But perhaps most of all, the intensity of demands for change from ordinary people has waned.  This weekend, an estimated 20,000 people will march in Munich to press the G7 to act on poverty and development. Hardly a number to be sniffed at – but only half the number of people who turned out for the IF campaign in London in 2013, and a small fraction of the number who rallied for Make Poverty History in 2005.  The starkest contrast of all, though, is between the state of development activism on the one hand, and climate activism on the other. Last year’s climate march in New York attracted a staggering 400,000 marchers. Nor was this a one-off; seemingly every week, another large investor capitulates to demands to divest from fossil fuel investments – Oxford University, the Church of England, the French insurance giant Axa, Norway’s gargantuan sovereign wealth fund.  In part, successes today are based on learning from mistakes in the past. In 2009, US-based climate NGOs were stunned by the failure to secure legislation to cap emissions, a win they had assumed was a done deal once it cleared the House of Representatives. In retrospect, they realised their key mistake had been to focus on insider lobbying, whereas their opponents in the Tea Party had focused on building a movement. Five years on, climate activists are beating the Tea Party at their own game. To start with, they’ve finally found a story that really resonates. Back in 2009, their messages were technocratic, fact-based, and uninspiring – in stark contrast to the Tea Party’s fiery rhetoric. Now, by contrast, activists are framing climate as a moral issue – a shift that David Roberts explored in detail a few weeks ago in a must-read essay.  Development activists have much to learn here, especially given the acutely technocratic tone of the UN’s sustainable development goals agenda. As I’ve argued elsewhere, the scope of the SDGs is right, but the framing is dreadful. We need a much more resonant storyline if we want to fire people up: one that speaks of a larger us, a longer future, a different good life.  Second, the climate movement has realised that big mobilisations are built out of small groups. Just as the Tea Party is built around local chapters, and just as Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign was built around clusters of activists all over the country, so the US climate divestment movement is rooted in groups of college students across the US.  The development movement used to do this much more than it does today. It was church congregations that provided the real backbone of Jubilee 2000 and Make Poverty History. Nowadays, by comparison, it sometimes feels as though we’ve become too reliant on celebrities to fire us up, and have forgotten about the need to invest in the grassroots.  This leads on to a third point: the power of faith. Progressive activists are often strongly secular in their instincts: as Alastair Campbell put it, we don’t do God. Yet, this is to overlook the extent to which faith groups have been central to so many of the biggest victories of progressive politics: the US civil rights movement, for example, or the abolition of slavery. And this is another thing the climate movement is getting right. Pope Francis – who will publish a papal encyclical on climate change any day now – is emerging as the world’s most important advocate of radical action to save creation from our ignorance. US climate sceptics are, rightly, terrified.  Fourth, the climate movement knows what it wants. Unlike (say) the Occupy movement, the climate movement has clear, actionable demands – above all, in its call for a global carbon budget that recognises the reality that we can’t burn all the fossil fuels in the ground and still keep to 2 degrees.  At Gleneagles, the development movement knew exactly what it wanted: more and better aid, fair trade, and full debt relief. Today, its demands are much less clear.  Fifth and finally, the climate movement is playing a long game. As Rich Gower and I noted in a recent report we wrote for Tearfund, “political and social change doesn’t unfold in a steady, linear fashion … There is often a long period when our efforts seem to yield few results [but] then comes a tipping point, after which events snowball and things suddenly start to fall into place.”  This is now happening right in front of us on fossil fuel divestment. If development activists want to achieve a similar breakthrough, we too will need to think much more in terms of five- to 10-year change processes – and start now to prepare for where we want to get to in 2020. Above all, though, what we need is for the climate and development movements to join forces. There is no realistic scenario in which we successfully address climate while ignoring development, or vice versa. So the movement we really need isn’t a climate movement, or a development movement, but a movement that demands a different way of organising our economy – ensuring that we live within environmental limits, that inequality is kept within reasonable limits – and that everyone is able to meet their basic needs. "
"The value of Europe’s five biggest energy utilities dropped €100bn (£73bn) between 2008 and 2013 in part because of a dogged preference for coal over clean power investments, a new report says. The five firms – E.ON, RWE, GDF Suez, EDF and Enel – collectively lost 37% of their share value in the period, in part because of their increasing dependence on loss-making new coal generating capacity, according to the study by the Carbon Tracker Initiative.  As the recession on the continent dampened power demand and the EU enacted new clean energy laws, Europe’s coal use fell by around 5%. At the same time, the ‘big five’ firms increased their reliance on coal by 9%. More than 100 new coal plants were announced but never built. Nineteen plants were constructed, but there was a net loss in coal-fired capacity of 19GW as other plants closed. The energy giants – which provide nearly 60% of Europe’s electricity – were blindsided as 203GW of additional production capacity from wind and solar came online. “Any firms that made new investment in the belief that there was a big future for coal, any companies that left themselves in that position, clearly did not have their eyes open,” said Michael Grubb, the sustainable energy adviser to Ofgem, the UK’s energy regulator. Grubb, a former climate change committee member and chief economist to the Carbon Trust, which advises businesses on reducing emissions, said that rapid moves to more energy efficient and renewable technologies this decade had bitten chunks out of the utilities’ market size and profit margins, due to their carbon-intensive business models. The new report, ‘Caught in the EU utility death spiral’ outlines how Enel bucked the downward market trend by separating its fossil fuels and clean energy operations in 2008, and ramping up its renewable quotient from 4% to 12% of overall capacity. Late last year, E.ON followed suit. The German energy company RWE took the opposite tack, and was the worst-performing of the big five companies. “Our competitiveness depends on whether we succeed in bringing electricity generation based on fossil fuels —especially coal— in line with the goal of protecting the climate,” its 2008 annual report had said. Last month, the firm posted a 5% fall in profits, blaming a “persistent drop” in demand for fossil fuel-generated power. More than half of RWE’s electricity still came from coal at the end of 2013. Its chief executive Peter Terium recently said that plans to set emissions budgets for big polluters would “affect our very existence.” But Carbon Tracker argues that the writing should have been on the wall for RWE in 2008, when the EU published its three 2020 goals of a 20% emissions cut, 20% share for renewables in the energy mix, and 20% increase in energy efficiency. With moderated but still tangible reforms to Europe’s emissions limits and carbon pricing systems set to kick in over the next decade – and new targets for 2030 – Matt Gray, one of the report’s authors, argued that the transition to a cleaner energy system was now unstoppable.  “The future for coal in Europe is very bleak,” he said. “We see coal generation reducing significantly between now and 2030, due to increases in renewables and stagnating energy demand,” he said. A case study in the Carbon Tracker paper finds that the asset stranding of Vattenfall’s new Moorburg hard coal plant in Hamburg is “almost inevitable”. Grubb said that as Germany’s energiewende continued to empower citizens to sell back their own solar-powered electricity to the grid, the utilities would be wise to capitalise on new business opportunities in the distribution and services provision sectors. “I think there will be a substantial number of stranded assets,” he told the Guardian, “although I also think many of the utilities will only have themselves to blame.” "

"Developing countries have the opportunity to leapfrog the west in economic development, if they go straight to clean technology while rich countries struggle to wean themselves off fossil fuels, president Francois Hollande of France said on Wednesday. “They are going to be skipping the stage where industrialised countries were stopped fro a long time, for many decades,” he said. “We were dependent on fossil fuel, which means we now have to concentrate on the transition in the medium to long term of abandoning fossil fuels. But they have the chance to move immediately to the new technologies.”  He said clean technologies such as renewable energy were “dropping in price and will continue to drop”, while industrialised countries faced costs in having to scrap old infrastructure and rebuild it anew in a low-carbon fashion. Developing countries, many of which are constructing scores of new cities to house their burgeoning populations, would be able to build them in a low-carbon way, with better energy efficiency, he told the annual meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in Paris. “In the old world, we are proud of our old cities, but [they are very inefficient],” he said. “But countries starting on the path of industrialisation can immediately go to new building [technology].” He compared the opportunity with the mobile phone revolution in Africa, whereby as mobile phone technology dropped in price and became widely available all over the continent, there was little incentive to build conventional fixed line phones. “The digital revolution and the energy revolution will go hand in hand as in a sense we are talking about the same revolution,” he said. Hollande looked ahead to the UN conference in Paris this December, at which governments are expected to forge a new global agreement on the climate, with commitments from all to limit greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, when current commitments come to an end. He said countries had still not done enough to reach an agreement. “We know everything [about climate change] - we do not need another report, we do not need more experts. We know a lot about this, and we know the cost of inaction.” He called for a price on carbon as this would encourage businesses to invest in low-carbon technology and to change their practices. “Set a price for carbon then businesses will change the way they invest and perform,” he said, echoing the six oil companies which earlier this week called for such a price. He also called for more transparency from businesses, and said France was leading the way by putting in place regulations that would require banks and investors to disclose their exposure to high-carbon assets. “We need to introduce rules that will channel investments,” he said."

"Japan and South Korea are the world’s biggest financiers of coal through export credit agencies, a new report has found, with coal projects in Australia among the major beneficiaries of their support. WWF said that the three countries are attempting to derail talks that could cut international coal finance from such agencies, which are state-owned mechanisms that fund or underwrite overseas projects that domestic companies are involved in. Japan’s export credit agency (ECA) gave more than $20bn (£13bn), with South Korea second on $7bn. The data, compiled by WWF, Oil Change International (OCI) and the Natural Resource Defence Council, reveals more than $73bn of international public finance was given to coal between 2007 and 2014. The group said the money “moved through largely unknown and opaque institutions”. ECAs based in OECD member states were the biggest drivers of coal investment, accounting for nearly half of the total. The data comes a week before the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) export credit group is due to meet in Paris to discuss banning export finance for coal. The US and France have already stopped their ECAs giving money to coal power plants, and are pushing for a global ban on export credit for coal.  Sebastien Godinot, an economist with WWF-Europe, said there was a high risk of the talks foundering on the recalcitrance of Australia, Japan and Korea. “The OECD countries have to recognise that this policy of supporting coal exports with public money is just completely inconsistent with their climate commitments. You have three countries which are trying to block progress which are Japan, Korea and Australia. This is the dark side. Their intention is clearly to buy time or to block any substantial progress,” he said. Under current OECD rules, ECA finance gives preferable, long-term conditions to all fossil fuel projects, including coal. Godinot said the loans, guarantees, policy lending and technical assistance often act as seed funding, which draws more investment to projects meaning the $73bn is actually responsible for generating much larger investments in the dirtiest fossil fuel. The NGOs calculated that the coal power plants supported by international finance would emit 0.5bn tonnes of carbon each year, equal to the annual emissions of Italy. Over their lifetime, supported plants would spew 18bn tonnes into the atmosphere. Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of OCI, said that by blocking progress and continuing to fund their own coal companies “governments are prioritising the corporate profits of the coal industry over the climate and the interests of the poor”. The coal industry has argued that its product is necessary to bring affordable electricity to the developing world.  But the data revealed that Australia, one of the world’s 10 richest countries , received over $4bn in funding for new coal projects – mostly for mines and mostly from Japan. This makes it one of the biggest beneficiaries of coal export finance in the world and one of eight high income countries in the top 20. Australia has also adopted the strongest opposition to the OECD export credit ban. Japanese miner Mitsubishi received over $1.4bn worth of credit from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, one of Japan’s two ECAs, to bolster its stake in the Caval Ridge Coal Mine in the Australian state of Queensland. At the opening, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott declared: “Coal is good for humanity.” The total funding for coal from ECAs was $12bn more than the funding from all global development banks. Japan’s finance alone was three times the funding given by the World Bank, whose president has called for an end to subsidies for coal. No countries defined as ‘low-income’ received finance from ECAs based in OECD countries. Much of the money did end up in emerging economies, such as Vietnam, South Africa and India.  But Kretzmann said the money was not targeted at development and that renewable energy was generally the cheapest way to provide electricity to those who lack it. “An ECA is an agency that is specifically designed to support a country’s own domestic corporate agenda abroad, to open up new markets for companies based in those countries. In the case of Japan, which is by far the largest lender, you have Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi who are the really big winners,” he said. Last week Reuters reported that Germany had weakened Europe’s stance on banning coal export finance. The Guardian understands that Germany is supportive of controls on coal finance but not the total ban desired by France and the US. Godinot said this was of particular concern because of Germany’s position in the EU and the EU’s large influence on the OECD – two-thirds of OECD countries are in the EU. Shelagh Whitley, a climate finance expert at the Overseas Development Institute, said Germany’s continued support for coal overseas – it is the fourth largest export financier of coal – was at odds with its domestic phase out of coal subsidies and clean energy growth.  “This dirty money helps German coal companies, now unable to do business at home, export their dead-end technologies to developing countries. This leaves a black mark on the country’s otherwise clean climate record,” she said. "

"Pledges made by countries to cut their carbon emissions ahead of a crunch climate summit in Paris later this year will delay the world passing the threshold for dangerous global warming by just two years, according to a new analysis. The research, led by a former lead author on the UN’s climate science panel, found that the submissions so far by 36 countries to the UN would likely delay the world passing the threshold until 2038, rather than 2036 without the carbon cuts.  However, more than 150 countries have yet to submit their carbon pledges despite a deadline of the end of March. While most are relatively small emitters, commitments by big polluters such as India could significantly change the picture. The analysis for the Guardian by the non-profit Climate Analytics comes as climate negotiators from nearly 200 countries meet in Bonn and academics warned the agreement hoped for in Paris would not keep temperatures to UN’s target of holding temperature rises below 2C above pre-industrial levels.   None of the pledges, known in UN jargon as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), were found to be in line with the 2C limit, when a fair global distribution of emissions cuts was factored into countries’ offers. Pledges made by Russia and Canada would be consistent with potentially catastrophic warming of between 3-4C if the pledges were matched with a similar level of ambition globally, according to the research. “The action and ambition we have seen to date is far from sufficient and unless it is rapidly accelerated, the difficulties of limiting warming below 2C will be extreme,” said Dr Bill Hare, the founder of Climate Analytics and a former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead author. But he added: “What we see in the economic and technological potential for emissions reductions gives us hope that if governments are willing to move fast enough in the next 5-10 years, we might still make it. All that is lacking is political will.” Achim Steiner, the director of the UN Environment Programme, said this week that he would measure countries’ commitments by “looking at whether the pledges add up to anything that comes close to ensuring that we at least have the possibility to stay within a 2C scenario.” The new analysis suggests an uphill struggle. Some civil society groups complain that the focus on national pledges distracts attention from the planet’s fast-dwindling carbon budget and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) goal of stabilising atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions at safe levels. “When the UNFCCC started 21 years ago, atmospheric CO2 concentration were at 300 parts per million (ppm). Today they are at 400 ppm, and increasing faster each year than the one before,” said Michael Wadleigh, the founder of the Unesco-supported Homo Sapiens Foundation, and director of the Oscar-winning film, Woodstock. “Despite all the UNFCCC’s negotiated agreements, the body is failing in its key objective.”   Reto Knutti, a lead author for the IPCC’s last major climate report, said that scientists would prefer the world to set global carbon quotas – rather than percentages of national emissions set against baseline years – but admitted that this was a hard sell. “We presented carbon budget schemes in Warsaw two years ago [the UN climate summit in 2013], and the policy-makers all said ‘we agree and its urgent’. But at the same time, they tried to tweak things so they had to do as little as possible,” he said. Nicholas Stern, the author of aninfluential review of the economics of climate change for the UK government, said that the Paris summit would be crucial in at least setting a “floor of ambition” “The question is how fast can you ramp up,” he said. “There’s no doubt that [INDCs] are coming in too high for 2030 for 2C [of warming]. That’s crystal clear. Much too high. But if we get some movement in policies, if we get much stronger innovation of the kind they are trying to encourage, then they could be ramped up quite quickly.” Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN climate secretariat, acknowledges Paris is unlikely to meet 2C but said future rounds of pledges could meet the target. “You don’t run a marathon with one step,” Reuters reported her as as saying.    "
"Nearly two-thirds of people believe that negotiators at key UN climate talks in December should do “whatever it takes” to limit global warming to a 2C rise, according to what is believed to be the most comprehensive survey of global public attitudes to climate change ever conducted.  The Worldwide Views on Climate and Energy consultation involved 10,000 citizens from 79 developed and developing countries.  It was initiated by a coalition including the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with support from, among others, the French, German and Norwegian governments and the European Space Agency.  Of those participating, 78% said they are “very concerned” about the impacts of climate change, although this drops to 69% for citizens from developed countries. Globally, 89% said that climate change should be a national priority in their country, while 49% said they felt that it already was. 80% said that their country should take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions even if others do not.  Asked how urgently the world should react to climate change, 63% of participants said the world should decide in Paris to do “whatever it takes” to limit temperatures to 2C.  The results come six months before the UN climate change summit in Paris at which negotiators from more than 190 countries will attempt to hammer out a deal deal on tackling climate change, primarily through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Current commitments to decrease emissions are due to expire in 2020. More than two-thirds (68%) of participants in the survey said an agreement in Paris should include a long-term goal for zero emissions by the end of the century that is legally binding for all countries.  Asked to comment on fossil fuel exploration, almost half (45%) said they thought the world should stop exploration for all fossil fuel reserves, while 23% said that exploration should continue, 62% said that exploration for new coal reserves should be stopped.  Bjorn Bedsted, global co-ordinator of the consultation said: “These results will be very valuable to politicians and negotiators – it’s the only source of information they have about what citizens really think about the key negotiations. This was not a climate change campaign to tell people what to think but was about asking people what they think.” He also commented that the results demonstrated that people see tackling climate change as “something positive – not as a trade off or a sacrifice they have to make.” Two-thirds (66%) thought that measures to combat climate change are “mostly an opportunity to improve our quality of life”, while 27% see it as mostly a “threat” to quality of life.  And 64% said the efforts of developing countries should “partly” depend on funding from developed countries, while 18% said it should depend “completely” on such funding. At previous annual UN climate change summits, global negotiators agreed that in order to avoid catastrophic and irreversible climate change the temperature of the planet must not rise more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. According to the World Bank, without immediate concerted action, we are currently on track to reach this within two or three decades and to reach a 4C rise by the end of the century. Commenting on the results, a spokesperson from the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change said: “The UK government shares the global view that climate change is not just a threat to the environment, but also threatens national and global security and our attempts to eradicate poverty and spread economic prosperity. That is why the UK is pushing hard for an ambitious global deal in Paris and is working hard to move towards a low-carbon economy.” The consultation took place on Saturday with 100 citizens from each participating area gathering for face-to-face discussion around the same policy questions. Participants were selected to reflect the demographic diversity of their country, according to multiple factors including age, gender, education, occupation and geography. Participants were also selected so that members of environmental organisations were not over-represented.  Participants were sent information packs in advance, which were reviewed by an advisory board including scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and citizen focus groups. Questions were chosen in consultation with global policy makers.  The results of the survey come as a UK poll suggests that two-thirds of the British public think that investments in fossil fuels are becoming more risky. Figures from a OnePoll survey of 2,000 people across the UK show that almost half (46%) said they would be unhappy if they found out their money was being used to fund fossil fuel developments such as fracking. Only 1 in 10 of those surveyed had seen coverage of fossil fuel divestment, a global movement to pressure investors to move their money out of fossil fuel companies as part of the move to an economy based on clean energy. Bruce Davis, co-founder of Abundance, the ethical investment company that commissioned the research, said that it suggests more people see fossil fuel divestment as an issue of financial security than of ethics. “What we’re seeing here is a tipping point in concern over fossil fuel risk. It reflects the fact that the actions of some high profile investors and the idea of carbon risk has achieved very broad reach beyond the divestment campaign. The industry can no longer claim that this is just an issue for the usual suspects, the activists who have protested against their ethical and environmental shortcomings for years, it is now top of mind for ordinary investors worried about their future financial security.” In December, the Bank of England launched an investigation into the risks posed to the global economy by a “carbon bubble”. The concept rests on a theory that investments in fossil fuel reserves will become worthless – or “stranded assets” – if governments stick to international targets to limit global warming to a 2C rise by limiting carbon emissions.  The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground Campaign is highlighting the fossil fuel divestment argument. It is calling on the world’s two largest health charities – the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – to move their investments out of fossil fuel companies.    "
"The world’s governments and businesses need to choose wisely and invest in low carbon energy, not the dirty fossil fuels of the past, according to the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon.  He said that climate change was striking faster than expected, but that the transition to clean energy was also accelerating. In an interview with the Guardian, Ban said previous slow progress on tackling climate change had spawned strong civil society movements, including a fast-growing fossil fuel divestment campaign. He encouraged citizens to press for action on global warming, which he said was a vital component of sealing a strong climate change deal at a crunch summit in Paris in December. Ban also said, with a papal encyclical on climate change due to be published in June, that he welcomed the addition of Pope Francis’s moral voice to the debate. Ban stressed that the reduction of poverty around the world was inextricably linked to tackling climate change.  “I have taken the climate change issue as one of my top priorities since I took over my job in January 2007,” said Ban. “This is a defining issue of our time.” “I have been urging all sectors of society to choose wisely and invest in the low carbon pathway,” he said. “Over the next 15 years, the world will make a massive investment in new infrastructures, in serious renewable energy. We can invest in the low carbon economy or we can invest in dirty technologies.” “Climate change is happening much much faster than expected,” said Ban. But he said the transition to renewable energy was speeding up also, as businesses became increasingly aware of the advances in technology and falling costs. “We will see a much quicker pace of investment pattern changes,” he said. Last week, insurance giant Axa announced it was pulling €500m from the coal sector and putting €3bn into green investments. Ban confirmed that Pope Francis, who he met last week, will speak at a UN meeting in New York in September. Ban added: “I’m looking forward to the Pope’s encyclical on the subject, which would add some moral voice on this issue.”  The branch of the UN tasked with delivering a climate deal in December has already added its “moral voice” to the fossil fuel divestment campaign, which is persuading investors from major financial institutions, charitable foundations, universities and churches to dump their fossil fuel investments.  Current fossil fuel reserves are several times what can safely be burned, leading campaigners to argue that investing in companies that are searching for more coal, oil and gas is highly risky to both the climate and investors’ capital. The Guardian, whose parent company has divested, is running a campaign asking the world’s two biggest health charities to divest. Ban said he was in agreement with the Pope that “ending poverty, embracing human dignity and addressing climate change are interlinked”. Ban said: “Climate change and sustainable development, they are the two sides of one coin.”  Some fossil fuel companies argue that restricting the burning of coal and other fossil fuels would hinder progress in reducing global poverty. But the latest report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, produced by thousands of the world’s foremost experts and approved by 195 nations, concluded that climate change, driven by unchecked fossil fuel burning, “is a threat to sustainable development” and would “prolong existing and create new poverty traps”. Ban said he was optimistic that the world’s governments would reach a climate agreement in December. “There is a strong sense by world leaders from governments and business and civil society that this is the time to reach an agreement,” he said. “There are still some significant hurdles to be overcome. However, all the countries ... believe that they should do it and they can do it.” I encourage citizens to press for climate action using peaceful and democratic means “At this time, what is most required is political will by the world leaders of the governments and political will and wise investment by the business communities and also a strong support and engagement of civil society,” he said. “I encourage citizens to press for climate action using peaceful and democratic means.” The UN climate negotiations resumed in Bonn this week, with officials attempting to pare down a draft text less than six months to go until the Paris summit."
"When I was a kid, I use to think that climate change was an issue that was only affecting polar bears in the north pole. It was frightening – for one hot minute – and then my family and I would throw our food waste and batteries together in the same bin.  I grew up in a cité, the French equivalent of a council estate, in Argenteuil, in the Parisian suburbs. The majority of its residents were of African and Maghrebi descent. We barely had functioning elevators, so the council couldn’t be bothered to force us to recycle.  My friends who lived in middle-class neighbourhoods already knew how to recycle and plant seeds in a garden – and they had the space for it. As I grew older, I realised that my friends who had the opportunity to leave the cité for more secure and bigger accommodation, such as gated communities in the suburbs, were almost all white. The few times I raised the environment issue at home, I was told that “recycling was for white people”. But environmental issues, and especially climate change, have a funny way of affecting our everyday lives. And they don’t really care about our origins. The first natural disaster which affected me was the French heatwave of 2003, when I was 12. It was quite a big deal in the country back then, because about 15,000 old people died from heat stroke and poor living conditions. Suddenly, global warming was upon us. I thought that it just meant that we would have higher temperatures during the summer. I was wrong. Climate change means that we experience more extreme temperatures every year, both hot and cold. And it affected the black and Maghrebi people in my neighbourhood even more: the buildings we are living in have very poor insulation, and no district heating.  Having vegetation around a home has been proven to be effective to protect populations against heat waves. We had some green spaces where I lived, incredibly small and always crowded. But they have since disappeared, replaced by concrete. One of our biggest green spaces locally turned to a wasteland, where rats appeared and then spread to the surrounding cités. We were completely forgotten, despite what the council promised. We had nothing to protect us from extreme temperatures, more frequent because of climate change. And that is the tricky thing with environmental racism: we have poor living conditions, and fewer opportunities to move to better accommodation. It has been shown that landlords tend to prefer white tenants when it comes to renting, or buying a home. And gentrification means that even if we choose to stay, we’ll be forced to leave sooner or later. Environmental issues are serious and urgent, and affect everyone – especially people like me. Having access to a decent environment is a natural right. And I urge more young black people to care about that, because we pay the price every day. It is time for us to start at a grassroot level, to build healthier local communities and produce locally. Because no one else will do it for us."

"Climate change is not just an urgent environmental issue; it is having a devastating effect on health.  Doctors for the Environment Australia’s (DEA) latest report finds that children are more vulnerable to global warming than adults for four major reasons: their behaviour exposes them to risks, their bodies respond differently, they depend on others, and they can have a lifetime of exposure to potential harms.  Doctors are concerned Australian children are already suffering health effects from increasing temperatures, and more frequent and severe droughts, floods, bushfires and heatwaves as a result of climate change. Doctors are also worried about rising temperatures causing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue, to areas further south, affecting air pollution levels, and increasing allergenic pollen in the air leading to higher rates of hayfever and asthma. Recent research from Brisbane and Westmead Children’s Hospital in Sydney demonstrated that higher temperatures increased rates of child emergency department attendances for fever, gastroenteritis and asthma. Children are vulnerable to heat-related illness due to behaviours such as playing outdoors, failing to drink sufficiently and being less able to control their environment; their smaller body mass to surface area ratio and higher requirement for water per unit of weight; and their immature immune systems which can predispose them to infections such as gastroenteritis. Children’s ongoing brain development, along with their dependence on care-givers, also makes them more vulnerable to the emotional trauma and cognitive effects of witnessing extreme weather events like bushfires and floods. Children surveyed six months after the 2003 Canberra bushfires showed much higher rates of behavioural and emotional problems and nearly half showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. But what worries doctors the most is the future health effects of four degrees of warming this century should we not rapidly reduce emissions. This would threaten the underlying foundations for children’s health – clean water, food supply, and social and economic stability. While 88% of the burden of disease from climate change today is felt by children in developing countries, rich countries emitting high levels of greenhouse gas emissions are unequivocally the cause. We have a moral responsibility to assist the children of the world along with a vested interest in maintaining geopolitical stability. Further, existing inequities within society will widen as those already marginalised are least able to cope. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children already suffer lack of access to healthy foods or adequate infrastructure and are at increased risk. Ultimately climate change represents a major intergenerational injustice – if we do nothing we are committing intergenerational theft of grand proportions. We urge governments to act to both mitigate and plan for adaptation. Climate change is a good example of “prevention being better than cure”. To avoid more than two degrees of warming this century (the internationally agreed “safe” level) we need to start markedly reducing emissions this decade and continue major wind backs after that. Our current bipartisan target of a 5% reduction on 2000 levels by 2020 is woefully inadequate, and plans to markedly increase coal exports are irresponsible – all Australian governments are failing in their duty to protect citizens. Unfortunately climate change has become the victim of vested interests and politics in Australia. In fact it’s so politically charged that we have been told that we are being brave to mention it in this report! We struggle to get the media to discuss what should be the most talked about issue of our time. Other countries are now acting to reduce emissions and Australia is being left behind and internationally criticised. We must adapt and prepare our health system for impacts from unavoidable climate change. We know infrastructure is struggling to cope with increasing extreme weather events. For example, despite an estimated 374 excess deaths due to the heat wave surrounding the Black Saturday fires of 2009, a damning review last year by the auditor general found Victorians were still receiving mixed messages about preventing heat-related illnesses and that at least four hospitals lost power during the heatwave in January 2014. The auditor general said: Individual agency heatwave plans were not mandatory, their quality variable, and there was a lack of clarity around the triggers for activation of the plans. Ultimately, climate change commitments must be made based on the medical science, as doctors have achieved before with tobacco and asbestos. We need better data on the health and other effects of climate change housed in a major centre in the Commonwealth department of health with satellite units in each state to initiate, implement and monitor a national strategy for the health effects of climate change.  The aim of DEA, a health advocacy organisation of medical doctors raising awareness of the link between health and the environment, in releasing the report on the impacts of climate change on the health of children was to influence Australian government emissions reduction commitments at the global climate negotiations this year in Paris. The AMA has set up a working group on the issue, and the Royal Australian College of Physicians has just voted to divest from fossil fuels. We hope that this report, with evidence that this is a major issue for the future health and wellbeing of our children, will influence both those in power and the general community to push for change. We need parents and grandparents to stand up and demand better of their elected representatives to protect their children and grandchildren."
"The global target of directing $100bn to poor countries to help them cope with climate change is likely to be missed unless private sector finance is ramped up significantly, a new analysis has found. Rich countries will also have to find more money from taxpayers to fund developing countries, enabling them to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and rebuild their infrastructure to adapt to the likely effects of global warming.  The analysis, seen by the Guardian, is a critical part of the runup to the UN climate change conference, starting on 30 November in Paris. Poor countries were promised finance flows of $100bn a year from developed countries by 2020, as part of the deal reached at the climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009. But finance has fallen well short of that target so far, and poor countries are concerned they will not receive the promised money. They are demanding that the target be reached, as a prerequisite for any agreement in Paris. Some countries have also demanded that all of the $100bn a year financing should come solely from the public purse of developed nations, rather than coming from the private sector or other sources. Developed countries are resisting this, and want private sector money to fulfil a large part of the pledge. The analysis, by the World Resources Institute, which will be published on Wednesday, shows that the target is unlikely to be met unless private sector funding is included. But if it is included, then the target can be reached or even substantially exceeded. At Paris this December, world governments are expected to forge a new global agreement on climate, with rich countries pledging to cut their greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments run out, and developing nations are expected to place curbs on their future emissions. The Getting to $100bn report, designed to inform the French and other governments ahead of the crunch negotiations, shows that rich countries must increase their pledges of funding in order to meet the target. It posits four scenarios, with varying amounts of cash coming from the public sector, development banks such as the World Bank, and businesses. Under the most likely scenario, developed countries would provide about $31bn a year towards the target from their taxpayers, nearly a doubling of the estimated $17bn provided in 2012. Development banks, including the World Bank, would supply $28bn, also nearly a doubling from the $15bn provided in 2012. “There is clearly a need for additional public money,” said Pascal Canfin, senior advisor on international climate affairs at the WRI, and co-author of the report. “But this is do-able.” The money from rich countries would enable about $39bn to be leveraged from the private sector – in other words, businesses would be expected to co-invest or use loans from the public sector – which is a substantial increase on the $21bn from this source in 2012. The money from development banks would also be leveraged in the private sector, supplying about $39bn, up from $21bn in 2012. If realised, this would amount to about $137bn, enough to satisfy developing countries’ requests. Providing the finance is seen as crucial to the success of the Paris talks. Canfin, who also advises the French government, said: “At Paris, if we are not able to demonstrate that finance is there, why should developing countries believe in an agreement? If we can’t demonstrate it, there won’t be a deal.” Canfin warned that much more investment than the $100bn a year would be needed to put the world’s economy on a low-carbon footing, and ensure that global warming does not exceed 2C above pre-industrial levels, the threshold beyond which the effects of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. “These finance flows will not be enough in themselves to produce a 2C economy,” he said. “There has to be in Paris a roadmap for a 2C economy.” The report does not address another crucial question: what will be agreed at Paris in terms of rich country pledges for finance flows beyond 2020? Unless that is also resolved, there may be no agreement in Paris."

"Australian delegates have been questioned about the government’s climate policies at a United Nations conference in Germany. The hour-long grilling from developing nations such as China and Brazil came at a meeting in Bonn which is as part of a mutual assessment process ahead of a conference in Paris in December where countries hope to sign a global agreement on climate action.  Countries questioned Australia’s scrapping of the carbon tax and whether the federal government’s $2.55bn direct action policy will be enough to meet Australia’s emissions reduction target of five per cent by 2020. The industrialised economies are far off track in helping the world meet the UN’s global warming target, a monitoring group said on Thursday. Carbon pledges made by 31 economies – members of the G7 and the European Union (EU) – mean that by 2030, they will contribute only 30% of the effort they should be, it said. Further work is needed to ratchet up commitments, said a report of the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) initiative, issued on the sidelines of the Bonn talks. The 195 countries of the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) are meant to seal a pact to ensure warming is limited to 2C over pre-industrial times. Laborious and complex, the talks have been dogged by finger-pointing between rich and poor countries over sharing the burden for curbing carbon emissions. “Ambitious greenhouse-gas reduction proposals by the G7+EU states are central for a successful outcome in Paris,” said the CAT analysis. “These countries are responsible in aggregate for around 30 percent of global greenhouse gases emissions and 40 percent of global GDP.”"

"The G7 leading industrial nations have agreed to cut greenhouse gases by phasing out the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has announced, in a move hailed as historic by some environmental campaigners.  On the final day of talks in a Bavarian castle, Merkel said the leaders had committed themselves to the need to “decarbonise the global economy in the course of this century”. They also agreed on a global target for limiting the rise in average global temperatures to a maximum of 2C over pre-industrial levels. Environmental lobbyists described the announcement as a hopeful sign that plans for complete decarbonisation could be decided on in Paris climate talks later this year. But they criticised the fact that leaders had baulked at Merkel’s proposal that they should agree to immediate binding emission targets. As host of the summit, which took place in the foothills of Germany’s largest mountain, the Zugspitze, Merkel said the leading industrialised countries were committed to raising $100bn (£65bn) in annual climate financing by 2020 from public and private sources. In a 17-page communique issued after the summit at Schloss Elmau under the slogan “Think Ahead, Act Together”, the G7 leaders agreed to back the recommendations of the IPCC, the United Nations’ climate change panel, to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at the upper end of a range of 40% to 70% by 2050, using 2010 as the baseline. Merkel also announced that G7 governments had signed up to initiatives to work for an end to extreme poverty and hunger, reducing by 2030 the number of people living in hunger and malnutrition by 500 million, as well as improving the global response to epidemics in the light of the Ebola crisis. Poverty campaigners reacted with cautious optimism to the news.The participant countries – Germany, Britain, France, the US, Canada, Japan and Italy – would work on initiatives to combat disease and help countries around the world react to epidemics, including a fund within the World Bank dedicated to tackling health emergencies, Merkel announced at a press conference after the summit formally ended on Monday afternoon. Reacting to the summit’s final declaration, the European Climate Foundation described the G7 leaders’ announcement as historic, saying it signalled “the end of the fossil fuel age” and was an “important milestone on the road to a new climate deal in Paris”. Samantha Smith, a climate campaigner for the World Wildlife Fund, said: “There is only one way to meet the goals they agreed: get out of fossil fuels as soon as possible.” The 350.org campaign group put out a direct challenge to Barack Obama to shut down long-term infrastructure projects linked to the fossil fuel industry. “If President Obama wants to live up to the rhetoric we’re seeing out of Germany, he’ll need to start doing everything in his power to keep fossil fuels in the ground. He can begin by rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline and ending coal, oil and gas development on public lands,” said May Boeve, the group’s director. Others called on negotiators seeking an international climate deal at Paris later this year to make total decarbonisation of the global economy the official goal. “A clear long-term decarbonisation objective in the Paris agreement, such as net zero greenhouse gas emissions well before the end of the century, will shift this towards low-carbon investment and avoid unmanageable climate risk,” said Nigel Topping, the chief executive of the We Mean Business coalition. Merkel won praise for succeeding in her ambition to ensure climate was not squeezed off the agenda by other pressing issues. Some environmental groups said she had established herself as a “climate hero”. Observers said she had succeeded where sceptics thought she would not, in winning over Canada and Japan, the most reluctant G7 partners ahead of negotiations, to sign up to her targets on climate, health and poverty. Iain Keith, campaign director of the online activist network Avaaz, said: “Angela Merkel faced down Canada and Japan to say ‘Auf Wiedersehen’ to carbon pollution and become the climate hero the world needs.” The One campaigning and advocacy organisation called the leaders’ pledge to end extreme poverty a “historic ambition”. Adrian Lovett, its Europe executive director, said: “These G7 leaders have signed up ... to be part of the generation that ends extreme poverty and hunger by 2030.” But he warned: “Schloss Elmau’s legacy must be more than a castle in the air. But the Christian relief organisation World Vision accused the leaders of failing to deliver on their ambitious agenda, arguing they had been too distracted by immediate crises, such as Russia and Greece. “Despite addressing issues like hunger and immunisation, it was nowhere as near as ambitious as we would have hoped for,” a spokeswoman said. Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust said the proposals would “transform the resilience of global health systems”. But he said the success of the measures would depend on the effectiveness with which they could be coordinated on a global scale and that required fundamental reform of the World Health Organisation, something the leaders stopped short of deciding on. “We urge world leaders to consider establishing an independent body within the WHO with the authority and responsibility to deliver this,” he said. Merkel, who called the talks “very work-intensive and productive” and defended the format of a summit that cost an estimated €300m (£220m), said that the participants had agreed to sharpen existing sanctions against Russia if the crisis in Ukraine were to escalate. She also said “there isn’t much time left” to find a solution to the Greek global debt crisis but that participants were unanimous in wanting Greece to stay in the eurozone. Demonstrators, about 3,000 of whom had packed a protest camp in the nearby village of Garmisch Partenkirchen, cancelled the final action that had been planned to coincide with the close of the summit. At a meeting in the local railway station, the head of Stop G7 Elmau, Ingrid Scherf announced that the final rally would not go ahead “because we’re already walked off our feet”. She denied the claims of local politicians that the group’s demonstrations had been a flop. “I’m not at all disappointed, the turnout was super,” she said. “And we also had the support of lots of locals.” Only two demonstrators were arrested, police said, one for throwing a soup dish, another for carrying a spear.

"Ikea, the world’s biggest furniture retailer, plans to spend €1bn ($1.13bn) on renewable energy and steps to help poor nations cope with climate change, the latest example of firms upstaging governments in efforts to slow warming.  Chief Executive Peter Agnefjall said the measures would “absolutely not” push up prices at the Swedish group’s stores. The investments will be “good for customers, good for the climate and good for Ikea too,” he told Reuters.   He said the plan was motivated by a desire to tackle climate change, rather than to court favourable publicity. “Getting that message out to the customers is secondary,” he said.  An internal review last year showed only 41% percent of its customers see IKEA as a company that “takes social and environmental responsibility“ seriously, below its goal of 70% by 2015.  IKEA, which had sales of €30bn last year, wants to generate all the energy used in its shops and factories from clean sources by 2020.  To that end, it will invest €600m euros on wind and solar power installations, adding to €1.5bn invested since 2009. It has already signed up to own and operate 314 wind turbines and has 700,000 solar panels on its roofs.  The Ikea Foundation, the charitable arm of the family-owned group, would invest €400m by 2020 in supporting families and communities in nations vulnerable to impacts of climate change such as floods, droughts and desertification.  Senior officials from almost 200 nations are meeting in the German city of Bonn this week to prepare for a summit in Paris in late 2015 at which governments aim to agree a deal to slow global warming.  The Alliance of Small Island States, which fears the impact of rising sea levels, welcomed Ikea’s planned investments.  “I am heartened to see corporate leadership in this area,” said Amjad Abdulla of the Maldives, chief negotiator for the alliance in Bonn.  There are signs that companies are taking a more active approach, keen to show their awareness of consumer concerns.  Last month, top European companies urged governments to commit to slashing greenhouse gas emissions.  This week, six European oil and gas companies – BG Group, BP, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and Total – added their voice to calls for a pricing system for carbon emissions. The firms have often been accused of inaction.  Mindful of environmental concerns, Ikea says it plans to get more of its wood and cotton from sustainable sources.  It says it will ensure it grows as many trees as it fells by 2020. The top national suppliers of pine and other wood used in its familiar self-assembly furniture were Poland, Lithuania, Sweden, Germany and Russia last year."
"David Cameron is preparing to warn fellow world leaders at the two-day G7 summit that starts in Germany on Sunday that the Fifa bribery scandal must be a trigger for international action against corruption.  The prime minister will criticise what he will call a widespread “taboo” in pointing the finger at corrupt institutions, and will say the Fifa scandal has shown how focusing on an organisation can provide the impetus for cleaning-up operations.  “In the last fortnight we have seen the stark truth about Fifa. The body governing football has faced appalling allegations that suggests it is absolutely riddled with corruption. And Blatter’s resignation this week presents an opportunity to clean up the game we love. It is also an opportunity to learn a broader lesson about tackling corruption,” he will say.  “Just as with Fifa, we know the problem is there, but there is something of an international taboo over pointing the finger and stirring up concerns.” Cameron’s intervention comes amid fears that the US investigation that has led to 47 racketeering charges against 18 football officials could lead to international tensions, with a Russia-led coalition ranged against the west. The FBI is looking into the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar.  Before meetings with Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and other major country leaders, Cameron will say: “Corruption is the arch-enemy of democracy and development. At international summits, leaders meet to talk about aid, economic growth and how to keep our people safe. But we just don’t talk enough about corruption. This has got to change. We have to show some of the same courage that exposed Fifa and break the taboo on talking about corruption.  “Corruption is the cancer at the heart of so many of the problems we face around the world today. It doesn’t just threaten our prosperity, it also undermines our security.  “Football is beginning a long journey to rid itself of corruption and it will take time, courage and determination to see through the reforms that Fifa needs. I believe world leaders must show the same courage and determination to tackle corruption around the globe,” the prime minister will say.  Amid fallout from the Fifa scandal, the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, said its outgoing president, Sepp Blatter, will be forced out of the job within a “couple of months” and predicted he will ultimately be arrested. “The great danger now is you get Blatter Mark II. It needs a root-and-branch change of the structure of the organisation. Blatter won’t lead that reform, he can’t do it,” said Dyke in a Guardian interview.  The FA chairman also definitively drew a line under suggestions that England could host the 2018 or 2022 World Cup if there was a re-vote, despite speculation by MPs and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London. Dyke insisted the 2018 and 2022 votes would have to be revisited if clear evidence of corruption was found by the FBI or Swiss prosecutors. Cameron is examining how anti-corruption targets for the G7 countries can be included with more traditional measures of success such as fighting infant mortality. The G7 has long seen one of its roles as fighting corruption, but commitments to act in communiques do not always lead to visible action. In the case of Fifa, there is little evidence that aid programmes have been at the centre of the corruption but there are claims that governments have been willing to offer bribes and huge trade deals to secure tournaments in their home country. It is notable that it took the FBI, rather than governments in the countries concerned, to act decisively on allegations of corruption that had been hanging over Fifa for decades. It’s not expected that the G7, made up of France, Italy, Germany, the US, Canada, Japan and Britain, will say anything specific collectively about whether the 2018 World Cup should be withdrawn from Russia. Few specific allegations have yet been made about the Russian government trying to bribe Fifa officials to secure the World Cup. During a disputed Fifa internal investigation, the Russians said relevant emails had been lost.  The G7 withdrew membership of its exclusive club from Russia last year following the Russian-backed rebellion in eastern Ukraine. It appears Russia will be permanently excluded, with fighting flaring again in eastern Ukraine and the issue of further sanctions against Russia is bound to be raised. The prime minister will also lead a further review of the British aid programme to see if more can be done to ensure UK aid is not being siphoned off by corrupt politicians or bankers around the world. Under Cameron the UK aid budget is held steady at 0.7 % of UK gross national income.  Cameron plans to hold a meeting with Obama at the summit, the first he will have held with the US president since January when he went to the White House ahead of the UK general election. At that meeting, Fifa may also be discussed. The two men are likely to discuss the fight against Isis in Syria and Iraq, including signs that Isis is making continued military progress close to Baghdad, and in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad.  Britain has been supporting the bombing in Iraq but not in Syria. Cameron is not expected to raise the issue of his plans to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU with either Merkel or with the French president, François Hollande. He has held bilateral meetings with both leaders to discuss Europe since his election. Cameron, accused by some American commentators of effectively leaving the world stage, is going to reassure Obama that he will be a more engaged world leader in the years ahead. Obama, himself a reluctant interventionist, will want to know whether Cameron will maintain a strong British military presence, symbolised by the UK commitment to spending 2% of UK GDP on defence.  The summit is also expected to discuss funding programmes to combat medical epidemics such as Ebola, the risk of a Greek exit from the euro, and climate change."

"This week sees governments meeting in Bonn, Germany for the last negotiating session in advance of November’s UN meeting on climate change in Paris – billed as the best chance in a generation for a worldwide treaty to tackle global warming. The omens are better than for many years. The political landscape was changed dramatically by last November’s China-US emissions deal. With the world’s two biggest emitters covered, other pledges have been arriving thick and fast: the task for Paris will be to forge them into a global agreement with legal force.  The other major issue under discussion in Bonn is finance, in particular how the commitment to providing developing countries $100bn (£65bn) a year by 2020 for climate adaptation and mitigation can be funded. One of the strongest and most morally charged voices in this arena is the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), who are most vulnerable to sea level rise and other climate impacts. But this is where the problems start. The chair of Aosis is currently the Maldives, a country of hundreds of coral atolls, none of them more than a metre above sea level. The Maldives shot to global attention in 2009, when its charismatic president Mohamed Nasheed held an underwater cabinet meeting to raise awareness of his nation’s plight, and later pledged to make his country the world’s first carbon neutral state.  Nasheed personally took on the might of China and the US in the climactic closed-door heads of state meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. He then defended the deal from the conference floor when other world leaders had already jetted home, salvaging some positives from a process that was otherwise headed towards total collapse. (I was climate adviser to President Nasheed during that time.) However, the Maldives is no longer represented by Nasheed, who was ousted in a coup in 2012 and later lost a rigged presidential election to the half brother of the former dictator. Nasheed was recently arrested, tried and sentenced to 13 years in prison following a politically-motivated trial Amnesty International decried as a “travesty of justice”. He is currently languishing in an unsanitary jail with highly restricted access to medical care, legal representation or visits from his wife and young children.  The Maldives’ new autocratic leadership has gutted the country’s democratic institutions and imprisoned every political opposition leader. The authoritarian president Abdullah Yameen has ditched the carbon neutral pledge and plans instead to drill for oil in the Maldives’ pristine coral-fringed waters. Yet this is the voice, as chair of Aosis, now supposedly representing the moral force of small island states at the international climate negotiations.  Having some of the most vulnerable countries in the world representated by authoritarian regimes presents the world with a dilemma. Should demands from these countries for billions of dollars’ worth of climate aid be heeded, when minimum standards of good governance are ignored and human rights are trampled?  In the Maldives, Yameen’s ministers have been accused of links with international gangsters and drug-dealers. Corruption is endemic, while journalists have been threatened, beaten and disappeared. Islamic extremism, meanwhile, is thriving, with hundreds of Maldivians reportedly traveling to Syria to join Islamic State. The problem was recognised by Nasheed when in office. Sharing his concerns over the possible channeling of western climate aid through corrupt governments in developing countries, he said: “The money is rarely spent on what it should be. Even that which isn’t stolen is spent on the wrong thing. The contract is given to a minister’s relative, rather than to a reputable company.” This is not a call to reduce the amount of aid pledged in Paris: the $100bn target has been agreed and should be met. But there is surely now a strong case for setting up procedures to enforce minimum standards of accountability for countries aiming to draw from these funds. There are plenty of Aosis members and other vulnerable nations that respect democracy, human rights and good governance, from Barbados to Cape Verde to Samoa. These countries should be first in the queue, while nations like the Maldives that slip backwards into autocracy and corruption should be excluded from accessing climate finance support. In the meantime, Aosis should come to its senses and realise that it is damaging the interests of small island states worldwide to have its collective voice represented by a regime that crushes democracy and imprisons opposition leaders. Human rights and climate change cannot be traded off against each other. It is because human rights and dignity are accepted as universal values that there is a moral case for climate finance in the first place – to address the injustice of those suffering the worst climate impacts not being those who bear the most responsibility for global warming.  Morality is a double-edged sword – if you behave unjustly yourself you forfeit any claim to moral leadership. That is why the Maldives cannot represent climate leadership while an aspiring dictator remains at the helm. "
