"Billions of dollars of public money was sunk in new fossil fuel projects by the world’s major development banks in the year after the Paris climate change deal was agreed, according to campaigners who are calling for the banks to halt their financing of coal, oil and gas. The new analysis also reveals that some of the taxpayers’ money given to coal and gas projects was counted as “climate” finance.   Funding for fossil fuel projects from the six main international development banks totalled at least $5bn in 2016, according to a report from researchers at Oil Change International (OCI). In particular, OCI estimate the funding for exploration for new oil and gas more than doubled in 2016, to $2.1bn. Funding for clean energy also grew by more than a third, to $11.4bn.  A second report from analysts at E3G suggests that in recent years the World Bank and European Bank for Development and Reconstruction (EBRD) have given similar levels of funding to fossil fuels as to climate-friendly energy projects.  “Despite the Paris Agreement being reached, multilateral development banks that say all the right things on climate are still financing billions of dollars in oil, gas, and coal projects,” said Alex Doukas at Oil Change International. “They are using relatively scarce public resources that need to be used as strategically as possible if we have a hope of meeting the agreement’s aims. If they really want to help lift people out of poverty, taxpayer-funded banks can no longer finance climate destruction. They must stop funding fossil fuels.” Helena Wright at E3G said: “Development banks must do more to green their investments. As a first step, the banks should commit to ending finance for fossil fuel exploration. Obviously exploration for new resources is not in line with the Paris goals – we have got enough fossil fuels already to go over 2C of warming.”  Scientists showed in 2015 that to keep under the internationally agreed 2C warming limit, then most existing fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground. In July, the G20 nations were accused of hypocrisy for talking tough on global warming but providing four times more public finance for fossil fuels than for renewables. Wright also found that millions of dollars given by the EBRD for a coal port in Morocco were counted as climate finance on the grounds the port contributed to adaptation to climate change. In another example, millions of dollars given by the EBRD for an offshore gas exploration project in Azerbaijan were also counted as climate finance on the basis that it reduced emissions compared to baseline. “It seems a bit ridiculous,” she said. However, a spokesman for the EBRD said it strongly disagreed with the analysis in the new reports and the way in which the projects were categorised. He said the EBRD spent 2.7 times more on energy-related climate projects than on fossil fuels and that the analyses had not included lending that went to projects via partner banks. A World Bank spokesman also disputed the analyses and emphasised the bank’s clean investments: “Over the last five years, the World Bank Group has invested more than $11bn in renewable energy and $4.5bn in energy efficiency. We are now the largest multilateral provider of finance for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in developing countries.” Both of the new reports analysed the lending by the World Bank, EBRD, the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. The OCI report estimated significant rises in fossil fuel funding in 2016 by the Asian Development Bank, where it leapt fivefold, and at the World Bank. The E3G report judged the Inter-American Development Bank as the greenest, giving over five times more to climate-friendly energy projects between 2013 and 2015 than to fossil fuel schemes. Yongping Zhai, energy advisor at the Asian Development Bank, said: “ADB will continue to expand climate finance, while still providing access to energy in the most cost effective manner to support progress for developing countries. ADB’s financing to fossil fuel in 2016 was limited to natural gas, which is an important transition fuel, [with] lesser carbon.”"
"Tony Abbott titled his London speech on climate change “Daring to Doubt” – a challenge, if you will, to reject mountains of evidence and instead lick your fingers and shove them into the plug socket of denial. Go on, I dare you.  Throughout his speech, the former Australian prime minister urged listeners to think that dismissing decades of research backed by the world’s leading scientific institutions required bravery and fortitude, rather than other less celebrated human attributes. But what would constitute bravery for a conservative politician like Abbott? Changing your mind when the evidence tells you you’re dead wrong, or saying what you’ve always said, using the logical fallacies that you’ve always used? One step is brave, the other is cowardly. Abbott was giving the Global Warming Policy Foundation’s annual lecture – an “honour” previously bestowed on his spiritual and political mentors John Howard and Cardinal George Pell.  Nobody should be surprised that what we got was an absolute crap speech from a man who confessed he still thinks climate science is “absolute crap”. Abbott went for the whole canon of tired climate science denial talking points – carbon dioxide is just food for plants, the climate has always changed, it’s the sun – in what constituted a warmed-up meal of misinformation with a side order of supercilious gravy. Several leading Australian climate scientists have hit back. How tired they must get of debunking this stuff. Abbott’s speech was also chock-full of internal contradictions. He suggested a conspiracy to tamper with temperature readings, but admitted the globe was warming. He described carbon dioxide as a “trace gas” and dismissed its role in warming, but elsewhere thought warming (which might not be happening) would be good. And the “trace gas” is insignificant, but not when it comes to its ability to “green the planet” and help plants grow.  Professor Steve Sherwood, deputy director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, read the speech and said it was “the usual mix of misdirection, falsehoods and tirades against ‘brigades’ who supposedly say this and that but are never clearly identified”. The @thegwpfcom wouldn't let me attend @TonyAbbottMHR's speech. But here's what he said https://t.co/cutUHcZZ4L pic.twitter.com/peDjtdveC4 Abbott told the thinktank – which had denied requests from seasoned climate reporters to attend – that past climate changes that occurred millions of years ago showed there was nothing to worry about now. “Abbott is trying to hide the fact that it is the scientists themselves – who know more about past climate changes than he does – who are sounding the alarm,” said Sherwood. The former prime minister confined his scientific missteps to seven or eight paragraphs in the middle of his speech.  Professor Mark Howden, director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, said Abbott’s claim that other factors, such as sunspots cycles or wobbles in the Earth’s orbit could be just as important as carbon dioxide, was simply false. “The evidence that our climate is changing due to human activity is overwhelming,” said Howden. “2016 was globally the hottest year on record, surpassing the 2015 record, surpassing the 2014 record. There is 99.999% certainty that humans are driving the observed temperature rises via greenhouse gas emissions.” Abbott’s claim that “no big change has accompanied the increase in carbon dioxide concentration” was “problematic”, said Howden, given “research shows that the world has already warmed by approximately 1C since pre-industrial times”. “We are already experiencing changed patterns of rainfall, more and more days with extreme temperatures, increasingly intense natural disasters and rising sea levels, impacting on almost all facets of life in Australia.” Professor Andrew Pitman, director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, said while it was true that CO2 is essential to life, “life also requires many trace elements that at higher concentrations are toxic”. “It is a myth to imply that because CO2 is essential to life, more of it is good.” Abbott also deployed another favourite talking point from climate science misinformers – that warming (which, remember, he thinks might not be happening) will cut the number of people dying of cold.  Pitman said this argument, too, was misleading, saying: “It is true that in rich countries which tend to be in the mid to higher latitudes, some warming might help reduce deaths from cold. In the lower latitude countries – the subtropics and tropics – people rarely die of cold. In contrast they die of heat and lack of clean water.  “So, countries responsible for global warming might gain a minor benefit from warming while those least responsible will wear the consequences.”  Dr Liz Hanna, an expert on the impacts of climate change on human health, said human-caused warming was already implicated in the deaths of many thousands. “In 2003, 70,000 people died in western Europe, and in 2010 a further 55,000 people died in Russia and eastern Europe. These figures far exceed deaths from cold snaps. The decade 2001-2010 saw a 2,300% increase in heat deaths above the previous decade. Mr Abbott’s assertions don’t tell the whole story, as they’re based on what has happened in the past rather than what is projected to happen in future. While more people die from cold than heat in Melbourne at the moment, this will reverse as more summer days reach the high 40s.” Away from his errors on the evidence, Abbott tried to characterise climate science and environmentalism as being hamstrung by a religious-type fervour that gets in the way of “common sense”. Abbott said: Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. Beware the pronouncement, ‘the science is settled’. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that ‘99% of scientists believe’ as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. As a Roman Catholic libertarian free market ideologue, Abbott is, presumably, immune to such group think. Climate scientist Ben Henley, of the University of Melbourne, also spots Abbott’s facile argument. In an email he told me: “By implication, Abbott superstitiously questions the foundations of science, and in doing so, he questions the same scientific method which discovered wifi and penicillin, and proved the Earth was not flat. “Abbott presents an absurdly and intentionally distorted viewpoint, reminiscent of a conspiracy theorist.” Abbott’s attitude to climate change seems to rest on a Boy’s Own “who dares wins” approach to policy that’s neither brave or daring. It’s stupid.  Graham Readfearn is the Guardian’s Planet Oz opinion columnist"

"Global leaders must do more to protect indigenous people fighting to protect their land and way of life if the world is to limit climate change, according to the UN special rapporteur Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. Speaking ahead of key climate talks in Bonn next month she urged politicians to recognise that indigenous communities around the world were the most effective custodians of millions of hectares of forest “which act as the world’s lungs”.  “Indigenous people’s rights need to be protected in the best way possible, not just for them but because they are also able to provide solutions to many of the world’s problems from climate change to biological diversity.  “It is in the self interest of states and even corporations in the medium and long term to protect and listen to these people – the question is, will they realise this in time?” said Tauli-Corpuz. A recent study found that a quarter of the carbon stored above ground in the world’s tropical forests is found in the collectively managed territories of indigenous peoples and local communities. In Brazil, deforestation in indigenous community forests from 2000 to 2012 was less than 1%, compared to 7% outside those areas. “They are the most effective stewards of these key areas,” said Tauli-Corpuz. “The needs of these indigenous people are converging with the wider environmental needs to protect these areas.” Indigenous people are locked in fierce conflicts with mining, logging and agricultural companies and their private security firms in hundreds of places from Indonesia to Brazil. 2016 was the deadliest year on record for land rights defenders with about 200 people killed in conflicts in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In addition, thousands more community activists were threatened or harassed. A Guardian project working with Global Witness is highlighting the pressure many of these groups face and has identified at least 134 people who have been killed so far this year. Tauli-Corpuz, who was speaking at the launch of a new global institution dedicated to securing the land rights of tens of millions of indigenous people, said there was an atmosphere of fear and intimidation in many of these communities. The event in Stockholm was the official launch of the International Land and Forest Tenure Facility which aims to help communities protect their land resources as well as combat climate change. Funded by Sweden, Norway and the Ford Foundation, a US charity, the Tenure Facility, has already provided grants and guidance for pilot projects in six nations. The Ford Foundation president Darren Walker said it was an important development in the fight against climate change and inequality. “Creating mechanisms that allow indigenous peoples and local communities to gain tenure over their land or forests is a way to tackle both these problems.” The Ford Foundation has pledged $5m, and Norway has announced a grant of $20m over the coming years. Sweden pitched in $10m during the pilot phase and will fund future projects. Walker said he expects donations to rise to $100m overall within a year. The project aims to boost forestland properly titled to indigenous peoples by 40m hectares, an area twice the size of Spain, within a decade. Organisers say this would prevent deforestation of 1m hectares and the release of 500m tonnes of CO2, more than the annual emissions of Britain or Brazil. Indigenous leaders representing tens of millions of people involved in land disputes in Asia, Africa and South America attended the conference. They said the tenure programme was an important step towards stopping the persecution of indigenous communities – but warned more needs to be done. Rukka Sombolinggi, the first female secretary-general of the world’s largest indigenous organisation, Aman, which represents 17 million people in Indonesia, said: “Our houses are being burnt down, people are being killed, tortured, and sent to jail as we speak.” Sombolinggi said some progress had been made, with much of the forests where indigenous communities live in Indonesia mapped for the first time. And she said “dominant communities” would benefit, not only environmentally from more rights for indigenous people, but argued they could also learn important lessons from the way many of these groups lived. “If we want to see the beautiful centuries ahead … we need to shift our paradigm of what constitutes wealth or prosperity because too many people see happiness only in terms of material goods and achievements and it is having a devastating impact. Many of us have lost our ability to connect with natural things and no longer seem able to live in harmony with the simple happiness around us.”"
"Earlier this summer, a paper published in the journal Nature captured headlines with a rather bleak forecast. Our chances of keeping global warming below the 2C danger threshold are very, very small: only about 5%. The reason, according to the paper’s authors, is that the cuts we’re making to greenhouse gas emissions are being cancelled out by economic growth.  In the coming decades, we’ll be able to reduce the carbon intensity of the global economy by about 1.9% per year, if we make heavy investments in clean energy and efficient technology. That’s a lot. But as long as the economy keeps growing by more than that, total emissions are still going to rise. Right now we’re ratcheting up global GDP by 3% per year, which means we’re headed for trouble.  If we want to have any hope of averting catastrophe, we’re going to have to do something about our addiction to growth. This is tricky, because GDP growth is the main policy objective of virtually every government on the planet. It lies at the heart of everything we’ve been told to believe about how the economy should work: that GDP growth is good, that it’s essential to progress, and that if we want to improve human wellbeing and eradicate poverty around the world, we need more of it. It’s a powerful narrative. But is it true? Maybe not. Take Costa Rica. A beautiful Central American country known for its lush rainforests and stunning beaches, Costa Rica proves that achieving high levels of human wellbeing has very little to do with GDP and almost everything to do with something very different. Every few years the New Economics Foundation publishes the Happy Planet Index – a measure of progress that looks at life expectancy, wellbeing and equality rather than the narrow metric of GDP, and plots these measures against ecological impact. Costa Rica tops the list of countries every time. With a life expectancy of 79.1 years and levels of wellbeing in the top 7% of the world, Costa Rica matches many Scandinavian nations in these areas and neatly outperforms the United States. And it manages all of this with a GDP per capita of only $10,000 (£7,640), less than one fifth that of the US.  In this sense, Costa Rica is the most efficient economy on earth: it produces high standards of living with low GDP and minimal pressure on the environment.  How do they do it? Professors Martínez-Franzoni and Sánchez-Ancochea argue that it’s all down to Costa Rica’s commitment to universalism: the principle that everyone – regardless of income – should have equal access to generous, high-quality social services as a basic right. A series of progressive governments started rolling out healthcare, education and social security in the 1940s and expanded these to the whole population from the 50s onward, after abolishing the military and freeing up more resources for social spending.  Costa Rica wasn’t alone in this effort, of course. Progressive governments elsewhere in Latin America made similar moves, but in nearly every case the US violently intervened to stop them for fear that “communist” ideas might scupper American interests in the region. Costa Rica escaped this fate by outwardly claiming to be anti-communist and – horribly – allowing US-backed forces to use the country as a base in the contra war against Nicaragua.  The upshot is that Costa Rica is one of only a few countries in the global south that enjoys robust universalism. It’s not perfect, however. Relatively high levels of income inequality make the economy less efficient than it otherwise might be. But the country’s achievements are still impressive. On the back of universal social policy, Costa Rica surpassed the US in life expectancy in the late 80s, when its GDP per capita was a mere tenth of America’s. Today, Costa Rica is a thorn in the side of orthodox economics. The conventional wisdom holds that high GDP is essential for longevity: “wealthier is healthier”, as former World Bank chief economist Larry Summers put it in a famous paper. But Costa Rica shows that we can achieve human progress without much GDP at all, and therefore without triggering ecological collapse. In fact, the part of Costa Rica where people live the longest, happiest lives – the Nicoya Peninsula – is also the poorest, in terms of GDP per capita. Researchers have concluded that Nicoyans do so well not in spite of their “poverty”, but because of it – because their communities, environment and relationships haven’t been ploughed over by industrial expansion.  All of this turns the usual growth narrative on its head. Henry Wallich, a former member of the US Federal Reserve Board, once pointed out that “growth is a substitute for redistribution”. And it’s true: most politicians would rather try to rev up the GDP and hope it trickles down than raise taxes on the rich and redistribute income into social goods. But a new generation of thinkers is ready to flip Wallich’s quip around: if growth is a substitute for redistribution, then redistribution can be a substitute for growth.  Costa Rica provides a hopeful model for any country that wants to chart its way out of poverty. But it also holds an important lesson for rich countries. Scientists tell us that if we want to avert dangerous climate change, high-consuming nations – like Britain and the US – are going to have to scale down their bloated economies to get back in sync with the planet’s ecology, and fast. A widely-cited paper by scientists at the University of Manchester estimates it’s going to require downscaling of 4-6% per year.  This is what ecologists call “de-growth”. This calls for redistributing existing resources and investing in social goods in order to render growth unnecessary. Decommoditising and universalising healthcare, education and even housing would be a step in the right direction. Another would be a universal basic income – perhaps funded by taxes on carbon, land, resource extraction and financial transactions.  The opposite of growth isn’t austerity, or depression, or voluntary poverty. It is sharing what we already have, so we won’t need to plunder the earth for more. Costa Rica proves that rich countries could theoretically ease their consumption by half or more while maintaining or even increasing their human development indicators. Of course, getting there would require that we devise a new economic system that doesn’t require endless growth just to stay afloat. That’s a challenge, to be sure, but it’s possible. After all, once we have excellent healthcare, education, and affordable housing, what will endlessly more income growth gain us? Maybe bigger TVs, flashier cars, and expensive holidays. But not more happiness, or stronger communities, or more time with our families and friends. Not more peace or more stability, fresher air or cleaner rivers. Past a certain point, GDP gains us nothing when it comes to what really matters. In an age of climate change, where the pursuit of ever more GDP is actively dangerous, we need a different approach."
"It was well that Tony Abbott gave his climate change denying speech this week in London, because his thinking betrays a bizarre Euro-centric conservative outlook that constantly ignores multiple studies that show Australia’s economy will suffer greatly from climate change.  His speech to the Global Warming Policy Foundation was a typical Abbott speech: a greatest hits of climate change denying canards that collapsed under its own lack of internal logic.   It was redolent of the shallow conservative thinking that unfortunately dominates far too much Australian commentary – especially when it comes to climate change.  They think climate change is a myth but it doesn’t matter because global warming will be good because, as Abbott put it, “far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves”.  And as with most dull conservative thinking in Australia, it is a very European perspective that oddly would have you believe that Australia is located nearer to Austria than Asia.  The idea that increased temperatures may have some positive aspect for colder parts of the world is neither new nor insightful. The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change noted that, in higher latitudes, “cold-related deaths will decrease” as a result of warming .  And if you stop there – as in effect Abbott did – all sounds good. But the report’s next sentence notes climate change will “increase worldwide deaths from malnutrition and heat stress”. Climate change is much easier to stomach when you ignore the fate of a majority of the world’s population. Abbott’s weird approach of viewing climate change as though we live in some snowbound country is the type of thinking that leads to the Carmichael coalmine despite a lack of financial viability and great environmental negatives.  The Australian’s Paul Maley, for example, responded to Abbott’s speech in praise-worthy tones, suggesting it was “was a thoughtful speech that deserved to be taken seriously”. He suggested that Abbott raised many good questions but that “a richer vein would have been the inherent tension between poverty reduction and climate mitigation measures”. He is right, but wrong in picking what that tension is.  The argument offered by Maley is one that echoes Abbott and other conservatives such as Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan that industrialisation powers economic growth and thus it would be wrong for us to deny this to other nations.  Maley argues that “this begs an awkward question: are we really opposed to climate change in all its forms? What if coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef is the price we must pay for affordable energy in south Asia? What if renewables, for all their promise, can’t provide the horsepower required to lift millions out of poverty?” It is a line of thinking that writer Richard Cooke recently suggested to me involves shouting how Greenies want us to go back to horses and carts, while at the same time arguing that we can only ever use 19th century modes of power generation. Not only will Australia suffer much more from climate change than just coral bleaching but the economies of south Asia are going to be hit harder than just about anywhere else.  In a nice bit of timing, the day after Abbott’s speech, the IMF released its latest World Economic Outlook, which contained a chapter on the economic impact of climate change.  The reported noted (much as the Stern review did) that climate change may actually have some positive economic affects for countries in colder parts of the world.  The IMF noted rising temperatures have “uneven macroeconomic effects”. If you live in a place where the climate is colder, warmer temperatures may actually lead to increased crop production.  But the report also notes that there will be “adverse consequences concentrated in countries with relatively hot climates, such as most low-income countries”. The IMF argues that in these countries climate change will lead to lower per capita output, in both the short and medium term. Even worse, they suggest the effect will be “long-lasting” and widespread. “[It] operates through several channels: lower agricultural output, depressed labour productivity in sectors more exposed to the weather, reduced capital accumulation and poorer human health”. And just in case you were hoping the problem might be able to be mitigated, the IMF found that “data indicate that macroeconomic outcomes have not become any less sensitive to temperature shocks in recent years, pointing to significant adaptation constraints”. That is, such countries are not going to be able to just adapt to the higher temperatures and carry on as before.  It rather slaps down the faux altruistic excuse for supporting the Carmichael mine as being important to help India’s economy, given the IMF finds that India’s economy will be among those most affect by climate change.  But while you might think it doesn’t really affect us, it is worth noting that when the IMF talks of economies with “relatively hot climates’ it refers to “117 economies with average temperature greater than 15°C.” And among those 117 economies is a rather familiar island continent known as Australia.  While the economic output of the southern parts near the coast of Australia are projected to be relatively unaffected, the IMF projects significant output per capita drops for the rest of Australia. The agricultural areas will be hardest hit – something that you would think might worry the National party. We need to shift from treating our nation as though its climate is that of Europe. We like to think our economy is linked with Asia more than Europe; our climate certainly is and we need to act accordingly. "
"Planting forests and other activities that harness the power of nature could play a major role in limiting global warming under the 2015 Paris agreement, an international study showed on Monday.  Natural climate solutions, also including protection of carbon-storing peatlands and better management of soils and grasslands, could account for 37% of all actions needed by 2030 under the 195-nation Paris plan, it said.   Combined, the suggested “regreening of the planet” would be equivalent to halting all burning of oil worldwide, it said.  “Better stewardship of the land could have a bigger role in fighting climate change than previously thought,” the international team of scientists said of findings published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The estimates for nature’s potential, led by planting forests, were up to 30% higher than those envisaged by a UN panel of climate scientists in a 2014 report, it said.  Trees soak up heat-trapping carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when they burn or rot. That makes forests, from the Amazon to Siberia, vast natural stores of greenhouse gases.  Overall, better management of nature could avert 11.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year by 2030, the study said, equivalent to China’s current carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use.  The Paris climate agreement, weakened by US president Donald Trump’s decision in June to pull out, seeks to limit a rise in global temperature to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times.  Current government pledges to cut emissions are too weak to achieve the 2C goal, meant to avert more droughts, more powerful storms, downpours and heat waves.  “Fortunately, this research shows we have a huge opportunity to reshape our food and land use systems,” Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, said in a statement of Monday’s findings.  Climate change could jeopardise production of crops such as corn, wheat, rice and soy even as a rising global population will raise demand, he said.  The study said that some of the measures would cost $10 a tonne or less to avert a tonne of carbon dioxide, with others up to $100 a tonne to qualify as “cost-effective” by 2030.  “If we are serious about climate change, then we are going to have to get serious about investing in nature,” said Mark Tercek, chief executive officer of The Nature Conservancy, which led the study.

"The clownfish, the colourful swimmer propelled to fame by the 2003 film Finding Nemo, is under threat from warming ocean waters wreaking havoc with sea anemones, the structures that serve as its home, a study has found. Closely related to corals, sea anemones are invertebrate marine creatures that live in symbiosis with algae, which provide them with food, oxygen and colour. Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, in turn use the structures as shelter to lay their eggs and raise their young – keeping the anemones clean in return. For the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, a research team monitored 13 pairs of orange-fin anemonefish living among the coral reefs of Moorea Island in the South Pacific. They were monitored before, during and after the El Niño weather event that in 2016 caused major coral bleaching as the Pacific Ocean warmed. Half of the anemones in the study “bleached”, expelling the algae that live on them and turning bone white, the team found. This happens in response to environmental stress, such as ocean warming or pollution. “Among the clownfish living in the bleached anemones, the scientists observed a drastic fall (-73%) in the number of viable eggs,” said a statement from France’s CNRS research institute. “These fish were laying eggs less frequently and they were also laying fewer and less viable eggs.” No changes were observed among fish with unbleached abodes. Blood samples showed a sharp increase in levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the affected fish, and a “significant drop” in sex hormones that determine fertility, the team reported. The health of the anemones and the fish improved three to four months after the end of the warming event. Further research is needed, the team said, to examine the effects of a longer, or more intense, warming period, and whether affected fish would deal better or worse with a new bleaching episode. Exceptional ocean warming events are predicted to become more frequent as the average global temperature rises. Nearly 200 nations agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement to limit warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over industrial levels. A level of about 1C has already been reached and scientists fear the ceiling will be shattered, with potentially disastrous consequences for the Earth’s climate. In June last year, a study said many of the real-life Nemos swimming in children’s fish tanks around the world were caught using cyanide – another threat to the species. Finding Nemo, the movie about the quest of a young fish separated from its family, resulted in more than a million clownfish being harvested from tropical reefs as pets."
"Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions, citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith, a solar geoengineering (GE) expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions, at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement.   “One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have, is that Trump might tweet ‘geoengineering solves everything – we don’t have to bother about emissions.’ That would break the slow-moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense,” Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference (CEC) in Berlin.  Indeed, utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration – most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has referred to climate change as “just an engineering problem” – make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year, Keith, a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection, involving launching a high-altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE, an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space, adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans, pumping deep cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques – roughly-speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR, or negative emission technologies) which removes greenhouse gases, and solar-radiation management (SRM or solar geoengineering) which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet – could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However, the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This week’s conference drew attention to the huge risks involved. “All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts,” said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the world’s poorest.  “They also ignore the question as to why there’s not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction,” she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification, a change in weather patterns, a rapid rise in temperatures, and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land, all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees.   But scientists such as Keith, and Mark Lawrence, scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam, argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less, almost impossible to achieve, the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster. “It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering,” Lawrence said. “It’s not impossible, but it’s hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary.”  Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs, or else see the importance of decades of their life’s work evaporate. “At the best climate engineering is a supplement, and it could be that we shouldn’t do it,” he insisted. “Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didn’t work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work, that it’s there if we need it. But let’s say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering, then I would say ‘abandon it’. That would be great. I’d love to publish that.”      "

"As a Caribbean climate scientist, I am often asked to speak about how climate change affects small islands. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, one of two category five storms to batter the eastern Caribbean in just a week, three words resonate in my mind. The first word is “unfamiliar”. Scientific analysis shows that the climate of the Caribbean region is already changing in ways that seem to signal the emergence of a new climate regime. Irma and Maria fit this pattern all too well. At no point in the historical records dating back to the late 1800s have two category five storms made landfall in the small Caribbean island chain of the eastern Antilles in a single year.  The intensification almost overnight from a tropical storm to a category five hurricane and the devastating intensity that lingered for several days are also unfamiliar, even to a region that is used to seeing hurricanes. Alongside other emerging climate patterns, there is a strong case to be made that there is something unfamiliar about the Caribbean’s climate today. We are seeing repeated and prolonged droughts, an increase in the number of very hot days, intense rainfall events causing repeated localised flooding, and rising sea levels that are consuming the beautiful beaches on which tourism in our region depends. The problem with unfamiliarity is that daily existence in the Caribbean is built on familiar patterns of climate. Our economies are premised on industries and sectors that are extremely sensitive to climate variations, such as tourism and agriculture. In a year that follows expected patterns and pulls no surprises, we see favourable economic growth and improvements in our quality of life. Even when we’ve seen bad weather, we have always had a certain familiarity with the limits of how bad it can be. Until now, newer infrastructure in the Caribbean has largely withstood the ravages of hurricanes and tropical storms, as their design has accounted for the upper bounds of extreme weather experienced in the past. Irma and Maria threw out the notion of planning and preparedness based on the expected and the familiar. Their ferocity destroyed even the strongest evacuation shelters and brought devastation of catastrophic proportions to our tiny islands. Just as climate change is heralding in an era marked by the unfamiliar, we need a paradigm shift in our approach to development planning in highly vulnerable regions.  The second word that comes to mind is “unprecedented”. A business-as-usual scenario without global action suggests that by the end of the current century, the Caribbean region will warm a further 2-3C over the 1C already seen in the last century. We project annual rainfall amounts will decrease by up to 40%, posing a significant challenge to already water stressed islands. Projections also show sea levels rising by 1-2 metres, far exceeding the rise already recorded.  Most frighteningly, given our experience in the last few weeks, is the expectation that we will see more of the strongest tropical Atlantic hurricanes (though not necessarily more overall). Cumulatively, the science of projections suggests that the region’s climate will be altered beyond recognition. This is to say, it will be outside the bounds of our lived experience to date. It will not just be unfamiliar at times, it may be unprecedented all the time.  The stocktaking is hardly complete from Irma and Maria. Yet for Barbuda and Dominica at least, the setback to their economies will be measured in years. The initial estimates for rebuilding are staggering. Perhaps even more heartbreaking is the loss of those things that are economically unquantifiable. The drastic reductions in living standards, especially for the most vulnerable, that will continue for months to come. The loss of irreplaceable culture and cultural assets, the mental anguish and loss of lives, the loss of biodiversity, and the destruction of “island life” as we know it. The small island of Barbuda, for the first time in 300 years, has no human inhabitants. They were all evacuated after the devastation wreaked by Irma and in anticipation of Jose and Maria. This seems to portend the challenge that climate change represents for the Caribbean region – a challenge that becomes more acute as the era of the unprecedented is ushered in faster than the region can prepare for its onset. Finally, the third word that comes to mind is “urgent”. Admirably, although the Caribbean islands are minuscule emitters of greenhouse gases, they have made bold commitments regarding future use. But in the end, the future viability of the region is premised on collective global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is for this reason that the Caribbean and other small island and developing states have argued for a limit to global warming of 1.5C. It is this message that must reach the global community when they see the images of Irma and Maria. For those in the Caribbean, the lessons are all too clear.  • Dr Michael Taylor is a physicist based at the University of the West Indies"
"Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has suggested climate change is “probably doing good” in a speech in London in which he likened policies to combat it to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods” .  Abbott delivered the annual lecture to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), a climate sceptic thinktank on Monday evening. The Guardian and several other media outlets were blocked from attending the event but a copy of the speech was later circulated.  Abbott told the group the ostracisation of those who did not accept climate science was “the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”.  Measures to deal with climate change, which Abbott said would damage the economy, were likened to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. “At least so far,” he said, “it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm. Climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm.” “There’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide – which is a plant food after all – are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial.”  When he was prime minister, Abbott said he took the issue of climate change “very seriously”. But since he was deposed as prime minister by his Liberal party colleague and bête noire Malcolm Turnbull in 2015, Abbott has returned to many hardline views he had tempered as leader. He told the GWPF Australia needed “evidence-based policy rather than policy-based evidence” and took aim at a 2013 study that showed that 97% of scientists agree humans are driving climate change, “as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts”. Climate change and energy policy has been a divisive issue in Australia for more than a decade, with Abbott consistently at the centre of the division. From the backbench, Abbott has pushed the Turnbull government to reject policies that would favour renewable energy. In his speech, Abbott blamed Turnbull’s failure to campaign on energy prices during 2016 for the narrowing of the government’s majority at that year’s election. “After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties,” Abbott said. On Monday the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, indicated the government did not intend to follow its chief scientist’s recommendation that it should implement a clean energy target. Abbott welcomed that news in London, calling it “belated”. “Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely better than futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s,” Abbott said. Recent research from the Australia Institute found the country was the only wealthy nation still breaking energy emissions records. The GWPF is chaired by Nigel Lawson, who served as Margaret Thatcher’s treasurer. Lawson has been an outspoken critic of climate science and recently incorrectly told the BBC the global temperature had slightly declined in the past decade. The BBC was heavily criticised for leaving his assertions unchallenged. John Hewson, who led the Liberal party from 1990 to 1994, said Abbott’s speech to Lawson’s group “sees him in like-minded, if disturbingly deluded, company”. “Tony Abbott has had a long history of playing short-term politics, for his own political benefit, with the existential threat posed by a rapidly changing climate,” Hewson said. “Abbott was effective in opposition – a man of nope rather than hope. His basic thrust is that if you can’t understand it, don’t believe it, or accept it. When it comes to climate, and the magnitude and urgency of the challenge, Abbott is prepared to deny the undeniable, and to ignore the risks and costs if left to future generations. History will undoubtedly judge Abbott and Howard and their small band of deniers harshly. When they could have acted on climate and emissions they failed as leaders, miserably.” Abbott’s speech – titled Daring to Doubt – contained echoes of his mentor and prime ministerial predecessor John Howard, who gave the same annual lecture to the GWPF four years ago. In 2013 Howard said climate “zealots” had turned the issue into a “substitute religion”. Abbott, who trained to be a Catholic priest, called climate change a “post-Christian theology” and said the decline of religion in society had left a hole in which other forms of “dogma” could take root.  A Lancet study in 2015 supports Abbott’s claim that more people die from cold weather than hot. But the World Health Organisation has found that by 2050, climate change will cause 250,000 extra people to die each year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. Abbott went on to deny many of the central findings of the UN’s climate science body and claimed, without providing evidence, that climate records had been “adjusted” and data sets “slanted”. “Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s,” Abbott said. “Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. “More than 100 years of photography at Manly beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent.” Scientists often refrain from linking single weather events to climate change, saying only that they fit with what they expect to see more of because of climate change. But as the Earth warms and scientist better understand climate change, weather extremes have been shown to have been made more likely due to greenhouse gas pollution. In Australia, the record hot winter just passed was made 60 times more likely by climate change. Researchers have also linked warming sea temperatures to the catastrophic rainfall and flooding that killed 35 people in Australia in 2011. Sea level rise is one of the least controversial aspects of climate science. It is progressing at 3.4mm per year globally, according to the Australian government’s Ozcoasts website. Perhaps not enough to appear in photographs against other variables, such as daily tides, but over time scientists agree this will cause problems with coastal housing and infrastructure. The Guardian asked repeatedly for an invitation to attend the event. Abbott’s spokesperson said the speech was “not considered a media event”. The Guardian understands the Times of London was invited to attend and excerpts of the speech were distributed to News Corp newspapers in Australia.

"It would be tempting to laugh at Tony Abbott’s feelings about how carbon dioxide is secretly good for humanity, and his insights into the goat sacrificing habits of primitives subduing volcano gods – except it isn’t that funny. The London outing is more strange and sad, and the strangeness and the sadness manifests itself on multiple fronts.  Let’s start with strange. The bloke who hobnobbed with the climate sceptics at Global Warming Policy Foundation is the same bloke who took a decision as prime minister to sign Australia up to the Paris international climate agreement. He’s also the same bloke who produced a set of initiatives in government which was badged as a policy to incentivise emissions reductions. That policy still exists and it’s called Direct Action. He’s also the same bloke who kept Australia’s renewable energy target, while abolishing the mechanism designed to give the market certainty to make future investments in baseload power generation. Abbott has a whole lot of feelings, and some loyal media megaphones to help him spread his singular insights, but these are basic facts he can’t escape. Abbott’s record in government points to him being a “warmist” (as Andrew Bolt is fond of characterising the modest band of weirdos who don’t think they know better than the world’s most eminent climate scientists). London’s hardcore climate sceptics, frankly, should have laughed him out of the room. Now let’s get to sad. Abbott’s climate frolic isn’t about a substantive issue. It’s about politics, because Australians haven’t had quite enough of politics, right? Abbott wants to cause a ruckus. He wants to make enough ruckus to constrain Malcolm Turnbull from producing a sensible energy policy. The lightbulb moment he’s trying to manufacture for colleagues is simple: the Abbott rationale is we can win the next election like I won the election in 2013 – by belting Labor on climate and energy policy. The country, the national interest, actually needs the major parties to come to terms and settle the climate wars which have generated the current problems we are all experiencing in the energy market, and settle them in sensible fashion. But politicians behind in the polls like to win elections. Put simply, Abbott’s pitch is an appeal to baser instincts – a pitch that prolonged polarisation serves the Coalition’s immediate interests. The former prime minister has also positioned himself in the public domain as a critical player in Turnbull’s ultimate settlement of energy policy, when the truth is all the heavy lifting on the new policy is happening completely outside Abbott’s orbit. The actual decision makers in the government are heads down bums up on the new investment framework, swerving around the many obstacles, trying to land something vaguely credible, which doesn’t blow up the Coalition. That’s the objective. Whether the government can produce something credible, given one of the core objectives has to be not blowing up the Coalition, is at this point seriously moot. Meanwhile, Abbott’s persistent wrecking tactics allow Labor to claim with a veneer of truth and credibility that the former prime minister is driving the government’s energy policy rather than Turnbull – elevating his status from fringe agitprop activist to centre-stage. In politics that sort of caper is called frontrunning, but I struggle for a word to adequately characterise that behaviour. Perhaps we can just keep it nice, and say cynical?"
"Last month, on these pages, I asked if you might get in touch with your questions and thoughts on population and climate change. You did – in some numbers. These generous contributions form the heart of the latest edition of We Need to Talk About …, our podcast featuring supporters’ voices, in which your concerns are addressed by a panel of Guardian journalists and experts. As a starting point, we used a Guardian article with an arresting headline: Want to fight climate change? Have fewer children. In the podcast, we hear from one of the academics who produced the research which this article refers to, but equally interesting were your responses to this issue, and the discussions they prompted in our studio.   That’s why we’ve decided to publish some of them here. While we aim to hear from lots of voices and include differing points of view on the podcast, a lack of time means we sometimes have to cut people short, or use one person to represent the views of several who have contacted us making similar points. Here, we can give members a bit more space to air their views. You can listen to the panel respond to them – our line-up is Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor; Lucy Lamble, the Guardian’s executive editor for global development, who often writes on and takes part in debates on global inequality; John Vidal, the multi-award winning former Guardian environment editor and Afua Hirsch, a writer and broadcaster for the Guardian and SkyNews among others, who has also worked in international development and the law.  But first gain a flavour of the concerns of your fellow readers below. Many of these questions appear in the podcast, while others influenced the direction in which we headed. The issue isn’t overpopulation – it’s poor resource allocation. We do not live in a world of lack, but of extreme waste and inefficiency. This is true of food, energy, land use and the financial system. The overpopulation argument is a way to once again deflect from real societal change that is needed, and instead focuses the discussion on families, usually poor families, having too many children. While it is likely that the Earth does have some sort of maximum carrying capacity, even that is not guaranteed with recent technological advancements such as vertical farming. The question is whether those technological advancements will be put to use to raise the standard of living for every human being on the planet, or are put towards continuing to line the pockets of the wealthiest individuals and their investors. To my mind, it is not the countries in Africa, or groups with a more traditional and much simpler way of life – such as Native people in North and South America, for instance – that have caused so many environmental problems, but the irrationality and consumerism of our western society. It is the fact that we consume without truly asking ourselves where all these goods come from, how they were produced, what the environmental impact is of producting all these mostly useless things. Unless we seriously address these questions, I cannot see any significant change or serious solution to climate change. I‘ve often noticed that some westerners, who have no agenda at all on any environmental question, are keen to invoke “overpopulation” as the main and only threat to survival on Earth. Is overpopulation just a convenient way for westerners to put the blame on Africans for the environmental threats we face? How can those with the largest carbon footprint be encouraged not to reproduce, when they are ones who make the greatest impact and have the greatest sense of entitlement? Pope Francis recently condemned climate change sceptics. He is passionate about protecting the planet and has called on everyone to care for creation, particularly as climate change disproportionately impacts the poor.  The Catholic church runs 25% of health and education systems worldwide and therefore, through its direct teaching and management, significantly reduces safe access to contraception for millions of women. No debate on controlling population growth and subsequent pollution can therefore exist without tackling this institutional barrier to action. Last year over 170 theologians issued a statement saying there was no reason for the Catholic church’s position against “artificial” contraception.  How does the panel feel the church can continue to do great work on this issue, yet continue to block safe access to contraception for some of the world’s poorest women? I am a gynaecologist working in Hong Kong, occasionally counselling women considering having another child. If someone is ambivalent about doing so, I add into the decision-making the idea that having more children impacts climate change. Since I was a teenager in the 1970s, I have believed it is a woman’s right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. Working as a volunteer in an African country where abortion is illegal, I have seen women saved from death after trying to procure an abortion themselves. They were lucky – the hospital was nearby, there were good doctors, antibiotics, surgery, and blood transfusion. In African countries where abortion is often illegal, an unmet need for contraception is also common. I applied for a volunteer job in northern Uganda where women having five to six children is the norm; when asked, they say they would have preferred three or four .  Donald Trump’s global gag rule which removes US aid from any NGO providing contraceptive advice, is a huge problem. Not only because maternal mortality due to abortion deaths will rise in Africa, but also because the UNFPA [UN population fund] will stop training midwives, and the resulting reduction in maternal mortality will diminish. In addition, there will be greater unmet need for contraception.  Do you think our society can reach the point where choosing to have fewer children as an essential carbon-cutting strategy is as widely understood as conserving energy? As a parent I would take a bullet for either of my two children. I’m certain almost all parents would do just about anything to ensure their kids have a decent life. Knowing this, I cannot help but feel that if young couples around the world have good information they will do the right thing. If they understand the ramifications of their family-size decisions on the quality of life – chance of survival even – of their children, then they will make the most loving, compassionate decision possible: to conceive no more than one child. I joined Population Matters, an organisation that promotes smaller family size and reduced consumption, to find like-minded people and put my energies into a worthwhile organisation. I appreciate the impact we are having on the environment, and am mindful of that. However, I have found people around me such as family, friends and colleagues are largely not interested, or suggest they should have the freedom to do as they please. How do we start making a difference? Also we seem to have failed with high-profile individuals, royals and celebrities in particular. So what happens now? We have to reduce the population, hopefully not by severe climate change, war or disease. China’s one-child solution would not be accepted by most people. What do experts suggest? It seems money has the only power over most people. Should we pay people not to have children? How do we get politicians to talk seriously about the links between population and climate change? The last three elections in the UK have barely mentioned the environment. Is there an agreement between the political parties to avoid this discussion?  I like children, but have never felt that I would like to have my own.  I am very regularly treated as odd for this decision, and feel that if we don’t open up the discussion about not having children, people will never consider this decision thoroughly, whether for the environment or other reasons. In the past three years, I have made a number of lifestyle changes in order to reduce my carbon footprint – which has only further cemented my feeling that I don’t want children. I often feel like I need to keep having what can be sometimes difficult conversations with people about this choice, so as to build conversation momentum around the subject. Alternative lifestyles need to be promoted. I would like to focus on supporting and improving the lives of people already on the planet.  I have made the decision to be childfree, largely due to environmental reasons. As a childfree person, I am constantly surprised how this decision is commonly questioned by others as being a poor or “selfish” choice when the evidence suggests that it is anything but.  Given the evidence that having fewer children isthe greatest decision one can make to combat climate change, do the panel think that society can switch from having a pro-reproduction stance, where policies promote reproduction and society views having children as the “correct” choice, to a neutral stance, where having children is considered optional and policies are made to promote other means of having a fulfilled life? "
"Tony Abbott has “left the realm of the merely destructive and entered the realm of the loopy”, Labor says, after his provocative speech arguing climate change was “probably doing good”. The deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said on Tuesday Abbott’s speech to a group of climate sceptics in London was “actually just weird stuff from the former prime minister” at a time when the government was trying to settle its energy policy.   While Abbott’s London outburst forced government colleagues into various acts of public diplomacy on Tuesday, one fellow conservative, the Sydney Liberal MP Craig Kelly, and chairman of the backbench committee on climate and energy, defended Abbott’s rationale. “The point that Tony makes is 100% correct, and the chief scientist has actually confirmed this, the chief scientist has said, no matter what we do here in Australia with our emissions, it’s not going to change the weather, it’s not going to change the temperature of the globe, it’s not going to prevent bad storms,” Kelly told Sky News. The government this week has continued to signal that it will not pursue the clean energy target modelled by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market published mid-year. Abbott has opposed the Finkel recommendation from the outset, branding further subsidies for renewables “unconscionable”, and, alongside fellow government conservative George Christensen, has threatened to cross the floor in the event the government attempts to legislate it. With the government working to finalise its policy and present it during the final parliamentary sitting weeks before the summer break, the energy minister Josh Frydenberg used an energy summit on Monday to argue low emissions technologies may not need further subsidies once the current renewable energy target winds down after 2020. That signal has rattled industry players, who had assumed the government was working on a modified version of the Finkel recommendation. As industry alarm about the government’s policy direction intensified, the chief scientist publicly defended his mechanism as being important to provide investor certainty. While the clean energy target has broad ranging support from industry, the energy sector and state governments, the heavily contested internal dynamics of the Coalition renders the Finkel recommendation hard to deliver. The government’s new energy policy is expected to include an overhaul of the national electricity market rules to provide incentives to bring more dispatchable power in the market. While Finkel’s target has clearly hit an internal roadblock, the policy is expected to include mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the use of international permits, which the government first signalled when it launched a review of its Direct Action policy. Industry sources also expect the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which is the Coalition’s voluntary scheme that gives incentives for farmers and landholders to reduce emissions, to be given renewed funding. A range of groups, from the business lobby to environmentalists, want the major parties to reach a bipartisan agreement on energy and climate policy and end a wretched decade of partisan argument. As the government is moving to finalise its policy, Labor has increased its public overtures that it is prepared to deal with the Coalition in the event it can produce a credible policy. But Labor has also grabbed Abbott’s public frolic to argue Malcolm Turnbull is not in charge of the Coalition’s policy formulation. Labor’s treasury spokesman, Chris Bowen, said on Tuesday Abbott’s intervention underscored the “catastrophic failure” of Turnbull “to stand up to the climate deniers in his party”. Bowen said Abbott was “an effective handbrake on the elected prime minister, stopping any sensible policy progress when it comes to climate change and energy”. He said Labor has not given the chief scientist the task of drafting a policy settlement for climate and energy, that request had come from the government. “Alan Finkel has delivered a very good report which says here’s a way forward,” Bowen said. “We’ve got this remarkable circumstance with the opposition of the day willing to be bipartisan but the government can’t reach an internal partisan position. “We can’t negotiate with a puff of smoke. “We need the government to have a position so that we can reach that policy certainty. We don’t have that because frankly Malcolm Turnbull is just not up to it.”"
"This is a story about how misinformation can take hold. It’s not always down to dishonesty. Sometimes it’s just a lack of time, a headline and the multiplying power of ideological certainty. Last week, China announced it was stopping or postponing work on 151 coal plants that were either under, or earmarked for, construction. Last month, India reported its national coal fleet on average ran at little more than 60% of its capacity – among other things, well below what is generally considered necessary for an individual generator to be financially viable. Neither of these stories gained much of a foothold in the Australia media. But one story on global coal did: that 621 plants were being built across the planet. The line was run in print, repeated on national radio and rippled out on social media among likeminded audiences. Some politicians and commentators claimed it showed it was strange, maybe even ridiculous, that MPs, financiers and energy companies said new coal power stations had no role to play in Australia. But the figure is wrong. Way off, in fact. According to the most recent data, there are 267 coal stations under construction. More than 40% of those are not actually new ones, but expansions of existing generators. A bit of background: the figure dates back to 19 June, when Nationals senator John “Wacka” Williams asked the parliamentary library to answer a few reasonable questions. How many coal plants are there in other countries? How many have been built recently or are being built? How many have closed? According to the parliamentary library analysis, he wanted the answers by 4pm the same day. Fast forward to September, and the Australian ran a page one story quoting the analysis under the headline “World building new coal plants faster than it shuts them”. The Oz (correctly) reported that the library found 621 coal-fired power units were being built. This was mis-repeated by several people who don’t accept that climate change is a present threat – including blogger and broadcaster Andrew Bolt and government backbench energy and environment committee chair Craig Kelly – as 621 plants being built. In reality, coal power stations are usually made up of several units. Victoria’s Hazelwood, which shut in March, had eight. But the distinction mattered little once Bolt had provided the shareable online headline: “New coal-fired power stations: World 621, Australia zero. Now understand?” While the stations/units confusion is relevant, it is not the main issue. The 621 is incorrect, however you cut it. By the time it appeared in the media, it was more than a year out of date. How do we know? The guy behind the data that was the initial source for the library analysis says so. The parliamentary library used as its source the Comstat Data Portal, a trade-focused African website not known for its energy expertise. As the library noted, the African portal copied its data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker, the widely respected database run by US-based anti-coal organisation CoalSwarm and used by the OECD, International Energy Agency and Bloomberg publications. But none of the players involved in spreading this story in Australia contacted CoalSwarm directly to check if the African database was accurate. It’s not. Ted Nace, the director of CoalSwarm, says there appeared to be numerous transcription errors. More significantly, the data on Comstat is out of date – from August last year. It did not reflect that new construction of coal plants plummeted in 2016 and 2017 following declines in construction in China and India. More coal-fired capacity is still being built than closed each year, though the gap has narrowed significantly. But, crucially, coal stations are not being used as much. The amount of electricity produced across the planet by burning coal has fallen each year since 2013. “A distinction needs to be kept in mind between capacity and electrical output,” Nace says. “Even though there are more power plants, the actual production of electricity from those plants – and likewise the amount of coal used worldwide – has fallen every year since 2013, with a small drop in 2014 and larger drops in 2015 and 2016.” The parliamentary assessment, and subsequent reporting, would have benefited from a closer glance at a report released in March by CoalSwarm, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club. Titled Boom and Bust 2017, it found an extraordinary 62% drop in new coal plant construction across the globe last year, and an 85% fall in new coal plant permits in China. Analysis of CoalSwarm’s database shows that in July, construction was taking place at 300 plants globally. Of those, 183 were new power stations and 117 extensions of existing plants. But that number is changing rapidly. As in so many things, the extraordinary story in coal comes from China. It still uses a stack of it, and is still building plenty of power stations. But according to a breakdown of the latest cancellation data announced last week by Simon Holmes à Court, senior adviser at the University of Melbourne’s energy transition hub, it stopped construction at 33 sites in the past three months alone. It means that since July, the number of new coal stations being built in China has fallen from 103 to just 74. There has also been a slight decrease in the number being expanded, down to 46. The reason? A glut in the Chinese electricity market. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found its coal fleet ran at only 47.5% capacity last year. India is the other big player, with 45 power stations under construction – 19 new plants and 26 being expanded. While debate continues to rage over whether the Australian government should subsidise Adani’s planned giant export coal mine in outback Queensland, existing Indian coal plants – including those owned by Adani – are struggling. Among countries comparable to Australia in terms of development, Japan – which signalled it would make a significant investment in coal after shutting down its nuclear fleet following the Fukushima disaster six years ago – has 14 construction projects, many of them small by Australian standards. Germany has been held up by lobby group the Minerals Council of Australia as an industrialised country investing in “high efficiency, low emissions”, or HELE, coal technology. It has one station under construction. Building work at what is known as Datteln 4 started a decade ago next month. After several delays, it is due to be commissioned next year. It is the only coal station being built in western Europe. Britain’s Conservative party has promised to phase out coal by 2025, and Justin Trudeau’s Canadian government by 2030. The two countries last week said they would work together to push other countries to join them. Despite Donald Trump’s grand promises about reviving the coal industry, there are no new stations under construction in the US. What does all this mean for Australia? In terms of the political debate, probably very little. Given the modern aversion to the persuasive power of evidence, misinformation will find a way. But don’t let yourself be kidded into thinking only local investors are leaving coal behind. • Support our independent journalism and critical reporting on energy and the environment by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"
"Accelerating rates of tree clearing in Queensland are wiping out any cuts to greenhouse gas emissions the federal government has made through its $2.55bn Direct Action fund, according to the latest data released by the Queensland government. The results also point again to apparent holes in the federal government’s greenhouse gas accounting, as its official figures maintain that land clearing in Queensland is reducing, and that changes in land use across the whole country are cutting emissions rather than adding to them.  About 40% of the clearing in the state identified in the latest figures occurred in catchments that drain water into the Great Barrier Reef, which will increase pollution affecting the struggling coral, sparking further calls for the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, to use his powers under federal law to stop some of the clearing. On Thursday the Queensland government released figures showing 395,000 hectares of bush had been cleared in 2015-16, according to its statewide landcover and tree study (Slats). That was up a third compared with the previous year and almost 50% compared with two years earlier. The state environment minister, Steven Miles, said the clearing in one year in Queensland alone caused 45m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The centrepiece of the federal government’s Direct Action policy on climate change is its $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund, under which it pays companies to pollute less. In the last auction of the ERF, the government paid an average of $11.82 for each tonne of carbon abated, meaning the emissions from Queensland’s land clearing cancelled out more than half a billion dollars of abatement paid for by the taxpayer – a fifth of the total fund in one year. “Deforestation has a major impact on climate change,” said Lyndon Schneiders, national director of the Wilderness Society. “Ending deforestation would be a fast, cheap and effective way to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.” Meanwhile, the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory, which is the country’s official source of climate change accounting, continues to find that across the whole country, changes in land use – which includes land clearing – amount to a carbon sink rather than a source. In the latest federal government figures, for the year to March 2017, changes in land use are counted as an abatement of 0.1% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The report on the figures says Queensland’s land sector emissions have been “reducing over time”. Changes in the way the federal government measures greenhouse gas emissions have led to revisions of historical reports, with significant amounts of emissions disappearing. Explanations given for the revisions do not fully explain the reduced emissions. The environment department said in a statement Queensland data was used to prepare the national figures and informed the national inventories. “Each year, we update land clearing estimates based on latest satellite data. Where applicable, we also revise estimates to reflect improvements in remote sensing and estimation methods,” a spokesperson said. The large amount of clearing occurring in the Great Barrier Reef catchments has led to renewed calls for Frydenberg to use his powers under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to stop some of the clearing. Frydenberg has previously stated that clearing activities require approval under the act if they “have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance under federal environment law”. He told the ABC in July the government had powers to enforce those laws and would continue to do so. But a WWF report from July found 99.2% of properties where land had been cleared that appeared to need approval under the act, had failed to gain it. The only time the federal government forced a property owner to gain approval, it led to fighting within the federal Coalition. “The amount of clearing in reef catchments should be ringing alarm bells with minister Frydenberg,” said Martin Taylor, a conservation scientist at WWF-Australia. “When the Queensland parliament rejected tougher laws the commonwealth was the last line of defence. Minister Frydenberg’s department has the power under the EPBC Act to rein this in. But the EPBC protections only work if they’re used and that’s not happening,” Taylor said. Frydenberg’s office did not respond to questions about the matter."
"The Turnbull government is poised to unveil a new energy investment framework that will impose obligations on the electricity sector to reduce emissions consistent with the Paris agreement. It will also create new reliability obligations to ensure there’s enough dispatchable power in the system. Cabinet, and the government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, considered the government’s new policy on Monday night before a party room debate slated for Tuesday morning.  Government sources have confirmed the Coalition will not adopt the clean energy target recommended by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market. The vociferous internal critics of Finkel’s proposal, led by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, have made it clear for months they will not accept any policy that contains new subsidies for renewable energy. The existing renewable energy target peaks in 2020 and will run out to 2030. It is understood the new obligations for reliability and emissions reduction will be imposed as part of an overhaul of the national electricity market rules recommended by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the new Energy Security Board, established by the Council of Australian Governments to drive the recommendations of the Finkel review already endorsed by state and federal energy ministers. While key details of the policy are not yet clear, government sources claim the required emissions reductions in electricity will be consistent with the Paris framework, and the new policy approach will have a more positive impact on power prices than the clean energy target, which Finkel said would lower energy prices compared with business as usual. The government is also expected to keep the emissions reduction fund and it flagged the potential use of international permits to help meet Australia’s emissions targets at lowest cost in its review of the Direct Action policy, launched in March. The government’s efforts to resolve its energy policy comes as the new Guardian Essential poll finds a clear majority of voters support the now dumped clean energy target to help drive the transition to low emissions power sources. The new poll shows support for a clean energy target at 65%. It also suggests Coalition conservatives who have campaigned against the Finkel proposal are out of step with the views of their own supporters. While the total approval for the clean energy target is 65% in the new survey, 68% of Coalition voters in the sample of 1,845 voters said the government should implement a clean energy target. And while Coalition conservatives have railed for months against subsidies for renewable energy – Australians are on a different page. Australians are overwhelmingly supportive of incentives for low-emissions technologies, with 74% of the sample backing ongoing support for renewables, and 75% of Coalition supporters endorsing that view. A majority of voters, including a slim majority of Coalition voters, also support Labor’s policy goal to source 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 – a policy regularly attacked by the Coalition. Labor’s policy was supported by 62% of the sample, and 52% of Coalition voters said they approved of it. At the beginning of a critical week for the government on energy, voters are inclined to see the government in Canberra underperforming on a key issue, although they are not as frustrated with the Coalition as they were in February. The Turnbull government is not doing enough to ensure affordable, reliable and clean energy for Australian households and businesses, according to 61% (down from 71% in February). Only 15% think it is doing enough, and 19% (up 5%) say they don’t know. More than half (56%) of Coalition voters think there has not been enough action, and 22% think it is doing enough. With Tony Abbott spending the past several months front running the government’s energy debate, and leading the opposition to the Finkel recommendation, 42% think the former prime minister should resign from parliament (down 1% from April), while 30% think he should stay in parliament in some capacity (down 2%). Liberal/National voters were more likely to think Tony Abbott should stay in parliament (38%) than Labor voters (27%) and Greens voters (17%). Labor is still in front in the new poll, leading the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure 52% to 48%, but that is an improvement on the government’s fortunes from a week ago, where Labor led 54% to 46%. The major parties traded blows over energy in parliament on Monday, when Labor asked a series of questions about why the prime minister had given early public endorsement to the clean energy target when the government now intended to dump it. Labor has signalled it is highly unlikely to support an energy policy which abandons the core Finkel recommendation but the shadow climate minister, Mark Butler said on Monday the opposition held out “some hope” that the government would produce something sensible. A major business group, the Business Council of Australia, urged the ALP to “stop, pause, and look at the detail” before forming a position on the government’s plan, because stakeholders needed bipartisanship for investment certainty. “The worst thing that could happen now is that we go into another round of never ever, pure politics or this won’t work or it’s not our scheme, so it’s not a good scheme,” said the BCA’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott. Westacott said it was “hugely important” for the government to set a trajectory for emissions reduction, and a establish a clear trigger, so businesses understood how emissions would be treated, because “if you’re trying to do a major project you want to price risk.”"
"Last week, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced, “the war on coal is over.” If there ever was a war on coal, the coal industry has lost. According to a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, many old American coal power plants are being retired or converted to natural gas, and new coal power plants aren’t being built because they’ve become more expensive than natural gas, wind, and solar energy:  The share of US electricity coming from coal fell from 51 percent in 2008 to 31 percent in 2016—an unprecedented change. New UCS analysis finds that, of the coal units that remain, roughly one in four plans to retire or convert to natural gas; another 17 percent are uneconomic and could face retirement soon.  Natural gas has now surpassed coal to supply 32% of US electricity (up from 21% in 2008), and solar and wind are up to 10% (from 3% in 2008). This trend will continue. As old coal plants continue to retire and be replaced by cheaper renewables and natural gas, their share of the US electricity supply will continue to plummet, and coal will become a fossil fuel in every sense of the word. That’s why American companies continue to invest in cheap, clean renewable energy. As a result, our air and water are becoming cleaner, Americans are becoming healthier, and our carbon pollution is falling. Two more coal plants to close in Texas. Believe that makes 12 this year nationwide: https://t.co/8n1kUQUJSc The shift away from coal poses a challenge for regions in which the local economy depends on the fossil fuel, but the transition is inevitable. A wise economic policy would involve funding programs to help those regions adapt to the change (Hillary Clinton proposed one such plan during her presidential campaign). A recent study showed that Americans are willing to pay a carbon tax with some of the revenue going to assist displaced coal workers. The Trump administration has instead opted to try and slow coal’s inevitable decline. The Trump administration seems hell-bent on causing as much global warming as possible. First there was the historically irresponsible decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, joining war-torn Syria as the only world countries to reject the treaty. Then just a few weeks ago, Trump’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced a plan to effectively take coal out of the free market and instead subsidize it with taxpayer dollars to bail out the industry and keep uneconomical coal power plants open. The hypocrisy ran thick – as Perry called for propping up the coal industry with increased taxpayer subsidies, Pruitt called for an end to subsidies for renewable energy:  I would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar. I’d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources, and let utilities make real-time market decisions on those types of things as opposed to being propped up by tax incentives and other types of credits that occur Soon thereafter, Priutt announced that Trump’s EPA will repeal the Clean Power Plan. That policy represented America’s most significant effort to cut its carbon pollution, but had been mired in a legal battle over whether the plan exceeded EPA’s regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act. Rather than let the courts decide the case, which many experts felt the EPA would win, Pruitt stopped defending the case in court and ended the program.  The problem is that according to the US Supreme Court, the EPA is legally required to regulate dangerous carbon pollution. Pruitt’s EPA may propose a dramatically weakened plan that probably wouldn’t survive a court challenge, or he may just try to run out the clock on Trump’s term. As with the disastrous Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they don’t have a replacement plan. In the meantime, states and environmental groups will take his Clean Power Plan repeal to court. I will sue to stop the Trump Admin’s irresponsible and illegal #CleanPowerPlan repeal, which threatens NYers public health & environment. pic.twitter.com/utm5Q0VWrF Pruitt’s Clean Power Plan repeal justification is largely based on bogus economics, which the Trump administration is using to reduce government estimates of the ‘social cost of carbon.’ This figure – which estimates how much a ton of carbon pollution costs society in terms of damages caused by climate change – is integral to many government policies. A majority of economists think the government’s estimate is too low, but Pruitt’s EPA manipulated the math by ignoring the costs of America’s carbon pollution to the rest of the world, and by using a high discount rate, which essentially says we care more about saving money now than preventing climate damages and suffering for future generations. However, because renewables and natural gas are now cheaper than coal, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that the US will meet the Clean Power Plan target of cutting carbon pollution from electricity generation 32% below 2005 levels by 2030 despite its repeal.  That being said, with the Clean Power Plan in place, the US likely would have beat its targets. As this excellent tool created by Carbon Brief shows, many states like California and Idaho are ahead of the curve, but other states like Texas and West Virginia would have been forced to accelerate their transitions to clean energy, had the Clean Power Plan been enforced. The good news is that none of the Trump administration’s moves are permanent. The next president can rejoin the Paris climate agreement, have the EPA draft new rules to regulate power plant carbon pollution, and revise the social cost of carbon based on real science and math. As Citizens’ Climate Lobby Executive Director Mark Reynolds wrote: Those who cheer the EPA’s move should remember that President Obama initiated the Clean Power Plan in 2015 in the face of Congress’s inaction on climate change. Without effective legislation to combat climate change, a future president could just as easily go down the path of executive action and regulations again. The best answer here is for Congress to pass legislation putting the market to work on solving climate change. There’s been some movement in this direction. A group of Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council called for a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which would grow the economy. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently called for a price on carbon pollution and is said to be working with Senator Whitehouse (D-RI) on climate legislation. The House Climate Solutions Caucus is now up to 30 Republican and 30 Democratic members and is trying to craft a bipartisan replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The Trump administration is taking every possible step to burn away our future, but fortunately the transition to a clean energy economy is unstoppable, and many of his party members are coming to grips with that reality."
"After the election of Donald Trump, many of us in the climate and energy fields were rightfully fearful. What would happen to international agreements to cut greenhouse gases? What would happen to funding for climate research? What would happen to the green energy revolution? In most instances, Trump is worse than we could have imagined. But in one special area, Trump may not matter. That is in the growth of corporate purchasing of renewable energy. It turns out there are factors that even Trump cannot stop that make choosing renewable energy an easy decision for many companies.  New evidence about the unstoppable renewable energy wave recently came out in a report that was released by Apex Clean Energy and the GreenBiz Group. These groups surveyed corporations to determine their future plans on renewable energy installation and adoption. They wanted to know whether these plans had changed in the past few years and what motivated their decisions to implement renewable energy strategies. The outcome of this survey is available here for people who want to read the entire document. The groups surveyed 153 major corporations (both public and private), whose combined revenue was in excess of $250 million. Among these companies, 84% are “actively pursuing or considering purchasing renewable energy over the next 5-10 years.” Surprisingly, they found that 43% of the corporations intend to be more aggressive in their pursuit of renewable energy in the next two years. 87% of those actively pursuing renewable energy purchases stated that the election of Trump had no impact on their decision.  In fact, 11% were more inclined to purchase renewable energy. Most surprising to me was that of the 128 companies that are actively pursuing or considering purchase of renewable energy over the next two years, all but 1 responded that they were “positive about either continuing forward or becoming more aggressive in their attempts to pursue renewables.”  A really important part of the survey addressed what motivated the companies as they made decisions to pursue renewables. Also, the report identified the factors that make companies successful in their pursuit. In terms of motivation to actually purchase renewables, 65% of the corporations report that energy price was the leading criteria. So sure, companies want to do the right thing, they want to create a healthier planet to hand off to future generations; they want to improve their public image. But, the decision to implement clean energy has to be made when the economics are right. It turns out, these companies want a diversified energy portfolio (energy sources and geography). Bringing clean energy, especially wind and solar into their energy supply can be a hedge against rising and variable costs of fossil fuels. The majority of these companies (57%) have renewable energy targets, and having such targets and champions within the corporation makes it much easier to follow through on renewable energy purchases. The main motivations for creating these targets in the first place were to address climate and emission goals and to demonstrate corporate leadership in their industry.  What this tells me is that while a majority of companies have aspirations to engage with clean energy, and while those aspirations are driven by corporate responsibility, it is the economics that convert aspirations to actions.  The survey then reported on the types of renewable energy purchases. The most common was owned renewable energy on site. But the second most common was purchased renewable energy credits, followed by power purchase agreements, leased renewable energy infrastructure, green tariffs, and community solar. Steve Vavrik, Apex’s Chief Commercial Officer told me: Companies that are seeking to buy renewables aren’t just looking for the easiest way to cut costs. They are making a strategic investment to diversify their energy portfolio and secure long-term sustainability. For me, this is all a much-needed positive sign that all the work done over the past few decades to improve the quality and reliability of clean energy and to develop various options for individuals and corporations to purchase clean energy is paying dividends. I’ve always thought that when the economics point toward the use of clean energy, we will see an unstoppable trend. We may be seeing that now."
"Warming soils are releasing more carbon into the atmosphere than previously thought, suggesting a potentially disastrous feedback mechanism whereby increases in global temperatures will trigger massive new carbon releases in a cycle that may be impossible to break. The increased production of carbon comes from the microbes within soils, according to a report in the peer-review journal Science, published on Friday.   The 26-year study is one of the biggest of its kind, and is a groundbreaking addition to our scant knowledge of exactly how warming will affect natural systems. Potential feedback loops, or tipping points, have long been suspected to exist by scientists, and there is some evidence for them in the geological record. What appears to happen is that once warming reaches a certain point, these natural biological factors kick in and can lead to a runaway, and potentially unstoppable, increase in warming.  Other tipping points posited by scientists include the disappearance of ice in the Arctic, which creates areas of dark water that absorb more heat, and the release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from thawing permafrost. In the Science study, researchers examined plots of soil in the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, a mixed hardwood forest in the US. They experimented by heating some of the plots with underground cables to 5C above normal levels, leaving others as a control.  The long-term study revealed that in the first 10 years there was a strong increase in the carbon released from the heated plots, then a period of about seven years when the carbon release abated. But after this second calmer period, which the scientists attribute to the adjustment of the soil microbes to the warmer conditions, the release of carbon resumed its upward path. In the last three years, the release of carbon has once again dropped back, which scientists attribute to another reorganisation of the microbes present. They suggest an increase in the number of microbes that can feast on the hard-to-digest organic matter, such as plant-based lignin, which gives clues to the possible cyclical nature of the process. From 1991, when the experiment began, the plots subjected to 5C warming lost about 17% of the carbon that had been stored in the top 60cm of the soil, where the greatest concentration of organic matter is to be found. Scientific understanding of the complexities of soil microbial activity is still limited, but the long-term nature of the study provides valuable insights into what might be happening, and is likely to happen in future, to vast swaths of forest soils across the world. While deforestation has been the focus of most research into forests’ effects on climate change, with a recent study suggesting tropical forests are turning into carbon sources rather than carbon stores as a result, the impact of warming soils has remained much of a mystery. Soils are one of the world’s biggest natural carbon sinks, along with trees and the oceans. Daniel Metcalfe, of Sweden’s Lund University, said: “If these findings hold more widely across major terrestrial ecosystems, then a much greater portion of the global soil carbon store could be vulnerable to decomposition and release of carbon dioxide under global warming than previously thought.” The study was carried out by scientists at the US Marine Biological Laboratory, led by Jerry Melillo, with contributions from the universities of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  Melillo, who holds the position of distinguished scientist at the MBL, said: “Each year, mostly from fossil fuel burning, we are releasing about 10bn metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere. The world’s soils contain about 3,500bn tons of carbon. If a significant amount of that is added to the atmosphere, due to microbial activity, that will accelerate the global warming process. Once this self-reinforcing feedback begins, there is no easy way to turn it off. There is no switch to flip.” He added: “The future is warmer. How much warmer is the issue.” While emissions from fossil fuels can be cut back, the reactions of the natural world to a warming climate may be impossible to control. Some recent work has suggested that the warming of the globe may be progressing at a slightly slower rate than the upper range of previous studies estimated. However, feedback loops and tipping points have the potential to create sudden disruptions that are hard to take account of in standard climate modelling, and these could mean much greater changes and far higher rates of warming in the future. Separately, research from Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, and other institutions, published in the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, and Global Change Biology, called for more work on how soil could be used as a carbon store. When agricultural soils are well-managed, they can store more carbon than they emit, which would allow them to be used as potential carbon sinks.  But the scientists warn that “we still don’t have a strong understanding of the interactions among biological, chemical and physical processes regulating carbon in soils”. They say much more research is needed, particularly as there are dangers in soils in Siberia that are rapidly warning, and could release vast quantities of carbon. They also warn that there may be 25-30% less organic matter in some soils than previously estimated.  “Soil has changed under our feet,” said Jennifer Harden, a visiting scholar at Stanford. “We can’t use the soil maps made 80 years ago and expect to find the same answers.”"
"Petrol and diesels vehicles will be banned from Oxford city centre under plans to bring in what officials believe would be the world’s first zero-emissions zone. The proposals aim to slash air pollution in the historic university city, which has seen levels of the harmful pollutant nitrogen dioxide rise above legal limits in some areas.  Under the plans being put out for consultation on Monday, the ban would be introduced in phases, starting with preventing non-zero-emitting taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses from using a small number of streets in 2020. As vehicle technology develops, the zero-emissions zone will extend to cover all non-electric vehicles, including HGVs, in the whole of the city centre by 2035, according to the joint proposals by Oxford city council and Oxfordshire county council. The introduction of the zero-emissions zone could see levels of nitrogen dioxide, much of which comes from traffic fumes, particularly diesel engines, fall by up to three-quarters by 2035, the councils said. Data released by the World Health Organisation last year showed that Oxford was one of 11 British cities to breach the safe limits set for toxic particles known as PM10s. It also breached the limit for PM2.5s. The city has already won £500,000 of government funding to install charging points for electric taxis, and £800,000 to install 100 electric vehicle charging points for residents, but officials say more will be needed to support the zero-emissions zone. Other schemes being considered to support the zone include reduced parking fees for electric vehicles, electric taxi-only ranks, and electric delivery vehicle-only loading areas. Councillor John Tanner of Oxford city council said: “Toxic and illegal air pollution in the city centre is damaging the health of Oxford’s residents. A step change is urgently needed; the zero emissions zone is that step change. “All of us who drive or use petrol or diesel vehicles through Oxford are contributing to the city’s toxic air. Everyone needs to do their bit, from national government and local authorities, to businesses and residents, to end this public health emergency.” Oxfordshire county council councillor Yvonne Constance said: “We want to hear from everyone who uses the city centre, including businesses, bus and taxi firms and local residents ... Pragmatism will be an important part of anything we plan, but we have set the ambition.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called last month for the environment department to amend the Clean Air Act to allow for the creation of zero-emission zones. Other cities that have tried to introduce measures to tackle vehicle emissions include Madrid, whose city council ordered half of the city’s cars to be banned in 2016, and Oslo, where the authorities eventually backtracked on a plan to ban all private cars in the Norwegian capital."
"Statements by Tony Abbott suggesting that climate change is “probably doing good” are different to his opinion while he was prime minister and it is up to him to explain why he has changed his view, Julie Bishop has said. Speaking from South Korea on the ABC’s 7:30 on Thursday, the foreign affairs minister rebuked Abbott by recounting his record of signing the Paris climate agreement and setting the renewable energy target.  Bishop’s comments follow a similar intervention from energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, stating that climate change is real and recalling that Abbott signed the Paris agreement. On Monday evening Abbott told a climate sceptic thinktank in London that policies to combat climate change were like “primitive people ... killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”. Asked about Abbott’s comments, Bishop said he was “entitled to express his views, as any other member of parliament ... is entitled to do”. But she added: “The views he expressed recently are different to those he expressed as prime minister when he supported the Paris agreement, and in fact set a nationally determined targets and the renewable energy target was established under then Prime Minister Abbott,” she said. “So, it’s up to him to explain the differences between his opinion then and his opinion now.” Bishop said the Turnbull government was determined to deliver “affordable, reliable energy ... that will still meet our international obligations, which were, in fact, established under then Prime Minister Abbott”. Asked why Abbott was not expelled for “constant breaches of discipline”, Bishop noted that he was discussing an issue that was “controversial” in some sectors of the community. Bishop suggested the reason there was “a deal of interest in what he has to say” is that he had changed his mind from his view as prime minister. “I think the question that has to be asked of Tony Abbott is why does he have a different view now than when he was prime minister?” With the government backing off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, it is unclear what mixture of climate policies it will propose to meet international obligations. Bishop said the Turnbull government’s energy policy “will be discussed by cabinet and by the party room and then of course announced to the Australian public”. The government could unveil its energy policy as soon as next week, when parliament resumes for the final spring session. The expected overhaul of the market rules in the government’s looming energy policy overhaul is expected to be accompanied by mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the use of international permits, which the government first signalled when it launched a review of its Direct Action policy. The energy sector also expects the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which is the Coalition’s voluntary scheme that gives incentives for farmers and landholders to reduce emissions, will also have its funding topped up between now and the next election. Abbott’s speech was labelled “loopy” by Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, but defended in part by Liberal MP Craig Kelly, the chairman of the backbench committee on climate and energy."
"Millions of draughty homes in England and Wales will be insulated and overhauled by 2035 to save families as much as £300 a year on their energy bills, under the government’s climate change plans. The long-delayed blueprint for how the UK will hit its binding target of cutting emissions by 57% by 2032 includes about 50 policies supporting everything from low-carbon power and energy savings to electric vehicles and keeping food waste out of landfill. Big winners in the 164-page Clean Growth Strategy include offshore windfarm developers, which will be guaranteed a further £550m of subsidies. Experts believe that could more than double the UK’s existing offshore wind capacity.  Energy efficiency for businesses and householders is at the heart of the plan, which the government was required to publish under the Climate Change Act. There is an aspiration that all houses will be brought up to the minimum of energy band C by 2035, but how that will be achieved is not spelled out. Existing schemes to improve insulation will be extended until 2028. New nuclear power stations are encouraged, but they will only go ahead if developers can do so at competitive prices. Solar power was given tentative support, while onshore windfarms won partial backing. The business secretary, Greg Clark, compared the changes under way in energy today to the big changes wrought by the UK’s first coal power station in 1882. “This government has put clean growth at the heart of its industrial strategy to increase productivity, boost people’s earning power and ensure Britain continues to lead the world in efforts to tackle climate change,” he said, launching the plan at the Olympic Park in east London.  Green campaigners, industry groups and businesses mostly welcomed the plan but said it needed more ambition and lacked detail in some areas. Robert Gross, the director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, said the politics of the strategy were key, and showed the greener wings of the Tory party had won out. “In 2015 the government started hacking and slashing at all manner of green policies. This has stopped, and that’s very welcome,” he said. Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, echoed that view. He said the strategy showed a “sea change” in “top-line thinking about the low carbon economy”, with Theresa May’s government seeing it as an opportunity rather than a cost as it was viewed under David Cameron. Claire Perry, the climate minister, said May’s foreword to the plan was important and showed how seriously the government was taking it. Asked if the strategy showed green-minded Tories were winning out after a slew of climate programmes were axed by the Conservatives in 2015, she said: “This isn’t about factions winning, it’s about getting on with capturing the opportunity [for business].” She told the Guardian: “This is doubling down on the green ambition, actually saying we see the economic benefit from doing this.” The minister said there would be a new “triple test” for whether the government backed clean technologies. They would have to maximise the amount emissions come down; show they can become cheaper in the future; and be an area in which the UK could lead the world. She said a proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon at Swansea – which an independent government review backed in January but on which government has yet to signal its view – would have to pass that test. New policies included a green light for onshore windfarms on remote Scottish islands being allowed to compete for subsidies. The move was welcomed by Orkney and companies including SSE, which plans a windfarm on Shetland, jointly owned with the community. There is also £100m of funding for research on carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, that is a fraction of the £1bn government competition on the technology that was cut two years ago. The plan is also scant on any detail of how the UK will cut emissions from heating, talking instead of simply exploring the best options. Low-carbon alternatives to gas include electrification via heat pumps, or using greener gases such as hydrogen. Many of the ideas in the strategy have already been announced, such as phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and £246m to develop batteries for cars and energy systems. Despite the wide-ranging policies, the strategy concedes that the UK is still not on track to meet its legally binding carbon targets for the late 2020s and early 2030s. The government noted it had ‘flexibilities’ on meeting the targets under the Climate Change Act, but might not need to use them. The Committee on Climate Change, the UK’s statutory climate advisers, welcomed the strategy but warned ministers against using the law’s flexibilities in meeting its carbon targets. “This should not be the plan,” said Lord Deben, the group’s chairman. The authority will pass its verdict in January after analysing the plan. Campaign group ClientEarth said it was weighing its options, given the legal requirement for government to close the gap. Jonathan Church, a lawyer at the group, said: “The UK government is still in breach of the Climate Change Act. The UK is on course to miss its 2023-27 emissions reductions targets by 116MtCO2e – equivalent to more than the Philippines’ emissions in a whole year – and the clean growth strategy does not fix this.” The Green party said the strategy was a missed opportunity. Caroline Lucas, the party’s co-leader, said: “Government has blown this enormous opportunity to put Britain on track to meet its climate target.” Other observers, including the London School of Economics, said the broad thrust of the strategy was good, but it was too vague. The union Prospect said there were “still too many unanswered questions”."
"I am still seeing butterflies almost daily, sunning themselves when they can and feasting on late-flowering ivy. Most are red admirals, a large, dark and powerful presence sailing through autumnal skies or feeding on rotten fruit in orchards. It has been a vintage red admiral year, with numbers up by 75% on 2016 in Butterfly Conservation’s Big Butterfly Count. But sadly it has not been a vintage butterfly summer.  With much of southern Britain enjoying a sunny May and June it once looked as if it might turn out to be the best season for a decade. But a wet July and August put a dampener on most species, which do emerge midsummer.  Heavy summer rains can wipe out whole generations. One butterfly recorder I spoke to reported seeing scores of speckled woods on his transect but, after a heavy rainfall, suddenly there were none. It was not a disaster like 2016, when a glorious late summer arrived too late for the butterflies; nor was it like the sodden summer of 2012. Not bad, is most butterfly lovers’ grudging verdict on 2017, and that may be as good as it gets. Our butterflies are well-adapted to the vicissitudes of the British summer but the long-term decline in two-thirds of our 59 native species shows they are less equipped to deal with rapid climatic changes or the dousing of farmland and gardens with pesticides. Milder winters in particular appear to be disastrous for many butterfly species, though not the red admiral. Half a century ago it appeared unable to survive British winters and most individuals made the reverse migration to the continent. Now it is not only a successful hibernator, but the most commonly spotted butterfly throughout the winter months. Keep a lookout for this Christmas-coloured insect if Christmas Day is sunny.  "

"A colony of about 40,000 Adélie penguins in Antarctica has suffered a “catastrophic breeding event” – all but two chicks have died of starvation this year. It is the second time in just four years that such devastation – not previously seen in more than 50 years of observation – has been wrought on the population. The finding has prompted urgent calls for the establishment of a marine protected area in East Antarctica, at next week’s meeting of 24 nations and the European Union at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart.  In the colony of about 18,000 breeding penguin pairs on Petrels Island, French scientists discovered just two surviving chicks at the start of the year. Thousands of starved chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the island in the region called Adélie Land (“Terre Adélie”). The colony had experienced a similar event in 2013, when no chicks survived. In a paper about that event, a group of researchers, led by Yan Ropert-Coudert from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, said it had been caused by a record amount of summer sea ice and an “unprecedented rainy episode”. The unusual extent of sea ice meant the penguins had to travel an extra 100km to forage for food. And the rainy weather left the chicks, which have poor waterproofing, wet and unable to keep warm. This year’s event has also been attributed to an unusually large amount of sea ice. Overall, Antarctica has had a record low amount of summer sea ice, but the area around the colony has been an exception. Ropert-Coudert said the region had been severely affected by the break-up of the Mertz glacier tongue in 2010, when a piece of ice almost the size of Luxembourg – about 80 km long and 40km wide – broke off. That event, which occurred about 250km from Petrels Island, had a big impact on ocean currents and ice formation in the region. “The Mertz glacier impact on the region sets the scene in 2010 and when unusual meteorological events, driven by large climatic variations, hit in some years this leads to massive failures,” Ropert-Coudert told the Guardian. “In other words, there may still be years when the breeding will be OK, or even good for this colony, but the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis.” The link between climate change and the sea-ice extent around Antarctica is not very clear. Sea ice has been increasing in recent years, which could be attributed to a rise in the amount of freshwater in the ocean around the continent caused by climate change. However, over the long term, climate change is expected to cause the sea ice to shrink dramatically. “For the moment, sea ice is increasing and this is a problem for this species as it pushes the feeding place – the sea ice edge – farther away from their nesting place,” Ropert-Coudert said. “If it shrinks it would help but if it shrinks too much then the food chain they rely on may be impacted. Basically, as a creature of the sea ice they need an optimum sea-ice cover to thrive.” Elsewhere, human pressures including climate change have already been having a severe impact on the numbers of Adélie penguins. On the Antarctic Peninsula, which has been badly affected by climate change, populations have been decreasing, and some researchers suggest they may become extinct there. Ropert-Coudert said there were more anthropogenic threats on the horizon – fishing and possibly tourism – that the penguins needed protection from. He has called for a marine protected area (MPA) to be established there. “An MPA will not remedy these changes but it could prevent further impacts that direct anthropogenic pressures, such as tourism and proposed fisheries, could bring,” he said. Next week, 24 countries and the European Union will meet at the CCAMLR in Hobart to discuss the potential creation of more MPAs around Antarctica. At last year’s meeting, after years of failed negotiations, the members agreed to create the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, and many expect the group to agree on East Antarctica next.  This has also been proposed by Australia and has been on the table at the CCAMLR for eight years. The head of polar programs at WWF, Rod Downie, said: “Adélie penguins are one of the hardiest and most amazing animals on our planet. This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins. It’s more like ‘Tarantino does Happy Feet’, with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adélie Land. “The risk of opening up this area to exploratory krill fisheries, which would compete with the Adélie penguins for food as they recover from two catastrophic breeding failures in four years, is unthinkable. So CCAMLR needs to act now by adopting a new Marine Protected Area for the waters off East Antarctica, to protect the home of the penguins.” Ropert-Coudert and his colleagues are in the process of completing a scientific paper on the breeding failure and plan to submit it to a journal in the coming weeks."
"The grownups have finally won and everyone in the UK, from those in cold homes to those on polluted streets and in flooded towns, will benefit. The most important aspect of the UK government’s new clean growth strategy is its unequivocal statement that tackling climate change and a prosperous economy are one and the same thing. This has been clear to many for some time, including Philip Hammond, if not his predecessor George Osborne. There is no long-term, high-carbon economic strategy because the impacts of unchecked climate change destroy economies, as Lord Nicholas Stern puts it.  But the Conservative party has long been swinging between the green dream and fossil-fuelled fantasies. David Cameron went from pledging the “greenest government ever” to dismissing the “green crap” in three years. Recent years have seen one green policy shredded after another, destroying confidence among the businesses we need to deliver a low-carbon economy. The new strategy published on Thursday signals a new, if belated, beginning. It is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel age: it is highly notable that the government plan omits any mention of fracking, having previously been its cheerleader. The government had to produce this plan under its own climate laws to explain how it will get on track to meet the nation’s legally binding carbon targets in 2030 and beyond. But ministers have rightly made a virtue of the plan’s necessity. The proposals themselves are ambitious but lack concrete suggestions in many areas. However, ambition always precedes action and there are plenty of groups, not least the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, who will hold ministers to account. If the government’s efforts to cut emissions from buildings have been slow, it is now taking seriously the need to address energy efficiency. Energy that isn’t used – negawatts – are by far the cheapest way to cut both emissions and energy bills. But as the vast failure of the green deal showed, efficiency is hard to make happen and it is here where firm plans are most urgently needed. Along with heating, transport also needs urgent action – emissions here have been rising. There is plenty in the new plan to harness the surging market for electric vehicles, though little of it is new. Ministers have also once again failed to explain how expanding aviation with Heathrow’s third runway fits with its climate change plan. Electric cars will need clean power and the UK’s electricity grid is already greening fast – coal power has fallen from 40% to 2% in the last five years. The new plan rightly builds on the UK’s success in dramatically driving down the cost of offshore wind power, yet it all but ignores an even cheaper source – onshore wind. It seems that even the conviction that the green economy is the UK’s future is not enough to face down the rural Tory-voting minority who continue to tilt at windmills. Solar power also seems destined to suffer the same fate. Despite looking these gift horses in the mouth, and ignoring tidal power, the plan promises yet more cash for those with their snouts in the nuclear trough. The hyper-expensive Hinkley Point farce has not dulled the appetite for more new nuclear power and it intends to plough by far the biggest sum of its innovation funding into the one energy technology where costs are always rising. But the biggest worry is the very limited support for carbon capture and storage, the technology that takes emissions from fossil fuels and buries them under the ground. CCS is seen as absolutely vital by the Committee on Climate Change, the National Audit Office and the UN’s climate science panel and the UK’s emptying North Sea fields are perfectly placed carbon reservoirs. But CCS gets only about a quarter of the investment of nuclear and just a tenth of the £1bn promised in the plan so abruptly canned by Osborne in 2015. Trees are natural carbon stores and the new plan pledges to “establish a new network of forests in England, including new woodland on farmland”, which offers a tantalising glimpse of the radical change to farm subsidies that may follow Brexit. But there is no mention of the reduction in meat consumption deemed essential in beating global warming by scientists. However, while many of the details are missing, the clean growth strategy marks an important and vital step forward for the UK. As the prime minister Theresa May says in the plan’s foreword: “Clean growth is not an option, but a duty we owe to the next generation. Success in this mission will improve our quality of life and increase our economic prosperity.” The strategy is now crystal clear – it is time to deliver."
"Cli-Fi refers to “climate fiction;” it is a term coined by journalist Dan Bloom. These are fictional books that somehow or someway bring real climate change science to the reader. What is really interesting is that Cli-Fi books often present real science in a credible way. They become fun teaching tools. There are some really well known authors such as Paolo Bacigalupi and Margaret Atwood among others. A list of other candidate Cli-Fi novels was provided by Sarah Holding in the Guardian.  What makes a Cli-Fi novel good? Well in my opinion, it has to have some real science in it. And it has to get the science right. Second, it has to be fun to read. When done correctly, Cli-Fi can connect people to their world; it can help us understand what future climate may be like, or what current climate effects are.  As I write this, we are getting a steady stream of stories out of Puerto Rico the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria. It is hard to imagine the devastation, what life is like without electricity, food, or water. What is life like on an island of 3 million people, each fending for themselves, just trying to survive. Another thing that is hard to imagine is the future. What will the world be like decades from now when Earth temperatures have continued to rise? What will agriculture be like? What will coastal communities be like? What will international relations and armed conflict be like? It is also hard to imagine what living a subsistence agriculture life is like, today. What happens to lives and communities when the rains change, or don’t come at all? What would that world look like?  Cli-Fi stories are vehicles that can help us imagine. The authors get us to think about these what ifs – these future Earths. Cli-Fi novels (and movies for that matter) can make experiences far more real than endless graphs or plots of temperature variations. And that, perhaps, is the most important contribution Cli-Fi can make to the discussion of climate change in our everyday lives. These authors get us to imagine what experiences are or would be like.  One recent example of Cli-Fi literature is South Pole Station by Ashley Shelby. In this book we follow an artist, Cooper Gosling, who is traveling to a research location on Antarctica to create paintings. Yes, an artist is sent to live with researchers and crew – with funding from the National Science Foundation. After arriving at the South Pole, Cooper has to become acquainted with the strange social system that exists there. Ashley writes the book in such a way that you actually feel you are huddled in the cold with her and her co-workers. Cooper doesn’t uplift her life to travel to the South Pole on a whim. It is an outcome of a family tragedy and a history that involves romanticized stories of adventure to this remote place. While Cooper is stationed at the pole, she hears news that a radical scientist is coming. This scientist claims that climate change is a hoax – and his presence further upsets the delicate social balance that exists at the research location.  You see the expected reaction of the regular scientists when this climate denier arrives to perform his research. There is backstabbing and sabotage where in the end we find Copper helping this climate-denying scientist carry out an experiment. The experiment goes awry and there are repercussions all the way back to the US mainland, and the halls of Congress. I liked this book because I don’t like fiction. That is, I find it really hard to get into fictional books because my mind always runs back to science, or my email, or papers to grade, or kids’ soccer practices to get to. I never feel like I have time to just read for fun. But this book was really engaging. It was the first fictional book in a decade that I didn’t want to put down.  It is funny with really quick-witted humor that made me laugh. At the same time, I was impressed by how I felt like I was there – working amongst the staff and scientists. I enjoyed how Ashely weaved in threads of real and accurate science. And this, perhaps, is what makes the Cli-Fi genre so important. We can unintentionally learn real science.  Ashley’s book is at the edge of this genre. It is not “dystopian” and it is not about a post-apocalyptic world resulting from climate change. It is topical and, though fiction, is as present-day as a news headline. This book is about what people, dedicated to facts, are really doing today. It doesn’t seem futuristic. It seems like we are at a point when a bunch of scientists and friends of facts could take over a research station and say, “Stop the madness!” Salman Rushdie recently said that in the present day the country is so filled with lies and fantasy and fiction surrounding the truth, that it might require the fiction writer to plainly lay out what is reality and what is not. I think Ashley’s book fits that notion. So, take a look at this new (newish?) form of literature. Particularly if you want a break from the usual genres. If you find something you like that I didn’t mention, please send it to me."
"The International Monetary Fund has warned the world’s richest nations to have a greater sense of urgency about climate change, a day after the former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, delivered a bizarre speech to a London-based thinktank claiming climate change was “probably doing good”. The IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), released overnight, has dedicated an entire chapter to the impact of weather shocks and climate change on global economic activity.  It warns coping with climate change will be one of the “fundamental challenges” of the 21st century and it calls on the global community to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions before they create “more irreversible damage”, saying richer countries must help low-income economies adapt to rapidly increasing temperatures. Directly contradicting one of Abbott’s arguments that Australia’s contribution to global emissions has been so small it is not worth restructuring its economy to change its energy use significantly, the IMF says nations with developed economies such as Australia – one of the highest per capita emitters in the world – have a responsibility to act.  “Advanced and emerging market economies have contributed the lion’s share to actual and projected climate change,” the report says. “Helping low-income developing countries cope with the consequences of climate change is both a humanitarian imperative and sound global economic policy that helps offset countries’ failure to fully internalise the costs of greenhouse gas emissions. “Since the turn of the 20th century, the Earth’s average surface temperature has increased significantly. Sizeable swings in global temperatures used to happen over long periods, such as fluctuations in and out of the Ice Ages. However, the speed at which the climate has changed over the past 30-40 years appears to be unprecedented in the past 20,000 years. “Climate change is a negative global externality of potentially catastrophic proportions and only collective action and multilateral cooperation can effectively address its causes and consequences.” Overall, the IMF is estimating global output growth will increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018, after upgrading its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for 2017 and 2018. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF’s economic counsellor, says the global cyclical upswing that began midway through 2016 is continuing to gather strength and is reaching more broadly than any upswing in a decade – roughly 75% of the world economy, measured by GDP at purchasing power parity, is sharing in the acceleration. But he has cautioned the recovery may not be sustainable because growth in nominal and real wages remains weak compared with past recoveries, including in Australia. “In particular, most advanced economies face medium-term growth rates significantly lower than in the decade before the global financial crisis of 2007–09,” he said. Abbott warned this week, in a speech that was being politely ignored by some of his colleagues on Tuesday, that climate change itself was “probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm,” and measures to deal with climate change would damage Australia’s economy. “In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial,” he said. The IMF warns specifically in its report that rising global temperatures could wreak havoc in parts of the world, particularly in hotter climates where people were too poor to migrate. Obstfeld has called on the global community to exploit the current cyclical global upswing to pursue domestic and international reforms. “Priorities for mutually beneficial cooperation include strengthening the global trading system, further improving financial regulation, enhancing the global financial safety net, reducing international tax avoidance, fighting famine and infectious diseases, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions before they create more irreversible damage, and helping poorer countries, which are not themselves substantial emitters, adapt to climate change,” he said. “If the strength of the current upswing makes the moment ideal for domestic reforms, its breadth makes multilateral cooperation opportune. Policymakers should act while the window of opportunity is open.” "
"Ophelia formed so far to the east in the Atlantic it caused the United States Hurricane Centre to recast its maps so that they could track the storm. They had not thought it was feasible for hurricanes to head north so near the coast of Europe. As it was, the cold sea south of Ireland took the sting out of the 15th named storm of a busy Atlantic hurricane season. Even so the winds of up to 100 miles an hour were only just below hurricane strength when they hit the south coast of Ireland. And Ophelia may be the shape of things to come. To form, tropical storms need sea temperatures to be at least 26C; they usually grow in strength until they make landfall or head over cooler seas.  Climate change means 26C “tropical seas” are now extending further north. Research tracking these storms has shown this is allowing hurricanes to reach maximum power about 30 miles further north than 10 years ago. The ability of hurricanes to sustain themselves as they travel north in these warmer seas is expected to be a continuing trend, putting Europe potentially in the firing line for hurricanes. In the meantime, the main concern in Britain will be storms coming from the west. Brian, the second potentially damaging autumn storm, is out there somewhere in the Atlantic. These storms are named when the Met Office calculates they need to issue weather warnings. The depressions do not need warm seas to form, although climate change is giving them extra energy and they carry more rain. With the jet stream speeding up the outlook is currently turbulent. "
"To live on one of the Pacific atolls is to come face to face with climate change on a daily basis. Few people in the world had such personal experience as Tony de Brum of the realities of sea level rises and storm surges, of warmer seas, receding beaches and abandoned land. Fewer still have been able to turn that experience into international action to save the islands, and the rest of the planet with them. De Brum, who has died aged 72, acted as ambassador on climate change for the Marshall Islands, a sparsely populated group of more than 1,000 tiny islands spread out over nearly 30 coral atolls. In 2015, he was instrumental in securing the Paris agreement on climate change, by which the world’s governments collectively agreed, for the first time, to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is the limit of safety, and with an aspiration to ensure warming does not exceed 1.5C.  The 1.5C provision was crucial for the low-lying Pacific island states: scientists estimate that, at 2C of warming, the atolls would be overswept by sea level rises and frequent storm surges. Only a lower limit would give them a lifeline, but the challenge of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with such a goal is immense, and while small developing countries were keen, many big economies balked at it. In the tense final days of the negotiations, De Brum helped to lead a coalition of developing and developed countries to forge a compromise and carry the day, resulting in the historic accord. He was hailed as “a real hero, a giant of history, a custodian of our shared future” by the Marshall Islands’ president, Hilda Heine, and by the former UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, as “an inspiring leader, a pillar of determination”. De Brum’s work on climate change, while it will form perhaps his most lasting global legacy, was only the third of the great causes he espoused in a five-decade career of public service, during which he served as foreign minister of the Marshall Islands for three separate terms, interspersed with periods as minister of finance, of health and the environment, and as assistant to the president. De Brum was born on Tuvalu, a former British colony 700 miles north of Fiji, as the war in the Pacific was nearing its final deadly stages. The family later moved to Likiep, in the Marshall Islands, at that time a trust territory of the US, which had wrested control from Japan. His father, Joe, became manager of Majuro airport; his mother, Cecilia, was a teacher. When hostilities ended, the US began 12 years of nuclear testing in the area, with close to 70 blasts by 1958. As a boy, De Brum witnessed one of the consequences from a fishing boat. He later recalled: “I was fishing with my grandfather. He was throwing the net and suddenly the silent bright flash, and then a force, the shockwave. Everything turned red: the ocean, the fish, the sky, and my grandfather’s net. And we were 200 miles away from ground zero.” This was the Bravo Shot, the largest of the US nuclear tests carried out on Bikini Atoll, more than a thousand times as powerful as the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Marshall Islanders’ campaign for freedom from the US lasted through the 1970s, with independence coming in 1979. After studying at Chaminade University, then the University of Hawaii – he was one of the first Marshall Islanders to attend university, according to Heine – De Brum took part in the negotiations, and in the independent governments that followed. His experience of nuclear testing led to a lifelong crusade for nuclear disarmament, culminating in filing lawsuits against all nine nuclear-armed countries in the international court of justice in 2014. “Nuclear weapons are a senseless threat to essential survival. There are basic human and ethical norms, not to mention longstanding treaties, which compel those who possess them to pursue and achieve their elimination,” he said. The legal bid failed. Unassuming in manner, grey-haired and grey-suited, De Brum could have been indistinguishable from the hundreds of other functionaries milling through the halls of UN meetings. There was nothing grey about his personality, however: affable and friendly, he was always ready with a quip or a wink for journalists, and shared stories about his beloved islands, his childhood and his family. He was as happy to greet groups of schoolchildren, or students dressed as polar bears, as to mingle with world leaders. De Brum’s work at the two-week-long Paris talks was a masterclass in diplomacy. The debate over whether the 1.5C target should be included had the potential to wreck the talks – it had wrecked the previous attempt, eight years earlier in Copenhagen. By agreeing a compromise, he showed a pragmatism often absent from the negotiations, and helped lead his fellow small island states and least developed countries in joining with the EU and various others in the “coalition of high ambition”. Some dismissed the 1.5C aspirational target as unachievable, but De Brum’s faith was borne out by a new study, published soon after his death in Nature Geoscience, a prestigious peer-review journal. It concluded that keeping within 1.5C was possible, though it required effort. De Brum is survived by his wife, Rosalie (nee Maddison), whom he married in 1969, three children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, and by his father. • Anton de Brum, politician, born 26 February 1945; died 22 August 2017"

"Swedish scientists have found that flatulent shellfish are creating vast amounts of greenhouse gases, leading to a predictable slew of comments about farting cockles and clams. But beneath the schoolboy humour, there is a serious point. The two gases in question – methane and nitrous oxide – are potent agents of climate change, with a warming potential 28 and 265 times greater than carbon dioxide respectively. Scientists studying the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden have found that shellfish are producing one-tenth of all the greenhouses gases released there – the equivalent to the amount produced by 20,000 cattle. If the same situation is being replicated around the rest of the world’s seas and oceans, we have a serious problem.  Chief scientist Stafano Bonaglia, from Stockholm University, is certainly concerned: “It sounds funny, but small animals in the seafloor may act like cows in a stable, both groups being important contributors of methane due to the bacteria in their gut.” He also points out that shellfish were releasing these gases long before global warming became an issue, and believes that the recent emissions may have been exacerbated by the enrichment of coastal waters, due to the run-off from agricultural fertilisers. To put this into perspective, the average cow produces 120kg of methane every year – 1,000 times as much as even the most flatulent human. With almost 100m head of cattle in the US alone, that means that 12m tonnes of gas are being released annually, dwarfing the efforts of the shellfish. The major animal producers of methane are cud-chewing creatures known as ruminants, such as cattle and sheep – it’s the bacteria in their stomachs that causes the problem. However, kangaroos have a different digestive system, so produce a lot less methane – kangaroo steak, anyone? Other creatures that create huge amounts of methane include the world’s 2,000-plus species of termite. Each only produces a tiny amount – roughly half a microgram a day, so it would take 2m termites to produce a daily dose of one gram of methane. However, there are so many of them that their annual emissions may top 20m tonnes a year. The big difference between termites and cattle is, of course, that termites – and the gases they release – are part of the natural ecosystem. Cattle aren’t."
"George Monbiot’s fear of the few remaining British farmers (Goodbye – and good riddance – to livestock farming, 4 October) reached new levels when he wrote that the “rich mosaic of rainforest and other habitats that once covered our hills has been erased” and blamed us for the tectonic drift that moved Britain from the equator towards the Arctic, perhaps 300m years ago. In the rest of his article he mixed unrelated science from all over the globe with the peculiar claims of noted eccentrics, and suggested that we should plough unsuitable land to grow soya, which will not grow in this climate, to produce artificial meat in urban factories. He didn’t mention inconvenient features of the British ruminant livestock industry, such as the fact that most feed that animals get other than grass is made up of byproducts of the human food industry such as brewers’ grains, sugar beet and fruit-juice pulp, most of which would have to go to landfill if cows and sheep did not recycle it. Without the income from this form of recycling, the price of food in the shop would increase. We do need to moderate excessive meat consumption, and we do need to act on climate change, but this article sows confusion that will delay necessary change.Huw JonesSt Clears, Carmarthenshire • Livestock has long formed part of the warp and weft of our countryside, and the issue of its potent role in greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution cannot be ducked. Compared to other sectors, farming has done poorly. Emissions have risen since 2010, despite the increasing urgency to act. That does not mean that we should get rid of all livestock. The issues are complex. Even the Food Climate Research Network, cited by George Monbiot, concludes that grazing livestock has a limited place in a sustainable food system. For us, this limited place means people in the UK should eat less but better-quality animal produce, whether dairy, eggs or meat. It also requires eating many more plants and challenging rising demand for animal-based proteins. The challenge for the farming sector is to make the shift to more sustainable and resilient systems, much less dependent on fossil fuels and set up to support a healthier population. We know this is possible because some farmers are doing this already, and very successfully too.Graeme WillisFood and farming campaigner, Campaign to Protect Rural England • On this occasion George Monbiot’s evangelical zeal obscures some fundamental practicalities. First, much grazing land is simply unsuitable for growing crops. For example, an organic farmer friend on Dartmoor tells me his land will successfully grow only grass. He farms organically and the manure allows insects to flourish, encouraging a high number and variety of farmland birds. Many arable farms, with their vast acres of monoculture, are often deserts where wildlife is concerned. Second, the implication that livestock farming is cruel is unfair and insulting. Like many farmers, my friend cares greatly about both the natural environment and the welfare of his animals. Third, would rewilding always be such a good idea? It would most likely produce impenetrable scrubland. We have a profound love of our farmed landscape, shaped in large measure by livestock grazing. Surely few of the 99% who are not vegans would consider veganism a price worth paying for its destruction. In any case, replacing meat with vegetables is a second-order priority beside the existential issues of population growth and global warming. And, yes, I am a meat-eater and the vast majority of people are firmly of the opinion that the tastiest dishes are those based on meat.David ThomasHereford • Our dependence on meat is mirrored by the Vikings who colonised Greenland during the Middle Ages. Although fish was readily available, they continued to raise cattle as this conferred social status. When the climate turned colder they perished. By contrast, the inhabitants of Tikopia, a small Pacific island, abandoned pig-rearing in the 17th century as they were rooting up vegetables and competing for food. This may be the only example of a society voluntarily abandoning meat consumption, and it allowed the Tikopians to maintain a population of 400 inhabitants per square mile without any recourse to modern agricultural technology. The question posed in my book The Gilgamesh Gene is whether humanity is behaving like the Vikings or the Tikopians.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • This is another stimulating article, but I wonder why George Monbiot does not make the point that the essential reason for not eating animal products is that the breeding, rearing and killing of sentient and intelligent animals is cruel and brutal, and unnecessary for human beings to survive and thrive. Of course, the supplementary point that the evidence shows that it is also potentially damaging to the future wellbeing of humanity is also relevant, but it is not the essential reason for avoiding animal products.Roger GibbsLoughton, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Big as the blow was to Theresa May at the general election in June, worse has followed. Not only was the election an unnecessary fight for Mrs May to have picked, she has emerged a diminished figure. Her cabinet is united – but mainly in their desire to succeed her. On the day of Mrs May’s big speech at the Conservative party conference this week, everything that could go wrong, did. Then Grant Shapps, a former party chairman who once led a double life as a “multimillionaire” web guru, was unmasked as a parliamentary general aiming to topple Mrs May for her shortcomings. Despite boasting the backing of 30 MPs, none of Mr Shapps’ troops were prepared to follow their commanding officer over the top. Mrs May is hurt and the consensus is that she will stagger on. But the crisis in the Conservative party is here to stay: a toxic brew of personal ambition, ideological visions and electoral panic. This at a time when Britain’s productive forces are stagnating and the biggest foreign policy issue of our times – leaving the European Union – is met with the political posturing of a clown wearing the mask of a roaring lion. The Conservative party was once steeped in pragmatism, dominated by the wish to win elections and to be in power. There always were differences of opinion. These differences in dispositions have now curdled into doctrinal differences.  The Brexit vote has helped widen gulfs in the party, intensifying the cultural nationalism on the right of the party. This group, who since the days of John Major have put forward anti-EU arguments with a burning passion, repelled the electorate to such an extent that the Tories could not win a majority for more than two decades. The bad news for Mrs May is that they are back. The result is that the Tories lost their parliamentary advantage this year. Yet those who profess this anti-European nationalist creed are feted in the current Tory party. It was their speakers who drew the crowds and cheers at conference, not the cabinet’s. That Mrs May relies on the votes of the anti-gay, anti-abortion climate-change deniers of the evangelical Democratic Unionist party to carry her through will mean MPs on the cultural nationalist right will be emboldened. It speaks volumes about the mess the party is in that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP for the last century, who is against gay marriage and anti-abortion on the grounds of his faith, is such a star. Young people, having grown up in a culturally permissive era, are not aroused by the holy anger of the right. They are moved by issues such as climate change and education, where an egalitarian view of humankind prevails. Conservatives have in the past been able to accept social change and adapt to it. They have anticipated society’s needs and changed their policies to meet them. Now the party’s anti-Europeanism means they risk losing a section of voters for ever. The Conservatives have also long been deaf to issues affecting the under-40s. Not only are these voters seeing their wages squeezed, they are unable to save for homes and pensions while the prices race away. Mrs May will find it difficult to sell capitalism to those with no capital. The last election threw into sharp relief the cracks in the Tory party’s support. Its voters are dying off faster than it can win over new ones. That is why Mrs May has accepted that there is a cost-of-living crisis and lifted policies from Ed Miliband, a man once derided as Marxist. The Tory leadership seems to think it does not require new ideas. It is content to make do with old ones. Mrs May needed to bring her party’s thinking in line with an environment it does not like. Replacing the leader will only work if the party understands that it needs to change too."
"A team of scientists is planning an expedition to examine the marine ecosystem revealed when an enormous iceberg broke off the Larsen C ice shelf earlier this year. In July, the iceberg known as A68 broke off the shelf, leaving the area at its lowest recorded extent. Researchers are now hoping the event may lead to novel revelations from their investigations of the area opened up, which had been hidden under ice for up to 120,000 years.   Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) will embark on the research ship RRS James Clark Ross in February 2018 to take the first look at the newly exposed ecosystems under the ice – if the conditions work in their favour. “You can never predict the ice,” said mission leader Dr Katrin Linse. “There are still several hundred kilometres covered in sea ice which has to move and melt. Fortunately this often happens now during the Antarctic summer, so that is why we are hopeful for February.”  If everything works out, the scientists will have the chance to look at 5,800 sq km of sea floor that had been shielded for tens of thousands of years. Planning for such expeditions normally takes several years, but urgent funding schemes are available during such unpredictable natural events, like the volcanic activity over Iceland in 2010. It is not the first time that scientists have been given the chance to take a look at these hidden marine worlds. After a similar iceberg broke off from the Larsen B shelf in 2002, a team of scientists set out to Antarctica, although it took much longer to get there.  Prof Dr Julian Gutt, a marine ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, was the first to lead a vessel to the area. He said: “We went to the area five years after it broke off. We had to try and learn what lived under the ice shelf when it still existed, so were never absolutely sure if our interpretation was correct.” This presents a unique opportunity for the BAS team: “The Larsen C break-off is recent, so if the British scientists are successful – under the difficult conditions they are facing – they could really encounter a pristine situation,” says Gutt. The BAS team expect to find organisms resembling those in deep-sea environments because of the areas’ similar conditions: a lack of nutrients, sunlight and wind.  A short timespan between the breakoff and research is crucial, says Linse.  “What Julian Gutt’s team found there five years after were already pioneer species, which slowly colonise the area. When we go this February, organisms will not have had enough time to settle down and adapt to their new environment,” she said.  The final decision on whether the project goes ahead will be made at the end of the year."
"The International Monetary Fund has been on quite a journey from the days when it was seen as the provisional wing of the Washington consensus. These days the IMF is less likely to harp on about the joys of liberalised capital flows than it is to warn of the dangers of ever-greater inequality. The fund’s latest foray into the realms of progressive economics came last week when it used its half-yearly fiscal monitor – normally a dry-as-dust publication – to make the case for higher taxes on the super-rich.  Make no mistake, this is a significant moment. For almost 40 years, since the arrival of Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street and Ronald Reagan in the White House, the economic orthodoxy on taxation has been that higher taxes for the 1% are self-defeating. Soaking the rich, it was said, would punish initiative and lead to lower levels of innovation, investment, growth and, therefore, reduced revenue for the state. As the Conservative party conference showed, this line of argument is still popular. Minister after minister took to the stage to warn that Jeremy Corbyn’s tax plans would lead to a 1970s-style brain drain. The IMF agrees that a return to the income tax levels seen in Britain during the 1970s would have an impact on growth. But that was when the top rate was 83%, and Corbyn’s plans are far more modest. Indeed, it is a sign of how difficult it has become to have a grown-up debate about tax that Labour’s call for a 50% tax band on those earning more than £123,000 and 45% for those earning more than £80,000 should be seen as confiscatory. The IMF’s analysis does something to redress the balance, making two important points. First, it says that tax systems should have become more progressive in recent years in order to help offset growing inequality, but have actually become less so. Second, it finds no evidence for the argument that attempts to make the rich pay more tax would lead to lower growth. There is nothing especially surprising about either of the IMF’s conclusions: in fact, the real surprise is that it has taken so long for the penny to drop. Growth rates have not picked up as taxes have been cut for the top 1%. On the contrary, they are much weaker than they were in the immediate postwar decades, when the rich could expect to pay at least half their incomes – and often substantially more than half – to the taxman. If trickle-down theory worked, there would be a strong correlation between growth and countries with low marginal tax rates for the rich. There is no such correlation and, as the IMF rightly concludes, “there would appear to be scope for increasing the progressivity of income taxation without significantly hurting growth for countries wishing to enhance income redistribution”. With a nod to the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty, the fiscal monitor also says that countries should consider wealth taxes for the rich, to be levied on land and property. The IMF’s findings on tax provide ample and welcome political cover for Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, as they seek to convince voters that Labour’s tax plans are not just equitable but also economically workable. By contrast, the study challenges President Donald Trump to rethink tax plans that would give an average tax cut of more than $200,000 a year for someone earning more than $900,000. The response from the US administration was predictable: mind your own business. The IMF is not naive. It knows it is one thing to make the case for higher taxes on the rich but another altogether to get governments to implement them, because better-off individuals have more political clout. The argument that what is good for the super-rich is good for the rest of us has been demolished, but don’t expect the top 1% to give up without a fight. Looking at Theresa May’s energy price cap for the answer to reining in your electricity and gas bills? Then you were watching the wrong government announcement last week. The solution to making energy affordable lies not in the draft legislation for the cap, which is a short-term stopgap that will do nothing to make prices fairer in the long term, but in a climate change masterplan launched by ministers at the Olympic Park in London. While the clean growth strategy is short on detail for a 164-page tome, it should be praised for putting energy efficiency front and centre. The plan’s bright idea is an aspiration to bring all homes in England and Wales up to a minimum of energy band C, by fitting new boilers, insulation and more efficient appliances. The potential savings on bills are enormous. Someone in an E-rated home would save £650 a year if it was overhauled to a C-rating. What’s missing are the sort of bold measures to make the aspiration a reality. There are good reasons that people don’t both with insulation. “For some, energy efficiency measures’ upfront costs and hassle can be high. The payback period from lower energy bills can be longer than the time people expect to stay in their home,” the National Infrastructure Commission said this week. As the commission pointed out, the market hasn’t delivered: so government intervention is needed. Ministers’ last attempt to kickstart improvements was a disaster, and the number of homes being made more efficient has plunged as a result. More radical policies are required to convince householders that energy efficiency is worthwhile – and fortunately there is no shortage of ideas. Lower stamp duty for energy-efficient homes, discounts on council tax and allowing people to take out bigger mortgages on greener homes (an idea that government is exploring) have all been mooted. Such steps are a big ask because they would require the Treasury’s buy-in. But the imperative for upgrading Britain’s leaky, draughty housing stock has never been greater. The clean growth strategy admitted that the best way to cut the carbon emissions from heating our homes is not yet clear. That means the mundane but vital job of stopping our radiators’ warmth leaking out through our walls and lofts is more important than ever – not just for our wallets, but for the planet too. Classic descriptions of financial bubbles usually describe the final pre-pop stage as the moment when the general public is attracted by the whiff of easy money. In the 21st century, we should not be surprised that social media and celebrity are also part of the story. That is the context in which to view a tweet by football manager Harry Redknapp, which grabbed attention last week. “Proper excited about Mobile Cryptocurrency! I’m in, get involved!” he declared Redknapp might have read the cryptocurrency warning from the Financial Conduct Authority that any investor backing an initial coin offering should be ready to lose the whole investment. But it seems equally possible that the 750% surge in the past year in the value in bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has provoked a mania that feeds off itself. Electroneum, the venture that excites Redknapp, reported that four Premier League footballers had got in touch within hours of Harry’s tweet. Oh dear."

"The US is set for a fresh battle over climate change after the Trump administration moved to tear up the country’s primary policy to lower emissions and stave off dangerous global warming.  On Tuesday, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), signed an order to scrap the Clean Power Plan, a Barack Obama-era initiative to curb pollution from US power plants.  “The war against coal is over,” Pruitt declared. “We are committed to righting the wrongs of the Obama administration by cleaning the regulatory slate.” The move has provoked a furious reaction from states, businesses and environmental groups that warn that the world’s second-largest carbon polluter is risking its population’s health and the future livability of parts of the planet.  New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said he would sue the Trump administration to prevent its “irresponsible and illegal efforts to turn the clock back on public health”. More than a dozen other states are likely to follow, backed by green groups. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, said he would do “everything in my power to defend the Clean Power Plan”. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said the organization would fight Trump and Pruitt “in the courts, in the streets, and at the state and local level across America to protect the health of every community”. Several large companies have stated their support for the Clean Power Plan. In a joint statement, Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft said: “Climate change is one of our most significant global challenges and strong action is critical to meeting the serious threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions.  “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth.” A spokeswoman for food manufacturer Mars said: “Mars has been outspoken about the need for business and government to step up and address critical global challenges, like climate change. We are disappointed by the decision.” The absence of any major national climate policy has placed greater onus on states, cities and businesses, such as those that formed the We Are Still In coalition after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, tweeted: “The EPA can repeal the Clean Power Plan but not the laws of economics. This won’t revive coal or stop the US from reaching our Paris goal.” Courtroom battles may take several years to unspool, meaning the Trump administration may not be able to scrap the climate plan and craft some sort of watered-down replacement before 2020. The repeal proposal states the Clean Power Plan “exceeds the EPA’s statutory authority”, adding that the agency has not determined whether it will replace the plan with anything. Instead, it has opened a comment period for the public. Pruitt said the EPA will “assess whether further regulatory action is warranted”. Some conservative groups want the EPA to provide no replacement and reverse its 2009 “endangerment finding” that climate change poses a risk to human health. It is more likely the regulator will simply put forward an industry friendly alternative that requires coal-fired plants to improve some internal practices rather than switch to cleaner sources such as solar and wind.  “What is especially laudable about the Trump EPA analysis is that Scott Pruitt and his team are intent on restoring legality to the regulatory process,” said Myron Ebell, who headed the EPA transition team for Trump and directs environment policy at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute. “CEI has petitioned EPA to reopen and rescind the endangerment finding, so we would obviously prefer no rule. However, if the endangerment finding is not rescinded, then a legal inside-the-fenceline rule would be acceptable.” The Clean Power Plan was unveiled by Obama in 2015 but was immediately challenged by industry groups and 27 states, including Oklahoma when Pruitt was attorney general of the state. Last year, the supreme court froze the plan pending legal challenges.  “Legally the Trump administration is on very firm ground, but if they don’t issue a replacement rule they will face lawsuits,” said Jeff Holmstead, a senior EPA official under George W Bush and part of the legal team that attempted to halt the Clean Power Plan. “I think the business community doesn’t want this heavy-handed sort of regulation but they do want a replacement plan. They do want some sort of regulatory certainty.” The Obama administration set the Clean Power Plan a goal of reducing emissions from the energy sector 32% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Electricity generation accounts for nearly a third of US emissions. The country is more than halfway to that target, largely due to a shift from coal to cheap and abundant natural gas which has lower carbon output. Even with the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, emissions from energy generation may still come close to the original target. But the US will probably fall short of its international pledge to help avoid highly dangerous levels of global warming. The EPA previously estimated that the Clean Power Plan would prevent about 90,000 child asthma attacks and 3,600 premature deaths a year by 2030. These gains would largely be made in disadvantaged communities and among people of color who disproportionately live next to sources of toxic pollution. “Unfortunately our most vulnerable communities will face the brunt of this irresponsible decision, including disproportionate health impacts, while rich corporations that have control over the EPA will reap the profits,” said Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former senior official at the EPA’s office of environmental justice. Pruitt – who is currently under investigation over his use of taxpayer-funded flights – has said he would ideally “do away” with tax credits for wind and solar so they can “stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources”. He made no mention of axing subsidies enjoyed for decades by oil, coal and gas producers. This month, researchers at Oil Change International estimated that the US provides around $20bn a year in subsidies to fossil fuels, through incentives, credits, low royalty rates and other measures. With the US pulling away from the effort to address climate change, other governments face a stiff challenge. Scientists have linked warming temperatures to increasingly ferocious hurricanes and wildfires. In recent months, parts of Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico have been battered by hurricanes. California’s Napa valley region is experiencing some of the worst fires in the state’s history."

"Tax breaks and free access to bus lanes should be used to help reverse Australia’s poor uptake of electric vehicles, a new report has said.  Australians remain deeply reluctant to buy electric cars, which accounted for just 0.1% of new car sales in 2015. Australia is increasingly falling behind other countries, particularly in Europe, where sales of electric cars represented 1.2% of new European Union car sales in the same year.  In Norway, electric vehicles made up 22.8% of new car sales, thanks largely to a suite of financial and policy incentives. Electric cars are allowed to use Norwegian bus and taxi lanes, pay no parking fees and are exempt from road tolls, VAT and registration charges.  Drivers in France are given a rebate for low-emitting cars and charged an extra fee for high-polluting vehicles. France’s scheme reduced average carbon emissions for a new car from 149 grams per kilometre in 2007, a year before the policy was introduced, to 114g in 2014. In the same year the average for a new car in Australia was 188g. The Australia Institute, in a report released on Friday, warned Australia risked becoming a “laggard” on electric cars by international standards. Australia offered “disappointingly few” incentives for buyers of electric cars, the report said, and lacked proper battery charging infrastructure.  Trials of electric vehicles in state government fleets were too small to produce meaningful results, the report said. Victoria used only 54 electric or hybrid cars between 2010 and 2014, in an overall fleet of 4.5m vehicles in the state. “Electric vehicles promise benefits to both consumers and governments,” the report said. “Nonetheless, the market for electric vehicles remains underdeveloped and progress has been slow. “Australia’s electric vehicle market is, by international standards, a laggard. This is in no small part due to a lack of public investment in establishing the conditions necessary for growth.” The Australia Institute said it had conducted its own survey showing majority support for policy incentives to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. The report recommends exempting electric vehicles from the luxury car tax, which applies to more expensive types of electric cars, including the Tesla Model S. It also calls for tax breaks to build a “visible, densely distributed network” of charging stations, to ease consumer concerns about being left stranded with a flat battery. “The development of this network requires careful management,” the report said. “Left unregulated, there is a risk that competing technology standards cannibalise the EV market.” Australia should also allow a Norwegian-style scheme to allow electric cars access to bus lanes, although such a perk should be time-limited to avoid congestion as the uptake of electric vehicles grows, the report said.  The measure would also require number plates that identify cars as electric. It should only apply to all-electric vehicles, the report said, to reduce congestion in bus lanes.  The report also recommended adopting a carbon pricing scheme, similar to that operating in France, which made cleaner cars cheaper to buy. "
"The UK government could potentially consider providing subsidies for electric bicycles and electric cars as part of a concerted policy effort to get more people cycling, the roads minister, Jesse Norman, has said. With the UK facing health crises from pollution and inactive living, other plans could include using electric cargo bikes to deliver packages from internet retailers rather than vans, Norman told the Guardian.  Saying his ambition was to “make the transition to a world where a 12-year-old can cycle safely”, Norman said he could not promise extra funding for cycle routes, but said central government could start pushing councils to take more action. A review into cycling safety announced last month would be broad, possibly including whether cyclists should be forced to wear helmets and high-visibility clothing, Norman said. But he promised any conclusions would be led by evidence. People buying electric or hybrid cars can receive up to £4,500 off the purchase price through a government subsidy scheme. However, there is no equivalent policy for e-bikes, where a small electric motor provides a boost when the rider pedals. These are increasingly popular with novice or older cyclists or those facing a hilly or lengthy commute, but can often cost £1,500 or more. Norman said an e-bike subsidy could happen: “We’ve done some work on that already, and I haven’t looked at the outcomes yet, and they might not be ready yet. There’s a case in principle.” He said there was “tremendous opportunity” for more packages to be delivered by electric-assist cargo bikes: “If you think about what in terms of local deliveries, a lot of these Amazon deliveries are lighter things – you don’t need a Transit van to be doing that. “I think e-bikes and ebikes-plus are a really interesting potential way of handling that last mile or two of deliveries.” Norman, who was appointed in June, faced accusations of anti-cyclist bias last month over his response to the case of Charlie Alliston, who was jailed for killing a pedestrian, Kim Briggs, after hitting her on a bike without a front brake. After the trial Norman said he would examine a possible new offence of causing death by dangerous cycling, and announced the review of cycle safety. He also wrote a letter to cycling organisations warning them riders should abide by the Highway Code. Norman said critics had “missed a wider point” that the safety review would also cover the danger posed to cyclists by drivers, including those “using cars in ways that are intentional and punitive”. Asked if he had experienced dangerous driving while cycling, he replied: “I bike every day, so absolutely.” On possible laws for helmets and high-visibility clothing, Norman said the review would “ask very general questions and if the feedback is that we should consider that stuff, then we’ll look at it”. He added: “Obviously there will be some people who feel very strongly that there should be hi-vis, and there will be plenty of people who think very strongly the other way. It’ll be the same with helmets. The literature on risk is quite a well developed one, I don’t need to tell you.” About 1-2% of trips in the UK are made by bike, considerably fewer than in many other other European countries.  A report by MPs in 2013 called for a share of 10% by 2025, to be achieved by spending £20 per person annually on cycling provision, notably safe bike lanes. Norman said the current spend had risen from £2 a head in 2010 to £6 after the launch in April of a new cycling and walking strategy, but he did not know if this would increase further: “Six weeks before the Budget it would be a brave minister indeed who made any pronouncements.” He raised the idea of a more proactive approach from Westminster over cycling, saying he was “not ruling out” the idea of ministers pushing local councils to do better on the issue, or mandating national standards for bike lanes. With the advent of driverless vehicles and other moves away from traditional cars, governments needed to think about how road transport was being transformed, Norman said, saying cycling would be key to this. He said: “It’s not just, if I may say so, the actions of a government which is supportive of cycling, it’s also the actions of a government that understands that the whole nature of the way in which we use the roads, and the way we think about cities, is going to change dramatically over the next decade or two, and possibly earlier. We need to be fully abreast of that.” "

"The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has slapped down Tony Abbott and other conservative rebels, declaring that climate change is real and that was why Abbott agreed to join the Paris international climate agreement when he was prime minister. Asked about Abbott’s provocative speech to a group of climate-change sceptics in London questioning the science of climate change – an outing that has been characterised by Labor as “loopy” – Frydenberg brought up Abbott’s own record in the top job.  “Climate change is real,” the energy minister told reporters. “We take our advice from the scientific experts. We believe we need to reduce our emissions. That is why Tony Abbott signed up to the Paris agreement.” With the government backing off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, which was opposed vociferously by Abbott and other government conservatives, voices are now marshalling against Australia’s participation in the Paris agreement. Conservative Eric Abetz on Wednesday backed Abbott’s speech in London questioning climate change and declared Australian pensioners need to be put before “some Paris aspirational climate deal”. Declaring himself an “agnostic” about the science of climate change, the Tasmanian Liberal senator said Abbott had made some “very valid points” in the speech to a group of climate-change sceptics. While noting the Paris climate agreement “was at all times aspirational and unenforceable”, Abetz queried why Australia had signed up. “Why we are supporting Paris in circumstances where the total Australian emissions are being, er, er, emitted in China and India by increasing their emissions each year?” Abetz told Sky News. “One really has to ask what is the benefit of exporting our coal to China and India so they can burn it and we can somehow claim environmental purity when it is costing us jobs and costing us wealth with no environmental dividend.” Frydenberg flatly dismissed those arguments.  “I point out that, at the time, Tony Abbott said that the agreement Australia struck at Paris was a definite commitment and that it was economically responsible and environmentally responsible. They were Tony Abbott’s words,” the energy minister said. “Now the Turnbull government is continuing the work of Coalition governments to reduce carbon emissions, but to do so in a way that doesn’t compromise the affordability and the reliability of our system.” Frydenberg said Australia’s commitment to the Paris treaty was rock solid.  “We have firm commitments we agreed to at Paris,” he said. “The government will meet and Australia will meet those commitments, just as we beat our first Kyoto target, just as we’re on track to beat our 2020 target. “We are doing it through a whole range of different mechanisms across the economy. We take climate change very seriously. We take our emissions reductions targets very seriously. That’s what the government has acted.” Industry is deeply alarmed that the government has backed off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, because a number of groups saw that policy as a valid pathway to achieve bipartisan agreement on climate and energy policy. Industry groups are concerned the government’s energy policy is off the rails. The Business Council of Australia is demanding a seat at the table if the government intends to propose an alternative mechanism to the clean energy target to drive the transformation to low-emissions technology. The government could unveil its energy policy as soon as next week, when parliament resumes for the final spring session. Abetz on Wednesday declared Australia was exporting jobs and wealth in the “manic determination to go down the renewable energy path”. He said the government’s new energy policy needed to encourage the construction of new high-efficiency low-emissions coal power plants and, “further forward”, nuclear energy, to provide reliable base-load energy. The senator said low-cost energy had made Australia a first-world economy and Australia needed to retain that comparative advantage. Abetz also backed Abbott’s contention that when the world’s climate has been warmer, people fared better. He said the simple reality “in general terms” was when the world’s climate had been a little bit warmer, humanity had done better. Abetz said he would prefer neither a heatwave nor a cold snap, but he said people died more often in cold snaps than during heatwaves."
"While politics never sleeps, and the verbiage from Canberra never stops, there has been a strange sense of suspended animation about the last couple of weeks, apart from a mild frenzy on Friday, as rumours circulated of early elections, cancelled parliamentary sittings, and general plague and pestilence. The reason for Friday’s startle reflex is, of course, the return of the federal parliament for the blockbuster spring session next week.  The reasons for the period of suspended animation before the startle reflex are also obvious. All the controversial issues the government has been spinning its wheels on for months, or warily circling, will hit between now and Christmas. The high court will determine the fate of the various dual citizens, and then, the public, potentially at least, depending on the decision, will determine the fate of the Turnbull government’s one-seat majority in the lower house. The public will also chart a course on same-sex marriage. Assuming a yes vote, given that seems to be the general direction of the public opinion polls, the Liberal party will then have to indulge one more round of handwringing about religious freedom before the parliament has its say. Then there’s energy, which will finally land next week. It really is hard to overstate the contortions that have accompanied this debate, which started in its current iteration with the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, floating and then killing an emissions trading scheme for electricity in the space of 24 hours, then rolling through to the creation of the Finkel review of the electricity market, then through the process of trying to land a clean energy target, which now seems to have been abandoned, at least in the form the chief scientist suggested it. Actually it started with wicked wind farms in South Australia, but there really is only so much torture I can inflict on you this weekend, so I’ll spare you that particular recap, which now feels about a century ago. Let’s look forward. On current indications, this is what will happen when the federal parliament resumes next week: the energy policy will go to cabinet, then to the Coalition party room, and if it doesn’t explode on impact in either of those places, pitching us into a whole new rodeo, it will then emerge for scrutiny by the world. Assuming success, that the policy clears the various internal hurdles, the government will then fire up its good news machine, and bombard us all with its general magnificence, but obviously we need to ignore all that, and keep a laser-like focus on the central issues. Next week, when we all get to making judgments about whether or not the government’s energy policy is reasonable (assuming the default unreasonableness that exists in the Coalition any time climate change is mentioned doesn’t consume it before take-off) – we need to look closely at the fundamentals. Australia’s energy sector is operating in an environment where there is no future investment certainty because there is continuing carbon risk. If carbon risk is a new concept for you, it just means the risk of a future government suddenly implementing serious policies aimed at reducing emissions to try to head off the worst climate-change scenario. That ongoing policy uncertainty has a price impact. Unless the new government investment framework explicitly addresses carbon risk, the price pressure in the system – the one we all feel through our nasty, nasty, power bills – will continue to be a problem. One way to deal with carbon risk would be to adopt the clean energy target proposed by the chief scientist Alan Finkel. A clean energy target is certainly not the only way to address carbon risk. In fact, many people (me included) would say there are much better ways of addressing carbon risk than a clean energy target. Unfortunately the Coalition has ruled most of the sensible alternative options out. The government may well come at the carbon problem, at the task of lowering emissions, by setting a reduction trajectory, giving more money to the existing Emissions Reduction Fund and adjusting the existing safeguard mechanism (two features of the existing Direct Action climate policy), and allowing the use of international permits. But if that’s the broad approach, depending how it’s structured, it could well be tokenistic. If the policy response is tokenistic – tokenistic enough, say, to subdue Tony Abbott, and the conservatives he speaks for in this wretched debate – it will not actually reduce carbon risk, which is what drives investment uncertainty, and pushes up energy prices. The government will have fixed a problem, but fixed it in the style of Christopher Pyne’s now infamous “fixing”, as in no fix at all – as in a fix that makes people in the real world, outside the strange retro hothouse of the Coalition party room, actually laugh out loud, out of nervous despair, rather than hilarity. To cut a long story short, the government will have produced a policy that clears the party room, but fails in the court of public opinion. Quite a risk that, given its electoral buffer, as we’ve noted, is a distance short of huge. There is one other reason to want Finkel’s clean energy target, and it’s this. The advantage of a clean energy target as a mechanism (as opposed to other means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions that may well be included in the government policy) is it had a prospect of securing a bipartisan consensus. The lack of bipartisan consensus is a big problem in climate and energy policy, not just a minor inconvenience. To understand this, you just have to stick with carbon risk, and push your mind through the various steps that would follow the government producing a policy that Labor can’t support. I know people inside the Coalition who equate public life with bar brawling see opportunity in having another zero sum bout with Labor – but standing on the fringes of the big stupid-off are a bunch of serious corporate interests who have to make decisions very quickly about new energy infrastructure, and a bunch of businesses that might well go to the wall if power prices keep rising. If Labor rejects the Coalition’s energy fix, then we have another brutally contested election, followed by a new government. Let’s stick with the current poll trend and speculate that the new government might be a Labor government. (You saw the might in that sentence, right?) Let’s say then that prime minister Shorten tries to navigate a climate and energy policy through a parliament where the Coalition is led by Peter Dutton, or let’s just pull a name out of a hat, Tony Abbott. In those circumstances, an outbreak of carbon peace seems unlikely, unless the Coalition has just suffered a major electoral bout, which results in someone in team centre-right twigging to the fact that governing for the nervous sensibilities of Andrew Bolt doesn’t really win you elections. But pushing on with our basic thought exercise, let’s assume in the next parliament that the Coalition again refuses to implement a climate policy that actually does anything. Then we are back with a Labor government, trying to get a policy through the parliament, with the Greens driving a hard bargain, which sounds a lot like Groundhog Day, and a Groundhog Day that doesn’t settle anything for the energy sector, because they just need to get off this damn roundabout. They need a policy that won’t be ripped up at the next election. They need this stupidity to stop. So does the country. In fact, we needed that at least a decade ago. So the question Malcolm Turnbull faces next week is much bigger than the bobble head preoccupations: who won or lost, who had the best line, who had the best tactics. Our prime minister needs to look the country in the eye and answer this, very simple, question: are you the political leader who can deliver what Australia needs?"
"As efforts to cut planet-warming emissions fall short, large-scale projects to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere will be needed by the 2030s to hold the line against climate change, scientists have said.  Many new technologies that aim to capture and store carbon emissions, thereby delivering “negative emissions”, are costly, controversial and in the early phase of testing.   But “if you’re really concerned about coral reefs, biodiversity [and] food production in very poor regions, we’re going to have to deploy negative emission technology at scale,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, a science and policy institute.  “I don’t think we can have confidence that anything else can do this,” the Berlin-based chief executive told a London climate change conference.  World leaders agreed in 2015 an aim of holding global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times. Scientists believe this is key to protecting small island nations from sea level rises, shoring up food production and preventing extreme weather.  Carbon-sucking technologies may even be needed to hold the planet to a less ambitious two degrees of warming, said scientists at Chatham House, a British thinktank.  The world has already seen an average of about one degree of warming, they said.  “It’s something you don’t want to talk about very much but it’s an unaccountable truth: we will need geoengineering by the mid-2030s to have a chance at the [1.5C] goal,” Hare said, referring to efforts to cool the planet through engineering.  These ideas include planting carbon-absorbing forests across large areas, then harvesting the wood for energy and pumping the emissions produced underground – a process likely to feature in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report next year.  Machines might also be developed to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air and pump it underground or otherwise neutralise it.  But efforts to store captured carbon underground are “showing no progress … and even backwards steps in some cases”, said Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia.  Underground carbon storage has been promoted as part of a push by the United States and other countries to develop “clean coal” technology.  Similarly, planting more forests – a technology known as Beccs, or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage – raises questions about food security and land rights, scientists said.  Le Quéré said Beccs is “probably essential to take us to zero emissions” although “it’s really difficult to imagine we can use land at the levels required in the models”.  She called for experts to focus on proven approaches, such as improving energy efficiency, promoting cleaner transport, eating less meat and scaling up renewable energies.  Many experts fear that launching costly “negative emissions” technologies could reduce the pressure to act swiftly to cut emissions now."
